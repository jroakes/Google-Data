FIG. 1 illustrates an example travelsearch engine system 119 as can be implemented for use in an Internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment. The travelsearch engine system 119 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. The travelsearch engine system 119 includes atravel search engine 118, as described in more detail below with reference toFIG. 2 . The travelsearch engine system 119 producestravel query results 120 from atravel query 116. The systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented in the example travelsearch engine system 119. - A
user 102 can interact with the travelsearch engine system 119 through auser device 105. In some implementations, theuser device 105 can communicate with the travelsearch engine system 119 over a network. For example, theuser device 105 can be a computer coupled to the travelsearch engine system 119 through one or more wired or wireless networks, e.g., mobile phone networks, local area networks (LANs) or wide area networks (WANs), e.g., the Internet. In some implementations, theuser device 105 can communicate directly with the travelsearch engine system 119. For example, the travelsearch engine system 119 and theuser device 105 can be implemented on one machine. For example, a user can install the travelsearch engine system 119 on theuser device 105. Theuser device 105 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 106, aprocessor 108, and one or more user interface devices 110, e.g., a display or a speaker for output, and a keyboard, mouse, microphone, or touch sensitive display for input. - A
user 102 can use theuser device 105 to submit atravel query 116 to the travelsearch engine system 119. For example, the user can use the one or more user interface devices 110 of theuser device 105 to enter thetravel query 116 in a user interface provided by travelsearch engine system 119, e.g., in a single query text input field of a web page. Thetravel query 116 can be text or audio and can be in natural language form. Thetravel query 116 can be associated with query metadata. The query metadata can be data associated with or provided by theuser device 105 and can be, for example, location, IP address, date, time, and user preferences. Theuser device 105 can provide such metadata in an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request that also includes thetravel query 116, for example. The scope of thetravel query 116 can be defined by a number of terms or parameters, including: an origin location, a travel location, a timeframe, an activity, flight preferences, hotel preferences, and pricing preferences. These are described in greater detail below, with reference toFIGS. 7-10 . The terms or parameters can be explicitly included by the user in thetravel query 116 or can be inferred by either theuser device 105 or thesearch engine system 119 based at least in part on the query metadata or other relevant data. - The
travel search engine 118 responds to the receivedtravel query 116 by obtaining travel query results 120 that are responsive to thetravel query 116. A travel query result represents a travel option, e.g., a destination or point of interest. The travel query results 120 are transmitted through a network to theuser device 105 and presented in an organized fashion to theuser 102, e.g., on a travel search engine results web page displayed in a web browser running on theuser device 105. Other search results generated by the search engine can be optionally presented with the travel query results 120. Each travel query result 120 can include a description of the represented travel option and a hyperlink to a site or sites that allow the user to book the different components of the travel option. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an exampletravel search engine 118. As shown inFIG. 2 ,travel search engine 118 includes ahotel module 210, aflight module 212, and a destination point ofinterest module 215. Thetravel search engine 118 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. - The
travel search engine 118 is configured to receive thetravel query 116 and return travel query results 120. Thetravel search engine 118 can employ any of its modules to produce the travel query results 120 based at least in part on thetravel query 116. Thetravel search engine 118 submits a request to any of its modules. The request can include thetravel query 116 and query metadata, or portions thereof. Thetravel search engine 118 receives a response from any of its modules and can use the contents of the response to produce travel query results 120. The response can include one or more travel query results and or other data that can be used to produce travel query results, e.g., digital photographs, descriptions, flight data, or hotel data. Responses and requests are issued and received, for example, by using function calls, messages, or shared data. - In some implementations, some or all of the
hotel module 210, theflight module 212, and the destination point ofinterest module 215 can be implemented as part oftravel search engine 118 or travelsearch engine system 119. For example, they can be implemented on the same computer or computers as thetravel search engine 118 and or share a network with thetravel search engine 118. In some implementations, some or all of thehotel module 210, theflight module 212, and the destination point ofinterest module 215 can be implemented separately from thetravel search engine 118 or travelsearch engine system 119. For example, they can be implemented on different computers than thetravel search engine 118 and communicate with thetravel search engine 118 and or each other over a network, e.g., the Internet. - The
hotel module 210, theflight module 212, and the destination point ofinterest module 215 can each include or be in communication with a corresponding data store residing locally or remotely. In some implementations, these include a hotel data store for thehotel module 210, a flight data store for theflight module 212, and, for the destination point ofinterest module 215, aphotograph data store 310 and a geographic data store 312 (FIG. 3 ). In some implementations, one or more of the data stores can be implemented as a file, database, multiple files, or multiple databases on a distributed data storage infrastructure, e.g., infrastructures of the kind described in Corbett et al., Spanner: Google's globally-distributed database, Proceedings of the 10th USENIX conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (2012), or infrastructures of the kind described in Chang et al., Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data, in Transactions on Computer Systems (June 2008), or on some other storage infrastructure, implemented on computer readable and writable memory devices. -
Hotel module 210 receives requests from thetravel search engine 118 and issues responses to thetravel search engine 118. Thehotel module 210 can also receive requests from and issue responses to any of the other modules intravel search engine 118. A request can include a travel location and a timeframe. These are described in greater detail below, with reference toFIGS. 8-10 . Here, thehotel module 210 can query the hotel data store for hotels that are available during the timeframe and are related to the travel location. Thehotel module 210 determines that a hotel is related to a travel location using one or more metrics, including whether the hotel's geographic location is within a threshold distance from the travel location. Additionally, a request can also include additional criteria, e.g., a price preference, a user feedback rating preference, or a hotel star preference. Here, thehotel module 210 can query the hotel data store for hotels that match the additional criteria. Thehotel module 210 can issue a response to thetravel search engine 118 or any of the modules in thetravel search engine 118. The response can include information about one of more hotels, which may include, e.g., titles, images, prices, availability, star ratings, user feedback ratings, locations, or descriptions. -
Flight module 212 receives requests from thetravel search engine 118 and issues responses to thetravel search engine 118. Theflight module 212 can also receive requests from and issue responses to any of the other modules in thetravel search engine 118. A request can include a travel location, an origin location, or a timeframe. These are described in greater detail below, with reference toFIGS. 8-10 . Here, theflight module 212 can query the flight data store for flights available during the timeframe that are related to the travel location and the origin location. Theflight module 212 can determine that a flight is related to a travel location and the origin location using one or more metrics, including whether the geographic location of one of the airports associated with the flight is within a threshold distance from the travel location or the origin location. Additionally a request can also include additional criteria, e.g., a price preference, a cabin preference, e.g., first-class, a user feedback rating preference, a number of stops preference, an airline preference, a plane type preference, or a time length preference. Theflight module 212 can query the flight data store for flights that match the additional criteria. Theflight module 212, can issue a response to thetravel engine 118 or any of the modules in thetravel search engine 118. The response can include information about of one or more flights, e.g., descriptions, airlines, flight numbers, flight times, flight durations, stops, price, user feedback ratings, locations, or availability. - Destination point of
interest module 215 receives requests fromtravel search engine 118 and issues responses to travelsearch engine 118. The destination point ofinterest module 215 can also receive requests from any of the other modules in thetravel search engine 118. The destination point ofinterest module 215 can issue responses to thetravel search engine 118 or any of the other modules in thetravel search engine 118. The destination point ofinterest module 215 is described in greater detail below, with reference toFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example destination point ofinterest module 215. As illustrated inFIG. 3 , the destination point ofinterest module 215 receives a destination point of interest request 315 and issues a destination point ofinterest response 316. The destination point ofinterest module 215 includes aphotograph data store 310 and ageographic data store 312. The destination point ofinterest module 215 receives a destination point of interest request 315, for example fromtravel search engine 118 or any of its modules. The request 315 can include one or more terms, including a travel location, a timeframe, or an activity. The destination point ofinterest module 215 can query thegeographic data store 312 for destinations or points of interest associated with the travel location and optionally the activity. The destination point ofinterest module 215 can also query thephotograph data store 310 for digital photographs associated with the travel location, a destination, a point of interest, the timeframe, or the activity. The destination point of interest module can take the results of the query to thegeographic data store 312 and or the query to thephotograph data store 310 and produce destination point ofinterest response 316. - The
photograph data store 310 stores digital photographs or references to digital photographs, e.g., links, identifiers, or memory references. Thephotograph data store 310 can store the digital photographs or references to the digital photographs on one or more non-volatile mediums, including magnetic hard drives, solid-state drives, memory, optical disks, or tapes. - In some implementations, the
photograph data store 310 stores photograph metadata associated with the digital photographs or the references to the digital photographs. The photograph metadata can be formatted in or derived from one or more standards including Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), and Design rule for Camera File (DCF). In some implementations, some or all of the photograph metadata is stored separately from the digital photographs or the references to the digital photographs. The photograph metadata can include geographic or geo-tag metadata, e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) or Assisted GPS (A-GPS) coordinates. Additionally, the photograph metadata can include camera metadata, e.g., the camera model or camera settings including, e.g., aperture, shutter speed, focal length, ISO speed, or resolution. Additionally, the photograph metadata can include temporal metadata, e.g., a creation timestamp that reflects when a photograph was taken or captured. Additionally, the photograph metadata can include topical metadata, e.g., a title or tags. - In some implementations, the photograph metadata includes document metadata for documents that include or reference a photograph. The document metadata can include the title of the photograph in the document, text from the document, the title of the document, or a URL for the document. The document metadata is drawn from one or more types of documents, including HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents, word processing documents, imaged documents, or presentation documents. The documents can be obtained from multiple sources including the Internet, social networking websites, and photo sharing websites in accordance with user privacy policies and expectations and copyright law. In some implementations, the documents are identified using an Internet image search.
- In some implementations, the photograph metadata can include photographer metadata, for example, references, e.g., links, identifiers, or memory references to other photos taken by the photographer, an identification for the photographer, a user feedback rating of the photographer, and a quality rating for the photographer. The photographer metadata can be obtained or determined from social networking websites and photo sharing websites in accordance with user privacy policies and expectations and copyright law.
- In some implementations, the
photograph data store 310 is associated with one or more indices. The indices are based at least in part on attributes or metadata associated with the digital photographs or references to the digital photographs stored in thephotograph data store 310. For example, the digital photographs or references to the digital photographs in thephotograph data store 310 can be indexed by geographic location based at least in part on their respective geographic or geo-tag metadata or associated destinations or points of interest. Each of the indices can include one or more sub-indices based at least in part on the same or different attributes or metadata. The indices can be stored in thephotograph data store 310 or separately from thephotograph data store 310. - The
geographic data store 312 stores geographic data regarding points of interests or destinations. For each of the points of interest or destinations, thegeographic data store 312 stores a variety of data, e.g., geographic coordinates or locations, names, or categories. Thegeographic data store 312 can store the geographic data on one or more non-volatile mediums, including magnetic hard drives, solid-state drives, memory, optical disks, or tapes. - The geographic data includes data classifying geographic entities, e.g., places or locations, as either destinations or points of interest. Generally, geographic entities that have a large geographic footprint are more likely to be classified as destinations. For example, continents, subcontinents, countries, regions of countries, states, regions of states, counties, neighborhoods, and cities would all be classified as destinations. Conversely, entities that have a small geographic footprint are more likely to be classified as points of interest. For example, points of interest can include hotels, restaurants, amusement parks, landmarks, statues, museums, parks, zoos, bars, nightclubs, and resorts.
- In some implementations, the geographic data represents a logical hierarchy reflective of the relationships between destinations and points of interest. The logical hierarchy can represent that a destination may contain one or more smaller destinations as well as one or more points of interest. The logical hierarchy can be multileveled with points of interest at the bottom or dispersed throughout. For example, a first destination could contain a smaller second destination, which could contain an even smaller third destination, which could contain one or more points of interest. In this example, the points of interest contained by the even smaller third destination are also associated with the second destination and the first destination because the points of interest fall under the second destination and the first destination in the logical hierarchy. The hierarchy can be represented in any convenient conventional way.
- In some implementations, geographic entities are classified based at least in part on initial mapping data. The initial mapping data can be political mapping data, natural mapping data, or a combination of the two, and can come from one or more sources. The initial mapping data can be for the entire earth or some subsection or subsections of the earth. The initial mapping data can be in a Geographic Information System (GIS) format, Geography Markup Language (GML) format, OpenStreetMap (OSM) format, or other mapping data format. The initial mapping data can define polygons or other shapes the represent the geographic footprint for a location or place. The initial mapping data can represent geographic entities that are predefined as continents, subcontinents, countries, regions of countries, states, regions of states, counties, cities, neighborhoods, or some other definition that is associated with a reasonably large geographic footprint. These geographic entities are classified as destinations. Additionally, the initial mapping data can represent geographic entities that are predefined as hotels, restaurants, amusement parks, landmarks, statues, museums, parks, zoos, bars, nightclubs, resorts, or some other definition that is associated with a reasonably small geographic footprint. These geographic entities are classified as points of interest.
- In some implementations, the destination point of
interest module 215 andgeographic data store 312 are configured to construct the logical hierarchy based at least in part on a hierarchy supplied by the initial mapping data. In some cases, the initial mapping data may represent a hierarchy. The destination point ofinterest module 215 can extract the hierarchy of the initial mapping data and use it to construct its own hierarchy in thegeographic data store 312. - In some implementations, the system constructs the logical hierarchy based at least in part on geographic footprints or locations. Here, geographic footprints for geographic entities classified as destinations are obtained and compared to identify destinations whose entire geographic footprint or substantially entire geographic footprint is contained within the geographic footprint of another destination. The logical hierarchy is then structured to indicate that each destination contains or substantially contains the destination below it in the hierarchy based at least in part on their respective geographic footprints. Geographic entities classified as points of interest are added to the logical hierarchy based at least in part on their geographic locations or footprints. For example, the system can assign one or more points of interest to a destination where the points of interest have geographic locations or footprints that are entirely or substantially contained by the geographic footprint of the destination. Optionally, a point of interest could be pushed down the logical hierarchy such that it is assigned to the lowest destination on the logical hierarchy that contains the point of interest.
- In some implementations, the
geographic data store 312 is configured to allow for searching by travel location. Here thegeographic data store 312 can include geographic coordinates or other geographic positioning data for the geographic entities classified as destinations or points of interests. As described in greater detail with respect toFIGS. 6 and 8 , the geographic coordinates or other geographic positioning data or the logical hierarchy can be used to map a travel location that is the subject of the search to one or more destinations or points of interest. -
FIG. 4 illustrates anexample method 400 for classifying natural features as either points of interest or destinations. As shown inFIG. 4 , natural features are classified as either destinations or points of interest and the result is stored in thegeographic data store 312, as described below. - The system receives natural feature mapping data (402). The natural feature mapping data is received in one or more ways including, as an argument in a function call, a query result from a data store, as a memory reference, or as a data transmission. The natural feature mapping data can be received in one or more formats, including GIS, GML, and OSM and include data representing one or more natural features. Natural features can be classified in the natural feature mapping data in categories including mountains, mountain ranges, lakes, seas, oceans, rivers, bays, islands, creeks, streams, valleys, forests, and deserts. Additionally, the system can receive natural feature mapping data that includes data representing geographic footprints for the natural features. The system extracts the data representing the natural features and the data representing the geographic footprints to identify multiple natural features and their geographic footprints.
- The system receives political feature mapping data (406). The political feature mapping data is received in one or more ways including, as an argument in a function call, a query result from a data store, as a memory reference, or as a data transmission. The political feature mapping data can be received in one or more formats, including GIS, GML, or OSM and include data representing one or more political features. Political features can be classified in the political feature mapping data in categories including continents, subcontinents, countries, regions of countries, states, regions of states, counties, neighborhoods, or cities. Additionally, the system can receive political feature mapping data that includes data representing geographic footprints for the political features. The system extracts the data representing the political features and the data representing the geographic footprints to identify multiple political features and their geographic footprints.
- The system classifies one or more of the natural features as a destination or a point of interest based at least in part on geographic footprints (410). In some implementations, if the geographic footprint of a particular natural feature overlaps with at least two of the geographic footprints of the political features, the particular natural feature is classified as a destination. In some implementations, the system requires that at least a minimum threshold portion of the geographic footprint of the natural feature intersect with the geographic footprint of the political feature before the two will be considered to overlap. Additionally, the political features considered can be restricted to one or more categories, for example states.
- In some implementations, where the geographic footprint of a natural feature is contained within one of the geographic footprints of the political features, the particular natural feature is classified as a point of interest. In some implementations, the system requires that at least a minimum threshold portion of the geographic footprint of the natural feature intersect with the geographic footprint of the political feature for a natural feature to be contained by a political feature. Additionally, the political features considered can be restricted to one or more categories, for example cities.
- The system stores data representing the natural features as either a destination or a point of interest in the geographic data store 312 (412). The data representing the natural features can include one or more pieces of data related to the natural features, e.g., names, geographic coordinates, shapes, categories, or classifications.
-
FIG. 5 illustrates anexample method 500 for selecting photographs for a destination or point of interest. As shown inFIG. 5 , the system selects one or more photographs for a destination or point of interest based at least in part on a relevancy score, as described below. - The system receives information about a destination or point of interest (502). The system receives information including a name or identification for the destination or point of interest, or a location or geographic coordinates for the destination or point of interest. In some implementations, the system also receives information about a time of the year. The system can receive information including a date, a range of dates, a month, or a season. In some implementations, the system also receives information about an activity, e.g., a name or identification associated with the activity.
- The system identifies multiple photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest (504). In some implementations, the system identifies a photograph as being geographically related to the destination or point of interest by calculating a distance between the location of the destination or the point of interest and the location of the photograph and determining if the distance satisfies a threshold. The threshold can be predefined or variable and can be based at least in part on the category or the size of the destination or point of interest. The system determines the location of the photograph based on the geographic or geo-tag metadata of the photograph obtained from the
photograph data store 310. - In some implementations, the system identifies the photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest using non-geographic metadata, e.g., document metadata and topical metadata. Here, the system queries the
photograph data store 310 for photographs having non-geographic metadata that references names or identifiers associated with the destination or point of interest. For example, a photograph having a title or surrounding text that mentions the Golden Gate Bridge would be identified as being related to the Golden Gate Bridge. In some implementations, the system queries thephotograph data store 310 for photographs having non-geographic metadata that references names or identifiers associated with other destinations or points of interest that are related to the destination or point of interest based at least in part on the logical hierarchy. - In some implementations, the photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest are identified based at least in part on photograph clustering. Here, the system identifies the photographs based at least in part on non-geographic metadata, as described above. The identified photographs are then clustered by the system based at least in part on their respective geographic metadata. In some implementations, a centroid and radius is calculated for each of the clusters. Subsequently, the system identifies additional photographs by comparing the geographic metadata of the additional photographs with the geographic locations of the clusters. For example, by determining that the additional photographs have a geographic location that is within a cluster as defined by its centroid and radius.
- In some implementations, the system identifies multiple photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest and associated with a time of the year. Here, the photographs that are geographically related are identified in any of the ways described above. The photographs that are associated with a time of the year are identified by querying the
photograph data store 310 or its indices for photographs with temporal metadata that corresponds to the time of the year. For example the system can query for photographs that have a creation timestamp that falls within a date range associated with the time of the year, e.g., photographs taken in January of any year. In some implementations, the system modifies the time of the year by adding months or days to the time of the year. - The system determines a relevancy score for each of the identified photographs (506). The relevancy score can be based at least in part on one or more criteria, including selection success data and references in documents. The relevancy score can be numeric or nonnumeric and may comprise more than one score or include sub-scores.
- In some implementations, the relevancy score is determined based at least in part on selection success data of the photograph. The selection success data is obtained from the
photograph data store 310 or another source, e.g., query logs, a social networking data store, or a photograph rating data store. The selection success data can be one or more types, including click through data and explicit user feedback, e.g., photograph ratings, votes, or other indicia of user approval. - In some implementations, a relevancy score of a photograph is determined based at least in part on click through data of the photograph for image search queries that refer to the destination or point of interest. Here, the system determines or obtains how many times a photograph or image was accessed, visited, or clicked on following image queries that include words or phrases relevant to the destination or point of interest, e.g., a name or identifier for the destination or point of interest or names or identifiers for other destinations or points of interest that are related to the destination or point of interest based at least in part on the logical hierarchy. Based at least in part on this, the system determines a relevancy score.
- In some implementations, the relevancy score for a photograph is determined based at least in part on explicit feedback, e.g., photograph ratings, votes, or other indicia of user approval. The explicit feedback can be from social networks or photo sharing services, in accordance with user privacy policies and expectations, terms of service, and copyright law. Here, the explicit feedback is obtained from social networks or photo sharing services, for example by identifying social networking or photo sharing pages related to the destination or point of interest or by querying data stores associated with the social networks or photo sharing services. The photograph ratings, votes, or other indicia of user approval can then be used to determine the relevancy score.
- In some implementations, the relevancy score is based at least in part on references to the destination or point of interest in documents associated with a photograph. Here, the system identifies electronic documents associated with the photograph, e.g., webpages, social networking pages, or photograph sharing pages. The system determines a document to be associated with the photograph based on one or more criteria, e.g., the document includes the photograph, some portion of the photograph, or a link to the photograph. Documents associated with the photograph can be identified in one or more ways, including performing a computer image recognition or computer vision search, or searching for the name or identification of the photograph in the documents or markup language associated with the documents.
- The system determines which of the documents associated with the photograph also reference the destination or point of interest. The system can determine that a document references the destination or point of interest where the document includes terms that are relevant to the destination or point of interest, for example, in the body, the metadata, or the markup language of the document. Relevant terms for the destination or point of interest can be identified, as described above. The system determines the relevancy score based at least in part on the documents that are associated with the photograph and reference the destination or point of interest.
- In some implementations, the relevancy score of the photograph is based at least in part on both selection success data and documents associated with the photograph using the methodologies described above.
- In some implementations, the relevancy score of the photograph is based at least in part on computer vision or computer visual recognition of an object associated with the destination or point of interest. Here, the system identifies an object associated with the destination or point of interest based at least in part on data in the
geographic data store 312 or by querying another data store either internal or external to the system. The system then provides the photograph and the object to a computer vision or computer visual recognition service which returns a response indicating whether the identified object is present in the photograph. The response may include a score e.g., a confidence score that can be used in determining the relevancy score. - In some implementations, the relevancy score of the photograph is determined with regard to an activity. The activity can be identified based at least in part on the received information about the activity. One or more synonyms for the activity can be determined by querying an electronic thesaurus or a synonym data store.
- In some implementations, the activity and or its synonyms are used to determine the relevancy score based at least in part on the selection success data. This process is substantially similar to the process for determining the relevancy score based at least in part on selection success data described above. However, here the activity and or its synonyms are used as the identified relevant terms either solely or in conjunction with the identified relevant terms for the destination or point of interest as described above. The same is true for determining the relevancy score based at least in part on documents associated with the point of interest.
- The system selects one or more selected photographs from the photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest based at least in part on the respective relevancy scores (508). In some implementations, the photograph or photographs with the best score or scores are selected. Depending on how the relevancy score is determined, the best score may be the highest score or the lowest score. In some implementations, photographs are selected if they satisfy a threshold. The threshold can be predetermined or dynamically determined. Depending on how the relevancy scores are determined, the threshold may be satisfied by scores that are greater than or equal to the threshold or scores that are less than or equal to the threshold. In some instances, more than one of the photographs may satisfy the threshold and thus more than one photograph will be selected. In some instances no photographs may satisfy the threshold, in which case no photographs will be selected. In some implementations, the system sets the threshold at a score corresponding to the score of a particular percentile, e.g., the bottom tenth percentile, for the photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest.
- In some implementations, the system selects photographs based at least in part on a visual quality score. The visual quality score can be one or more numeric or nonnumeric scores or measures. The visual quality score is determined based at least in part on one or more criteria e.g., exposure, color or saturation, clarity, photographer, camera, or user feedback. Exposure, color or saturation, and clarity scores or ratings are determined using established algorithms. In some implementations, the photographer rating is obtained, for example from the photographer metadata in
photograph data store 312. In some implementations the photograph rating is calculated based on exposure, color or saturation, or clarity scores or ratings for some or all the photographs by the photographer according to photographer metadata in thephotograph data store 312. The camera rating can be determined based at least in part on camera metadata in thephotograph data store 312 or by calculating aggregated or combined exposure, color or saturation, or clarity scores or ratings for some or all the photographs taken by the camera according to camera metadata in thephotograph data store 312. - The system can combine that visual quality score with the relevancy score and can be used to select one or more photographs. Additionally, the visual quality score can be separate from the relevancy score. Photographs can be selected where their visual quality score satisfies a threshold as described above.
- In some implementations,
example method 500 is performed where the destination is a city. Here, the system receives data indicative of a city and identifies photographs that are geographically related to the city. For each of the photographs, the system determines a relevancy score based at least in part on selection success data of the photograph for image queries referring to the city and references to the city in documents associated with the photograph. The system then selects one or more selected photographs from the photographs based at least in part on a respective visual quality score and the respective relevancy scores. -
FIG. 6 illustrates anexample method 600 for selecting photographs for a destination. As shown inFIG. 6 , the system selects photographs for a destination by selecting photographs for points of interest associated with the destination. - The system receives information about a destination (602) as described above with reference to
FIG. 5 . - The system identifies multiple of points of interest associated with the destination by querying the geographic data store 312 (604). The details of this step are described below with reference to
FIG. 7 . - The photo selection process as described above with reference to
FIG. 5 is performed for each of the identified points of interest associated with the destination (606-610). The result is one or more selected point of interest photographs for at least some of the identified points of interest. - From this result, one or more destination photographs are selected (612). The system selects one or more selected destination photographs based at least in part on the respective relevancy scores and or the respective visual quality scores for the selected point of interest photographs as described above with reference to
FIG. 5 . In some implementations, the selection of the one or more selected destination photographs can be based at least in part on a popularity score for the respective associated points of interest. Determination of the popularity score is described with reference toFIG. 7 . Here, the system can consider the relevancy score and or the visual quality score for a selected point of interest photograph as well as the popularity score for the associated point of interest when selecting the selected point of interest photograph as a selected destination photograph. - In some implementations, the system can require that the popularity score, relevancy score, visual quality score, or a combination of any of the three satisfy a threshold. The threshold can be determined dynamically and can be based at least in part on some or all of the identified or selected point of interest photographs. For example, the system could dynamically set the threshold at a score corresponding to the score of the bottom tenth percentile for the identified point of interest photographs.
- Note that the term point of interest photograph has no special meaning other than to identify that the photograph was selected for a point of interest. Similarly the term destination photograph has no special meaning other than to identify that the photograph was selected for a destination.
- In some implementations,
example method 600 is combined withexample method 500. Here a first set of selected photographs are selected for the destination usingexample method 500 and a second set of selected photographs are selected for the destination usingexample method 600. The system then selects one or more selected destination photographs from the two sets. The selection is based at least in part on one or more criteria, including the respective relevancy scores, visual quality scores, or popularity scores. In some implementations, the system can require that the popularity score, relevancy score, visual quality score, or a combination of any of the three satisfy a threshold. The threshold can be determined dynamically and can be based at least in part on some or all of the identified or selected point of interest or destination photographs. For example, the system could dynamically set the threshold at a score corresponding to the score of the bottom tenth percentile for the identified point of interest photographs and destination photographs. -
FIG. 7 illustrates an example method 700 for selecting a destination or point of interest. As shown inFIG. 7 , one or more destinations or points of interest are selected for a travel location based at least in part on a popularity score, as described below. - The system identifies multiple destinations or points of interest associated with a travel location (702). The travel location can take one or more forms, including, a name or identifier associated with a geographic location or a destination or a point of interest, a single set of geographic coordinates, or multiple sets of geographic coordinates corresponding to a shape.
- In some implementations, the destinations or points of interest associated with the travel location are identified by geographic location based on data mapping travel locations to destinations or points of interest. The travel location or location data derived from the travel location is used to query the
geographic data store 312. The system identifies a destination or point of interest fromgeographic data store 312 by calculating a distance between a location of the destination or the point of interest and the travel location. Where the calculated distance satisfies a threshold, the system identifies the destination or point of interest as being associated with the travel location. The threshold can be satisfied as described above. - In some implementations, the destinations or points of interest associated with the travel location are identified using data mapping travel locations to destinations or points of interest based at least in part on matching or the logical hierarchy. The travel location or location data derived from the travel location is used to query the
geographic data store 312 to identify one or more destinations or points of interest that match the travel location. Matching can be based at least in part on comparing names, identifiers, or geographic coordinates for the travel location with those for the destinations or points of interest. Additionally in some implementations, the system identifies additional destinations or points of interest using the logical hierarchy by selecting destinations or points of interest that are related in the logical hierarchy to the destinations or points of interest that match the travel location. For example, where the travel location is California the matching destination could be California. Using the logical hierarchy, additional destinations could be identified that are within California, e.g., San Francisco, Los Angeles, or San Diego. Additionally, the system can choose to identify only destinations, only points of interests, or a combination of the two. In some implementations, the matching and hierarchical identification approaches disclosed here are combined with the geographic location approach disclosed above. - The system determines a popularity score for each of the destinations or points of interest that are associated with a travel location (710). The system determines the popularity score based at least in part on one or more criteria, including travel related documents that refer to the destination or point of interest, travel related queries that refer to the destination or point of interest, or photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest. The popularity score, as determined by the system, can be numeric or nonnumeric and may comprise more than one score or include sub-scores.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on determining travel related documents that refer to the destination or point of interest (704). The system determines the travel related documents from one or more types of documents, including web pages, social networking pages, photo sharing pages, word processing documents, presentations, or books. The system classifies documents as travel related documents based at least in part on one or more criteria including, usage of travel related terms in the text, title, header, URL, metadata, or markup language of the document, or being from a travel related source based at least in part on a list of travel related sources. The system accesses the travel related documents in one or more ways, including by querying a travel document data store, or obtaining results from a document or Internet search with travel related terms. The system determines that the travel related documents refer to the destination or point of interest, e.g., by identifying a reference to a name or identifier of the destination or point of interest in text, title, header, URL, metadata, or markup language of the travel related document.
- The system then determines a popularity score for a destination or point of interest based at least in part on the travel related documents that refer to the destination or point of interest. The popularity score is determined in one or more ways, including determining a count for the number of travel related documents or the number of references to the destination or point of interest in the travel related documents. Optionally, the count can be weighted based at least in part on the quantity or quality of the references to the destination or point of interest in the respective travel related documents. Optionally, the count can be weighted based at least in part on the source of the travel related documents. Optionally, the system compares the travel related documents and removes duplicates. Optionally, the system analyzes the travel documents and removes those that appear to be spam. Additionally, the count can be modified using one or more mathematical operators to adjust the distribution of counts or to coerce counts into a range.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on determining travel related documents that refer to the destination or point of interest as well as an activity. This approach is similar to the approach for determining a popularity score based at least in part on travel related documents described above, with the addition that the travel related documents also refer to the activity. Here, the travel related documents are determined to refer to the activity based at least in part on, e.g., references to the activity or its synonyms in text, title, header, URL, metadata, or markup language of the travel related document.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on determining travel related queries that refer to the destination or point of interest (706). The system classifies a query as a travel related query based at least in part on one or more criteria including, determining that the query was for or directed to a travel search engine, the query includes one or more travel related terms, or the query includes terms associated with a geographic location that is greater than a threshold distance away from a location of an I.P. address associated with the query. The system determines that the travel related queries refer to the destination or point of interest based at least in part on the inclusion of terms that are relevant to the destination or point of interest, e.g., names or identifiers for the destination or point of interest or other destinations or points of interest that are related to the destination or point of interest based at least in part on the logical hierarchy.
- The system then determines the popularity score for a destination or point of interest in one or more ways, including determining a count for the number of travel related queries or the number of references to the destination or point of interest in the travel related queries. Optionally, the count can be weighted based at least in part on the quantity or quality of the references to the destination or point of interest in the respective travel related queries. Additionally, the count can be modified using one or more mathematical operators to adjust the distribution of counts or to coerce counts into a range.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on travel related queries that refer to the destination or point of interest as well as an activity. This approach is similar to the approach for determining a popularity score based at least in part on travel related queries described above, with the addition that the travel related queries also refer to the activity. Here, the travel related queries are determined to refer to the activity based at least in part on the inclusion of one or more terms that reference the activity or its synonyms.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on a combined query distance for the travel related queries that refer to the destination or point of interest. The query distance for each travel related query is determined by calculating, the distance between a location associated with the travel related query and the location of the destination or point of interest. A location associated with the travel related query can be determined in one or more ways, including resolving an IP address associated with the query. The query distances for the travel related queries are then combined using one or more mathematical operators. For example, the combined query distance can be the average or the total of the query distances.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on identifying photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest (708). Photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest are identified as described above with regard to
FIGS. 5-6 . - The system then determines the popularity score for the destination or point of interest based at least in part on the photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest. In some instances, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on a count of the number of photographs that are geographically related to the destination or point of interest. Optionally, the count can be weighted based at least in part on the respective distances between the locations associated with the photographs and the location of the destination or point of interest. Additionally, the count may be modified using one or more mathematical operators to adjust the distribution of counts or to coerce the count into a range.
- In some implementations, the popularity score is determined based at least in part on two or more of the approaches described above, including determining travel related documents, determining travel related queries, determining combined query distances, or identifying photographs. Here, the popularity score is determined in one or more ways, including combining the respective popularity scores for each of the approaches by applying one or more mathematical operators or formulas.
- In some implementations, the popularity score for a destination is determined based at least in part on the popularity scores for other destinations or points of interest that are related to the destination according to the logical hierarchy. Here, other destinations or points of interest that are related to the destination are identified using the logical hierarchy as described above with reference to
FIGS. 3 and 7 . For each of the identified other destinations or points of interest, a popularity score is determined using one or more of the approaches described above. The popularity scores for the other destinations or points of interest can be combined by applying one or more mathematical operators or formulas. Additionally, a popularity score for the destination can be determined using one or more of the approaches described above. The combined popularity score for the other destinations or points of interest can be combined with the popularity score for the destination by applying one or more mathematical operators or formulas. - The system selects one or more selected destinations or points of interest from the identified destinations or points of interest based at least in part on the respective popularity scores (712). In some implementations, the destinations or points of interest with the best score or scores are selected. Depending on how the popularity score is determined, the best score may be the highest score or the lowest score. In some implementations, destinations or points of interest are selected if they satisfy a threshold as described above.
- In some implementations, the destinations are cities. Here, cities associated with a travel location are identified by querying the
geographic data store 312. For each of the cities the system determines: a count of travel related documents that refer to the city, a count of travel related queries that refer to the city, a count of photographs from thephotograph data store 310 that are geographically related to the city, and a popularity score based at least in part on the count of travel documents, the count of travel queries, and the count of photographs. The system then selects one or more selected cities based at least in part on the respective popularity scores. -
