Definitions
- Radio detection and ranging (RADAR) systems can be used to actively estimate distances to environmental features by emitting radio signals and detecting returning reflected signals. Distances to radio-reflective features can be determined according to the time delay between transmission and reception.
- the radar system can emit a signal that varies in frequency over time, such as a signal with a time-varying frequency chip, and then relate the difference in frequency between the emitted signal and the reflected signal to a range estimate.

- FIG. 2 illustrates example beam steering for a sector for a radar unit.
- FIG. 3A illustrates an example coordinate plane.
- FIG. 3B illustrates an example radar DSP system for determining crossing target dynamics.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example computing device for performing some of the methods disclosed herein.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example method for determining crossing target dynamics.
- vehicular radar systems may feature multiple radar units with each radar unit having an associated field of view.
- Automotive systems may feature radar systems that offer 360-degree radar coverage, thus, unless radar systems that look in a single direction, radar targets will have a higher crossing component. That is, radar systems that look in a single direction generally will determine a velocity component for a target that is normal to the radar unit (velocity moving toward or away from the radar unit), and ignore the crossing components.
- crossing dynamics may be determined that aid in control of an autonomous vehicle.
- vehicular radar systems have featured a single radar unit looking in a forward direction. These traditional radar systems would also typically only direct the radar beam in a single direction. For example, a traditional vehicular radar system may only be configured to detect the presence of another vehicle directly in front of the vehicle having the radar system. Thus, as long as a radar beam generally points in the forward direction the traditional radar system would be able to detect the vehicle.
- More advanced radar systems may be used with a vehicle in order to obtain a wider field of view than just that directly in front of the vehicle. For example, it may be desirable either for a radar to be able to steer a radar beam or for a vehicle to feature multiple radar units pointing in different directions. Additionally, the radar units may be configured to detect more than just other vehicles located directly in front of the vehicle with the radar unit. Thus, the radar system may be able to interrogate different regions than just the region in front of the car. In some examples, multiple radar units may be combined with steerable radar beams to further increase the interrogation region and the imagining resolution of the vehicular radar system.
- One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for the operation of a signal processing system for a vehicular radar system.
- the presently disclosed system can measure object crossing speed and object cross range extent with a radar system. Because of the high frequency of operation of automotive radar systems, a radar target may have a large Doppler extent. This large Doppler extent may introduce processing errors or difficulties with traditional radar processing systems. However, the signal processing disclosed herein may use this large Doppler extent to aid in a calculation of the object crossing speed and/or object cross range extent.
- a cross-range rate may be calculated. These calculations may provide several useful insights.
- the doppler and azimuth bandwidth of the object may be calculated by examining matched range filters in the neighborhood of a large peak using image processing. From these calculated bandwidths, equations may be used to directly calculate crossing speed and cross range extent.
- radar detection processing may be used.
- An object's large Doppler extent may create multiple detections, and the disclosed approach may be used to examine the multiple detections. For example, for a pair of detections, it is possible to measure their cross-range distance and cross-range rate. This information can be used in a joint estimator to determine both (i) whether two detections arise from the same object and (ii) that object's crossing speed.
- the disclosed processing could be used to augment a traditional moving object autofocus algorithm.
- Such algorithms generally jointly estimate range, range rate, and range acceleration.
- a combined estimator could also include cross-range extent and cross-range rate.
- a common problem when objects are resolved is that multiple tracks of a single object compete and jump from scatterer to scatterer on the object, degrading the overall quality of object tracking. For example, if an object has either a large cross-extent and/or range-distance extent, multiple points of the object may be causing the detected scattering. Thus, a radar-processing algorithm may accidently jump between the various different reflecting points. The use of different reflecting points can cause inaccuracies in calculations. For example, a velocity for an object may be calculated based on different reflecting points, resulting in an inaccurate velocity calculation.
- One fix for large cross-extent and/or range-distance extent is to attempt to aggregate detections that appear to arise from a single object. Another fix may be to use image processing to identify object blobs (e.g. a large amount of reflections caused by a single object). However, such attempts tend to lack robustness.
- An example radar system for use with the present disclosure may include a multi-sector 90-degree field of view radar antenna architecture.
- This architecture enables an antenna to both scan across approximately 90 degrees of the azimuth plane (e.g. the horizontal plane) while also being mountable on various surfaces of a vehicle.
- Having a radar antenna with a 90-degree field of view may enable a radar system to scan a full 360-degree azimuth plane by having four radar units each configured to scan one 90-degree non-overlapping sector. Therefore, the example disclosed radar system may be able to steer a radar beam to interrogate the entire region in the azimuth plane of the vehicle.
- four such radars located on four corners of a car would provide a full 360-degree coverage around the car.
- a system such as this may aid in autonomous driving of a vehicle.
- each radar unit can scan or span a 90-degree region
- placing 4 radar units on a vehicle may enable the vehicle to scan a beam over the full 360-degree azimuth plane.
- Each of the four radar units may be configured to scan a beam over one sector (i.e. one quarter of the azimuth plane) and thus the entire plane may be scanned by the combination of the four radar units.
- the placement of the radar units may be adjusted depending on the specific vehicle, the requirements of the radar system, or other design criteria.
- the radar units may be configured to scan a region of an angular width that is not 90 degrees. For example, some radar units may scan 30 degrees, 120 degrees, or another angle. Further, in some examples, the radar units on the vehicle may scan less than the full 360-degree azimuth plane.
- the radar sectors may be defined based on where the radar units are mounted on the vehicle.
- one radar unit may be mounted in each of the side mirrors of the vehicle.
- the other two radar units may be mounted behind the taillights of the vehicle.
- the quadrants may be defined based on axes where one axis aligns with the direction of vehicular motion and the other axis aligns with the middle of the vehicle from front to back.
- the radar units may be mounted in order to have one pointing forward, one pointing backward, and one pointing to each side.
- the axes of the quadrants may be at a 45 degree angle to the direction of motion of the vehicle.
- the radar unit may be mounted on top of the vehicle.
- the modular multi-sector 90-degree field of view radar antenna architecture may be able to steer the radar beams emitted from each radar unit.
- the radar beams may be steered by the radar units in various ways.
- the radar units may be able to steer the beam in an approximately continuous manner across the 90-degree field of view for the respective antenna or the radar units may be configured with sectoral sub beams spanning the 90 degrees.
- the radar units may be able to steer the radar beam to predetermined directions within the 90-degree field of view for the respective antenna.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example layout of radar sectors for an autonomous vehicle 102 .
- each of the radar sectors may have an angular width approximately equal to the scanning range of the radar units (as will be described with respect to FIG. 2 ).
- the sectors of FIG. 1 divide the azimuth plane around the autonomous vehicle 102 into 90-degree sectors.
- the radar units are configured to scan a radar beam over a different angle than 90 degrees, the width and number of sectors may change.
- the radar sectors may align with the axes ( 112 a and 112 b ) of the vehicle 102 .
- the axes ( 112 a and 112 b ) of the vehicle 102 there may be a front left, front right, rear left, and rear right sector defined by the midpoints of the vehicle 102 .
- each radar unit may be configured to scan across one sector.
- each example radar unit of FIG. 1 has a scanning angle of approximately 90 degrees, each radar unit scans a region that approximately does not overlap with the scanning angle of any other radar unit.
- the layout of radar sectors shown in FIG. 1 is one example. Other possible layouts of radar sectors are possible as well.
- each radar unit may be mounted at a 45 degree angle with respect to the two axes of the vehicle 102 .
- a 90 degree scan of the radar unit would scan from one vehicle axis to the other vehicle axis.
- a radar unit mounted at a 45 degree angle to the axes in side mirror unit 104 may be able to scan the front left sector (i.e. from the vertical axis 112 a through the front of the vehicle 102 to the axis 112 b that runs through the side of the vehicle).
- An additional radar unit mounted at a 45 degree angle to the axes in side mirror unit 106 may be able to scan the front right sector.
- a radar unit may be mounted in taillight unit 110 .
- a radar unit may be mounted in taillight unit 108 .
- the radar unit placements shown in FIG. 1 are merely one example. In various other examples, the radar units may be placed in other locations, such as on top of the vehicle, or within or behind other vehicle components.
- the sectors may also be defined differently in various embodiments. For example, the sectors may be at a 45 degree angle with respect to the vehicle. In this example, one radar unit may face forward, another backward, and the other two to the sides of the vehicle.
- all the radar units of vehicle 102 may be configured with the same scanning angle.
- the azimuth plane around the vehicle is equal to a full 360 degrees.
- the scanning angle for the radar units would be equal to approximately 360 degrees divided by the number of radar units on the vehicle, for full azimuth plane scanning
- the number of radar units may be chosen based on a number of criteria, such as ease of manufacture of the radar units, vehicle placement, or other criteria.
- some radar units may be configured with a planar structure that is sufficiently small.
- the planar radar unit may be mountable at various positions on a vehicle.
- a vehicle may have a dedicated radar housing mounted on the top of the vehicle.
- the radar housing may contain various radar units.
- radar units may be placed within the vehicle structure.
- radar units When radar units are located within the vehicle structure, each may not be visible from outside the vehicle without removing parts of the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle may not be altered aesthetically, cosmetically, or aerodynamically from adding radar units.
- radar units may be placed under vehicle trim work, under bumpers, under grills, within housings for lights, within side mirrors, or other locations as well.
- various plastics, polymers, and other materials may form part of the vehicle structure and cover the radar units, while allowing the radar signal to pass through.
- the radar units may be configured with different scanning ranges for different radar units. For example, in some embodiments a specific radar unit with a wide scanning angle may not be able to be placed on the vehicle in the proper location. Thus, a smaller radar unit, with a smaller scanning angle may be placed in that location. However, other radar units may be able to have larger scanning angles. Therefore, the total scanning angle of the radar units may add up to 360 degrees (or more) and provide full 360 degree azimuthal scanning For example, a vehicle may have three radar units that each scan over 100 degrees and a fourth radar unit that scans over 60 degrees. Thus, the radar units may be able to scan the full azimuth plane, but the scanning sectors may not be equal in angular size.
- FIG. 2 illustrates example beam steering for a sector for a radar unit 200 .
- the radar unit 200 may be configured with a steerable beam, i.e., the radar unit 200 may be able to control a direction in which the beam is radiated. By controlling the direction in which the beam is radiated, the radar unit 200 may be able to direct radiation in a specific direction in order to determine radar reflections (and thus objects) in that direction. In some embodiments, the radar unit 200 may be able to scan a radar beam in a continuous manner across the various angles of the azimuth plane. In other embodiments, the radar unit 200 may be able to scan the radar beam in discrete steps across the various angles of the azimuth plane.
- the example radar unit 200 in FIG. 2 has a radar beam 206 that can be steered across a plurality of different angles.
- the radar beam 206 may have a half-power beamwidth of approximately 22.5 degrees.
- the half-power beamwidth describes the width, measured in degrees, of a main lobe of the radar beam 206 between two points that correspond to half the amplitude of the maximum of the radar beam 206 .
- the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be different than 22.5 degrees. Additionally, in some embodiments, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may change depending on the angle at which the radar beam 206 is pointed.
- the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be narrower when the radar beam 206 is pointed more closely to the orthogonal 204 a (i.e. broadside) direction to the radiating surface and widen and the radar beam 206 is steered away from the orthogonal direction 204 a.
- the radar beam may be able to be steered to four different angles.
- the steering angle may be measured with respect to the orthogonal 204 a (i.e. broadside) direction to the radiating surface.
- the beam may be steered to +36 degrees at 204 c and ⁇ 36 degrees at 204 e .
- the beam may be steered to +12 degrees at 204 b and ⁇ 12 degrees at 204 d .
- the four different angles may represent the discrete angles to which the radar beam 206 may be steered.
- the radar beam may be able to be steered to two angles simultaneously. For example, the radar beam may be steered to both +12 and ⁇ 12 degrees at the same time.
- the full 90 degree field of view can be scanned.
- the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from +47.25 degrees to +24.75 degrees (as measured from the broadside direction 204 a ).
- the radar beam 206 is steered to ⁇ 36 degrees, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from ⁇ 47.25 degrees to ⁇ 24.75 degrees.
- the radar beam 206 when the radar beam 206 is steered to +12 degrees 204 b , the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from +23.25 degrees to +0.75 degrees. And finally, when the radar beam 206 is steered to ⁇ 12 degrees 204 d , the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from ⁇ 23.25 degrees to ⁇ 0.75 degrees. Thus, the radar beam 206 will effectively be able to scan (i.e. selectively enable or disable the four beams spanning the angular width) from ⁇ 47.25 to +47.25 degrees, covering a range of 95 degrees.
- the number of steering angles, the direction of the steering angles, and the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be varied depending on the specific example.
- a radar beam of a radar unit may be configured to only scan a 60 degree region. If a radar unit can scan a 60 degree region, six radar units may be used to scan a full 360 azimuth plane. However, if the radar unit can scan 90 degrees, four radar units may scan the full 360 azimuth plane.
- FIG. 3A illustrates an example coordinate plane for use within the context of the present disclosure.
- the present disclosure uses the following variables: the position of the radar unit (O), the position of the target (P), the angle between a position of the radar unit and the target's velocity ( ⁇ ), the target velocity (V t ), the radar unit's velocity (V o ), the cross-range extent (w c ), and the range to the target (r).
- the variables will be used throughout the present disclosure.

Radio detection and ranging (RADAR) systems can be used to actively estimate distances to environmental features by emitting radio signals and detecting returning reflected signals. Distances to radio-reflective features can be determined according to the time delay between transmission and reception. The radar system can emit a signal that varies in frequency over time, such as a signal with a time-varying frequency chip, and then relate the difference in frequency between the emitted signal and the reflected signal to a range estimate. Some systems may also estimate relative motion of reflective objects based on Doppler frequency shifts in the received reflected signals.

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the figures and the following detailed description.
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures, which form a part hereof. In the figures, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, figures, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.
The following detailed description relates to an apparatus and methods for determining crossing target dynamics for a radar system. In practice, vehicular radar systems may feature multiple radar units with each radar unit having an associated field of view. Automotive systems may feature radar systems that offer 360-degree radar coverage, thus, unless radar systems that look in a single direction, radar targets will have a higher crossing component. That is, radar systems that look in a single direction generally will determine a velocity component for a target that is normal to the radar unit (velocity moving toward or away from the radar unit), and ignore the crossing components. By combining the ability to scan a radar beam 360 degrees and novel processing techniques, crossing dynamics may be determined that aid in control of an autonomous vehicle.
Traditionally, vehicular radar systems have featured a single radar unit looking in a forward direction. These traditional radar systems would also typically only direct the radar beam in a single direction. For example, a traditional vehicular radar system may only be configured to detect the presence of another vehicle directly in front of the vehicle having the radar system. Thus, as long as a radar beam generally points in the forward direction the traditional radar system would be able to detect the vehicle.
More advanced radar systems may be used with a vehicle in order to obtain a wider field of view than just that directly in front of the vehicle. For example, it may be desirable either for a radar to be able to steer a radar beam or for a vehicle to feature multiple radar units pointing in different directions. Additionally, the radar units may be configured to detect more than just other vehicles located directly in front of the vehicle with the radar unit. Thus, the radar system may be able to interrogate different regions than just the region in front of the car. In some examples, multiple radar units may be combined with steerable radar beams to further increase the interrogation region and the imagining resolution of the vehicular radar system.
One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for the operation of a signal processing system for a vehicular radar system. The presently disclosed system can measure object crossing speed and object cross range extent with a radar system. Because of the high frequency of operation of automotive radar systems, a radar target may have a large Doppler extent. This large Doppler extent may introduce processing errors or difficulties with traditional radar processing systems. However, the signal processing disclosed herein may use this large Doppler extent to aid in a calculation of the object crossing speed and/or object cross range extent.
Traditional radar tracking algorithms assume that the range and Doppler extent of a target is approximately matched to a size of a range filter. That is, a scatterer typically will produce a reflection signal that is nominal in both range extent and range-distance extent. For example, in a processing display a target may appear as a single ‘pixel’ object. When the assumption that the range and Doppler extent are small is broken, the performance of the radar system can suffer.
Therefore, by measuring the dopper bandwidth, range, and bearing angle, a cross-range rate may be calculated. These calculations may provide several useful insights.
First, the doppler and azimuth bandwidth of the object may be calculated by examining matched range filters in the neighborhood of a large peak using image processing. From these calculated bandwidths, equations may be used to directly calculate crossing speed and cross range extent.
Second, rather than performing image processing, radar detection processing may be used. An object's large Doppler extent may create multiple detections, and the disclosed approach may be used to examine the multiple detections. For example, for a pair of detections, it is possible to measure their cross-range distance and cross-range rate. This information can be used in a joint estimator to determine both (i) whether two detections arise from the same object and (ii) that object's crossing speed.
Third, the disclosed processing could be used to augment a traditional moving object autofocus algorithm. Such algorithms generally jointly estimate range, range rate, and range acceleration. A combined estimator could also include cross-range extent and cross-range rate.
A common problem when objects are resolved is that multiple tracks of a single object compete and jump from scatterer to scatterer on the object, degrading the overall quality of object tracking. For example, if an object has either a large cross-extent and/or range-distance extent, multiple points of the object may be causing the detected scattering. Thus, a radar-processing algorithm may accidently jump between the various different reflecting points. The use of different reflecting points can cause inaccuracies in calculations. For example, a velocity for an object may be calculated based on different reflecting points, resulting in an inaccurate velocity calculation. One fix for large cross-extent and/or range-distance extent is to attempt to aggregate detections that appear to arise from a single object. Another fix may be to use image processing to identify object blobs (e.g. a large amount of reflections caused by a single object). However, such attempts tend to lack robustness.
An example radar system for use with the present disclosure may include a multi-sector 90-degree field of view radar antenna architecture. This architecture enables an antenna to both scan across approximately 90 degrees of the azimuth plane (e.g. the horizontal plane) while also being mountable on various surfaces of a vehicle. Having a radar antenna with a 90-degree field of view may enable a radar system to scan a full 360-degree azimuth plane by having four radar units each configured to scan one 90-degree non-overlapping sector. Therefore, the example disclosed radar system may be able to steer a radar beam to interrogate the entire region in the azimuth plane of the vehicle. Thus, four such radars located on four corners of a car would provide a full 360-degree coverage around the car. For example, a system such as this may aid in autonomous driving of a vehicle.
When each radar unit can scan or span a 90-degree region, placing 4 radar units on a vehicle may enable the vehicle to scan a beam over the full 360-degree azimuth plane. Each of the four radar units may be configured to scan a beam over one sector (i.e. one quarter of the azimuth plane) and thus the entire plane may be scanned by the combination of the four radar units. In various examples, the placement of the radar units may be adjusted depending on the specific vehicle, the requirements of the radar system, or other design criteria. In some additional examples, the radar units may be configured to scan a region of an angular width that is not 90 degrees. For example, some radar units may scan 30 degrees, 120 degrees, or another angle. Further, in some examples, the radar units on the vehicle may scan less than the full 360-degree azimuth plane.
In some examples, the radar sectors may be defined based on where the radar units are mounted on the vehicle. In one example, one radar unit may be mounted in each of the side mirrors of the vehicle. The other two radar units may be mounted behind the taillights of the vehicle. In this example, the quadrants may be defined based on axes where one axis aligns with the direction of vehicular motion and the other axis aligns with the middle of the vehicle from front to back. In another example, the radar units may be mounted in order to have one pointing forward, one pointing backward, and one pointing to each side. In this second example, the axes of the quadrants may be at a 45 degree angle to the direction of motion of the vehicle. Additionally, the radar unit may be mounted on top of the vehicle.
The modular multi-sector 90-degree field of view radar antenna architecture may be able to steer the radar beams emitted from each radar unit. The radar beams may be steered by the radar units in various ways. For example, in some embodiments, the radar units may be able to steer the beam in an approximately continuous manner across the 90-degree field of view for the respective antenna or the radar units may be configured with sectoral sub beams spanning the 90 degrees. In other embodiments, the radar units may be able to steer the radar beam to predetermined directions within the 90-degree field of view for the respective antenna.
As shown in FIG. 1 , the radar sectors may align with the axes (112 a and 112 b) of the vehicle 102. For example, there may be a front left, front right, rear left, and rear right sector defined by the midpoints of the vehicle 102. Because each sector corresponds to one radar unit, each radar unit may be configured to scan across one sector. Further, because each example radar unit of FIG. 1 has a scanning angle of approximately 90 degrees, each radar unit scans a region that approximately does not overlap with the scanning angle of any other radar unit. The layout of radar sectors shown in FIG. 1 is one example. Other possible layouts of radar sectors are possible as well.
In order to achieve radar sectors defined by the midpoints of the vehicle 102, each radar unit may be mounted at a 45 degree angle with respect to the two axes of the vehicle 102. By mounting the radar units a 45 degree angle with respect to the two axes of the vehicle 102, a 90 degree scan of the radar unit would scan from one vehicle axis to the other vehicle axis. For example, a radar unit mounted at a 45 degree angle to the axes in side mirror unit 104 may be able to scan the front left sector (i.e. from the vertical axis 112 a through the front of the vehicle 102 to the axis 112 b that runs through the side of the vehicle). An additional radar unit mounted at a 45 degree angle to the axes in side mirror unit 106 may be able to scan the front right sector. In order to scan the back right sector, a radar unit may be mounted in taillight unit 110. Additionally, in order to scan the back left sector, a radar unit may be mounted in taillight unit 108. The radar unit placements shown in FIG. 1 are merely one example. In various other examples, the radar units may be placed in other locations, such as on top of the vehicle, or within or behind other vehicle components. Further, the sectors may also be defined differently in various embodiments. For example, the sectors may be at a 45 degree angle with respect to the vehicle. In this example, one radar unit may face forward, another backward, and the other two to the sides of the vehicle.
In some examples, all the radar units of vehicle 102 may be configured with the same scanning angle. The azimuth plane around the vehicle is equal to a full 360 degrees. Thus, if each radar unit is configured with the same scanning angle, then the scanning angle for the radar units would be equal to approximately 360 degrees divided by the number of radar units on the vehicle, for full azimuth plane scanning
If the vehicle 102 had two radar units, each would scan approximately 180 degrees. For three radar units, each would be configured to scan 120 degrees. For four radar units, as shown in FIG. 1 , each may scan approximated 90 degrees. Five radar units may be configured on the vehicle 102 and each may be able to scan 72 degrees. Further, six radar units may be configured on the vehicle 102 and each may be able to scan approximately 60 degrees.
The number of radar units may be chosen based on a number of criteria, such as ease of manufacture of the radar units, vehicle placement, or other criteria. For example, some radar units may be configured with a planar structure that is sufficiently small. The planar radar unit may be mountable at various positions on a vehicle. For example, a vehicle may have a dedicated radar housing mounted on the top of the vehicle. The radar housing may contain various radar units. However, in other embodiments, radar units may be placed within the vehicle structure.
When radar units are located within the vehicle structure, each may not be visible from outside the vehicle without removing parts of the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle may not be altered aesthetically, cosmetically, or aerodynamically from adding radar units. For example, radar units may be placed under vehicle trim work, under bumpers, under grills, within housings for lights, within side mirrors, or other locations as well. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to place radar units in positions where the object covering the radar unit is at least partially transparent to radar. For example, various plastics, polymers, and other materials may form part of the vehicle structure and cover the radar units, while allowing the radar signal to pass through.
Additionally, in some embodiments, the radar units may be configured with different scanning ranges for different radar units. For example, in some embodiments a specific radar unit with a wide scanning angle may not be able to be placed on the vehicle in the proper location. Thus, a smaller radar unit, with a smaller scanning angle may be placed in that location. However, other radar units may be able to have larger scanning angles. Therefore, the total scanning angle of the radar units may add up to 360 degrees (or more) and provide full 360 degree azimuthal scanning For example, a vehicle may have three radar units that each scan over 100 degrees and a fourth radar unit that scans over 60 degrees. Thus, the radar units may be able to scan the full azimuth plane, but the scanning sectors may not be equal in angular size.
The example radar unit 200 in FIG. 2 has a radar beam 206 that can be steered across a plurality of different angles. As shown in FIG. 2 , the radar beam 206 may have a half-power beamwidth of approximately 22.5 degrees. The half-power beamwidth describes the width, measured in degrees, of a main lobe of the radar beam 206 between two points that correspond to half the amplitude of the maximum of the radar beam 206. In various embodiments, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be different than 22.5 degrees. Additionally, in some embodiments, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may change depending on the angle at which the radar beam 206 is pointed. For example, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be narrower when the radar beam 206 is pointed more closely to the orthogonal 204 a (i.e. broadside) direction to the radiating surface and widen and the radar beam 206 is steered away from the orthogonal direction 204 a.
In the example shown in FIG. 2 , the radar beam may be able to be steered to four different angles. The steering angle may be measured with respect to the orthogonal 204 a (i.e. broadside) direction to the radiating surface. The beam may be steered to +36 degrees at 204 c and −36 degrees at 204 e. Also, the beam may be steered to +12 degrees at 204 b and −12 degrees at 204 d. The four different angles may represent the discrete angles to which the radar beam 206 may be steered. In some additional examples, the radar beam may be able to be steered to two angles simultaneously. For example, the radar beam may be steered to both +12 and −12 degrees at the same time. This may result in a beam that is overall steered in the direction of the sum of the angles (e.g. −12+12=0, thus the beam in this example would be in the broadside direction 204 a). However, when a radar beam is steered at two directions at once, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam may be widened. Thus, a radar resolution may decrease.
By steering the radar beam 206 to each of angles 204 b-204 e, the full 90 degree field of view can be scanned. For example, when the radar beam 206 is steered to +36 degrees 204 c, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from +47.25 degrees to +24.75 degrees (as measured from the broadside direction 204 a). Additionally, when the radar beam 206 is steered to −36 degrees, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from −47.25 degrees to −24.75 degrees. Further, when the radar beam 206 is steered to +12 degrees 204 b, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from +23.25 degrees to +0.75 degrees. And finally, when the radar beam 206 is steered to −12 degrees 204 d, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from −23.25 degrees to −0.75 degrees. Thus, the radar beam 206 will effectively be able to scan (i.e. selectively enable or disable the four beams spanning the angular width) from −47.25 to +47.25 degrees, covering a range of 95 degrees. The number of steering angles, the direction of the steering angles, and the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be varied depending on the specific example.
For example, and further discussed below, a radar beam of a radar unit may be configured to only scan a 60 degree region. If a radar unit can scan a 60 degree region, six radar units may be used to scan a full 360 azimuth plane. However, if the radar unit can scan 90 degrees, four radar units may scan the full 360 azimuth plane.
The CFAR processing block 352, may include performing Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) processing on received radar reflection signals. CFAR is an adaptive radar-detection algorithm configured to detect reflection signals in a received radar signal. The CFAR algorithm may be adaptable to determine both a threshold detection level as well as a detection level to reduce clutter and interference. Although block 352 is described as CFAR processing, other radar-processing algorithms may be used as well.
As previously discussed, traditional radar tracking algorithms, such as CFAR, assume that the Doppler and range extent of a target is approximately matched to the size of range and Doppler matched filters. That is, a target typically will produce a reflected phase history that is nominal in both Doppler extent and range extent. For example, in a processing display a scatterer may appear as a single ‘pixel’ object. When the assumption that the Doppler and range extent are small is broken, the performance of the radar system can suffer. However, these features may be exploited by the present system in order to obtain cross-range information about abut a target.
The processing described herein may be performed as image processing. The output of the CFAR processing block 352 may be an image based on the received radar reflection signals. The image produced from the CFAR processing block 352 may be a two dimensional image. On one axis, each image pixel may correspond to one of a plurality of range filters of the radar processing system. On the other axis, the Doppler shift in Hertz is plotted. Thus, the image plots the various Doppler reflections for various ranges of the reflection signal. Although the data is described as an image, the data may take the form of image data and never be rendered into a viewable image.
After the CFAR processing block 352, the system may perform block 354 Extract Doppler Subband around a respective detected point. By extracting the Doppler subband, a range of Doppler reflection signals may be extracted that correspond to a target. For example, when processing an image (like the above-described image), the Doppler subband may be a region around a detection point that has sufficiently high detection levels. In one example, a Doppler subband may be extracted within a single range bin or across multiple range bins. In another example, the various Doppler subband points that are extracted may be individual points that each have a reflection signal above a threshold. In yet another example, the various Doppler subband points that are extracted may be a continuous span of Doppler spectrum where each portion has a reflection signal above a threshold.
After extracting a Doppler Subband, the Doppler bandwidth may be calculated at block 356. The Doppler bandwidth may be calculated based on the image as well. The Doppler bandwidth may be the difference between the highest and lowest Doppler shift within an identified Doppler subband. For example, the Doppler bandwidth may correspond to the difference between a Doppler shift of a highest Doppler shift point having a reflection above the threshold and the Doppler shift of a lowest Doppler shift point having a reflection above the threshold. The cross-range extent of an object will cause the object to occupy some portion of the Doppler spectrum. Expressed in meters per second the space occupied in Doppler Bandwidth (Bd) is,
A Taylor expansion of the functions above about θ gives an approximation,
After calculating a Doppler bandwidth, the cross-range rate may be calculated at block 358. Substituting in the value of cross-range rate gives the following:
Solving the equation for the cross-range rate gives the following:
Thus, the cross-range rate may be based on the Doppler bandwidth, the cross-range extent, and the range of a reflecting object. The cross-range rate may be used by an autonomous vehicle to help control the autonomous vehicle. For example, the cross-range rate of an object may be used to control the autonomous vehicle so as to avoid the object.

At block 504, the method 500 includes receiving a reflection signal. The reflection signal may be a single reflection or a signal including several reflected signals. The reflection signals may be reflected from objects within the field of view of the radar system. The reflection signals may be received by an antenna or antenna system of the radar system. The antenna may output signals based on the received reflections for further processing by the radar system.
In some examples of method 500, the processing and determining may be based on image processing, as described with respect to example DSP system 350. As discussed, an image produced may be a two dimensional image. On one axis, each image pixel may correspond to one of a plurality of range filters of the radar processing system. On the other axis, the Doppler shift in hertz is plotted. Thus, the image plots the various Doppler reflections for various ranges of the reflection signal. Although the data is described as an image, the data may take the form of image data and never be rendered into a viewable image.
At block 506, the method 500 includes determining a Doppler Bandwidth based on the received signal. The Doppler bandwidth may be the difference between the highest and lowest Doppler shift in a within an identified Doppler subband. For example, the Doppler bandwidth may correspond to the difference between a Doppler shift of a highest Doppler shift point having a reflection above the threshold and the Doppler shift of a lowest Doppler shift point having a reflection above the threshold. The cross-range extent of an object will cause the object to occupy some portion of the Doppler spectrum.
At block 508, the method 500 includes determining a range based on the received signal. The range may be determined based on determining which of the range filters (or pixels along an axis of the image) correspond to the reflection signal. During operation, the range filter corresponding to the reflection signal will indicate a range of the reflection signal.
At block 510, the method 500 includes determining a cross-range extent based on the received signal. The cross-range extent may be determined in various ways. For example, the cross-range extent may be determined based on other systems of an autonomous vehicle. For example, traditional imaging may be able to identify objects and use a lookup table to determine cross-range extent. In other examples, scanning of radar beams may be used to determine a cross-range extent of a reflecting object. The cross-range extent of an object may be based on the angular width of the object. Further, the cross-range extent of the object may be a physical width of the reflecting object.
At block 512, the method 500 includes determining a cross range rate based on the received signal. As previously discussed, expressed in meters per second the space occupied in Doppler Bandwidth (Bd) is,
A Taylor expansion of the functions above about θ gives an approximation,
After calculating a Doppler bandwidth, the cross-range rate may be calculated. Substituting in the value of cross-range rate gives the following:
Solving the equation for the cross-range rate gives the following:
At block 514, the autonomous vehicle may be controlled based on the determined cross-range rate. The cross-range rate may give a crossing speed for various objects that are causing the reflections. For example, the cross-range rate may give a crossing speed for another vehicle approaching an intersection. Thus, the cross-range rate may be an effective calculation for object avoidance for an autonomous vehicle.
