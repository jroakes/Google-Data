Description
Related application
The application requires the exercise question submitted on November 1st, 2002 right of priority for " Method and Systemfor Dynamic Textual Ad Distribution via Email ", at present still unsettled U.S. Provisional Patent Application number 60/422,0844.
Technical field
The present invention relates in for input paying or the similar system of advertising, be used for providing the system and method for motion graphics or text advertisements by the electronic document of Email or other storage.
Background technology
A kind of form of advertising that sets the goal of often using in electronic medium is the bid of throwing in the broadcasting Email, and described broadcasting Email is a target with the particular recipient colony with one or more common interests.For example, news Email about specific topics (for example parentage) generally includes a large amount of uniform resource locator (URL) tabulations to the sending advertisement person website of catering to this specific topics (for example website of toyshop), the recipient of news Email can " click " link on it, come to check the website (this incident is called " clicking-enter ") of being advertised here, by web browser.
The sending advertisement person can be somebody's turn to do " clicking-enter " input generation by the advertisement that comprises in the Email that sets the goal to submitting a tender for the amount that any " clicking-enter " paid.In fact, several sending advertisement persons can carry out competitive bidding to input mutually, and the highest tenderer will be given and the right of priority that is higher than other tenderers.For example, will be listed by first the highest bid of news Email, other tenderers' advertisement can be listed with descending based on their bid.Therefore, when each click of giving the company of advertising-when entering the cost increase of (as submitting a tender), just listing of the said firm seen or the most tangible part (for example, the top of news Email) near the news Email is the easiest more.In the news Email the higher input of advertisement usually make to the click of this advertisement-enter more, thereby make the person's that obtains the sending advertisement the flow of targeted website more.
Though thisly the benefit of seeking the mechanism of advertising that sets the goal is provided for the sending advertisement person for throwing in the paying e-mail advertisement, the Email supplier obtains possible whole potential income in usually can not the paying from Email advertising.Common for throwing in the variation that concerns between the person that generally do not consider the sending advertisement of the paying Email system of advertising, Email supplier and the news Email content.For example, the sending advertisement person ceaselessly changes their bid to advertisement putting, may be developed with New Development advertizer's relation, may be moved to end with sending advertisement person's relation, and new advertisement may be able to obtain, or the like.
Though the relation between sending advertisement person and the Email supplier may be unfixed, the news Email generally is lasting, generally is sent to recipient's mailbox in a few minutes of sending.Then, news can stop the uncertain time period in recipient's mailbox (for example, several minutes, several hours, a couple of days, several weeks, several moons, or the like) after it is by initial the transmission, before the recipient checks this news Email.During this variable time section, the relation that news Email supplier and its advertisement are listed between the sending advertisement person in the news Email that is transmitted may change.For example, some or all listed sending advertisement persons account may not have money, some or all listed sending advertisement persons may no longer with for input paying Email supplier has concern that the relative ranking that the sending advertisement person submits a tender may change during this period, or the like.Therefore, the arrangement of advertising listing can not reflect when the news Email person of being received opens the best advertising listing of Email supplier is arranged in the initial news Email during transmission.
For example, the sending advertisement person based on its bid may be listed in the most showy position when the news Email is transmitted.But, being transmitted and the recipient checked in period between the Email at Email, the sending advertisement person has stopped itself and news Email supplier's relation, therefore, and no longer includes the relation of paying between the Email supplier.Therefore, owing to the recipient clicks any click to the sending advertisement person who has stopped that the sending advertisement person tabulation that stopped in the news Email causes-enter, in fact all the income of loss for the Email supplier, because the sending advertisement person who has stopped has freely received these clicks-enter.Similarly, submit a tender after transmitting or to any variation of click-admission rate of sending advertisement person can be when not transmitting the advertising listing of Email in reflect.The result is that if the advertising listing in the news Email reflects the optimal advertising tabulation arrangement when the mail person of being received checks, the Email supplier just can not realize its whole potential incomes so.In the current techniques of advertising that sets the goal by Email, also there is other shortcoming.

Comprise the result set of selected advertising image and their desired location in Email shows, be called " preferred advertisement layout " here.In at least one embodiment, the content provider is suitable for that the expression with the preferred advertisement layout is stored in the advertising database in exact date and time, because the preferred advertisement data layout is being submitted a tender and can changed during the variation of clicks-admission rate.Similarly, in one embodiment, the content provider is suitable for that browser cookie is set in E-mail client (or web browser) and locates, and wherein, browser cookie comprises the date and time to the reference and the advertisement of preferred advertisement layout.
If the Email recipient selects a shown advertising image, so in one embodiment, E-mail client sends request to the website to the content provider, this website by the URL that is associated with selected advertising image in the preferred advertisement laying out images with reference to quoting.About the advertising image reference in the Email, in one embodiment, the URL that is associated is not with reference to pointing to concrete sending advertisement person's website, but can be used to identify with reference to selecteed context based on URL wherein the nonspecific URL reference of concrete advertizer website.Is nonspecific URL http://x.about.com/sg/r/3459.htm in our example more early? p=0﹠amp; Amp; Ret=specsportss1_sg.Therefore, at least one embodiment, E-mail client is suitable for being included in the reference that is included in the preferred advertisement layout among the browser cookie that more early is stored in the client computer place.Use this preferred advertisement layout, ad system 24 can identify the sending advertisement person website that is associated with the selected sending advertisement person image that shows in this concrete moment in the user email client computer.Ad system 24 can offer sending advertisement person website E-mail client (or other web browser) then, is used for showing as " clicking-enter ".In case content successfully shown, ad system 24 just can write down to click-enter and be used to the purpose of keeping accounts.
Change if be used for the preferred advertisement layout of concrete news, just changed with sending advertisement person URL by the image of reference in the Email so, described URL is relevant with each the nonspecific URL that is stored in in the database that image is associated.Therefore, when the preferred advertisement layout changes, needn't on E-mail client, change any code that is stored in the Email, just can dynamically show different advertisements to the user.
In addition, when Email is opened at every turn request to contain the result of present image of preferred advertisement layout be that sending advertisement person or advertisement old or that no longer participate in are not shown.Therefore, this sending advertisement person can not obtain " freely " nomination, and ad system can not lose from the revenue opportunity to the sending advertisement person's who no longer participates in click-enter.
Content/ad system 16/24 can comprise a lot of parts, and is for example, shown in Figure 2 as following reference.Particularly, relevant with aforesaid operations, advertising image generation module 42 can be provided for the image that produces with one or more (preferably a plurality of) part that advertisement is relevant, and example is image as shown in Figure 23, as is described below.The function that is used to produce image can comprise data are taken out from database and becomes image format to prepare the computer software of complete image.Can also use other software.In addition, image server 44 can be provided for from the request of database reception to image, and can retrieve the image of locating at specific based on network finger URL (URL) and specify which image with the variable that is provided when request.The image that is provided can be based on being used to from the variable of database 18 index and retrieving images.
In addition, target Redirect Server 46 can be provided for the request that receives webpage behind selection and the corresponding image section of advertisement.Target Redirect Server 46 can receive request in specific based on network position, and operation parameter is determined corresponding sending advertisement person.
For the function of unit 42-46 is provided, database 18 can be stored and all index particular delivery the subject identifier for example image and the targeted website of numeral or name.Advertising listing generation module 32 (promptly with time, new bid, change of bid or the like) off and on upgrades advertisement rank order to the specific part theme, and therefore upgrades image that will be provided and the advertisement URL that target Redirect Server 46 can be redirected to E-mail client when correspondent advertisement is selected (comprising the position based on contingent rearrangement change URL).
Particularly, figure 22 illustrates steps flow chart according to a method of the present invention.In first step 2202, the recipient receives and store electronic documents (for example HTML Email), and the document comprises the html coding of at least one reference that is assigned to content/ad system place image.Next, in step 2204, take place the time period by alphabetical X appointment.Therefore pointing out that as top the time period is uncertain, is that the recipient opens can be through the time of growing arbitrarily between the step 2206 of Email at user's reception and storage of e-mails and next procedure.In case opened Email, in step 2208, E-mail client 28 can load Email and explain the code of Email, is included in the reference of the image that is stored in content/ad system 16/24 place.At this point, E-mail client can setting up procedure 221 0 asks to be stored in the advertising image/link in the Email.Point out that as top Email news can comprise one or more this references to the image that will be stored in ad system 24 places.
Step 2214 can occur in ad system 24 places, is used for definite preferred advertisement image that is associated with the reference that is received from E-mail client.Point out as top, because sending advertisement person's preferred compositions can change in the single image, so this dynamically and when request carries out.Therefore, for example, give numeral or name indicator, can produce specific image.In case correct image is determined, in step 2214, ad system 24 just can send back advertising image E-mail client to be shown to the user in step 2216.In addition, in step 2218, advertising listing system 24 can be delivered to cookie the E-mail client that will be stored in the computing machine of E-mail client.As discussed above, cookie can contain a large amount of information, comprises the indication of throwing in date and time and about image be passed to the various information of user's image mapped.In step 2220, determine whether that each dynamic advertising in the Email all is received, if, repeating step 2210,2212,2214,2216 and 2218 process so.If all this advertisements are shown, so in step 2222, the recipient can be chosen in one or more links that step 2222 is described in being delivered to user's image.Concrete, image can show the thing that seems link, though each be actually can be in illustrated image mapped example the as above part of selecteed image mapped.If the recipient selects link, so 2224, E-mail client sends back request at the ad system at the URL place of appointment in the image mapped code as discussed above.At this point, in step 2224, the user is redirected to the sending advertisement person of the image mapped part correlation connection of selecting with the user.In addition, to click-enter the purpose with other data-base recording technology in order writing down, in step 2226, to click-enter and be recorded.
The example of e-mail advertisement and click-entering part of being associated can be shown in Figure 23.In the figure, advertisement 60 can have the mass part that the content of text that often provides in the Email news is provided.In addition, can comprise various advertising images.In this example, depicted severally, be used for key diagram and how work as mapping function but only describe one in detail.Here, in the advertising image 70 can have three particular advertisement of different dvd system manufacturers or DVD dealer.Here, each can be shown as the part of single advertising image 70 in three advertisements, and can have the image section that is depicted as unit 72,74 and 76, is allocated for each sending advertisement person's demonstration.
Here, the sending advertisement person is selected based on being determined the grouping that is used to produce the maximum income of ad system: the first sending advertisement person has each and clicks-enter 25 cents bid, second each click-enter 21 cents, the 3rd each click-enter 24 cents, but this portfolio ratio such as one of them sending advertisement person can each to click-enter submit a tender 26 cents combination better.Here, described the line part, be used to show that they may select this part of image to enter into the user about this concrete sending advertisement person's message.As described above, after a part of having selected image mapped, just activated with the URL of this part correlation connection, be redirected the advertising listing system of getting back to, the directed therefrom then sending advertisement person ABC that for example is associated with this concrete advertisement by E-mail client.
As will be appreciated, although the current group of ABC, GHI and DEF can be the present arrangement to the sending advertisement person of this concrete Email news, in week age from now on, possible ABC can stop to list system by advertisement and participate in advertisement.Therefore, if present image is all transmitted when the user opens Email each time, so may the user will be redirected to the website of ABC, and therefore ABC needn't pay or " fault link " will be arranged when from the ABC request message.Native system has prevented this situation by transitive graph picture when Email is opened at every turn as described above, make that each the sending advertisement person who is included in the image is movable sending advertisement person, in their participation system, and advertisement is listed system and is had to be used to make from this sending advertisement person to their active link and ask the user of more information to be redirected, and produces income the arrangement thereby can enter from click as more detailed description ground below.

As shown in figure 2, advertising listing supplier 16 can comprise the system that advertisement receiver module 30 is provided, and this module is used for interacting to receive advertising message with the advertisement supplier.It can also comprise advertising listing generation module 32, and this module is based on the standard that is provided and depend on that the place (for example search engine, content inlet, issue partner or the like) of advertisement produces advertising listing from database.Advertisement priority determination module 34 can give the tab sequential of module generation based on rank.In one embodiment, advertisement priority determination module 34 can be determined rank based on income efficient, and utilizes and click-enter-rate determination module (also be called and click-enter-the rate counter).Then, produce and transmitted by various channels by the gained advertisement of rank.Can also provide advertisement communication module 38 to be used for communicating by letter with the sending advertisement person.For example, possible desirable system is used for reminding the sending advertisement person before the advertisement of given bid or before rank moves up and down advertisement in change.Can provide database 18 with the advertising listing supplier with interrelating, be used for stores advertisements, bid, advertising message and will be used for determining the click buffer memory of click-admission rate.
In addition, because advertising listing supplier 16 can provide releasing advertisements own and the function of search-engine results is provided, so can provide services on the Internet device system 40 and search engine system 42.Should be appreciated that, in advertising listing supplier 16, can comprise a plurality of such systems.
In addition, database server system 18 can comprise one or more Database Systems of storing various types of data, described data comprise one or more in following: advertisement, click buffer memory, bid amount information and sending advertisement person information, sending advertisement person information comprises the log-on message about the sending advertisement person, sending advertisement person's account, paying information and out of Memory described herein.Can provide a large amount of modules in various embodiments, and/or these modules can be combined so that described function to be provided.In addition, module can be dispersed on a plurality of physical systems, perhaps can be replicated in a plurality of systems.
The advertising listing supplier system that illustrates Figure 16 to 19 can realize taking in the various examples of the mode of efficient arrangement method.As shown in Figure 16, for given key word, the sending advertisement person tabulates the supplier can be by many different method advertizers, and they are submitting a tender from the input in the Search Results of the search engine of realizing the bid jettison system to this key word.On a period of time or to a large amount of impression, advertising listing supplier system can monitor and store the click-admission rate to effective advertisement of given sending advertisement person.For example, for per 100 impression, can determine that the primary advertising that is provided by the higher bidder to key word " DVD " produces click-admission rate of 20%.Each is clicked based on it-enter 0.25 dollar bid, and this ratio produces per thousand incomes (RPM) of 50.00 dollars.Can follow the trail of other sending advertisements person's that key word DVD is submitted a tender class likelihood data, described sending advertisement person comprises that its secondary advertisement has been implemented the sending advertisement person JKL company among Figure 16 for example with the sending advertisement person that increases efficient.
After determining each sending advertisement person's RPM, the sending advertisement person supplier that tabulates just can take action, and comprises based on RPM coming to sending advertisement person rank again at key word DVD.In this example, several lower bidder can be moved upward in rank owing to their higher click-admission rates, and higher click-admission rate shows the degree of correlation that they submit a tender.Like this, system monitors at given key word and change advertisement rank based on RPM.This supervision to rank can be ongoing or use the different time periods with revaluation.For example, click-admission rate can be by the hour, by week, monthly wait and monitor.
For this example, rank can also be determined by the system that is used in that the content inlet is thrown in.For example, not that key word " DVD " is submitted a tender, the sending advertisement person can submit a tender to the page in the content inlet of relevant DVD.In this system, in this page, can show the sending advertisement person of limited quantity, for example, as shown in Figure 18.Based on new rank, the order of advertisement or throw in may be because the RPM of those three advertisements lead but ABC, GHI are DEF then, although will produce different results according to the rank of bid amount in the page then.
In addition, as discussed above, the supervision of RPM can also comprise selecting walking advertisement with given bid from a plurality of advertisements that provided by the sending advertisement person.Figure 17 has described form, has indicated tabulating the supplier system to determining that a plurality of advertisements that provided by single sending advertisement person are made by the sending advertisement person with given bid.Two examples are provided.In first example.Sending advertisement person company ABC submits a tender to key word " DVD ", and four different advertisements are provided.On the given time period, it is higher that RPM is confirmed as advertisement #3, thus advertisement #3 can be confirmed as be the walking advertisement that shows in the ranked list that ABC submits a tender to key word DVD.In order to estimate interchangeable advertisement, can the different time, during etc. four different advertisements of operation, with attempt giving each advertising opportunity with in the correlation time section by statistics on very many viewers check.May can not use interchangeable advertisement always, begin to descend up to click-admission rate to given advertisement.Perhaps, replaceable advertisement can be shown a few hours weekly, all the other time showing walking advertisements in this week.Under this mode, replaceable advertisement can constantly be provided by the sending advertisement person, looking at whether replaceable advertisement is more effective than current walking advertisement, if but it does not have an appreciable impact than walking advertisement is far short of what is expected.In other words, encouragement is provided for the sending advertisement person, attempt to produce more revenue and, and not lose the potential punishment of rank when competing with adversary's sending advertisement person to sending advertisement person's more multithread amount.For example, when being used to other bidder relatively, replaceable ad click-admission rate can be got rid of from whole advertisement rate.
Similarly, sending advertisement person DEF company agree to provide two advertisements to its bid on the content page of pregnancy.about.com.After during the evaluation between two advertisements, may determine that advertisement # 1 still is the most effective, therefore, can continue to serve as walking advertisement based on RPM.
In addition, the comparison between a plurality of advertisements can be estimated on different time sections, to determine the highest RPM on different time sections.Figure 19 has described example table, and this table can be represented wherein, to have estimated intraday different time sections by determining that advertising listing supplier system makes.As the explanation of this example, may be at one day different time, more effective based on the advertisement that RPM is different.Therefore, the advertisement of selecting according to submitting a tender can be based on RPM and select time section.
Be used for taking in the evaluation that efficient is determined rank at least in part, other data also factor of can be used as are considered into.Spectators' demography, issue channel, country and other available information can be admitted to evaluation, to help the RPM of maximization at the advertisement of bid key word and content portal page.For example, can determine to produce different ranked list for different issue channels.
According to another embodiment, advertisement can fractional analysis.Grouping can be based on the known results collection by concrete issue channel expectation.Therefore, grouping can be issued channel and analyzed separately at each, therefore makes different issue channels receive and is optimised to produce different the advertisement order and the tabulation of income by this channel.For example, an issue channel can be that expectation is output the result set that is used for the content portal page.In such embodiments, set the tabulation of quantity and may expect, system of the present invention is based on determining the most effective tabulation combination of income to each effective income of clicking of dividing into groups, and the member of change group in time is to determine this most effective grouping.Right illustrative purposes is supposed having only four advertisements (A, B, C, D) with given key word (video-game), wherein, has only three tabulations will be displayed on the disseminule (being the content portal page in this example).In this example, sending advertisement person B provides two creation B1 and B2.
In order to determine the most effective grouping, system is each in the output various combination on the time period of setting, and determine effective CPM summation (sending advertisement person's cost) of per thousand impression of each model thus obtain the income of advertisement distributing system.So various combinations are: AB1C, AB1D, ACB1, ACD, ADB1, ADC, B1AC, B1AD, B1CA, B1CD, B1DA, B1DC, CB1A, CB1D, CAB1, CAD, CDB1, CDA, DB1C, DB1A, DCB1, DCA, DAB1, DAC, AB2C, AB2D, ACB2, ACD, ADB2, B2AC, B2AD, B2CA, B2CD, B2DA, B2DC, CB2A, CB2D, CAB2, CDB2, CDA, DB2C, DB2A, DCB2, DCA and DAB2.
Effective CPM summation of each model can by with the CPM of each tabulation (by formula 1000
*Click-admission rate
*CPC (each cost of clicking)) addition obtains.
For MODEL C B1A, produce:
Unit CTR CPC ECPM
C 0.00151.42 .6342
B1 0.00145.43 .6235
A 0.00148.36 .5328
Then, effectively the CPM summation is:
CB1A 1.7905
If MODEL C B2A produces following result:
Unit CTR CPC ECPM
C 0.00151.42 .6342
B2 0.00149.43 .6407
A 0.00148.36 .5328
Then, effectively the CPM summation is:
CB2A 1.8077
This will show that CB2A is better than CB1A.
By this embodiment, advertisement is not isolated from each other and compares, but in the grouping that produces maximum income, carry out.This embodiment admits that the variation of advertisement can produce more income, because the viewer has diversified interest.For example, the webpage on the content inlet relevant with video-game can attract to have the viewer of many different gaming platforms.If all advertisements only all relate to the sale with the recreation of single platform compatibility, this grouping will lack some advertisements that the viewer is interested in so.
