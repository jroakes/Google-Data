Fig. 5 A is the diagram illustrating spectrogram corresponding to two relevant with public accident media item.Fig. 5 B is the diagram of the curve chart illustrating the relevance score between the spectrogram shown in Fig. 5 A.After one group of video has been identified as being from same real world event, video and line locking common time can be made.The details of this process is described below under the background of various visual angles playback interfaces.
For N number of video, a target is that the skew finding alignment audio signal 510,520 unanimously collects x1:N=(x1,x2,…,XN).First system can make each pair of signal correction, relatively offsets x to measureij530.Then pass through the paired information of use be formulated joint probability distribution and use confidence spread to make inferences to obtain consistent solution.Confidence spread allows the pair signals sharing the vicinity of the audio signal being more closely related to facilitate the concordance of last solution.
Can pass through to select feature from audio signal, under possible audio offset, then compare these features, find so that the time migration 530 of two audio signals 510,520 alignment.The time migration with best coupling score value 540 can be used in assuming time unifying.There is some possibilities of the feature using audio signal, such as original audio signal, or be such as usually used in the spectral method of Language Processing MEL frequency spectrum or cepstrum.In one implementation, system uses the feature based on frequency, audio frequency spectrogram si(t,w):[0,Ti-1] x Ω: → R, it measures the spectrum power of wavelength w ∈ Ω at the place of time t in input video i, wherein TiIt is the length of input audio signal i.In order to mate, system can use zero normalized cross correlation as the conforming tolerance of a pair spectrogram, because normalization makes comparison that overlap length is insensitive.Fig. 5 A illustrates that currently unjustified two spectrograms 510,520, Fig. 5 B illustrates the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) of two spectrograms of the correct alignment of instruction due to the skew of mistake.
Normalized Cross Correlation Function fij(t):[1-Tj,Ti-1] → [-1,1] are zero normalization and length normalization method spectrogram si、sjDependency, and be defined as
Wherein Tij(t)=[max (0, t), min (Ti-1,t+Tj-1)] being overlapping region, the average of signal and length are taken from same overlapping region.
By finding the limit of signal to extract most probable K peak.
The hypothesis from analyzing extraction in pairs is used to be built into evidence,
Wherein c is from dependency fijThe confidence level derived.
Then, system is by being combined into evidenceThe joint probability distribution of time migration is modeled, obtains
Due at solution space (that is, p (x1:N)=p (x1:N+ t)) one Parameter uncertainties of middle existence, so a node is fixed as benchmark and its value is set as xl=0 by system, obtain following joint probability distribution
This is in the common form seen in Markov random field model.
Then passing through loopy confidence spread and come the limit of the x in approximant (6), loopy confidence spread uses the sequence of iterations of the message between node to propagate evidence by curve chart.At iteration t >=1 place of algorithm, the message definition from node i to j from the message of previous ones is by use
Wherein define t=0 place message equably or randomly.
The confidence level at iteration t place approaches limit, and uses the message of propagation to come its definition,
It should be noted that formula (7) is the convolution of paired factor and partial belief degree, this permission system is efficiently used Fourier transformation to calculate information updating.
After T iteration, it is possible to obtain last solution X by being maximized by confidence leveli:
Owing to not guaranteeing that loopy confidence spread converges on correct limit, so system can attempt solving all possible node as benchmark to obtain N number of hypothesis.System retains makes the maximized last solution of concordance score value,
Alternatively, relevance score can be directly used for measuring the total concordance assuming to solve:
The theory of various visual angles geometry provides mathematical tool, carries out camera attitude and the reconstruct of scene geometry with the some correspondence derived from image.Although having carried out the work about 3D structure from multiple camera perspectives, but many technology only having worked under the hypothesis of the internal calibration of known camera (such as, focal length, principal point).But, for the content generated by user, system cannot it is assumed that internal calibration information.It addition, different from according to depending on the reconstructing method based on 3D vision of the non-structured photo intersection of the Inline Function of coding in EXIF head, video metadata does not usually comprise this useful information.Therefore, in one implementation, system uses the pure phase machine being present in the video generated by user to rotate and automatically extracts internal calibration.
For concert or competitive sports, camera usually stays in a position and only slightly rotates to observe action.Owing to this is a target service condition, system uses a kind of method to provide the accurate initial estimation of camera focus for such video motion.Then, system uses some selection algorithms to filter out better or is just carrying out the image-region that camera attitude is extracted and various visual angles reconstruct, and then uses the focal length derived that these image-regions are carried out attitude extraction.
When camera only experiences rotation (and be likely to insignificant translation), between two images, associated images transformation of coordinates can project homography matrix H by 3x3 and is correlated with.
Under not losing general situation, first camera is made to align with initial point；Therefore, camera matrix is defined as
P1=K [I3×3| 0], (12)
And if the second visual angle is only the rotation R at the first visual angle, then
P2=K [R | 0]. (13)
Here, inner camera parameter is assumed to be zero-deviation, and principal point is assumed to be the center of the plane of delineation at camera, and most consumers camera situation is such:
The wherein focal length on fx and fy respectively x and y.Then, the homography matrix of associated images is internal and spin matrix function:
H=HRK-1.(15)
Owing to R meets I3x3-RRTOrthogonal 3x3 spin matrix, utilize formula (15), constraint can be rewritten as
D=(K-1HK)(K-1HK)T-I3×3, (16)
This is the function of homography matrix H of only K and recovery.Owing to directly H can be estimated from images match, retrain Tr (DDT)=0 provides the non-linear least square problem in unknown fx and fy.System by minimizing Tr (DD in the space of fx and fyT) minimum solve fx and fy: from (fx, fy) a certain initial value starts, then the trust region method using similar Levenberg-Marquardt calculates (Δ fx, Δ fy) forward iteratively, until it converges on acceptable minima.
System can be answered matrix H by checklist and select remainder to estimate camera internal parameter, automatically abandons the image sequence part rotating deficiency with zoom or camera.
Image selects, mates in pairs and bundle adjustment
For calculating reason, system can first pass through and consider that the quantity of feature, the quality of each frame and the amount of time motion only select several notable frames from each video sequence, reduces the quantity of the frame of input reconstruct.Once system have selected image for reconstruct, it just can from each image zooming-out SIFT feature and use these features to mate paired image.In one embodiment, system can use the coupling by Lowe threshold value to obtain initial matching collection.In order to remove incorrect coupling, system can by only selecting the coupling that its ratio is consistent with the ratio of other coupling of major part and misorientation out-phase with orientation difference to carry out this coupling of further refine.This can be completed by the 2D rectangular histogram being distributed into by initial matching collection across the ratio mated and orientation difference.Systematic selection comprises up to the coupling as final refine of the coupling in the subpackage of the coupling of quantity.
Then, system can use coupling that each pair of image is calculated two visual angle models, i.e. point in basis matrix and f.System can use the focus information of image calculated above to calculate these two visual angles models.Once we have had two visual angle models, two visual angle models just can be added together and carry out bundle adjustment by system iteratively, thus obtaining comprising the final 3D model of all cameras.
For static 3D map, the final 3D position of camera is taken as the Median Position on the position of all reconstruct of this video sequence by system.Can use the 3D model at the interface that the 3D point cloud of reconstruct derives based on 3D map, or alternatively, it is possible to manually the 3D map that the 3D camera attitude of reconstruct creates with the artist of this environment is directed at.
Input video from consumer's camera often suffers from quality problems.Before utilizing video flowing, system can apply color correction alternatively between video, reduces shake by motion stabilization, reduces noise artifacts by denoising.Audio level between editing also can be normalized to common level.
System can use energy minimization to identify when Switch Video.Except common quality and conversion clue, we can item it can be considered that the 3D position of camera and viewpoint.Using position and viewpoint, if switched up in consistent side, then conversion can carry out more continuously.
After solving optimization, editor's video of combination can be created.Alternatively, playback engine receives the list of in-edit, as the instruction time that should be switched of video to sequence.So, user viewing can direct editing version while playback engine uses this edit list to be dynamically updated viewpoint.User also can switch to obtain free view-point effect from director's editing version at any point.
The benefit adopting 3D camera attitude and rough approximation scene geometry has triple: 1) space of video is arranged and can be presented to user to allow interactive viewpoint selection intuitively；2) virtual view in the middle of also can be presented to user；And 3) space arranges and can be used in possible next visual angle of prediction.Interactive multi-view angle player make use of these advantages while other UI element of the vital point presented on instruction timeline.Middle virtual perspective is likely to do not have fidelity as input visual angle, but is of value to and covers intrinsic buffering and delay in video switching.
UI element
Fig. 6 A and Fig. 6 B is two diagrams being likely to the example presented at the video playback interface, interactive multi-view angle illustrating some implementations according to the disclosure.3D interactive mode visual angle in Fig. 6 A is shown in the video attitude of reconstruct to have the 3D template model corresponding with event of icon/widget.These icons also illustrate that currently playing camera and can use (or in scope) in which viewpoint of current playback time.User can spatially browse video scene by click on the desired camera view on map.
Owing to also not all video all starts in the identical time or terminates, so videodensity bar can show have preset time how many videos can use (referring to Fig. 6 B) to be shown in together along with the normal bar that drags.Alternatively, it is possible to use popular bright spot bar to indicate the bright spot of event.This bright spot bar is similar to the bright spot bar that can be used for single video playback.Can manually manage this bright spot bar, or this bright spot bar can use from the clue of social media or accept from the mutual feedback of login user.When various visual angles, useful clue be any given time can both quality and quantities of video.It addition, user can also act as the clue of the density driving bright spot bar from the reset number of times in a moment of different points of view.
In order to ensure good interactive experience, interface can present the bumpless transfer between viewpoint when user asks.Unexpected discontinuous in the playback caused owing to answering handover request again to cushion is minimized.
Instant switching or time between video viewpoint search and make use of the random access immediately to all video datas.Guaranteeing that this random access will need pre-buffering or download all videos before playback, this may result in the Consumer's Experience of difference.Release the instant constraint searched, all video streamings will be allowed instant viewpoint switch simultaneously, but due to bandwidth constraint, this fluidisation unlikely realizes.These extreme cases, desirable player is replaced only to download the video section that will watch, but as some regions of the necessary pre-buffering video of compromise, in order to guarantee interactive switching.
A solution to the compromise between bandwidth and interactivity is to use back buffer form.The current main video selected is play on foreground, and in order to attempt to ensure that quickly interactive switching, the second back buffer video will fluidize on backstage, and cushion and play.The fluidisation of the video in back buffer can monitor user behavior such as hover above virtual view with prediction will select which video.Alternatively, the history of all users can act as priori to determine next viewpoint most probable, or all videos near material time can be performed some pre-buffering.
Identified will after the video of back buffer, it is possible in back buffer with play this video.Fig. 7 illustrates the timeline of this event, and wherein tp indicates the time made prediction, taThe time of instruction user's actual selection viewpoint, and tsIt it is the time of the switching that system is complete in new video.At tpIn the moment, back buffer video player must obtain enough video datas to start playback (buffer time).There is also the data completely available fine delay starting player afterwards.If being complete in startup occurs user to select time t afterwardsa, then the video of back buffer can be shifted to foreground simply.
Fig. 7 illustrates two examples of prediction and buffer timeline.At time tp place, system prediction user will be switched to video 2 soon, and therefore video 2 is buffered on backstage and starts playback.Then user switches in time ta place's actual request, and we allow for the delay animation of the length ts-ta of buffering/playback with ready subsequently.When prediction correct (left side), this postpones animation can be shorter.If video is buffered (the right), it is only necessary to enough cover the delay of playback startup time.
But, in order to guarantee consistent experience when or video data incorrect at video estimation do not complete and cushion, system uses more than the animation of startup time and postpones ts-ta.This animation postpones at least cover until the video of back buffer gets out the time of playback.So, user still is able to the main video that viewing is current, until the secondary visual angle of back buffer can be used.It addition, when back buffer video is play on backstage, before the video of back buffer is shifted to foreground, animation postpones to allow the final synchronization of playback duration.
Current video fluidization technique can be utilized to realize above strategy.If the new standard of the video streaming of such as MPEG-DASH allow also to bandwidth can; carry out seamless instant quality and change ().Using MPEG-DASH, above buffering scheme can use low quality video in back buffer, so that it is guaranteed that lower bandwidth, and therefore cause the buffer time faster of back buffer.After video is taken to foreground, can automatically improve quality according to available bandwidth.Similarly, scalable video (SVC) method can be used to derive the strategy based on effectiveness, in order to if bandwidth can; send the data from visual angle, backstage.Such as, the such strategy of definable: attempt and preferably have some low quality video from all viewpoints, thus allowing quickly to switch and reuse the view data of display on the thumbnail of 3D ground angle of field.
Transition animation
The fine delay covering that above-mentioned buffering strategy depends on after user selects new video prepares background video to carry out the time delay played back.In order to make playback conversion seem reaction sensitiveer, can during this conversion time on video superposition animation or effect.
One such effect is simulated the pan of the thumbnail that the video from the mutual element of user to current main video selects by being, is scanned and fade out.If it is available, the 3D information recovered from the computer vision assembly of system can be used in simulation free view-point switching.Such conversion also gives user better environment space sense, shuttles back and forth because rendering the 3D looking like scene.Such transformation can only use rough approximation scene geometry and being mapped to the texture of projection by currently playing video texture to render in scene.In one implementation, this can be referred to as free view-point and renders.Single input picture and the rough scene geometry visual angle to synthesize near zone can be used.Upper and lower diagram illustrates the texture being just projected in scene.
Other conversion effect can also include slow motion or replay mode, and wherein when video switches, the time is refunded so that user can watch same event from different viewpoints.Refunding time point can use the information from videodensity bar dynamically to refund a little automatically to identify.
Above description presents the content generated according to user and realizes holonomic system and the method that multi-angle video plays back.This system focuses on extraction, utilizes and presents all available information, including video time started and 3D camera position.By doing so it is possible, system achieves various visual angles viewing experience intuitively, wherein by considering that user is visually guided the point of interest to time and space by available video quality clue, 3D attitude information and user interaction history.These identical clues are also used to the predictability back buffer strategy during playback, ensure that interactivity while this bandwidth constraint in reducing Internet protocol transmission.
