- user profile component 440 may present, to the user, an option to specify what criteria to use to rank friends, and/or an option to let the user rank the friends manually.
- Friends stored in friends list field 630 may be ranked based on information obtained about the user's interaction with the friends. For example, a user may send messages to, or comment on documents associated with, a first friend more than a second friend.
- friends list field 630 When using friends list field 630 to score comments based on subjective parameters associated with the user, a comment by the first friend may be scored higher than a comment by the second friend.
- Preferred authors field 640 may include a list of authors that have been identified as authors for whose content the user has expressed a preference. Different users may have preferences for different authors. The preferred authors may differ from friends in that friends might be other users that the user personally knows or with whom the user communicates, while preferred authors might be other users that the user does not know, but whose content the user has liked in the past.
- preferred authors field 640 may include user identification information of the authors, such as user identification information from user identification field 610 of the user profile of the authors.
- preferred authors field 640 may include a pointer to the user profile of the author. If a particular author does not have a user profile, other identification information may be included.
- a list of preferred authors 640 may be provided, at least in part, explicitly by the user.
- other methods may be executed to identify preferred authors of the user, such as by analyzing documents that the user accesses, or by analyzing comments that the user has rated.
- preferred authors field 640 may include information regarding authors that the user does not like and from whom the user would not like to see comments. For example, the user might find a particular author offensive or boring.
- Authors that the user does not like may be stored in preferred authors field 640 along with an indication not to include comments from these authors when presenting comments to the user.
- Preferred authors of the user may be identified based on documents accessed by the user.
- a comments toolbar installed in a browser may, with the user's permission, gather information about documents that the user has accessed and send the information to user profile component 440.
- a user may access documents written or created by one or more particular authors. As an example, a user may regularly visit a blog written by a particular author. As another example, a user may access online books written by a particular author. As yet another example, a user may download images created by a particular author.
- Authors identified based on accessed documents may be stored in preferred authors field 640 of the user's profile by user profile component 440. Whether to store an identified author based on accessed documents in preferred authors field may depend on a combination of at least one of the following factors: 1) how many times the user has accessed documents associated with the identified author; 2) how many different documents associated with the author the user has accessed; 3) the period of time over which the user has accessed the documents accessed; and/or 4) how much time has passed since the last time the user has accessed a document associated with the author. Each of the four factors may have an associated threshold. A combination of the associated thresholds may be used to determine whether to store an identified author in preferred authors field 640.
- Preferred authors may be identified based on comments that a user has rated.
- a comment that is presented to users may be provided along with an option to rate the comment.
- a comments toolbar installed in a browser may, with the user's permission, gather information about comments that the user has rated and send the information to user profile component 440. Consequently, information regarding authors based on rated comments may be stored in preferred authors field 640 of a user's profile by user profile component 440.
- Whether to store information about an author based on rated comments may, for example, be based on a number of comments created by that author that the user has rated. For example, if a user highly rates comments created by a particular author a threshold number of times, it may indicate that the user values the author's opinions.
- Authors identified as preferred authors may be scored in various ways.
- user profile component 440 may score authors automatically based on predetermined rules and rank the authors based on the scores.
- user profile component 440 may present to the user an option to specify what criteria to use to rank authors, and/or an option to let the user rank the authors manually.
- the score which is used to rank a particular author, may depend on the extent to which a user prefers the author. For example, a first author whose blog the user reads every day may be ranked higher than a second author whose blog the user read once a week. As another example, a first author whose comments the user has always rated highly may be ranked higher than a second author whose comments the user has rated highly only some of the time. Authors identified by rated comments may be ranked higher than authors identified based on accessed documents. Users may prefer to see comments by authors whose comments they have rated highly before seeing comments by authors whose contents they like to read.
- Information regarding the identified authors, including the associated scores of the authors, may be stored in preferred authors field 640 of the user's profile.
- User profile component 440 may identify hundreds of authors.
- preferred authors field 640 may only store information about a predetermined number of authors. For example, only information about authors with the ten highest scores may be stored. In another implementation, information about all authors identified as preferred authors may be stored.
- Location field 650 may include information about a geographic location of the user.
- a user may provide a geographic location when creating a user profile. For example, a user may provide a street address, a city, a state, a zip code, a country, or any combination thereof.
- Location field 650 may store the information as provided by the user, or the information may be converted to a code, such as a longitude and latitude code, or a triangular mesh grid code. In another implementation, geographic location of the user may be determined based on an IP address associated with a client 210 of the user. Location field 650 may also include the IP address information.
- Interests field 660 may include information about the interests of the user.
- the information about the interests may be in the form of keywords.
- the information about the interests may also be in the form of category codes for a particular category classification scheme.
- the user may provide the information about the user's interests when creating the user profile.
- the information about the user's interests may be determined based on documents that the user has accessed. For example, documents that the user has accessed may be analyzed, with the user's permission, for topics by searching for noun phrases or noting any tags associated with the documents.
- Search history field 670 may include information about recent search queries that the user has submitted. In a particular implementation, the user may be presented with the option of not recording the user's search queries. In one implementation, search history field 670 may include search queries entered by the user. In another implementation, search history field 670 may include keywords based on analyzing a series of search queries submitted by the user. For example, assume the user has entered the following search queries: "find cheap airline tickets,” “luggage”, and "hotel reviews.” Based on the entered search queries, search history field 670 may store a "travel" keyword.
- User profile database 430 may additionally store other information. For example, a user profile for a particular user may store a list of comments that the user has rated, along with a rating that the particular user has given to a particular comment. In one implementation, comments that the user has rated may be identified based on comment identifier field 505 of the comment. In another implementation, user profile database 430 may store pointers to records of comments stored in comments database 150 for comments that the user has rated, along with a rating that the user has given to each particular comment.
- Figs. 7 and 8 depict flowcharts of exemplary processes described herein.
- the processes of Figs. 7 and 8 may be performed by one or more components within server 220, client 210, or a combination of server 220 and client 210.
- the process may be performed by one or more components within another device or a group of devices separate from or including server 220 and/or client 210.
- One or more blocks of Figs. 7 and 8 may be performed by one or more processors associated with comments server 140.
- Fig. 7 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for providing ranked comments to a user in connection with presentation of a document.
- the process of Fig. 7 may begin with receiving a request for comments about a document (block 710).
- the request may be received in response to a specific user action. For example, the user may click on a button labeled "comments" on a toolbar installed in the browser.
- the request may be sent automatically in connection with a request for the document. For example, the user may click on a link to the document or enter an address in an address box of a browser.
- searching component 410 may perform a search for comments associated with the particular document (block 720). For example, searching component 410 may search comments database 150 for comments about the particular document. Comments that match the particular document may be identified. For example, comment records that have a URL in document identifier field 540 matching the URL of the particular document may be identified.
- Ranking component 420 may rank the identified comments (block 730).
- the ranked comments may be provided in connection with presentation of the particular document (block 740). For example, the ranked comments may be provided for display in a same window with the document. Alternatively, the ranked comments could be presented in a new window, in a frame, or in some other manner.
- Fig. 8 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for ranking comments.
- the process of Fig. 8 may begin with scoring comments based on objective parameters (block 810).
- objective ranking component 422 may score the comments using objective parameters.
- Objective parameters may include parameters with values that are independent of a particular user.
- Fig. 9 is a diagram of an exemplary function for scoring a comment based on objective parameters.
- Objective parameters may include a measure of relevance 910 of a comment, a linking structure 920 of a comment, author reputation 930 of a comment, ratings score 940 for a comment, timestamp 950 of a comment, length 960 of a comment, and spelling and grammar score 970 of a comment.
- Objective ranking function 900 may take, as input, values for any number of the parameters indicated on Fig. 9. In particular implementations, any of the parameters may be omitted as an input to objective score function 900, and/or additional parameters not depicted may be added as inputs.
- Objective score function 900 may, for a particular comment, take, as input, values for the depicted parameters and compute objective score 560 for the particular comment.
- An input parameter to objective score function 900 may include a measure of relevance 910 of a comment to the document.
- the relevance of a comment may indicate how closely terms in the content of the comment correspond to terms in the content of the document to which the comment corresponds. For example, a document may describe how to choose a reliable car, and may include the terms "reliable car.”
- a comment which includes the terms "reliable car” may have a high measure of relevance to the document.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on relevance may include providing comments to a user that specifically relate to the content of the document with which the comment is associated..
- An input parameter to objective score function 900 may include a linking structure 920 of a comment. Users may have an option to include hyperlinks in comments. These hyperlinks may link to other comments.
- Linking structure may refer to how many other comments or documents link to a particular comment.
- a document may be a web page describing a product.
- a user may create a comment that reviews the product, and other users may find the comment to be particularly detailed or insightful.
- Many other users, when creating comments about the product may refer to that comment and include a link to the comment.
- many other users may disagree with a comment about the product and include a link to the comment for reference.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on linking structure may include providing an important comment to a user, where the comment is considered important because the comment was referenced by many other users.
- An input parameter to objective score function 900 may include author reputation 930 of an author of a comment.
- Author reputation may refer to an author that has many visitors to a document that the author has created. For example, an author may have a blog that receives many hits.
- Author reputation may also refer to how the author's comments are rated. For example, many users may give a particular author's comments a favorable rating.
- Each author may have an author reputation score.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on author reputation may include providing a comment to a user that was written by a highly regarded author.
- an author's comments may consistently get low ratings from users, and the author may have a low author reputation score. In that case, scoring comments based on author reputation may include the benefit of omitting comments from poorly regarded authors when providing comments to a user.
- An input parameter to objective score function 900 may include ratings score 940 for a comment. Ratings score 940 may correspond to a value stored in comment rating field 550. Ratings score 940 may refer to an average rating for the comment. In one implementation, users may rate a comment on a two point scale. A two point scale may include a positive rating and a negative rating. In another implementation, users may rate a comment on a multiple point scale, such as a five point scale. A five point scale may include five points, with one point indicating a very low rating and five points indicating a very high rating. A benefit of scoring comments based on user ratings may include providing a comment to a user that has been highly rated by many users. Such a comment may include valuable content.
- Ratings score 940 may include a weight based on how many users the user ratings score is based. For example, in the five point scale implementation, a rating with an average of four points, based on five user ratings, may be scored lower than a rating with an average of three points, based on twenty user ratings.
- An input parameter to objective score function 900 may include timestamp 950.
- a comment may include a timestamp that records a time and/or a date at which the comment was created. More recent comments may be rated higher than less recent comments. By scoring comments based on a timestamp, comments that are more recent (e.g. fresher) may be presented over less recent (e.g. stale) comments.
- An input parameter to objective score function 900 may include length 960.
- Comments may be of various lengths.
- a comment of greater length may be scored higher than a comment of lesser length.
- comments with a length greater than a particular threshold may receive a boost in score.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on length may include providing to a user a long comment that includes more content. For example, a comment that explains in detail an author's opinion of a document may be more valuable than a comment that only includes the content "I like this document.”
- comments that are too long may be penalized. Users may not want to see comments that are excessively long. Therefore, comments that are longer than a particular length may receive a lower score.
- comments that have a length that falls within a particular range may receive a boost in score. For example, comments that have a word (or character) count greater than a first threshold, but less than a second threshold, may be ranked higher than comments that are either shorter or longer than the particular range.
- An input parameter to objective ranking function 1000 may include spelling and grammar score 1070 of a comment.
- comments with bad spelling and grammar may be assigned a low spelling and grammar score and comments with few spelling and grammar mistakes may be assigned a high spelling and grammar score.
- Comments with few spelling and grammar mistakes may include more reliable content.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on spelling and grammar may include providing to a user comments that are easier to read and include more reliable content. Spelling and grammar score may additionally be based on proper capitalization. For example, a comment written in all capitals may have a lowered spelling and grammar score.
- inputs to objective score function 900 may include weights and objective score 560 may be based on a weighted average. For example, each input value may be multiplied by the associated weight, and the weighted values may be added and divided by the number of inputs.
- the objective parameters used as inputs for objective score function 900 may have different scales, and therefore the values may be normalized before the values are combined. In another implementation, particular inputs may provide a boost to the objective ranking score.
- the inputs to objective score function 900 may be combined in any number of ways to compute objective score 560.
- objective score 560 for a comment may be computed when the comment is created, and may be updated periodically. For example, if a user rates the comment favorably, the objective score 560 of the comment may be increased accordingly. As another example, if a particular time period elapses since the creation of the comment, indicating that the comment is not a recent comment, the objective score 560 may be lowered. In another implementation, objective score 560 may be computed at a time when the comment is identified as matching a request for comments from a user. [0086] Returning to Fig. 8, ranking component 420 may determine whether the user can be identified (block 820). For example, a user may be identified with an existing user profile through a login process.
- a user may create a new user profile and may be identified through the user profile creation process.
- a user may be identified based on an IP address, a cookie file, or by receiving information from a server associated with a third party. If the user is not identified (block 820 - no), ranking component 420 may rank the comments using objective score 560 (block 825). In other words, if the user is not identified, the comments may be ranked based on objective parameters and no subjective parameters.
- ranking component may retrieve a user profile associated with the user (block 830). For example, comments server 140 may retrieve the user profile from user profile database 430. Subjective ranking component 424 may score the comments using subjective parameters (block 860). Subjective parameters may include parameters with values that depend on a particular user. The subjective parameters may be based on information from the retrieved user profile.
- Fig. 10 is a diagram of an exemplary function for scoring a comment based on subjective parameters associated with a particular user.
- Subjective score function 1000 may take, as input, values for any number of the parameters indicated on Fig. 10. In particular implementations, any of the parameters may be omitted as an input to subjective ranking function 1000, and additional parameters not depicted may be added as inputs.
- Subjective score function 1000 may, for a particular comment, take, as input, values for the depicted parameters and compute subjective ranking score 1090 for the particular comment.
- Inputs to subjective score function 1000 may include an indication 1010 that the user is the author of the comment, an indication 1020 that the user has rated the comment, a language 1030 of the comment, an indication 1040 that the author of the comment is a friend of the user, an indication 1050 that the author of the comment is a preferred author of the user, an indication 1060 that content of the comment is related to an interest of the user, a location 1070 associated with the comment, and an indication 1080 that content of a comment is related to search history of the user.
- An input parameter to subjective score function 1000 may include an indication 1010 that the user is the author of the comment. Users may prefer to see their own comments.
- author field 510 in comments database 150 that is associated with the comment may be matched with user identification field 610 of the particular user's profile.
- any comments made by a user for a particular document may be ranked higher than comments made by other users for the particular document when presenting comments about the particular document to the user.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on whether the user is the author of the comment, when providing comments to the user, may include letting a user see comments that the user made about the document.
- An input parameter to subjective score function 1000 may include an indication 1020 that the user has rated the comment.
- a user may prefer to see comments based on ratings that the user has previously given to the comments. For example, if the user rated the comment highly, the comment may receive a higher subjective score and therefore a boost in rank. If the user gave the comment a low rating, the comment may receive a lower subjective score and, consequently, the comment's rank may be demoted.
- User profiles may include information about which comments the user has rated. For example, user profiles stored in user profile database 430 may store a list of comments that the user has rated, along with a rating that the user has given to each particular comment.
- comment identifier 505 in comments database 150 that is associated with the comment may be matched with a list of comments that the user has rated stored in user profile database 430.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on whether a user has rated the comment, when providing comments to the user may include providing to the user comments that the user has liked in the past and omitting comments that the user has not liked in the past.
- An input parameter to subjective score function 1000 may include language 1030 of the comment.
- a language of a comment may be identified by analyzing the content of the comment.
- comments database 150 may store an indication of a language in which a particular comment is written.
- the language that is associated with the comment may be matched with an entry stored in language field 620 of the particular user's profile. For example, comments in a language that is not included in language field 620 of the user's profile may be given a lower subjective score and therefore demoted in rank or altogether omitted when providing comments to the user.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on the language of the comment, when providing comments to the user may include omitting comments that the user may not be able to read.
- An input parameter to subjective score function 1000 may include an indication 1040 that the author of a comment is a friend of the user.
- a friend of the user may be another user that the user personally knows or communicates with.
- a list of friends of the user may be stored in friends list field 630 of the user's profile.
- author field 510 in comments database 150 that is associated with the comment may be matched with an entry in friends list field 630 of the particular user's profile. If the author of a comment is a friend of the particular user, the comment may receive a boost in rank. Friends stored in friends list field 630 may be ranked based on information obtained about the user's interaction with the friends.
- a user may send messages to, or comment on documents associated with, a first friend more than a second friend. This may be an indication that the first friend is more important than the second friend and, consequently, the first friend may be ranked higher than the second friend in friends list field 630.
- friends list field 630 to score comments based on subjective parameters associated with the user, a comment by the first friend may be scored higher than a comment by the second friend.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on whether the author of a comment is a friend of the user, when providing comments to the user may include providing comments to the user authored by people the user personally knows and whose opinion the user may value higher than the opinion of other people.
- An input parameter to subjective score function 1000 may include an indication 1050 that the author of a comment is a preferred author of the user.
- a user may have preferred authors that have been identified as authors whose content the user likes to read.
- a list of a user's preferred authors may be stored in preferred authors list field 640 of the user's profile.
- author field 510 in comments database 150 that is associated with the comment may be matched with an entry in preferred authors list field 640 of the particular user's profile.
- the comment may receive a boost in score.
- the boost in score may be in relation to the score of the author in the list of preferred authors included in preferred author list field 640.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on a user's preferred authors, when providing comments to the user may include providing comments to the user created by people whose content the user has liked in the past.
- an author of a comment may share similar interests with the user, and users may want to see comments made by authors with similar interests. Such an author may not be stored in preferred authors field 640 of the user's profile.
- An author's user profile may include interests field 660 with entries that match entries in interests field 660 of the user's profile.
- a comment made by an author with similar interests to the user may receive a boost in the subjective score when presenting comments to the user.
- An input parameter to subjective scoring function 1000 may include an indication 1060 that the content of a comment is related to an interest of the user.
- a comment may include a tag that indicates a topic associated with the comment. Topics that have been identified as topics in which the user has expressed an interest may be stored in interests field 660 of the user's profile. The tag of the comment may be matched with an entry in interests field 660 of the user's profile.
- a topic associated with a comment may also be determined by searching the content of the comment for noun phrases. If a topic associated with a comment matches an entry in interests field 660 of the user's profile, the comment may receive a boost in rank.
- entries in interests field 660 may be ranked and the boost in rank may be based on a rank of the particular interest, as recorded in interests field 660, which matches a topic associated with the comment.
- a benefit of scoring comments based on a user's interests, when providing comments to the user, may include providing comments whose content is of interest to the user.
- An input parameter to subjective score function 1000 may include a location 1070 associated with a comment.
- a comment may have a location associated with it.
- a location may be associated with a comment based on a location associated with the author of a comment.
- a location may be associated with a comment based on content of the comment.
- a comment may include terms with geographic relevance, such as the name of a geographic area.
- a location may be associated with the document with which the comment is associated.
- a document may be a document about a local business (even though the content of the document may not include geographically relevant terms), and the comment may likely be related to the local business.

- a comments toolbar installed in the browser of the client device may include an option to enter keywords when a user requests comments for a document.
- a user may be looking at a document about a particular model of digital camera. The user may request comments about the document and enter the keyword "night," because the user may be interested in night photography. Comments that include the keyword "night” may include opinions by other users about how the particular model of digital camera performs at night and may be ranked higher than other comments when providing the comments to the user.
- inputs to subjective score function 1000 may include weights and subjective score 1090 may be based on a weighted average. For example, each input value may be multiplied by the associated weight, and the weighted values may be added and divided by the number of inputs.

- the ranked comments may be provided in a new window, a frame, or in some other manner.
- the number of ranked comments that are presented to the user may depend on a particular threshold.
- the particular threshold may be selected by the user. For example, a user may select that maximum often comments be provided. In another
- the number of ranked comments may depend on a threshold combined score. For example, only comments with a combined score above a particular threshold value may be provided. In yet another implementation, all comments that were identified by searching component 410 may be provided to the user.
- FIG. 12 is a diagram of exemplary information that may be presented within a browser.
- a user may be provided with browser window 1200.
- Browser window 1200 may include document window 1210, toolbar 1220, and comments window 1250.
- Browser window 1200 may include a document window 1210.
- Document window 1210 may display the contents of a document that the user has accessed.
- Browser window 1200 may include a toolbar 1220, such as a Google toolbar.
- Toolbar 1220 may include comments button 1230 for requesting comments about the displayed document.
- Button 1230 may include an indication of how many comments are available for the displayed document. When a user clicks on comments button 1230, comments associated with the document displayed in document window 1210 may be displayed in comments window 1250.
- Button 1230 may be configured to make comments window 1250 alternately appear and disappear with each click.
- Fig. 13 is a diagram of a close-up view of comments window 1250.
- Comments window 1250 may include number of comments indication 1310, "next" button 1320, "add comment” button 1330, and one or more comments 1340, 1350, 1360, and 1370.
- Number of comments indication 1310 may display how many comments are available for the document.
- "Next" button 1320 may provide a function for scrolling down to the next page of comments when a user clicks on "next" button 1320.
- "Add comments” button 1330 may allow a user to add a comment to the document. For example, when a user clicks on "add comment” button 1330, a new window may appear, allowing a user to enter text and other information to create a new comment.
- An individual comment may include author and date information 1341, comment content 1342, "more” button 1343, topic tags 1344, rating option 1345, and rating indication 1346.
- a comment may also include a friend indication 1362.
- Author and date information 1341 may display information about the author of the comment and the date and/or time on which the comment was created. The author may indicate a name of the author who created the comment.
- Comment content 1342 may include text, images, audio clips, hyperlinks, or other type of content that the author added to the comment. Only a portion of comment content 1342 may be visible in comments window 1250 so that other comments may be displayed at the same time.
- An individual comment may include "more” button 1343. When a user clicks on "more” button 1343, the window of the individual comment may expand downward and display the full contents of the individual comments.
- An individual comment may include tags 1344 that indicate topics associated with the comment.
- Tags 1344 may be clickable. When a user clicks on a tag, comments that are displayed in comments window 1250 may be changed to comments that include the tag that was clicked. In the example of Fig. 13, if a user clicks on the "route finding" tag of comment 1340, comments that are displayed below comment 1340 may be changed to comments that include a "route finding" tag. This may allow a user to see comments associated with a particular topic.
- An individual comment may include rating option 1345 to provide a rating for the comment. In this example, the rating is a five scale rating. By clicking on a particular star, the user may indicate what rating the user is giving for the comment. Rating indication 1346 may indicate how many users found the comment useful. In this example, a user may be considered to have found a comment useful if the user gave the comment a favorable rating (e.g., 3 or more stars).
- Comments presented in comment window 1250 may be presented in order of ranking based on combined score 1 110 of each comment. Comment 1360 may be ranked higher than comment 1370, comment 1350 may be ranked higher than comment 1360, and comment 1340 may be ranked higher than comment 1350. Therefore, the highest ranked comment may be displayed on top in the most prominent position.
- document in document window 1210 of Fig. 12 is a document about a climbing route.
- Four comments are displayed in comments window 1250. Comment 1340 is displayed first. Comment 1340 may have the highest final ranking, because many users have ranked the comment highly. Comment 1350 may have the second highest rank, because the comment was created (or modified) by the particular user that is accessing the document.
- Comment 1360 may be ranked third, because the comment was made by a friend of the user. If a comment is made by a friend of the user, friend indication 1362 may be provided under the name of the author of the comment. Comment 1360 may be ranked fourth, because the comment includes the term "rope," and the user has recently entered a search query that included the term "rope.”
- the size of the individual comments that are displayed in comments window 1250 may be adjustable by dragging, with a pointing device such as a mouse or a stylus, a line that separates two comments.
- Implementations, described herein, may provide ranked comments to a particular user in connection with presentation of a document.
- the comments may be ranked based on objective parameters, independent of the particular user, where the objective parameters may be used to determine a quality of the comment.
- the comments may additionally be ranked based on subjective parameters, which depend on the particular user, where the subjective parameters may be used to determine a measure of relevance of a comment to the particular user.
- logic that performs one or more functions.
- logic may include hardware, such as a processor, an ASIC, or a FPGA, or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., software running on a general purpose processor).
- ranking scores are generated for comments and authors.
