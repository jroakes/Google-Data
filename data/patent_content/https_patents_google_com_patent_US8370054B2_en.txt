Definitions
- the present invention relates in general to tracking and management of service vehicles and, in particular, to the formation of databases of location information of service vehicles and the automated provisioning of this information to remote end users.
- Fleet tracking systems for service vehicle fleets have been under development for many years in various forms. Many different types of services use fleet tracking systems, including vehicle for hire services that transport persons, such as taxi, limousine, bus, and shuttle companies, delivery companies that transport goods such as local and long haul delivery companies, and business service companies (plumbers, utilities, exterminators, etc.).
- Fleet tracking serves a variety of functions including but not limited to basic vehicle tracking, geo-fencing, time card tracking and speed limit compliance.
- the fleet tracking service In order to be used for this system, the fleet tracking service must perform the basic function of locating the position of vehicles in the fleet. This can be done through a variety of technologies but is most often achieved through the use of GPS tracking devices installed in the vehicles. The geographic position and sometimes additional information (e.g., speed, heading) is relayed from the vehicles to a central location using some form of wireless communications channel.
- One limitation of existing fleet tracking systems is that are intended to track the vehicles only in one or more specifically designated fleets, such as the taxis of a particular taxi company (or group of companies) or the trucks of a particular utility company, and thereby do not track the vehicles in other fleets.
- a second limitation is that the location information is only provided to an internal employee of the fleet company or dispatch agency, and is not exposed to end users, such as persons needing a vehicle for hire for a pick up, or a person needing to know the location of a nearby delivery vehicle. In particular, end users cannot query a private company's fleet tracking system to obtain information about nearby service vehicles.
- Vehicle dispatching of service vehicles is performed a variety of ways. In some cases, specific routes are determined prior to a vehicle leaving the dispatch center. In others, the vehicle is routed in an “on demand” fashion. Hybrid systems can have aspects of both types of approaches. “For hire” vehicles use all of these dispatch methods. For example, a limousine in a limousine service may be given a known set of customers for pickup and set of routes at the start of a day. By contrast, a taxi is typically dispatched on demand as end users call in to the dispatch agent. A shuttle may have a predetermined set of routes, followed by a period of on demand scheduling. The same variety of dispatch methods exists for delivery vehicles (e.g., package pick up or drop off) and other business service vehicles (e.g., utility service, electrical service, plumbing service, towing service).
- delivery vehicles e.g., package pick up or drop off
- other business service vehicles e.g., utility service, electrical service, plumbing service, towing service.
- a vehicle position aggregation system integrates multiple sources of real time or near real time vehicle position data for service vehicles into a unified database.
- the vehicle position database includes information to identify the service vehicles, their position and can include the time of a given service vehicle's position.
- the vehicle position aggregation system aggregates information from a plurality of different service companies, including companies that offer competitive services, such as multiple taxis companies, delivery companies, business service companies and so forth.
- the present invention includes various functional capabilities provided by the vehicle position aggregation system.
- One function of the vehicle position aggregation system is to provide vehicle position and related information to end users in response to queries from such users.
- a user can input a location to the vehicle position aggregation system, and obtain the locations of nearby vehicles for hire, such as taxis.
- the user provides the desired location (either manually or automatically), and the vehicle position aggregation system determines which of the vehicles for hire are nearby that location, and available for usage.
- the user can limit the search query with respect to various attributes of the vehicles for hire, such as company, type, fare, and so forth.
- Related information for the vehicle for hire service such as telephone number, is likewise provided.
- the vehicle location information and related information is displayed to the user on the user's particular device, whether that is a personal computer, cellular telephone, palm top computer, or otherwise.
- the preferred display representation includes a map display of the area surrounding the user's input location, and icons representing the locations of the nearby vehicles for hire.
- the vehicle position database stores vehicle information such as fleet identification, vehicle identification and vehicle status. Vehicle status may include availability, job status and/or time to availability. Vehicle position information is preferably stored as latitude and longitude but other forms of position information may be used as well.
- FIG. 1 is an overall system diagram of an embodiment of the vehicle position aggregation system.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of a vehicle position display provided by the system for display on a computer screen.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of a vehicle position display provided by the system for display on a cellular telephone.
- FIG. 1 there is shown system diagram illustrating an overall system environment for a vehicle position aggregation system.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 operates in conjunction with fleet management systems 110 .
- the fleet management systems 110 will typically include systems from numerous different service companies, and thereby be independent of each other, particularly where there service companies are competitors.
- the fleets can be of different types of service companies, such as towing fleets, taxi fleets, and delivery fleets.
- the fleets can operate in the same, overlapping or different geographic areas.
- a fleet management system 110 may be operated by a dispatch agency and contain information for the vehicles of one or more service companies.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 operates to aggregate the information from a number of disparate and unrelated sources, thereby providing end users with a much larger and richer source of information than would otherwise be available to the end user by directly contacting any one of the underlying businesses operating the service vehicle fleet.
- a fleet management system 110 receives real time or otherwise current location information from a number of service vehicles 112 in one or more fleets of vehicles, for example a fleet of vehicles for hire (e.g., taxis 112 c , limousines 112 b , and the like), a fleet of delivery vehicles 112 a , or a fleet of business service vehicles.
- the location information is typically in the form of GPS data, as acquired by analog or digital location units installed in the fleet vehicles 112 .
- the underlying location technology includes a GPS receiver, and an analog or digital backchannel (for example, private mobile radio, cellular, WiMAX, 802.11p, etc.) for communicating the GPS location information back to the fleet management system 110 .
- the location information is usually augmented by information identifying the vehicle (e.g., a vehicle and/or fleet ID), the data source (e.g., a source ID identifying the fleet management system 110 ), and vehicle status (e.g., availability, job status, time to next availability, time to next delivery, etc.).
- vehicle status e.g., availability, job status, time to next availability, time to next delivery, etc.
- Each fleet management system 110 can report the vehicle data for one or more vehicles at a time.
- the vehicle information can then be passed to the vehicle position aggregation system 100 over a network connection in real time or stored by the fleet management system 110 . If the vehicle information is stored by a fleet management system, the fleet management system 110 can either regularly transmit the vehicle information to the vehicle position aggregation system 100 or the vehicle position aggregation system 100 can regularly pull the vehicle information from the fleet management systems 110 .
- the transfer of data from their sources can be through a variety of methods (e.g., socket connections, FTP, SOAP requests, and the like).
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 exposes an appropriate interface to the fleet management systems 110 to provide these data transfers.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 combines the data received from the fleet management sources in an integrated vehicle position and a fleet attribute database 120 .
- the vehicle position database 120 represents vehicles with the following attributes and data:
- a separate portion of the database 120 (or a separate database) is preferably used to associate the fleet id with fleet attributes.
- This fleet attribute database may include the following data and attributes:
- fleet contact information information that a user might use to contact the service business operating the fleet vehicles, such as a phone number or other additional information that the system could display associated with a particular fleet.
- the database collection and aggregation subsystem 114 receives the vehicle position information from the fleet management systems 110 , parses the information, validates it, and formats for entry into the vehicle position database 120 , and performs the appropriate database calls to update the database.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 may be based on the traffic information system described in the Real Time Traffic Information application, incorporated by reference herein.
- the vehicle position aggregation system receives requests from end users via the presentation and interface generation subsystem 116 . These end user consumers deliver a request from an end user electronic device 130 , such as a notebook computer 130 a , a desktop computer 130 b , a handheld computer 130 c , a cell phone 130 d .
- This request includes some information about the location around which the user would like to display vehicle positions.
- the end user's location information can be input directly by the user in the form of address, city, zip or latitude/longitude or may be obtained from the user's device directly in the case of a device 130 that has the capability to detect and transmit position information, such as a cell phone 130 d with built-in GPS capability.
- the end user's request is sent to the vehicle position aggregation system through a communication means such as the wired or wireless Internet and/or cellular communications.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 receives a user's request via the presentation and interface generation subsystem 116 , queries the database 120 to determine a set of vehicles that satisfy certain parameters of the request, and transmits data describing the result set to the user's device, preferably for display thereon. More specifically, the query can be processed to locate all (or a limited number) of vehicles nearby the user's position. There are a variety of methods for limiting the vehicles delivered to an end user device. The vehicle position aggregation system could limit vehicle positions retrieved to those that would appear in the viewing area of the map chosen by the user or the vehicle position aggregation system (e.g., show all vehicles that appear on the map).
- Another method would be give fleets a geographic region and only display vehicles from fleets where the user request and the fleet geographic region overlap. For example, a user searching for vehicles in the Chicago area would not see vehicles from a Milwaukee fleet even if they happen to be in the Chicago area.
- the end user device may retrieve more positions than can be currently displayed caching those positions in the end user device for display if the user alters the display area.
- the result set can be further constrained or filtered to include only vehicles of particular companies (e.g., only “Yellow Cab”) or of certain types (e.g., limousines), certain business types (e.g., tow trucks, plumbers), or other characteristics (e.g., vehicles for hire serving the local airport), or any combination of these or other constraints.
- the type of service vehicle can have a default type (e.g., taxis) if it is not specified by the user.
- the result set includes each vehicle's location (in sufficient granularity to allow the user's device to determine and graphically display the vehicle on a map), and optionally secondary data, such the name of the company, type of vehicle, fare rate, contact information (e.g., telephone number, or a URL) and other information useful to the user in choosing a vehicle for hire.
- the presentation and interface generation subsystem 116 formats the result set based on the source of the request, the network connection type, or the device type, or any combination thereof.
- the result set is formatted for presentation in standard browser window (see, e.g., FIG. 2 ).
- the result set can be formatted for display on the smaller screens of these types of devices (see, e.g., FIG. 3 ).
- the result set also preferably includes one or more bit maps images of a map in the vicinity of the end user's requested location.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a sample display screen 200 in response to a user's request.
- the request is entered into a query field 202 .
- the result set is transmitted back to the user's device 130 for display; the display includes a map 204 and list of a company names 206 , listing the companies to which the service vehicles (here taxis) belong, along with the contact information the end user can use to contact the vehicle or vehicle dispatcher.
- This information may include a phone number as listed, a web link (here a URL indicated the underlined name of the company) or some other data or voice connection between the end user and the vehicle dispatcher or the vehicle directly.
- the vehicle positions are indicated by icons 208 .
- the vehicle positions displayed will be the most current information available to the vehicle position aggregation system 100 . Using the timestamp information, if available, the vehicle position information displayed can be modified (e.g., only displaying positions that are less than 30 minutes old or showing positions that are older than 30 minutes in a different color or transparency level).
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 can vary the span of the map displayed based on the granularity of the location information given by the user, number of vehicles currently in the database, number of fleets currently in the database 120 and/or the device that has issued the request. For example, if a user provides low granularity information by specifying only a city (e.g., San Jose, Calif.) for a location, then the vehicle position aggregation system 100 retrieves information for service vehicles a in a corresponding area, along with a corresponding map such as illustrated in FIG. 2 . Likewise, if the user specifies high granularity location information, such as a specific address (e.g., 801 N.
- a specific address e.g. 801 N.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 selects service vehicles in a more limited vicinity of the location, along with a corresponding more detailed map, for example the displayed maps may be of only several square blocks around the address.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 could transmit a map spanning a greater area if the number of vehicles or fleets in the user specified location is relatively sparse.
- the vehicle position aggregation system may be set up to ensure that the initial map displayed to the user always had one, two, or some other number of vehicles displayed.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 could adapt the span of the map 204 to better match the capabilities of the end user device 130 , for example, displaying a map 204 with fewer pixels, fewer colors, with more sophisticated overlaying techniques and/or with enhanced compression for devices 130 with smaller screens or less computing power, as illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the vehicle aggregation system 100 receives information in the request from the user that identifies at least some of the capabilities of the end user device 130 . For example, many mobile device browsers transmit information about the device when sending request such as their screen size, model number, browser compatibility, and the like. The vehicle aggregation system 100 can then format the result set displayed to be compatible with the device 130 .
- the vehicle aggregation system 100 may limit the map displayed to the width of the device (e.g., 120, 130, 160, 320 pixels) and color depth (e.g, 16 colors or monochrome).
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 allows the user to interactively vary the span of the map (i.e., zoom) via the zoom controls 210 , and allows the user to pan the area displayed on the map via the directional pan controls 212 .
- Contact information for the dispatchers or vehicles may be arranged in a variety of fashions.
- the information may be displayed directly on the screen, either continuously or only upon some predefined user action such as mouse-over or clicking on the icon 208 for a vehicle.
- the information may be arranged in a tabular format next to a map 204 as well as illustrated in FIG. 2 , or in other layouts.
- the ordering of the different fleets can be done based on a variety of metrics as well—total size of fleet, number of vehicles of each fleet displayed in the current window, most highly ranked in terms of some external measure such as best quality and business arrangement (i.e., pay for placement).
- the ordering of the display of the fleets is performed by the vehicle position aggregation system 100 , but different ordering criteria could be used for different users, and executed by a local client application on the user's device 130 , or by vehicle position aggregation system 100 based on stored account information for the user.
- the factors that could be used to cause different fleet display ordering could include preferences set by a user, device type, geographic location and/or time of day.
- the user is able to directly connect from the displayed result screen to a service business's computer servers and make a request for a pickup, delivery, or like.
- the user can click on the vehicle icon 208 or company name 206 to be linked to the company website to book a vehicle; an interface to the company's reservation system would appear on the user's device 130 in this case.
- the user clicks on the vehicle icon 208 or company name 208 or company phone number the user's device 130 sends a message (e.g., SMS, or via an email protocol) to the company's computer system to book a vehicle.
- a message e.g., SMS, or via an email protocol
- Another approach particularly useful for user's of cell phones 130 d , enables the user to click on the vehicle icon 208 , company name 208 or phone number and initiate a call to the company.
- a fourth approach transmits the user's telephone number to the service company, again via SMS, email or other messaging protocol, in which case the company calls the end user back to confirm the request.
- Each of the foregoing can be adapted to directly contact the driver of one of the service vehicles (or get a return call from a driver), instead of the company's dispatch operations.
- the service company can most efficiently schedule the vehicle to the user's location, even before it contacts the user to confirm the request.
- clicking on the vehicle icon 208 generates a message to the service company's computer system that queries for the scheduled or estimated time until the vehicle arrives; the resulting time information is then transmitted to and displayed on the user's device.
- an alert message can be queued in the service company's computer system to be transmitted to the end user a fixed number of minutes (e.g., five minutes) before the vehicle arrives; the message can be sent by email, SMS, or as a telephone call, using a computer generated voice message.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 provides end users with a number of functional capabilities in addition to locating nearby vehicles for hire, such as nearby taxis and limousines.
- the end user may query the system to see the location of a delivery truck having an item scheduled for delivery to the user's location.
- the user's request would include a unique tracking ID that can be used to identify the user's shipment in the delivery company's database.
- the vehicle position aggregation system 100 can use this information to query the delivery company's own database, and then format the results for presentation to the end user.
- the end user may user the vehicle position aggregation system 100 to determine the location of a previously assigned service employee en route to the user's location, and thereby better determine the employee's likely time of arrival. This capability eliminates the need for the end user to call the service business operations and inquire as to the employee's likely arrival time.
- business service vehicles such as plumbers, exterminators, utilities, or any other service which dispatches employees to a user's location to perform a business service
- the end user may user the vehicle position aggregation system 100 to determine the location of a previously assigned service employee en route to the user's location, and thereby better determine the employee's likely time of arrival. This capability eliminates the need for the end user to call the service business operations and inquire as to the employee's likely arrival time.
