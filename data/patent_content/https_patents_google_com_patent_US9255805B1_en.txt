Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual driving mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous driving mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual driving mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous driving mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself
- autonomous vehicles When operating in an autonomous mode, these vehicles need to be able to accurately estimate their relative geographic location in the world.
- autonomous vehicles typically combine inertial pose estimation systems (e.g., using gyros, accelerometers, wheel encoders, GPS) and map-based localization approaches (e.g. generating a local map using onboard sensors and comparing these to a stored map to estimate where the vehicle is in the stored map).
- map-based localization approaches e.g. generating a local map using onboard sensors and comparing these to a stored map to estimate where the vehicle is in the stored map.
- These approaches may result in noise or uncertainty in both the inertial pose estimation and localization stages that makes it difficult to achieve very high accuracy results.
- these approaches tend to focus on near range information so that a local map can be built up and compared against a stored map or because this is all that the sensor can detect with sufficient density of data points.

- the map information may also include three-dimensional terrain maps incorporating one or more of objects listed above.
- the vehicle may determine that another object, such as a vehicle, is expected to turn based on real-time data (e.g., using its sensors to determine the current GPS position of another vehicle and whether a turn signal is blinking) and other data (e.g., comparing the GPS position with previously-stored lane-specific map data to determine whether the other vehicle is within a turn lane).
- the map information 136 need not be entirely image based (for example, raster).
- the map information may include one or more roadgraphs or graph networks of information such as roads, lanes, intersections, and the connections between these features.

For example, using laser data collected by laser 310 , computer 101 may detect objects within the range of the laser. Computer 110 may use the range and intensity data from the laser to generate the environmental map. In other words, computer 110 may construct a three-dimensional model of the objects detected from the laser data. The locations of the objects in this map may be defined by a coordinate system relative to the autonomous vehicle (or the first sensor).
- FIG. 7 is an example of area 500 in which vehicle 101 is being driven in an autonomous mode along roadway 510 .

- laser 310 may have a range of 80 meters, the farther from the laser 310 , the data points from the laser become less reliable and less dense.
- sensor field 411 has a range of 80 meters for 360 degrees
- computer 110 may utilize a smaller portion of this sensor field in order to have a sufficient amount of data per square meter to generate a useful map.
- computer 110 may receive data points from laser 310 sufficient to generate an environmental map of vehicle 101 's environment accurate to 25 centimeters.
- the area of the environmental map generated by computer 110 may depend upon the accuracy and range of the sensor. In this example, because of the drop off in reliable data points, data points beyond a particular distance, here 50 meters, may be ignored when generating this initial environmental map.
- FIG. 8 is an example 800 of an environmental map 811 generated from laser data collected from laser 310 within sensor field 711 while vehicle 101 is at the location of FIG. 7 .
- This birds-eye view demonstrates that the laser data for a single 360 degree scan covers only locations within the line of sight of the laser 310 . Because of this, laser 310 , while very accurate, cannot “see” behind or around objects without moving past or around them.
- computer 110 receives data for objects 822 and 834 corresponding to only a portion of objects 522 and 534 (shown in FIG. 5 ).
- the autonomous vehicle may compare the environmental map to the stored detailed map information to determine the autonomous vehicle's relative position and heading.
- the locations of the objects in the environmental map may be defined by a coordinate system relative to the autonomous vehicle (or the first sensor) while the locations of the objects and features in the detailed map information may be defined by a different coordinate system.
- the locations of the objects and features in the detailed map information may be defined by latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates.
- the autonomous vehicle may identify the latitude, longitude, and altitude of the objects of the environmental map.
- the autonomous vehicle's latitude, longitude, altitude coordinates and heading may be estimated, for example, by converting the coordinate system relative to the autonomous vehicle (or the first sensor) to latitude and longitude coordinates.
- FIG. 9 is an example 900 of the environmental map 811 as compared to portion 600 of detailed map information 136 .
- computer 110 may use the objects from the environmental map 811 and correlate those objects to objects of the map information with 25 cm accuracy, out to a range of 50 m.
- the detailed map information may include coordinates. Regardless of the number or density of detected features, a pose estimate based on the alignment to the prior map could be off by nearly 1 ⁇ 3 of a degree in yaw. As a result, the location estimation from the first sensor may have a relatively high degree of inaccuracy that is unacceptable for autonomous driving.
- a second sensor such as a laser or camera
- vehicle 101 is also associated with a second laser 311 as well as a camera 330 having ranges of approximately 200 meters for 30 degrees. Both of these sensors have fields of view that extend at least twice as far as the sensor field of laser 310 and at least three times as far as the sensor field 711 used to generate the initial environmental map.
- the sensor data from the second sensor may be used to identify a reference object at a distance significantly farther from the autonomous vehicle than the range of the first sensor.
- this second sensor may have a longer range, but a narrower field of view.
- a laser sensor can often see retroreflective material (such as freeway signs or roadway markers) at a much greater range than it detects non-retroreflective objects.
- the autonomous vehicle's computer could search the laser data for these retroreflective objects at distances well beyond the range of the first sensor.
- the second sensor were a camera
- the computer could search the camera's images for retroreflective objects or bright lights at such distances.
- FIG. 10 is an example 1000 , of data 1010 collected from laser 311 or camera 330 within sensor fields 410 or 430 while vehicle 101 is at the location of FIG. 7 .
- FIG. 10 demonstrates that the data covers only locations within the line of sight of the laser 311 or camera 330 .
- reference objects 1041 , 1042 , 1045 , and 1046 receives data for reference objects 1041 , 1042 , 1045 , and 1046 corresponding to only a portion of objects 541 , 542 , 545 , and 546 (shown in FIG. 5 ).
- Each of reference objects 1041 , 1042 , 1045 , and 1046 having retroreflective, high intensity, or high brightness characteristics.
- the retroreflective, intensity, and brightness characteristics of reference objects 1041 , 1042 , 1045 , and 1046 which makes these objects reference objects is based on the limitations of the second sensor, for example, camera 331 or laser 311 . In other words, whether or not an object is a reference object is dependent upon whether the particular second sensor is able to identify a characteristic of that reference object at longer ranges.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine the location of one or more of these reference objects identified from the sensor data beyond the range and field of view of the first sensor used to generate the environmental map. For example, the location relative to the autonomous vehicle (or the second sensor) may be determined from the laser data points or from two or more images using the location of the camera when the images were captured.
- the one or more identified reference objects may then be correlated to the reference objects of the detailed map information. This correlation may then be used to identify the latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinate of the one or more reference objects. It is important that the object correlate to the detailed map information well, if not, that reference object may be ignored or not used to correct the location and heading of the vehicle. Once the latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates of the identified references objects are determined, the autonomous vehicle's latitude, longitude, altitude coordinates and heading may be corrected.
- the second sensor may provide the location of a reference object relative to the sensor (and implicitly the vehicle). Given this relative information, one can compute the expected location of the object given the location of the vehicle, or the expected location of the vehicle given the location of the object. Since the detailed map information includes the “true” location of the object, and the sensor tells provides the estimated location of the object (given the current estimate of the vehicle's location), the error between the map location and the sense location of the object tells the vehicle's computer how the computer should adjust the vehicle's location.
- references objects may be used. If only a single reference object is used, then the one farthest from the vehicle would be most useful. If only a subset of all detections could be used, then along with the one farthest from the vehicle, there would also be a preference for a difference in bearing to the vehicle.
- FIG. 11 is an example 1100 of sensor data 1010 (from a camera or a laser) as compared to portion 600 of detailed map information 136 .
- computer 110 may identify data for reference objects 1041 , 1042 , 1045 , and 1046 all of which are beyond the range and field of view of laser 310 used to generate the environmental map 811 .
- the computer may correlate data to portions of reference objects 641 , 642 , 645 , and 646 of the portion 600 of detailed map information 136 . The location of each of these reference objects may then be used to correct the initial estimation location and heading.
- the error in the heading estimation discussed above may be reduced to less than 1/10 of a degree.
- the autonomous vehicle's computer can make a much more accurate estimate of what the heading (roll, pitch, yaw) of the autonomous vehicle is as compared to if the sign was only detected at 50 meters.
- the noise in the sign detection from the sensor data may be relatively high at longer ranges
- the noise in the correlation between the sensor data and the detailed map information (which is usually based on the size of the sign rather than the distance) may be much smaller when the sign is farther away than when it is closer.
- the constraint on the autonomous vehicle's heading is much tighter for the 100 meter case than for the 50 meter case.
- the autonomous vehicle's computer can also correct the autonomous vehicle's location.
- FIG. 12 is a flow diagram 1200 of some of the aspects described above.
- the steps of flow diagram 1200 may be performed, for example, by a computer of an autonomous vehicle such as computer 110 of vehicle 101 .
- the computer receives data from a first sensor having a first sensor range at block 1202 .
- this first sensor may be a laser having a 360 degree field of view.
- This received data is used to generate a map of a vehicle's environment at block 1204 .
- the vehicle's location and heading are estimated by comparing the map to a stored map at block 1206 .
- the computer also receives data from a second sensor having a second range greater than the first sensor range at block 1208 .
- This second sensor data is used to identify a reference object having particular retroreflective, brightness, or intensity characteristics located beyond the first sensor range at block 1210 .
- the location of the reference object relative to the autonomous vehicle (or the second sensor) is determined from the data from the second sensor data at block 1212 .
- the determine location of the reference object is correlated to a reference object of the stored map at block 1214 .
- the correlation is then used to correct the estimated location and heading at block 1216 .
- the features described herein would work with one sensor that was only a few meters longer in range than another, though greater correction benefits would be achieved with a greater difference in the ranges.
- the similar approach may be utilize the same physical sensor, but a different sensor processing approach, to create two “virtual” sensors.
- a first processing technique e.g. generating an environmental map
- a second processing technique e.g. identifying reference objects having particular retroreflective, brightness or intensity characteristics
- the first processing technique may be a first virtual sensor
- the second technique may be a second virtual sensors.
- some steps may also be performed in a continuous loop.
- the correlation from the environmental map data to the detailed map information need not be used to determine the vehicle's location from scratch each time. Rather, the results of previous geographic location determinations may also be used as input in order to further refine the position and heading estimates.
- geographic locations described herein are expressed in terms of latitude, longitude, and altitude, other global coordinate systems, such as Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), may also be used.
- UTM Universal Transverse Mercator
- the autonomous vehicle may detect a smaller number of features but get improved accuracy in its location and heading estimation. This is particularly important for systems that rely on very accurate estimates of their location and heading, such as high speed vehicles on roads, advanced driver assistance systems, vehicles that are generating information to be used in mapping, or vehicles that rely on the location and heading estimation to detect important objects using the detailed map information (such as detecting the color of known traffic lights). Because of this, the autonomous vehicle may both get improved location and heading estimation accuracy, but could also reduce the amount of data stored in a map for performing localization.
