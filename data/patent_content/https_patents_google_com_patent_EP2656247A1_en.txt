Definitions
- Various network-based search applications allow users to enter one or more search terms and in response, receive a list of search results .
- These search services may also allow users to conduct "local" searches for information associated with a particular geographic location or area.
- a "local” search or a search with “local” intent may include search terms which provide a geographic context or constraint for a query. For example, a user may use the terms “pizza, Miami” in a map search. The “Miami” gives the query a local context, and accordingly, the user may be provided with search results related to pizza in the area of Miami. Similarly, a user may use the terms “empire state building, New York” in a web search. Again, the terms “New York” give the query a local context .
- These services use numerous different types of ranking algorithms to ensure that the search results are both relevant to the user's query and displayed in a useful way. For example, some systems rank results based on the relevance to the search query as well as the reliability and safety of the search results. These search services may also rank and display search results according to the prominence of an entity or entities associated with the search result. For example if a user searches for "coffee house Seattle", the search application may also display a list of prominent (or well known, respected or important) websites or businesses based on the geographic location, here, Seattle.
- Some services allow users to upload and share three- dimensional ("3D") models of various objects such as the interior or exterior of buildings, stadiums, ships, vehicles, trees, or terrain (for example, the Grand Canyon), etc.
- the objects may be associated with various types of information such as titles, descriptive data, user reviews, points of interest ("POI"), business listings, etc.
- POI points of interest
- Many of the objects and the models themselves may be geolocated or associated with a geographic location such as an address or geolocation coordinates. Models may also be categorized. For example, a model of a skyscraper may be associated with one or more categories such as skyscrapers, buildings in a particular city, etc.
- a user may search the database for models, for example, based on the associated title, geographic location, description, object type, collection, physical features, etc.
- a user may interact with the model. For example, a user may query the database for "the Eiffel Tower" and in response receive a list of search results including various models of the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, France, as well as other objects associated with or indexed by the search terms. Once a user has selected an object, for example, by clicking on a search result, the user may, among other actions, download, view, rotate, or comment on the model.
- Services may also allow users to search, for example, for businesses or geographic locations on a world map.
- the service may provide a map identifying, among other information, a 3D model or a link to a 3D model of a 3D model database. Again, the user may interact with the 3D model, for example, by clicking on the model .
- aspects of the invention relate generally to ranking geographic locations based on perceived user interest. More specifically, a database of three-dimensional models of buildings or other architectural features may be used to determine the level of user interest in a particular location and accordingly rank, for example, geographic locations or web or map search results with local intent. For instance, various signals such as the number of models created by users for a particular location, the number of clicks or requests for the models of the particular location, the number of points of interest (POIs) contained within or associated with the models associated with the particular geographic location, number of categories associated with a model associated with the geographic location, number of embedded views or views of the models associated with the particular location on other web sites, and the age of the models associated with the particular geographic location.

- the user may input information using a small keyboard (in the case of a Blackberry-type phone), a keypad (in the case of a typical cellular phone) or a touch screen (in the case of a PDA) .
- Data 134 of server 110 may include a database 136 of 3D models of various objects. These 3D objects may be associated with data provided by the model's creator (or uploading user) or other users. For example, a model may be associated with one or more categories, geographic locations, descriptions, user reviews, etc. The models may also be associated with user-designated collections. For example, when a user uploads a new model to the database, the user may designate the model as part of one or more collections, such as "mid-century modern" or "stuff I like.” As a result, the new model may also be associated with other models also associated with the same collection. This information may be used to identify, index, and query the models .

- the map information 138 may include various types of geolocated information, such as, buildings, roadways, waterways, POIs, and other features which may be used to display a map of a given location.
- the map information may also include representative 3D objects selected from database 136.
- database 136 For example, there may be a plurality of models of the "Eiffel Tower" stored in database 136.
- a particular 3D model may be selected to represent the Eiffel Tower at the map location of Paris, France.
- the selected model may be selected manually or by the server based on various criteria including, for example, question and answer sessions with the model's designer, the level of accuracy and detail, the file size, and even how fast the model may load on a client device when requested from the server.
- the model selected to represent an object at a particular geographic location may change over time as new models are generated and uploaded by users.

- Data 134 may also include a list of geographic locations 142. This information may be stored as part of map information 138 or independent of the map information. Each particular geographic location of the list of geographic locations may be associated with a user interest value based on the perceived user interest in 3D models associated with the particular geographic location. As described in more detail below, these values may be used, for example, to rank and order the list of geographic locations or search results associated with the geographic locations.
- the server may use 3D object data to quantify user interest in a particular geographic location.
- the server may determine the number of models of a particular geolocated object which have been uploaded by users and use this number as an indicator of user interest. For example, more 3D models of a particular geolocated object or location may imply a greater user interest in that entity or location.
- the server may use a threshold value based on the number of co-located models as an indicator of user interest.
- the number of co-located models may be used as a weighted factor.
- the threshold value for example, more than 5
- the location may be considered "interesting.” In other words, if more users are creating and uploading 3D models associated with a particular geographic location, the more likely other user may be interested in the particular geographic location. It will be understood that as the total number of models increases, this "threshold" number of models may also increase.
- database 136 may include twenty different models of or which contain the Eiffel Tower but only one model of the Hopital de Longjumeau (both in Paris, France) .
- database 136 may include twenty different models of or which contain the Eiffel Tower but only one model of the Hopital de Longjumeau (both in Paris, France) .

- the user enters a local search 410 for Business A, NY.
- the server may query the map information and return a map 420 of New York City, various search results 430, and related map markers 440.
- the map may also include 2D or 3D representations, images, photos, etc. of buildings 450, roadways 460, intersection 470, etc.
- the user may select the model by clicking on a 2D representation or image or a building to view the model more closely or request additional information about the Empire State Building.
- the user may maneuver a mouse icon 505 over and/or click on a building 510 and receive a popup 520 with a view of a 3D model.
- the user may select model 530 by clicking on the model using mouse 505.
- the user may be presented with a display of the 3D model and various other information as shown in FIGURE 6.
- the number of times a particular representative model has been selected for a given period of time may be recorded and stored by the server.
- Each "selection" or “click” event may be associated with the model and stored, for example as a running tally or average.
- privacy protections are provided for the user data including, for example, anonymization of personally identifiable information, aggregation of data, filtering of sensitive information, encryption, hashing or filtering of sensitive information to remove personal attributes, time limitations on storage of information, or limitations on data use or sharing.
- data is anonymized and aggregated such that any individual user data is not revealed.
- model A may receive an average of 100 clicks per day for the last 30 days, whereas model B may receive an average of 120 clicks per day for the last 10 days.
- the same average number of clicks per day may be received if model A receives a total of 1000 clicks in the last 10 days and model B receives a total of 1200 clicks in the last 10 days. The greater the number of clicks on a particular representative model over a given period of time, the greater the level of user interest (and indicator value) of the geographic location associated with the model.
- the representative model selected for a particular geographic location may change over time.
- the count may be recorded for a particular geographic location and may span multiple models.
- the server may record the click data associated with model A and model B and combine these counts together. The greater the number of clicks on a given model or chain of models, the greater the level of importance or user interest in the geographic location. Again, the server may use this information to determine the level of user interest or an indicator value for search results associated with the object or the object's geographic location.
- the server receives, from a plurality of requesting client devices, requests for a map of a geographic area at block 702.
- the server transmits the requested map of the geographic area to the requesting client devices at block 704.
- the server also transmits information identifying a 3D model of an object associated with a particular geographic location within the geographic area of the transmitted map.
- the server receives, from one or more of the client devices, one or more requests for the 3D model at block 706 (for example, where the user has clicked on the information identifying a 3D model) .
- the server identifies the number of received requests for the 3D model received over a period of time at block 708.
- the server determines an indicator value for the particular geographic location based on the number of received requests for the 3D model for the period of time at block 710.
- the server may also determine a user interest value based on various other criteria associated with user actions such as how often a model is requested from database 136 (for example by entering a query into search box 610 and selecting a resulting 3D model or by selecting the model as shown in FIGURE 5), the average length of time a model or the description associated with a model is viewed by users (for example, how long the user views the model 620, description 630, etc.), etc. Again the greater these values, the greater the user interest in the model, and the greater the perceived level of user interest and indicator value for the geographic location .
- various other criteria associated with user actions such as how often a model is requested from database 136 (for example by entering a query into search box 610 and selecting a resulting 3D model or by selecting the model as shown in FIGURE 5), the average length of time a model or the description associated with a model is viewed by users (for example, how long the user views the model 620, description 630, etc.), etc. Again the greater these values, the greater the user
- the server receives a request for a particular 3D model, for example, where a user selects or clicks on the 3D model in a list of search results as shown in block 802.
- the server identifies the number of received requests for the 3D model at block 804.
- the server determines an indicator value for the particular geographic location based on the number of received requests for the 3D models at block 806.
- the server may use the number POI associated with, nearby, or contained within the bounds of a geolocated model (based on its map location) as an indicator of user interest in the particular geographic location.
- a particular 3D object may be associated with a given geographic location.
- the server may identify one or more POIs of the map information at or near the given geographic location.
- an identified POI may be located within the building (at the same address), in the courtyard of the building, or next to the building.
- the identified POIs may be associated with the 3D object and this association may be stored as described above.
- a particular location is associated with a relatively high number of POI, the location may be considered more interesting to users and thus be associated with a greater interest value. For example, a first building including only a bookstore business may be considered less interesting to users than a second building associated with a coffee shop, a bookstore business, and a park. Thus, the second building associated with three POIs may have a higher perceived level of user interest (or indicator value) than that of the first building associated with a single POI.
- the server identifies a number of points of interest associated with a 3D model of an object associated with a particular geographic location at block 902.
- a point of interest may be associated with a 3D model, for example, if the point of interest is contained within the boundaries of the 3D model or the object or is located proximate to the object.
- the server determines an indicator value for the particular geographic location based on the number of points of interest associated with the 3D model .
- the server may use the number of collections or tags associated with a geolocated model as an indicator of user interest in the particular geographic location. For example, users which designate a model as part of a particular collection may be likely to do so because the user admires the model and presumably the geographic location of the real object. Models associated with a relatively high number of collections, for example 5 or more, may therefore have a higher level user interest and a higher indicator value than models which are contained in very few collections, or none at all.
- the server receives one or more 3D models of an object associated with a particular geographic location at block 1002.
- the server receives, for each of the one or more 3D models, one or more user defined collection designations at block 1004.
- the server identifies the number of collections associated with the one or more 3D models at block 1006.
- the server determines an indicator value for the particular geographic location based on the number of collections at block 1008.
- the server may use the number of embedded views of a geolocated model as an indicator of user interest in the particular geographic location.
- Embedded views may be described as two-dimensional views or images of a model displayed in various ways on a web site (as opposed to views of the 3D model displayed in the context of database 136) .
- a website advertising, promoting or mentioning a particular 3D model may include a two dimensional image of the 3D model as described above.
- the server may provide the two dimensional views of the 3D model to users upon request and thus identify the number of requested images as well as embedded views.
- the server may identify whether the request is for an embedded view and may record the number of requests .
- the server identifies a number of 2D views of a 3D model associated with a particular geographic location at block 1102. These "views" may be included in various web sites . The server then determines an indicator value for the particular geographic location based on the number of 2D views at block 1104.
- the server may use the length of time that a particular geographic location has been associated with one or more geolocated models.
- the age, or how long a particular geolocated model has been included in the database may indicate the user interest or importance of the associated geographic location. This may be, for example, because at least one user thought an object at the geographic location was interesting enough to create and upload a 3D model. If a particular geolocated model has been included in the database for a relatively long period of time, such as four or more years, this may indicate a higher level of user interest or indicator value for the geographic location than another geographic location which has no associated models or models which have existed for a much shorter period of time, such as one year or less.
- the server receives a 3D model of an object associated with a particular geographic location at block 1202.
- the server stores the 3D model for an amount of time at block 1204.
- the server determines an indicator value for the particular geographic location based on the amount of time the 3D model has been stored at block 1206.
- each particular location of a given list of geographic locations may be associated with a user interest value.
- the user interest value may indicate the level of user interest in a particular location based one or more of the factors determined from the 3D model data, etc. described above.
- the user interest value may be used to rank the list of geographic location or may simply be associated with the geographic location and the association stored in memory accessibly by the server.
- the values may be determined periodically or updated as the various indicator's contributions to the value may change overtime. For example, a process may be run periodically, such as each night, in order to determine a user interest value for each geographic location of the list of geographic locations.
- the user interest value may be associated with each entity and stored.
- the server may receive a query and in response, identify a list of search results based on relevance to the query.
- the server may also determine a relevancy-to-query value. For each particular entity returned as a search result for a query, the server may retrieve the stored user interest value associated with the geographic location of each particular entity.
- the user interest values may be combined with the respective relevance-to-query score for each search result in the identified list of search results in order to determine the ranking of the results. For example, if an entity X and an entity Y include identical relevancy-to-query values for a given query and are otherwise identical, the server may use the user interest values to determine whether the entity X and entity Y will be displayed, and if so, the order in which they will be displayed to the user. Alternatively, these values may be computed by the server for a list of search results in real time in response to receiving a search query and identifying the list of search results.
- the user interest value may be based on one or more of the indicators described above, such as the number of models of a particular object; the number of clicks on a particular geolocated model; criteria associated with user actions; the number POI associated with, nearby, or contained within the bounds of a geolocated model; and the length of time that a particular geographic location has been associated with one or more geolocated models. For example, if there are multiple user interest signals being considered, the user interest values may be combined by way of a mathematical function so as to determine an aggregate user interest over all of the plurality of user interest indicators.
- One example of this type of calculation may be a weighted sum of the user interest indicators, where a greater weight is given to stronger indicators of user interest.
- the weighted sum may be written as:
- weights sum to 1, this may be a weighted average.
- a user creating a 3D model at a location may be a stronger indicator of user interest than a single user interacting with the same model.
- the weighted user interest value for a particular model may be :
- weight_ ⁇ number of 3D models over lapping this one ⁇ may be .99, while the value of weight_ ⁇ number of interactions with the model in the last week ⁇ may be 0.01.
- a single model associated with a geographic location may indicate the same amount of user interest as 99 separate interactions with the model.
- the weighted sum described above may be passed through a thresholding nonlinearity such as a sigmoid.
- a thresholding nonlinearity such as a sigmoid.
- Matlab the program Matlab.
- %SIGMOID returns the sigmoid function
- "x" may be the linear combination of user inputs (the weighted sum) .
- Figure 13 depicts this sigmoid where the shift has been set to 0.5 and the scale to 0.1.
- the server accesses a list of geographic locations at block 1402. For each particular geographic location, the server identifies one or more indicator values (see, for example, FIGURES 6-12) associated with the particular geographic location and generates a user interest value based on the identified one or more indicator values as shown in block 1404 and 1406, respectively. The server associates the user interest value with the respective geographic location of the list of geographic locations at block 1408. The server then orders the list of geographic locations based on the respective user interest values as shown in block 1410.
- indicator values see, for example, FIGURES 6-12
- a client device may request information from the server. If the request is a local search, including a geographic search constraint as described above, the server may select search results from the list of geographic locations. As noted above, the results may be ranked in advance or ranked as a result of the search request. The server may then identify the relevant search results, for example, in descending order based on the associated user interest values .
- the user interest value may be used to remove or reorder search results in order to reduce spam search results.
- a search for "empire state building, new york” may return a list of search results related to the true Empire State Building in New York city.
- the results may also include "spam" results. These spam results may contain text which refers to the queried terms, but the spam may also be associated with a location different from the geographic locations of the true Empire State Building and the of the 3D models contained in the database.
- the spam result may be removed or ranked very low so that it is either withheld from search results provided to the requesting client device, transmitted but not displayed on the display of the client device, or displayed at a relatively low position (for example, towards the bottom of a list of search results) .
- the present disclosure can be used to rank geographic locations based on perceived user interest.
