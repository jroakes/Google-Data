Definitions
- the invention relates to physical layer (PHY) digital signal processing for use in processors developed for wireless local area networks (LAN's), and more particularly to wireless LAN's based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) of the license-free national information structure (U-NII) radio spectrum bands in the United States and generally conforming to IEEE Specification 802.11a.
- PHY physical layer
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- U-NII license-free national information structure
- the IEEE 802.11a standard herein “802.11a”, specifies, among other things, the physical layer (PHY) entity for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with data payload communication capabilities of 6,9,12,18,24,36,48, and 54 Mb/s.
- PHY physical layer
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- the 802.11a standard specifies RF transmission in the 5.15-5.25, 5.25-5.35, and 5.725-5.825 GHZ unlicensed national information structure (U-NII) bands.
- the IEEE communication standards specify the transmit bit-stream in addition to performance specifications, RF emissions requirements, etc.
- the wireless transmission medium inherently introduces some unique impairments (not present in traditional LAN's) to the transmitted signal, which must be mitigated in the remote receiver station.
- impairments include signal fading, multi-path reflections, base—and remote—unit oscillator mismatch introduced frequency offset, timing misalignment, and timing synchronization.
- RF hardware limitations such as receiver IQ imbalance and phase noise that must be mitigated as well.
- the mitigation of such effects falls under the category of baseband digital signal processing.
- a known training sequence is usually embedded into the transmit bit stream. This occurs at the expense of bandwidth.
- the same problems occur in the upstream direction (remote station transmitting to the base station), but it suffices to discuss the downstream digital signal processing.
- This processing block digitally estimates the oscillator mismatch between the base- and remote-station and corrects for it in subsequent data demodulation.
- Typical voltage-controlled temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (VCTCXO) used in wireless communications have a ⁇ 20 (parts-per-million) ppm error. At 5 GHz (5000 MHz), this translates to an error of ⁇ 100 kHz at each end, or ⁇ 200 kHz in combination. With OFDM modulation, a frequency error of 3% of the inter-carrier frequency spacing is the maximum tolerable frequency error.
- the transmission scheme in 802.11a is bursty. This means that the receivers must digitally process the training sequence to mitigate the undesired signal impairments each time a burst commences. This means that it is desirable for the processing blocks to be as robust and computationally efficient as possible.
- the quality of carrier frequency-offset estimation must be such that the relative error between actual and estimated values does not exceed three percent of the frequency spacing between consecutive sub-carriers, e.g. 9.375 kHz.
- the 802.11a PHY specification recommends that frequency offset estimation be carried out into two successive stages, a coarse and fine frequency estimation stage. Coarse and fine estimates must be derived from the processing of the short and long preambles respectively. See, IEEE-802.11a-1999, ⁇ 17.3.3. For short, these are called the “short preamble” and the “long preamble”.
- Frequency offset errors need to be removed in order for a receiver to track the transmitted signal and demodulate it properly.
- a conventional method exists to remove such offset, which involves a control loop, which feeds a frequency error signal back to a VCTCXO to slowly correct the oscillator mismatch.
- C&S Technology Kerbe has announced a wireless-LAN modem-chip for IEEE-802.11a applications (see http://cnstec.com/e-html/products/products-1-2-4.htm).
- AFC automatic frequency control
- the method described herein does not use AFC circuitry.
- Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver embodiments of the invention demodulate OFDM signals (embedding quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals) transmitted in the 5 GHz frequency band and digitally correct for frequency offset in their digital signal processing (DSP) units.
- OFDM signals include binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16-QAM and 64-QAM (and 256-QAM in future standard enhancements).
- BPSK binary phase shift keying
- QPSK quadrature phase shift keying
- 16-QAM 16-QAM
- 64-QAM 64-QAM
- 256-QAM in future standard enhancements.
- the method assumes that the coarse frequency offset value has already been estimated using the first part of the preamble (also referred to as short preamble) and that the second part of the preamble (also referred to as long preamble), which is subsequently used for fine frequency offset estimation, has been frequency offset corrected accordingly.
- a presently preferred method comprises a step in which an OFDM signal is I/Q sampled.
- the minimization of a cost function provides the fine frequency offset value. Once this value is available, it is used in the downstream digital signal processing.
- FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an OFDM radio-transceiver embodiment of the invention
- FIG. 2 is a diagram representing the structure of the synchronizing PLCP preamble, signal, and data fields used for the physical layer (PHY) of a wireless local area network (LAN) conforming to the IEEE-802.11a specification; and
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a method embodiment of the invention for determining the fine-frequency offset error from samples obtained during the long-preamble interval in the structure of FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 1 illustrates a wireless local area network (LAN) embodiment of the invention, and is referred to herein by the general reference numeral 100 .
- LAN local area network
- Such wireless LAN is preferably based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and quadrature phase shift keying (QAM) of signals transmitted in the license-free 5 GHz frequency band.
- the wireless LAN 100 typically includes a wireless network 101 connected to the Internet, a PHY-transmitter 102 , and a PHY-receiver 103 .
- Such units all conform to the IEEE-802.11a specification for a physical layer (PHY) interface in a wireless local area network which allows mobile clients.
- PHY physical layer
- the transmitter 102 comprises a digital signal processor (DSP) 104 which implements a forward error correction (FEC) coder 106 , an interleaving and mapping process 108 , an inverse fast Fourier transform processor 110 , and a symbol wave shaper 112 .
- the DSP 104 outputs in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) signals that are input to an IQ modulator 114 driven by a local oscillator 116 .
- the modulated output is sent to a mixer 118 for upconversion to the 5 GHz band.
- a second local oscillator 120 provides the necessary carrier frequency.
- a high power amplifier (HPA) 122 drives a transmitter antenna 124 .
- a radio up-link 125 is received by the wireless network 101 .
- the transmitter 102 can be implemented with conventional methods and components.
- the receiver 103 receives a radio down-link 126 that is typically transmitted in bursts. Each packet is begun with a training sequence, e.g. a short and long preamble.
- the receiver 103 includes a receiver antenna 128 followed by a low-noise amplifier (LNA) 130 .
- a local oscillator 132 and a first mixer 134 produce an intermediate frequency (IF).
- An automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier 136 smoothes out signal-strength variations and drives an IQ-detector 138 .
- a second local oscillator 140 provides the carrier necessary to derive the l/Q samples, e.g. 16-bit binary at 20.0 MHz.
- a receiver-DSP 142 comprises a fast Fourier transform process 144 , a demapping and deinterleaving process 146 , and an FEC decoder 148 .
- the receiver-DSP 142 further includes the necessary digital logic needed for carrier frequency offset determination and correction.
- the higher levels of the mobile client are represented by a media access controller (MAC) 150 and a client agent software 152 .
- MAC media access controller
- the frequency-offset estimation error must not exceed three percent of the adjacent sub-carrier channel spacing, e.g. 9.375 kHz is a rule of thumb that was derived from the OFDM-related papers.
- the specification therefore recommends that frequency offset estimation be carried out into two successive stages, e.g. a coarse estimation followed by a fine estimation.
- Such estimates are respectively derived from the processing of the so-called short and long preambles.
- These two training sequences are of equal duration and constitute the packet preamble. Neither contains any information.
- the short preamble is composed of ten identical elementary waveforms (‘short symbols’) in succession while the long preamble is composed of two longer basic constituents (‘long symbols’) preceded by a guard interval. All presently preferred embodiments of the invention rely on this observation and use digital signal processing methods to correct the common frequency offset that has been computed in a wireless local area network.
- This disclosure is directed to the fine estimation of frequency offset using the long preamble.
- the estimation of the coarse frequency offset using the short preamble is the first operation to be performed once an incoming packet has been detected.
- coarse frequency estimation is disclosed in “Coarse Frequency Offset Estimation—Patent Disclosure”, Alain Chiodini, John Reagan, nBand Communications, 2000.
- the coarse frequency offset operation precedes any intra-baud timing offset synchronization estimation. This information is needed to achieve proper demodulation of data-bearing OFDM symbols. In fact, all that is needed here is the knowledge of a timing reference point referred to as “boundary between long and short preambles”. This is the purpose of the synchronization operation.
- synchronization acquisition operation is disclosed in “OFDM Data Demodulator Synchronization—Patent Disclosure”, John Reagan, Alain Chiodini, nBand Communications, 2000.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a burst transmission structure 300 that begins with a short preamble 302 followed by a long preamble 304 .
- a boundary 306 serves as an important timing point, and previous circuitry must find this point in transmission time before fine-frequency offset determination can proceed.
- Each of the short preamble 302 and long preamble 304 periods are 8.0 ⁇ s long.
- the long preamble begins with a guard interval (GI) that is two 0.8 ⁇ s units long.
- GI guard interval
- T 1 and T 2 is 3.2 ⁇ s in transmission duration.
- AWGN additive white Gaussian noise
- MUSIC multiple signal classification
- This algorithm is specifically applied to a selected portion of the long preamble.
- the timing knowledge i.e. the knowledge of the boundary between short and long preambles, needed to extract either sequence is a direct result of the synchronization stage.
- the length of the processed signal determines the dimension of the vector space dealt with.
- This vector space can be decomposed into two orthogonal subspaces: a signal and a non-signal subspaces.
- the dimension of the vector space is 128, and it is appropriate to use the orthonormal basis ⁇ V m ⁇ m ⁇ [0 . . . 127] formed by the row vectors of the 128 ⁇ 128 square matrix associated with the 128-element discrete Fourier transform to span it.
- the signal subspace is spanned by the 52-element subset of row vectors (or “frequency components”) indexed by [2 4 6 8 . . . 52] and [76 78 80 82 . . . 126] while the non-signal subspace is spanned by the 76-element complementary subset of row vectors, i.e. those indexed by 0, [1 3 5 7 . . .
- V 0 [1 1 1 1 . . . 1 1]
- V 64 [1 ⁇ 1 1 ⁇ 1 . . . 1 ⁇ 1]
- the dimension of the vector space is 64 and it is appropriate to use the orthonormal basis ⁇ V m ⁇ m ⁇ [0 . . . 6.3] formed by the row vectors of the 64 ⁇ 64 square matrix associated with the 64-element discrete Fourier transform to span it.
- the signal subspace is spanned by the 52-element subset of row vectors indexed by 1 through 26 and 38 through 63 while the non-signal subspace is spanned by the 12-element complementary subset of row vectors, i.e. those indexed by 0 and 27 through 37.
- Two of these vectors are real and expressed in a most simple way:
- V 0 [1 1 1 1 . . . 1 1]
- V 32 [1 ⁇ 1 1 ⁇ 1 . . . 1 ⁇ 1]
- Method embodiments of the invention can safely assume that the fine-frequency offset is no more than ⁇ 10 kHz because that is the outer bounds of a preceding coarse frequency offset compensation.
- the ⁇ 10 kHz requirement is valid for the 802.11a PHY only.
- this frequency interval can be either increased or decreased depending on the sampling frequency Fs used in the receiver (Fs determines the frequency range when the Taylor expansion takes place).
- the conventional multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm can be used to estimate the pseudospectrum from a signal or a correlation matrix using Schmidt's eigenspace analysis method. See, R. O. Schmidt, Multiple Emitter Location and Signal Parameter Estimation IEEE Transactions Antenna Propagation, vol. AP-34, pp. 276-280 (March 1986).
- the algorithm estimates the signal's frequency content by way of an eigenspace analysis of the signal's correlation matrix, and is used where the signals are the sum of sinusoids with additive white Gaussian noise.
- the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the signal's correlation matrix can be estimated if the correlation matrix is not supplied, e.g. as in the PMUSIC commercial product marketed by The MathWorks, Inc.
- the integer p is the dimension of the signal subspace, so the eigenvectors v k used in the sum correspond to the smallest eigenvalues and also span the noise subspace.
- the vector e(f) consists of complex exponentials, so the inner product ⁇ k H e(f) amounts to a Fourier transform. This is used for computation of the pseudospectrum estimate.
- the FFT is computed for each v k and then the squared magnitudes are summed.
- FIG. 3 represents a method embodiment of the invention, and is referred to herein by the general reference numeral 400 .
- the method 400 comprises a step 402 in which an OFDM transmission is I/Q sampled.
- the measurements represent a reference signal comprising a signal subspace and a non-signal subspace (spectral representation).
- the reference signal includes fifty-two non-zero equal magnitude subcarriers.
- a step 406 assumes the coarse frequency offset after compensation does not exceed ⁇ 10 kHz.
- a step 408 uses a cost function to determine a fine-frequency offset.
- a step 410 compensates the fine-frequency offset.

The integer p is the dimension of the signal subspace, so the eigenvectors vk used in the sum correspond to the smallest eigenvalues and also span the noise subspace. The vector e(f) consists of complex exponentials, so the inner product νk He(f) amounts to a Fourier transform. This is used for computation of the pseudospectrum estimate.
