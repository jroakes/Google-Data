Definitions
- This specification generally relates to user interfaces.
- Search systems may generate responses to queries by providing search results on user interfaces. These search results may include resources such as web pages, images, video, email, files, or applications, which may be obtained from a remote server and/or from a user's client device. Some search systems may even act in a proactive or predictive manner, providing search results to users without prompting the user to enter a search query. In some cases, the user interfaces may also include portions with factual details responsive to the queries.
- a search results page user interface that includes a “reversible” portion may provide additional information related to that portion without causing a user to navigate away from the current search results page.
- a first representation of the reversible portion e.g., a front side of a panel
- a second representation of that portion e.g., a reverse side of the panel
- additional elements may be aligned with elements from the first representation so that users may readily determine what the additional elements relate to.
- the reversible portion may include resources such as web pages, images, video, email, files, or applications, which may be obtained from a remote server and/or from a user's client device.
- one aspect of the subject matter includes the actions of outputting a search results page, the search results page including a portion having one or more elements in a first arrangement, the one or more elements comprising one or more of text elements, image elements, input elements, and video elements.
- the actions include receiving a command to render a reversed representation of the portion of the search results page.
- the actions also include generating the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page, the reversed representation including the one or more elements in a second arrangement, the second arrangement being a mirror image of the first arrangement, wherein the reversed representation comprises one or more additional elements aligned with at least one of the one or more elements, the one or more additional elements comprising text elements, image elements, input elements, or video elements, and wherein each additional element is associated with the respective element with which the respective additional element is aligned.
- the actions include outputting the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page.
- the reversed representation comprises one or more additional elements overlaid on or adjacent to at least one of the one or more elements.
- Some implementations involve outputting an animated transition between a display showing the portion of the search results page having the one or more elements in the first arrangement and another display showing the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page.
- the animated transition may include outputting a horizontal rotation animation that transitions between the display showing the portion of the search results page having the one or more elements in the first arrangement and the other display showing the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page.
- the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page may include at least one of the one or more elements in the second arrangement being a mirror image of the respective element in the first arrangement. In some implementations, the reversed representation may involve at least one of the one or more elements in the second arrangement being a blurred version of the respective element in the first arrangement.
- the reversed representation may include one or more of a histogram element, a metadata information element, or a feedback input element aligned with the image element.
- the reversed representation may include one or more additional elements aligned with at least one of the one or more elements of the advertisement portion, the one or more additional elements enabling a user to purchase a product or service associated with the advertisement portion.
- Implementations described in this specification may realize one or more of the following advantages. Some implementations may allow a user to interact with a portion of a search results page to obtain additional information without leaving the search results page. Some implementations may allow user interface designers to keep a user interface clean by putting only the essential controls on the original portion of the user interface and providing additional elements on the virtual reverse side of the user interface.
- FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate an example user interface with a reversible portion.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate another example user interface with a reversible portion.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate still another example user interface with a reversible portion.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for providing a user interface with a reversible portion.
- a user interface such as a search results page may become crowded with user interface elements, including editing options and help links. In some cases, additional elements may also distract users from completing desired tasks. In a sequence of desired tasks, for example, the success rate of inducing users to complete the entire sequence may decrease as additional steps are added. In one example, if the desired sequence involves asking a user to contribute to factual information, directing the user to a different application or website may decrease the potential contributor's willingness to complete the sequences and/or distract the potential contributor from the desired sequence.
- a graphical user interface that allows users to easily access additional elements by reversing a portion of the user interface, e.g., flipping a panel on the user interface to a reverse side, may address some of these limitations.
- Such an interface may provide a virtual means for users to view “under the hood” elements of the user interface.
- the reversible portion of the user interface may include resources such as factual descriptions, web pages, images, video, email, files, and/or applications, which may be obtained from a remote server and/or from a user's client device.
- a reversible portion of the user interface may be a panel or other segment of a user interface that a user can manipulate to show two or more different representations of the portion.
- a panel on a web page may mimic a physical panel having a front side and a reverse side such that a user can transition back and forth to access additional information without having to leave the web page.
- the reverse side of the panel may include the same elements as the front side of the panel in a mirror image arrangement. Some of the elements on the reverse side may also be mirrored or blurred in relation to the elements from the front side, e.g., an image from the front side could be flipped and/or rendered with blurring applied.
- the reverse side may include additional elements that are aligned with the elements from the front side (in the mirror image arrangement) to provide additional functionality.
- the reversible portion may include various curation tools, editing tools, and additional information that are associated with elements on the front side.
- An element may refer to components of a user interface such as, for example, text, images, inputs, controls, videos, audio, or any combination of these.
- an element may correspond to a hypertext markup language (HTML) element.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Elements may be arranged and rearranged on a user interface in any suitable manner; for example, elements may be configured in an HTML document using HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS), JavaScript, any combination of these, or any other similar technology.
- elements on the reverse side of the portion associated with a text element may include an input field allowing the user to provide feedback, offer editing suggestions, fill out a questionnaire, or change settings for the text.
- the reverse side may also display additional information and/or options related to the text such as citations, sources, contributors, editors, information about similar topics, rich media (e.g., images, videos, audio), change history, discussion forums (e.g., live chat, video chat, or message forums), help topics, and/or terms and conditions.
- Examples of elements on the reverse side that may be associated with a media element, e.g., images or video may include a histogram and metadata such as source, contributor, file size, dimensions, image format, geotags, creation date, and/or change history.
- the reverse side could include information such as similar items, endorsements, reviews/ratings, social media activity, recommendations, and/or report abuse features.
- elements on the reverse side could include encoding of the email, routing information and source information.
- the reverse side could include file information such as size, file type, creation date, modification date, and/or file path.
- the reverse side may show actual processes running or a command line representation listing processes.

Abstract
A user interface that includes a “reversible” portion may provide additional information related to that portion without causing a user to navigate away from the user interface page.
Description
- This specification generally relates to user interfaces.
- Search systems may generate responses to queries by providing search results on user interfaces. These search results may include resources such as web pages, images, video, email, files, or applications, which may be obtained from a remote server and/or from a user's client device. Some search systems may even act in a proactive or predictive manner, providing search results to users without prompting the user to enter a search query. In some cases, the user interfaces may also include portions with factual details responsive to the queries.
- A search results page user interface that includes a “reversible” portion may provide additional information related to that portion without causing a user to navigate away from the current search results page. In some implementations, a first representation of the reversible portion, e.g., a front side of a panel, may provide factual details while a second representation of that portion, e.g., a reverse side of the panel, provides various additional elements such as curation tools, editing tools, and further information. These additional elements may be aligned with elements from the first representation so that users may readily determine what the additional elements relate to. Alternatively or in addition to factual details, the reversible portion may include resources such as web pages, images, video, email, files, or applications, which may be obtained from a remote server and/or from a user's client device.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter includes the actions of outputting a search results page, the search results page including a portion having one or more elements in a first arrangement, the one or more elements comprising one or more of text elements, image elements, input elements, and video elements. The actions include receiving a command to render a reversed representation of the portion of the search results page. The actions also include generating the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page, the reversed representation including the one or more elements in a second arrangement, the second arrangement being a mirror image of the first arrangement, wherein the reversed representation comprises one or more additional elements aligned with at least one of the one or more elements, the one or more additional elements comprising text elements, image elements, input elements, or video elements, and wherein each additional element is associated with the respective element with which the respective additional element is aligned. And the actions include outputting the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page.
- In some implementations, the reversed representation comprises one or more additional elements overlaid on or adjacent to at least one of the one or more elements.
- Some implementations involve outputting an animated transition between a display showing the portion of the search results page having the one or more elements in the first arrangement and another display showing the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page. The animated transition may include outputting a horizontal rotation animation that transitions between the display showing the portion of the search results page having the one or more elements in the first arrangement and the other display showing the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page.
- In some implementations, the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page may include at least one of the one or more elements in the second arrangement being a mirror image of the respective element in the first arrangement. In some implementations, the reversed representation may involve at least one of the one or more elements in the second arrangement being a blurred version of the respective element in the first arrangement.
- In some implementations that include a portion having an image element in a first arrangement, the reversed representation may include one or more of a histogram element, a metadata information element, or a feedback input element aligned with the image element. In some implementations that include a portion having an advertisement portion with one or more elements in a first arrangement, the reversed representation may include one or more additional elements aligned with at least one of the one or more elements of the advertisement portion, the one or more additional elements enabling a user to purchase a product or service associated with the advertisement portion.
- Implementations described in this specification may realize one or more of the following advantages. Some implementations may allow a user to interact with a portion of a search results page to obtain additional information without leaving the search results page. Some implementations may allow user interface designers to keep a user interface clean by putting only the essential controls on the original portion of the user interface and providing additional elements on the virtual reverse side of the user interface.
- The details of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate another example user interface with a reversible portion. -
FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate still another example user interface with a reversible portion. -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for providing a user interface with a reversible portion. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- A user interface such as a search results page may become crowded with user interface elements, including editing options and help links. In some cases, additional elements may also distract users from completing desired tasks. In a sequence of desired tasks, for example, the success rate of inducing users to complete the entire sequence may decrease as additional steps are added. In one example, if the desired sequence involves asking a user to contribute to factual information, directing the user to a different application or website may decrease the potential contributor's willingness to complete the sequences and/or distract the potential contributor from the desired sequence.
- A graphical user interface that allows users to easily access additional elements by reversing a portion of the user interface, e.g., flipping a panel on the user interface to a reverse side, may address some of these limitations. Such an interface may provide a virtual means for users to view “under the hood” elements of the user interface. For example, the reversible portion of the user interface may include resources such as factual descriptions, web pages, images, video, email, files, and/or applications, which may be obtained from a remote server and/or from a user's client device.
- A reversible portion of the user interface may be a panel or other segment of a user interface that a user can manipulate to show two or more different representations of the portion. For example, a panel on a web page may mimic a physical panel having a front side and a reverse side such that a user can transition back and forth to access additional information without having to leave the web page. The reverse side of the panel may include the same elements as the front side of the panel in a mirror image arrangement. Some of the elements on the reverse side may also be mirrored or blurred in relation to the elements from the front side, e.g., an image from the front side could be flipped and/or rendered with blurring applied. In addition, the reverse side may include additional elements that are aligned with the elements from the front side (in the mirror image arrangement) to provide additional functionality.
- The reversible portion may include various curation tools, editing tools, and additional information that are associated with elements on the front side. An element may refer to components of a user interface such as, for example, text, images, inputs, controls, videos, audio, or any combination of these. In some implementations, an element may correspond to a hypertext markup language (HTML) element. Elements may be arranged and rearranged on a user interface in any suitable manner; for example, elements may be configured in an HTML document using HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS), JavaScript, any combination of these, or any other similar technology.
- For example, elements on the reverse side of the portion associated with a text element may include an input field allowing the user to provide feedback, offer editing suggestions, fill out a questionnaire, or change settings for the text. The reverse side may also display additional information and/or options related to the text such as citations, sources, contributors, editors, information about similar topics, rich media (e.g., images, videos, audio), change history, discussion forums (e.g., live chat, video chat, or message forums), help topics, and/or terms and conditions. Examples of elements on the reverse side that may be associated with a media element, e.g., images or video, may include a histogram and metadata such as source, contributor, file size, dimensions, image format, geotags, creation date, and/or change history. In addition, the reverse side could include information such as similar items, endorsements, reviews/ratings, social media activity, recommendations, and/or report abuse features. For an email, elements on the reverse side could include encoding of the email, routing information and source information. For a file icon, the reverse side could include file information such as size, file type, creation date, modification date, and/or file path. For a specific process with an indication displayed on the front side, the reverse side may show actual processes running or a command line representation listing processes.
-
FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate an example user interface with a reversible portion. The user interface may be displayed in response to a user inputting a search query at a client device. The client device may include one or more processing devices, and may be, or include, a mobile telephone (e.g., a smartphone), a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a network appliance, a camera, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, an interactive or so-called “smart” television, a smart watch, a head mounted display device, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. - Initially, a user enters a query into the
search box 102 at their client device, e.g., “Thomas Jefferson.” The client device submits the query to a search engine and the search engine then responds with search results. Upon receiving the search results, the client device renders the search resultspage 100 a shown inFIG. 1A . The search resultspage 100 a may include aportion 104 a with factual information responsive to the query as well as links tovarious documents 114 that are responsive to the query. - In some implementations, the search engine may provide search results to the client device based on predictions (e.g., using machine learning and/or similar users' behavior) without a user explicitly submitting a search query. For example, assume that a user's email account includes a flight confirmation email for a departure flight. Three hours before the scheduled departure, the user may access the search engine (e.g., an application or website), and the search engine may provide the current status of the flight (e.g., on time, delayed) without the user entering a search query. This result could be based on a high confidence prediction of the user's potential behavior.
- The
portion 104 a may be the front side of a reversible panel that allows the user to transition the panel between the front side as shown inFIG. 1A and a reverse side as shown inFIG. 1B . The front side of thepanel 104 a includes factual information that is responsive to the “Thomas Jefferson” query. In particular, thefront side 104 a includes afirst text element 106 a describing Thomas Jefferson, animage 108 a of Thomas Jefferson, and anothertext element 110 a that includes further information about Thomas Jefferson. - The user may trigger a transition of the panel from the
front side 104 a to thereverse side 104 b, for example, by a mouseover, a single click, a double click, a gesture (e.g., a touch gesture, a body movement gesture such as head or arm, or an eye gesture such as gaze tracking), a voice action (e.g., “show me more,” “give me details,” or “flip this”), a control element (not shown), or any combination of these. In client devices that include an accelerometer and/or gyroscope, the transition could be triggered by the user initiating a physical flipping motion with the client device. Alternatively or in addition, the transition could be triggered to flip to thereverse side 104 b without any prompt or action from the user. For example, the transition could be based on a timer—if thefront side 104 b is visible for more than a predetermined amount of time (e.g., N seconds or N minutes), the transition would be triggered. - Upon receiving the user's command to trigger the transition, the client device generates and renders the reverse side of the
panel 104 b, optionally presenting an animated transition between thefront side 104 a and thereverse side 104 b. For example, when the transition is triggered, the panel may be animated to appear to rotate about a vertical axis 112. Alternatively or in addition, other transition effects may be used, such as, for example, rotation about a horizontal axis, rotation about a diagonal axis, a folding animation, or any other suitable animation. In some implementations, the transition may simply replace the front side of thepanel 104 a on the search resultspage 100 a with the reverse side of thepanel 104 b with no animation. - While only a single panel is shown in
FIG. 1A , some implementations may involve multiple reversible panels. In such implementations, each of the panels may be independently triggered to transition from the front side to the reverse side. Alternatively or in addition, a subset of the panels may be related such that triggering one of the panels causes all of the panels in the subset to transition from the front side to the reverse side. - The reverse side of the
panel 104 b includes the elements from the front side of thepanel 104 a in a mirror image arrangement around the vertical axis 112. For example, the position of the elements on the front side of thepanel 104 a may be mirrored on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b to create the appearance that a user is viewing the flip side of thepanel 104 a. In particular, whereas theoriginal image 108 a is in a top left position on the front side of thepanel 104 a, thecorresponding image 108 b is in a top right position on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b. Also, theoriginal text 106 a is in a top right position on the front side of thepanel 104 a, while thecorresponding text 106 b in a top left position on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b. And theoriginal text 110 a is in a bottom left position on the front side of thepanel 104 a, while thecorresponding text 110 b in a bottom right position on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b. - The elements on the reverse side of the
panel 104 a may also be mirrored and/or modified. For example, in some implementations, images may be mirrored and/or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b. As shown inFIG. 1B , theimage 108 a from the front side of thepanel 104 a has been flipped horizontally and blurred to form acorresponding image 108 b. In some implementations, text is not mirrored or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b as these effects could make the text difficult to read, but text may be changed from left justified on the front side of thepanel 104 a to right justified on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b. Alternatively or in addition, in some implementations the text may be mirrored and/or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b. Additionally, some implementations may enable a user to selectively unblur and/or unmirror elements on the reverse side of thepanel 104 b to facilitate editing. For example, if text is blurred and mirrored, the user may unblur and unmirror the text for editing by way of a mouseover, a single click, a double click, a touch gesture, a control element (not shown), or any combination of these. - In addition to the mirrored
original elements panel 104 a, the reverse side of thepanel 104 b includesadditional elements additional elements elements FIG. 1B as overlaying the mirrored elements, theadditional elements elements - The additional elements may provide additional functionality such as curation tools, editing tools, and/or additional information. For example, the “Feedback/more info”
control element 120 may allow a user to provide comments or obtain additional information about the text in thetext element 106 b. In particular, when the user selects thecontrol element 120, the user interface may display an input field allowing the user to provide feedback, offer editing suggestions, fill out a questionnaire, or change settings for the text. In addition, the user interface may display a dialog box with additional information and/or options related to the text such as citations, sources, contributors, editors, information about similar topics, rich media (e.g., images, videos, audio), change history, discussion forums (e.g., live chat, video chat, or message forums), help topics, and/or terms and conditions. Similarly, the “Edit”control element 122 may allow a user to provide comments on the text in thetext element 110 b. For example, when the user selects thecontrol element 122, the user interface may display an input field allowing the user to offer editing suggestions for the text. Thehistogram element 124 may provide a graphical representation of the tonal distribution in theimage 108 b. The “Info”control element 126 may provide additional information about theimage 108 b, such as, for example, source, contributor, file size, dimensions, image format, geotags, creation date, etc. - In some implementations, various elements of the user interface may be modified when the user interface transitions the portion to the reverse side. For example, some elements outside of the reversible portion could be blurred or greyed out to focus attention on the reverse side. On some devices, as an additional effect, a mouse pointer could become mirrored when the pointer is hovering over the reverse side. In implementations where the front side of the panel produces a sound effect in stereo, the right and left audio channels could be reversed when the panel is reversed. In an example scenario, assume that a user is watching a video that is displayed in the reversible portion of a web page. The user may reverse the panel to view additional information about the video while watching the video, and as a result, the audio channels could be reversed.
-
FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate another example user interface with a reversible portion. The user interface may be displayed in response to a user inputting a search query at a client device. Initially, a user enters a query into thesearch box 202 at their client device, e.g., “pizza.” The client device submits the query to a search engine and the search engine then responds with search results. Upon receiving the search results, the client device renders the search resultspage 200 a shown inFIG. 2A . The search resultspage 200 a may include aportion 204 with advertisements related to the query as well as links tovarious documents 214 that are responsive to the query. - As shown in
FIG. 2A , one of theadvertisements 206 a (e.g., an advertisement for Pizza Palace) represents the front side of a reversible panel, which allows the user to transition the panel between the front side as shown inFIG. 2A and a reverse side as shown inFIG. 2B . The front side of thepanel 206 a includes atext element 208 a for the advertisement and animage 210 a for the advertisement. - The user may trigger a transition of the panel from the
front side 206 a to thereverse side 206 b, for example, by a mouseover, a single click, a double click, a touch gesture, a control element (not shown), or any combination of these. In client devices that include an accelerometer and/or gyroscope, the transition could be triggered by the user initiating a physical flipping motion with the client device. Upon receiving the user's command to trigger the transition, the client device generates and renders the reverse side of thepanel 206 b, optionally presenting an animated transition between thefront side 206 a and thereverse side 206 b. For example, when the transition is triggered, the panel may be animated to appear to rotate about avertical axis 212. Alternatively or in addition, other transition effects may be used, such as, for example, rotation about a horizontal axis, rotation about a diagonal axis, a folding animation, or any other suitable animation. In some implementations, the transition may simply replace the front side of thepanel 206 a on the search resultspage 200 a with the reverse side of thepanel 206 b with no animation. - While only a single panel for one advertisement is shown in
FIG. 2A , some implementations may involve multiple reversible panels for multiple advertisements. In such implementations, each of the panels may be independently triggered to transition from the front side to the reverse side. Alternatively or in addition, a subset of the panels may be related such that triggering one of the panels causes all of the panels in the subset to transition from the front side to the reverse side. - The reverse side of the
panel 206 b includes the elements from the front side of thepanel 206 a in a mirror image arrangement around thevertical axis 212. Whereas theoriginal text 208 a is in a leftmost position on the front side of thepanel 206 a, thecorresponding text 208 b in a rightmost position on the reverse side of thepanel 206 b. Also, while theoriginal image 210 a is in rightmost position on the front side of thepanel 206 a, thecorresponding image 210 b is in a leftmost position on the reverse side of thepanel 206 b. - The elements on the reverse side of the
panel 206 a may also be mirrored and/or modified. For example, in some implementations, images may be mirrored and/or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 206 b. In some implementations, text is not mirrored or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 206 b as these effects could make the text difficult to read, but text may be changed from left justified on the front side of thepanel 206 a to right justified on the reverse side of thepanel 206 b. Alternatively or in addition, in some implementations the text may be mirrored and/or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 206 b. - In addition to the mirrored
original elements panel 206 a, the reverse side of thepanel 206 b includesadditional elements additional elements elements FIG. 2B as overlaying the mirrored elements, theadditional elements elements - The additional elements may provide an order form that allows a user to purchase the products advertised on the front side of the
panel 208 a without leaving the search resultspage 200 a. For example, theinput box 216 may allow the user to enter and/or verify their delivery information (e.g., address and phone number), theselection element 218 may allow a user to select one or more types of pizza (e.g., pepperoni, sausage, cheese, veggie, or white), and thebutton 220 may allow the user place their order. In particular, when the user selects the “place order”button 220, the user interface display a dialog box confirming the user's order and/or requesting additional information such as payment information. -
FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate still another example user interface 300 with a reversible portion. The user interface may be displayed in response to a user accessing a web page. For example, a user may navigate to a URL by entering the URL into a search/address bar 302, e.g., “http://www.thomasjefferson.com,” using a web browser. The browser and/or search engine that directs the browser to the URL may determine that the user may be interested in viewing a translation of the web page into another language. For example, the browser and/or search engine may determine that the browser request originates from a Spanish-speaking country (e.g., Mexico), while the language of the web page is in another language (e.g., English). In response to making this determination, the browser renders the web page in a reversible panel. - The front side of a
reversible panel 304 a allows the user to transition the panel between the front side as shown inFIG. 3A and a reverse side as shown inFIG. 3B . The front side of thepanel 304 a includes the original web page at the “http://www.thomasjefferson.com” URL. In particular, thefront side 304 a includes afirst text element 306 a describing Thomas Jefferson and animage 308 a of Thomas Jefferson. Also, based on the determination that the user may be interested in viewing a translation of the web page, thepanel 304 a also includes acontrol button 310 that allows the user to trigger a transition to a translated version of the web page. - The user may trigger a transition of the panel from the
front side 304 a to thereverse side 304 b, for example, using thecontrol button 310, a mouseover, a single click, a double click, a touch gesture, or any combination of these. In client devices that include an accelerometer and/or gyroscope, the transition could be triggered by the user initiating a physical flipping motion with the client device. Upon receiving the user's command to trigger the transition, the client device generates and renders the reverse side of thepanel 304 b, optionally presenting an animated transition between thefront side 304 a and thereverse side 304 b. For example, when the transition is triggered, the panel may be animated to appear to rotate about avertical axis 312. Alternatively or in addition, other transition effects may be used, such as, for example, rotation about a horizontal axis, rotation about a diagonal axis, a folding animation, or any other suitable animation. In some implementations, the transition may simply replace the front side of thepanel 304 a on theweb page 300 a with the reverse side of thepanel 304 b with no animation. - The reverse side of the
panel 304 b includes the elements from the front side of thepanel 304 a in a mirror image arrangement around thevertical axis 312. For example, the position of the elements on the front side of thepanel 304 a may be mirrored on the reverse side of thepanel 304 b to create the appearance that a user is viewing the flip side of thepanel 304 a. In particular, whereas theoriginal image 308 a is in a top left position on the front side of thepanel 304 a, thecorresponding image 308 b is in a top right position on the reverse side of thepanel 304 b. Also, theoriginal text 306 a is in a top right position on the front side of thepanel 304 a, while thecorresponding text 306 b in a top left position on the reverse side of thepanel 304 b. - The elements on the reverse side of the
panel 304 a may also be mirrored and/or modified. For example, in some implementations, images may be mirrored and/or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 304 b. As shown inFIG. 3B , theimage 308 a from the front side of thepanel 304 a has been flipped horizontally and blurred to form acorresponding image 308 b. In some implementations, text is not mirrored or blurred on the reverse side of thepanel 304 b as these effects could make the text difficult to read, but text may be changed from left justified on the front side of thepanel 304 a to right justified on the reverse side of thepanel 304 b. - In addition to the mirrored
original elements panel 304 a, the reverse side of thepanel 304 b includesadditional elements FIG. 3B theadditional elements elements - The additional elements may provide additional functionality such as curation tools, editing tools, and/or additional information. Similarly, the “Editar traducción”
control element 314 may allow a user to provide comments on the translation of the text in thetext element 306 b. The “Info”control element 316 may provide additional information about theimage 308 b, such as, for example, source, contributor, file size, dimensions, image format, geotags, creation date, etc. - In some implementations, input elements associated with the front side of the
panel 304 a may change functions when the user transitions to the reverse side thepanel 304 b. For example, the function of the search/address bar 302 may change when the user transitions to the reverse side of thepanel 304 b. The search/address bar 302 could be animated to appear to rotate simultaneously with the web page. Then, while the user is viewing the reverse side of thepanel 304 b, the input method of the search/address bar 302 could be changed from English to Spanish. This may be particularly useful in cases where the language of the original web page and the language of the translation are based on different character sets (e.g., English and Hebrew, English and Russian, English and Japanese, etc.). - Various additional functions may be implemented for the reverse side of a full web page other than translations of the web page. For example, the reverse side may provide summarized texts of the web page. In some implementations, the reverse side could provide tools for debugging the output of the web page or the browser rendering the web page. The reverse side could also provide source code for the web page (e.g., HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript).

FIG. 4 shows anexample process 400 for providing a user interface with a reversible portion. Theprocess 400 will be described as being performed by a client device such as a mobile telephone (e.g., a smartphone), a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a network appliance, a camera, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, an interactive or so-called “smart” television, a smart watch, a head mounted display device, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. While the steps are illustrated in a particular sequence inFIG. 4 , the steps may be implemented in any suitable sequence. - Initially, in
step 402, the client device outputs a search results page. For example, a user may submit a search query to a search engine using a browser on the client device, and the search engine may provide the search results page in response. Alternatively or in addition, the search engine may provide search results to the client device based on predictions (e.g., using machine learning and/or similar users' behavior) without a user explicitly submitting a search query. - The search results page includes a portion (e.g., a front side of a panel) having one or more elements in a first arrangement, where the one or more elements may include text elements, image elements, input elements, and video elements. In some implementation, the portion may include an advertisement portion having one or more elements in a first arrangement. In some implementations, the search results page may include factual information along with links and/or snippets of various web pages. In some implementations, the search results page may include only factual information without providing links and/or snippets of other web pages.
- Next, in
step 404, the client device receives a command to render a reversed representation of the portion of the search results page (e.g., a reverse side of the panel). The command may be, for example, from a mouseover, a single click, a double click, a gesture (e.g., a touch gesture, a body movement gesture such as head or arm, or an eye gesture such as gaze tracking), a voice action (e.g., “show me more,” “give me details,” or “flip this”), a control element, or any combination of these. In client devices that include an accelerometer and/or gyroscope, the command could be a user initiating a physical flipping motion with the client device. Alternatively or in addition, the command could be generated by the client device without any prompt or action from the user. For example, the command could be based on a timer—if the front side of the panel is visible for more than a predetermined amount of time (e.g., N seconds or N minutes), a transition would be triggered. - The client device then generates the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page in
step 406. The reversed representation includes the one or more elements in a second arrangement that is a mirror image of the first arrangement. The reversed representation includes one or more additional elements aligned with the one or more elements from the front side of the panel, where the one or more additional elements may include text elements, image elements, input elements, or video elements. Each additional element is associated with the respective element with which the respective additional element is aligned. The additional elements may be adjacent to (e.g., above, below, or beside) or overlaid on their associated elements. Some implementations may involve one or more of the elements in the reversed representation being mirrored and/or blurred versions of the respective elements in the original portion of the web page. In implementations that include an advertisement portion on the search results page, the reversed representation may include one or more additional elements that enable a user to purchase a product or service associated with the advertisement portion without leaving the search results page. - The additional elements in the reversed representation (e.g., the reverse side of a panel) may provide various functions to the user related to the respective element the additional element is aligned with. For example, elements on the reverse side associated with a text element may include an input field allowing the user to provide feedback, offer editing suggestions, fill out a questionnaire, or change settings for the text. The reverse side may also display additional information and/or options related to the text such as citations, sources, contributors, editors, information about similar topics, rich media (e.g., images, videos, audio), change history, discussion forums (e.g., live chat, video chat, or message forums), help topics, and/or terms and conditions. Examples of elements on the reverse side that may be associated with a media element, e.g., images or video, may include a histogram and metadata such as source, contributor, file size, dimensions, image format, geotags, creation date, and/or change history. In addition, the reverse side could include information such as similar items, endorsements, reviews/ratings, social media activity, recommendations, and/or report abuse features. For an email, elements on the reverse side could include encoding of the email, routing information and source information. For a file icon, the reverse side could include file information such as size, file type, creation date, modification date, and/or file path. For a specific process with an indication displayed on the front side, the reverse side may show actual processes running or a command line representation listing processes.
- Finally, in
step 408, the client device outputs the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page. Some implementations may involve an animated transition between a display showing the portion of the search results page having the one or more elements in the first arrangement and another display showing the reversed representation of the portion of the search results page. The animated transition may be, for example, rotation about a horizontal axis, rotation about a diagonal axis, a folding animation, or any other suitable animation. - While certain example implementations have been described above with relation to process 400, various alternatives are within the scope of the present specification. For example, while only a single panel is described in relation to process 400, some implementations may involve multiple reversible panels. In such implementations, each of the panels may be independently triggered to transition from the front side to the reverse side. Alternatively or in addition, a subset of the panels may be related such that triggering one of the panels causes all of the panels in the subset to transition from the front side to the reverse side.
- In addition, while described above as being implemented on a search results page, some implementations may involve other types of user interfaces such as other types of web pages or mobile applications. A general implementation may involve a client device that outputs a representation of a first user interface, where the representation of the first user interface includes one or more original elements in a first arrangement. The original elements may include text elements, image elements, and video elements. The client device then receives a command to render a representation of a second user interface. In response, the client device outputs a representation of a second user interface, where the representation of the second user interface includes the original elements in a second arrangement that is a mirror image of the first arrangement. The second user interface also includes one or more additional elements aligned with at least one of the original elements, where each additional element is associated with the respective element with which the respective additional element is aligned.
- Additionally, while described above as having a front side and a reverse side, the reversible portion of the web page as described herein need not be limited to a two-sided object. Some implementations may include a reversible portion represented by a three-dimensional object having multiple sides (e.g., a tetrahedron, cube, or other polyhedron).
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
