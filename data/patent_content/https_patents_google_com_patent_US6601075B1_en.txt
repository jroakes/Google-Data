Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of data processing, and particularly to a software system and associated method adapted for use within a search engine system, to rank search results based on document quality.
- This invention pertains, in particular, to a computer software product and algorithm for retrieving and ranking XML documents and their associated document schemas based on the link relationships among them.
- the World Wide Web is comprised of an expansive network of interconnected computers upon which businesses, governments, groups, and individuals throughout the world maintain inter-linked computer files known as web pages. Users navigate these pages by means of computer software programs commonly known as Internet browsers. Due to the vast number of WWW sites, many web pages have a redundancy of information or share a strong likeness in either function or title. The vastness of the WWW causes users to rely primarily on Internet search engines to retrieve information or to locate businesses. These search engines use various means to determine the relevance of a user-defined search to the information retrieved.
- a typical search engine has an interface with a search window where the user enters an alphanumeric search expression or keywords.
- the search engine sifts through its index of web pages to locate the pages that match the user's search terms.
- the search engine then returns the search results in the form of HTML pages.
- Each set of search results includes a list of individual entries that have been identified by the search engine as satisfying the user's search expression.
- Each entry or “hit” includes a hyperlink that points to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) location or web page.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- a search of web pages using keywords returns an over-abundance of search-results.
- a search for “Harvard” might result in an excessive number of web pages.
- Search engines face the challenge of ranking these results according to the most definitive pages for the search query. Text-based ranking alone will often miss some pages that are relevant to the search.
- the web site www.harvard.edu may not be the one that uses the term “Harvard” most often, most prominently, or in any other way that would favor it under a purely text-based ranking function even when it is the most definitive result for a topic-based search query.
- Hyperlinks encode a considerable amount of human judgment used by various techniques to determine the authority or quality of a page in a specific context.
- Exemplary techniques that use algorithms to exploit the hyperlink structure within HTML pages for this purpose are the HITS and CLEVER methods. These algorithms have been implemented in search environments in order to determine the relevance of HTML pages to user-defined search criteria.
- the HITS method introduces the notions of “authoritative” and “hub” resources.
- An authoritative resource or authority page is one that contains definitive information about a topic. In other words, in the context of search results, it is a high-quality page.
- a hub resource or hub page is one that contains a large number of hyperlinks that point to authoritative pages.
- the HITS algorithm is applied to a set of pages returned by a text-based search (a seed set). The goal is to determine the most authoritative pages and best hub pages in the set. To accomplish this goal, the HITS algorithm makes use of the structure of the in-links (the links into a web page) and the out-links (the links out of a web page) of each of the pages within the set.
- the initial ‘hub’ score of a page is the number of pages linking out of that page, and the initial ‘authority’ score of this page is the number of pages pointing to it.
- the ‘hub’ score for the next iteration is the sum of the ‘authority’ scores of the out-linked pages and the ‘authority’ score is the sum of the ‘hub’ scores of the in-linked pages.
- the iterations are continued until satisfactory convergence for the ‘authority’ and ‘hub’ scores is achieved.
- the pages with the highest ‘hub’ and ‘authority’ scores are identified as the results of the search.
- HITS is the definitive algorithm used to find authoritative resources in a hyperlinked environment.
- the CLEVER method extends the HITS method by taking advantage of the text surrounding hyperlinks. It uses the annotations provided by this text to weight each link and further classify the search results.
- HTML is a mark-up language that describes how to display page information through a web-browser and to link documents up to each other.
- HTML is an instance of SGML (Standardized Markup Language) and is defined by a single document schema or Document Type Definition (DTD).
- DTD Document Type Definition
- the document schema puts forth a set of grammatical rules that define the allowed syntactical structure of an HTML document.
- the schema, or structure of HTML pages, is consistent from page to page. Both the HITS and CLEVER algorithms apply to HTML pages and do not necessarily address documents containing a number of different schemas.
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- SGML SGML
- WWW authors to define schemas for customized mark-up languages to suit their specific needs.
- a shoe manufacturer might create a “shoe” schema to define an XML language to be used to describe shoes.
- the schema might define mark-up tags that include “color”, “size”, “price”, “material”, etc.
- XML documents written in this shoe language will embed semantic, as well as structural, information in the document.
- a shoe XML document uses the mark-up tag “color” to indicate that the shoe is “blue”.
- XML XML
- a business may send XML data that conforms to a predefined schema to another business. If the second business is aware of the first business's schema, it may use a computer program to efficiently process the data. To enable this efficient data interchange and processing, XML requires that standard and high-quality schemas be developed and conformed to, by XML documents.
- the XML framework allows for the definition of document schemas, which give the grammars of particular sets of XML documents (e.g. shoe schema for shoe-type XML documents, resume schema for resume-type XML documents, etc.).
- the XML framework also puts forth a set of structural rules that all XML documents must follow (e.g. open and close tags, etc.).
- Information about the quality of an XML document may be inferred by its conformance with the rules put forth by this XML framework.
- An XML document is said to be “valid” if it has an associated schema and conforms to the rules of the schema.
- An XML document is said to be “well-formed” if it follows the general structural rules for all XML documents. Ultimately, a high quality document has a higher probability of being both “valid” and “well-formed” than a low-quality document.
- XML documents form a hyperlinked environment in which each XML document that has an associated schema provides a link to the schema (if the schema is not defined within the document itself.
- each XML document using various mark-up structures, such as XLink or XPointer, may link up to other XML structures and XML documents.
- the schemas of each hyperlinked document may vary from document to document. A document that satisfies one particular schema can point to a document that satisfies a different schema. Further, two documents with different schemas can point to a document with a third schema. The quality of each schema may vary significantly.
- the HITS and CLEVER algorithms make use of hyperlinked structures to rank documents that share the same schema.
- Exemplary documents with hyperlinked structures are HTML documents.
- XML has given rise to a new hyperlink environment that includes documents with different schemas. In this environment, it will become increasingly important to identify high-quality schemas and documents that correctly use them. Hence, this new environment presents several previously unaddressed issues: ranking documents based on the quality of their associated schema, determining the quality of the schemas themselves, and ranking documents based on their structural properties (e.g. validity, well-formedness, etc.).
- the WWW today calls for a system that finds and identifies authoritative XML-documents that take these factors into account. This need, which makes use of the new dimension added by XML, has heretofore remained unsatisfied.
- the present system and method for identifying authoritative XML schemas and documents includes a ranking manager that satisfies this need.
- the present invention describes a retrieval system using a ranking manager and a method that extend the HITS algorithm by introducing the notions of document schemas and structural conformance to the algorithm. It rates the authority of XML documents and the authority of their associated document schemas based on an enhancement of the iterative algorithm originated by HITS.
- the present invention provides an algorithm which is applied to an initial set of documents. For example, a search for a topic (e.g. shoe) on the web might produce a large number of responses, or “hits”, of XML documents.
- the initial seed set includes these search results.
- the seed set includes all the XML documents linking into and out of these hits.
- the seed set also includes all schemas used by these XML documents in the expanded set.
- One goal of such an embodiment is to order these documents and their schemas by their authority (i.e., quality or reliability of search results) and hub scores.
- a document that is a good authority is a definitive representative of the search topic.
- a document that is a good hub links to a large number of documents that are good authorities.
- good authorities are linked to from a large number of good hubs.
- Good authorities have a high authority score.
- good hubs contain a large number of links to good authority documents.
- a good hub document has a high hub score.
- the present invention introduces the notion of an authoritative schema.
- a schema is said to be authoritative if it is used by a large number of authoritative pages and by a large number of good hub pages.
- An authoritative schema has a high authority score.
- the ranking manager of the present invention uses a ranking software program, algorithm, or module, that is based on a base iterative algorithm, such as the HITS and/or CLEVER algorithms.
- the base algorithm maintains a hub score, h(d), and an authority score, a(d), for each document, d. It initializes these scores to some constant and recomputes them through a sequence of iterations.
- the ranking algorithm recomputes the hub score, h(d), of each document by replacing it with the sum of authority scores of the documents to which it points.
- the ranking algorithm replaces the authority score, a(d), of each document with the sum of the hub scores of the documents that point to it.
- the base algorithm reiterates these steps until the difference among the hub scores, and/or the difference among the authority scores, in each iteration converge to a predetermined value such as 0.
- the above described base algorithm has been used to find authoritative resources in hyperlinked environments, specifically HTML documents.
- XML introduces new dimensions to this analysis of authoritative resources.
- the present invention enhances the notation of authoritative resources based on the following observations.
- the quality of schemas provides a new source of information about the quality of the hyperlinked documents that use them. For example, the conformance of a document to a high-quality industry-standard schema confers on it a degree of authority.
- the correctness of document structure provides information about its reliability.
- a hyperlinked document's structure, such as its validity and/or well-formedness adds weight to its authority.
- Third, the characteristics of a set of XML documents that share a common schema provide information about the quality of the shared schema.
- schema X For example, if all documents that use a schema X are malformed and not valid, schema X will lose credibility as a good schema. Moreover, if only a handful of documents about shoes use schema X, while the rest of the documents about shoes use schema Y, it may be inferred that schema Y is a better schema than schema X. In this case, schema Y has more authority than schema X.
- the iterative process of the present invention enhances the base algorithm to account for the attributes of document structure, which provide additional information about the document quality, and to account for the authority scores of the schemas that the documents use.
- the ranking manager adds weights to the hub and authority scores of each XML document based on document validity and well-formedness, and further introduces the notion of authoritative document schemas. Consequently, the ranking manager introduces a third step to the iterative process that computes and incorporates the authority score of these document schemas.
- the ranking manager in addition to maintaining the hub and authority scores for each XML document, also maintains, for each schema, s, an authority score, a(s).
- the ranking manager begins by initializing the hub score, h(d), and authority score, a(d), of each XML document to a weighted value based on the document's validity and well-formedness. It initializes the authority score, a(s), of each schema, s, to 0 or some constant.
- Each iteration includes the following three steps: (1) The ranking manager recomputes the authority score, a(s), of each schema used by the XML documents in the pool by adjusting it with a normalized sum of the hub scores of the documents that use the schema and the authority scores of the documents that use the schema; (2) it recomputes the hub score, h(d), for each XML document, d, in the pool by adjusting it with a normalized sum of the authority scores of the documents that it points to and the authority score of the schema that it uses; and (3) it recomputes the authority score, a(d), of each XML document in the pool by adjusting it with a normalized sum of the hub scores of the XML documents that point to it and the authority score of the schema that it uses.
- the ranking manager reiterates over these three steps until the difference between the scores computed from one iteration to the next reaches a predetermined threshold value or converge to 0.
- the ranking manager ranks the documents and their schemas according to these computed values.
- the authoritative XML document and schema identifying system (or ranking manager) of the present invention provides several features and advantages, among which are the following:

- FIG. 1 portrays the overall environment in which a ranking manager 10 according to the present invention may be used.
- the ranking manager 10 includes a software or computer program product that is typically embedded within, or installed on a host server 15 .
- the ranking manager 10 can be saved on a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices. While the ranking manager 10 will be described in connection with the WWW, the ranking manager 10 can be used with a stand-alone database of terms that may have been derived from the WWW and/or other sources.
- the cloud-like communication network 20 is comprised of communication lines and switches connecting servers such as servers 25 , 27 , to gateways such as gateway 30 .
- the servers 25 , 27 and the gateway 30 provide the communication access to the WWW Internet.
- Users, such as remote Internet users are represented by a variety of computers such as computers 35 , 37 , 39 , and can query the host server 15 for the desired information.
- the host server 15 is connected to the network 20 via a communications link 42 such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link.
- the servers 25 , 27 can be connected via high speed Internet network lines 44 , 46 to other computers and gateways.
- the servers 25 , 27 provide access to stored information such as hypertext or web documents indicated generally at 50 , 55 , and 60 .
- the hypertext documents 50 , 55 , 60 most likely include embedded hypertext link to other locally stored pages, and hypertext links 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 to other webs sites or documents 55 , 60 that are stored by various web servers such as the server 27 .
- the hypertext documents 50 , 55 , 60 can be represented as the WWW 20 in FIG. 2 .
- Searches on the WWW are performed by the search service provider 100 that generally comprises a web crawler 200 , a search engine repository 210 , an indexing engine 220 , a query transformer 230 , a search engine 240 , a search results transformer 250 , and an indexed data repository 260 .
- the crawler 150 crawls the WWW 20 and downloads web documents to the search engine repository 210 where they are stored and updated systematically.
- the indexing engine 220 indexes the XML web documents, their document data types (DTDs), and the linking relationships for all of the indexed documents.
- the indexed data is stored in the indexed data repository 260 for later use by the search engine 240 , as appropriate.
- the search engine repository 210 is a data store maintained by a web information gatherer such as the web crawler 200 .
- the search engine repository 210 maintains information or metadata from previously encountered web pages. This metadata is used by the indexing engine 220 to prepare the index.
- the search engine repository 210 is maintained centrally by the search service provider 100 .
- the search engine repository 210 may be located and maintained on an independently provided system to which the search service provider 100 has access.
- the ranking manager 10 is described as including two repositories 210 and 260 , it should be clear these two repositories 210 and 260 could be functionally combined in a single database.
- the indexing engine 220 generates a description for each web document from the metadata stored in the search engine repository 210 .
- the query transformer 230 prompted by the user browser 140 , applies an internal query request to the indexed data stored in the indexed data repository 260 , and generates a search result with matches (or query results) 270 that are specific to the user's query.
- the ranking manager 10 expands the initial query results, or seed set, to find all documents that link into and out of the query result set.
- the ranking manager 10 then applies a module that uses an algorithm for identifying authoritative XML schemas and documents on the expanded seed set and returns a sub-set of the expanded seed set that contain the documents with the highest authority scores, in the order of the documents' authority scores.
- the search service provider 100 transforms them into viewable form (i.e., HTML) that can be browsed by means of the query transformer 230 .
- the transformed query results are subsequently presented to the user at the user interface (UI) or browser 140 .
- FIG. 3 shows a more detailed description of the method of operation of the ranking manager 10 for identifying authoritative XML schemas and documents.
- the search engine 240 (FIG. 2) generates a seed set of documents from the search results at step 305 .
- Each document of the seed set has a document schema.
- the schema may be a DTD.
- the ranking manager 10 expands the seed set of documents into an expanded set of documents at step 310 , by crawling the document's links and including all the documents that point to the seed set of documents found at step 305 .
- Step 310 5 is optional as the ranking manager 10 may alternatively use a look-up table in the search engine repository 210 that stores the links to the seed set of documents.
- the expanded set of documents is stored in a temporary repository at step 315 .
- the ranking manager 10 uses the following three factors to initialize the hub and authority scores of the XML documents: valid, well formed, and other.
- the document is said to be valid if it follows the schema of the document.
- the document is said to be well-formed if it follows a good document structure; for example, all elements contains open and close tags.
- the document obtains a score “other” based on its text-match with the terms in the search query.
- Alternative embodiments may use different criteria to determine the score “other.”
- the ranking manager 10 recomputes the authority score, a(s), for each schema, s, used by the XML documents in the expanded set, by adjusting it with the a normalized sum of the hub scores of the XML documents that use it and the sum of the authority scores of the XML documents that use it.
- the ranking manager 10 recomputes the authority score, a(d), of each XML document in the expanded set by adjusting it with a normalized sum of the hub scores of the XML documents that points to it and the authority score of the schema that it uses.
- the ranking manager 10 recomputes the hub score, h(d), for each XML document, d, in the set by adjusting it with a normalized sum of the authority scores of the documents that it points to and the authority score of the schema that it uses.
- the ranking manager 10 inquires at step 340 if it should iterate again, based, for example, on whether or not the threshold for the difference in the hub scores h(d) and the threshold for the difference in the authority scores a(s) of successive iterations have not been reached. These thresholds would be considered reached if all the following conditions hold true:
- the difference between the authority scores a(s) computed at the current step 325 and the authority scores a(s) computed at step 325 of the previous iteration (or computed at step 320 if the current step is the first iteration) is less than a predetermined threshold value, for example a constant C 1 ,
- the difference between the authority scores a(d) computed at the current step 330 and the authority scores a(d) computed at step 330 of the previous iteration (or computed at step 320 if the current step is the first iteration) is less than a predetermined threshold value, for example a constant C 2 , and
- the difference between the hub scores h(d) computed at the current step 335 and the hub scores h(d) computed at step 335 of the previous iteration (or computed at step 320 if the current step is the first iteration) is less than a predetermined threshold value, for example a constant C 3 .
- the ranking manager 10 proceeds to step 325 and repeats steps 325 , 330 and 335 . Otherwise, if the determination at decision step 340 is negative and all the thresholds have been reached, the ranking manager 10 selects the orders the documents by the hub scores h(d) and authority scores a(d) and their schemas by authority scores a(s) at step 345 .
- FIG. 4 shows a sample relationship, between hub documents and authority documents.
- Hub documents are designated as H 1 , H 2 , H 3 and H 4 .
- Authority documents are designated as A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , and A 4 .
- the arrows between the documents represent links.
- a good hub document is a document that points to a document that is reliable and relevant, i.e., one that has high authority.
- a document with high authority is pointed to by good hubs or documents.
- a good hub document has a high hub score, and a good authority document has a high authority score.
- the ranking manager 10 uses Xlinks and Xpointers for link identification among XML to documents.
- the Xlinks, or extended links are semantic links that can be used to identify semantic relationships between documents.
- the attributes of these links can be used to weight the authority and hub scores based upon the topic of interest. If the topic of interest is “play”, links with “role”, “act”, or “stage” as attributes would have higher weights than those with unrelated attributes.
- h k (d i ) be the hub score of d i
- ak(d i ) be the authority score of d i
- ak(s i ) be the authority score of s i on iteration k.
- a k ( s i ) f (sum( a k ⁇ 1 ( d j )))+ f (sum( h k ⁇ 1 ( d j
- a k ( d i ) f ( a k ⁇ 1 ( d i ))+ f (sum( h k ⁇ 1 ( d j )))+ f ( a k ( s j )),
- sj schema used by di and f is some normalizing function.
- h k (d i ) f ( h k ⁇ 1 ( d i ))+ f (sum( a k ( d j )))+ f ( a k ( s j )), where
- the documents d 0 , d 1 , and d 2 use schema s 0
- documents d 3 and d 4 use schema s 1 .
- the initial hub and authority scores, h(d) and a(d), respectively, for each document may be determined based on the following scores:
- the ranking manager 10 Considering the 5 documents d 0 -d 4 , the ranking manager 10 generates the scores illustrated by the following Table II:
- the ranking manager 10 recomputes the authority scores a(s) for each schema s i , based on the normalized sums of hub scores h(d) and authority scores a(d) of each document that uses it (step 320 ). For this example, the ranking manager 10 adds all of the hub and authority scores of the documents that point to the schema s i , divides it by the twice the number of these documents (to normalize the result) and replaces the authority score with the resulting value a(s), as illustrated by the following Table III:
- the ranking manager 10 calculates the authority scores a(d) for each document d by adding to the last authority score, a(d), the sum of the hub scores h(d) of each document that points to the current document (from step 320 ), and the authority score a(s) for the schema (step 325 ) that the current document uses.
- the ranking manager 10 divides this sum by the number of documents that point to the current document plus 1 for the schema and 1 for the document itself, as illustrated by the following Table IV:
- the ranking manager 10 calculates the hub scores h(d) for each document by adding to its hub score h(d) (step 320 ) to the sum of the authority scores a(d) (step 330 ) of each document that it points to and the authority score a(s) for the schema (step 325 ) that the document uses, divided by the number of documents it points to plus 1 for the schema and 1 for itself, as illustrated by the following Table V:
- the ranking manager 10 repeats steps 325 through 335 of the first iteration and adjusts each of the scores as described above. Steps 325 through 340 for the second and subsequent iterations are similar to those of the first iteration. The ranking manager 10 continues to adjust the scores by iterating steps 325 through 340 until no changes occur in the scores, or until the predetermined difference thresholds are reached.
