- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of selected elements of an embodiment of a method for harvesting application metadata
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of selected elements of an embodiment of a computing device.
- Web applications Many users of public networks, such as the Internet, interact with web applications by using a browser. Web applications also reach many users of wireless devices. The user interaction with web applications may generate metadata that describe some characteristic, for example purchasing behavior, preference, or location of the user.
- One avenue for monetizing metadata generated by web applications involves aggregating and harvesting the metadata for advertising purposes, such as identifying advertising target groups based on specific criteria.
- Web 2.0 refers to “Web 2.0” as a perceived second generation of web development and design, that aims to facilitate communication, secure information sharing, interoperability, and collaboration on the World Wide Web.
- Web 2.0 concepts have led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, hosted services, and applications; such as social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs, and the like.
- the disclosed subject matter includes a metadata collection approach suitable for a Web 2.0 environment in which a number of dedicated, special purpose, and/or independently developed web applications, operating independently of one another on the web.
- a disclosed method for harvesting application metadata includes receiving metadata from a web application.
- the metadata is indicative of a characteristic of a user of the web application and/or a context of the user/application interaction.
- the metadata may be stored to a metadata collection that includes an identifier of the web application user and web application user metadata generated by a plurality of other web applications.
- the method may further include characterizing one or more advertisements and, based on the characterization of the advertisements and the metadata collection, determining an affinity between the advertisements and the web application user.
- the affinity indication may be stored to a storage device and disclosed to a source of the advertisements for a fee.
- web application users are identified as potential targets for the advertisement if the affinity exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- the set of potential targets may then be disclosed to a source of the advertisement for a fee.
- the metadata may be provided from the metadata collection to potential advertisers directly.
- the metadata collection service may provide advertisements to the identified candidates on behalf of the advertisement sources.
- the fee charged may be based at least in part on a magnitude of the affinity. For example, the fee associated with identifying highly relevant potential targets may be higher than the fee for less relevant targets.
- the metadata itself, may include chronological information indicative of when the user interaction occurs and/or location information indicative of a geographic location associated with the user interaction.
- the user characteristic that the metadata is indicative of may include a user preference, a user interest, a user's consumption, or a user's behavior.
- the operation of receiving metadata may be performed for a first plurality of users and each of the first plurality of users may correspond to one of a first plurality of user metadata collections.
- Some embodiments include compensating an author of, owner of, or other entity associated with a web application for providing the metadata. These embodiments would employ a technique for tracking the owners of various applications. Compensation may accrue when metadata is used to select an advertisement for a user or to identify a user as a potential target of an advertisement.
- the method further includes receiving monetary compensation for responding to the request for an advertisement target group.
- the method may further include providing monetary compensation for receiving the metadata.
- a disclosed database server for harvesting application metadata includes a processor, and memory media, accessible to the processor, in which processor executable instructions are embedded or otherwise stored.

- the metadata database may include user metadata gathered from a plurality of user applications.
- a vendor or advertiser may specify advertising criteria and the instructions may be operable to determine from the metadata database whether the user matches the advertising criteria.
- the instructions may include instructions executable to inform the vendor or advertiser of a potential target and/or return at least a portion of the user metadata profile or affinity information to the vendor or advertiser.
- the received metadata may include information indicative of at least one of when and where the user interaction occurred.
- the network adapter may be coupled to a wireless network, wherein the user application executes on a wireless communication device.
- the instructions may be executable to record a credit for responding to the request.
- the instructions may further be executable to record a charge for receiving the metadata.
- the charge may be at least one of a credit and a debit.
- the instructions may further be executable to notify the web application that the received metadata was used to match the advertisement criteria.
- a service for advertising using application metadata includes, in response to receiving a first request for advertising specifying an advertising criteria, sending a second request for a target group satisfying the advertising criteria, and recording an indication of at least one of the first and second requests to a storage device.
- the service may further include receiving a plurality of identifiers for a respective plurality of individuals included in the target group, wherein each of the plurality of individuals are included in the target group based on an affinity between metadata collected from a plurality of web applications and an advertisement or a set of advertisement criteria.
- the service may include sending an indication of the plurality of identifiers in the target group.
- the service may further include recording a first charge for sending a response to the first request, and recording a second charge for receiving a response to the second request.
- the first and the second charge may be at least one of a debit and a credit.

- each of the plurality of identifiers may be at least one of a network address, a network identity, a digital certificate, a network location, an electronic marketplace identity, a wireless service identifier, and an email address.
- the method may involve selecting an advertisement for a particular user from an inventory of potential advertisements when the opportunity to present an advertisement to the user arises, such as when the user is enjoying a broadcast, podcast or visiting a website. Selection of the advertisement for that user is based on an affinity score and other criteria (e.g., the amount that different advertisers are willing to pay for a given degree of affinity).
- the affinity score is derived from metadata associated with the advertisements, as supplied by the advertisers, and from the metadata associated with the user, as stored in the metadata database. Selection of an advertisement may result in a charge to the advertiser and compensation to the metadata sources that supplied user metadata relevant to the selection of the advertisement.
- disclosed computer-readable memory media include processor executable instructions for implementing a web application for interacting with users of the Internet.

- the instructions may further be executable to receive a receipt recording monetary compensation for the generated metadata from at least one of: an entity associated with the metadata database, an advertiser configured to access the metadata database, and a vendor ordering advertisements based on the metadata database.
- a disclosed computer program product comprising computer readable storage media including instructions for harvesting metadata, includes instructions for receiving metadata each of a plurality of web applications where the metadata is indicative of a characteristic of a user of the corresponding application.
- the metadata from the plurality of web applications is collected, for a specified user, in a user profile.
- an affinity between a user profile and the item is determined and information based on the affinity information is disseminated to a vendor of the product or service.
- the affinity is indicative of a relevance of the item to the user.
- the computer program product may further include compensating an entity associated with the applicable web application when metadata information relevant to a particular item is included or otherwise used. Disseminating information based on the affinity information may include indicating whether a particular user is a member of a target group or indicating which of a set of advertisements is suitable for a specified user.
- a computing device including a processor and memory or other type of storage accessible to the processor, includes a program in the form of processor executable instructions for harvesting metadata.
- the computer program instructions include instructions for grouping metadata received from a plurality of web applications into user profiles. Each user profile represents metadata for a corresponding user, the metadata being indicative of a characteristic of a web application user.
- An affinity between a user represented by a user profile and a product or service represented by an advertisement or advertisement criteria is determined. Based on the determined affinity, targeted marketing information is made available to a vendor and the applicable web application owners are compensated based on a value of metadata provided by their respective web applications.
- Making targeted marketing information available includes providing an indication of a group of users having affinities exceeding a specified threshold. Making targeted marketing information available may also include determining from a group of advertisements which advertisements are best suited for a specified user.
