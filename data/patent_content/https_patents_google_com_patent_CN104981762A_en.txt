In some implementations, rating engine 221 inquires about isomerism data source for the candidate content item relevant with search terms, receives candidate content item, and by candidate content item compared with model, to determine whether user finds that candidate content item is very interesting.In some implementations, isomerism data source comprises search engine 143, entertainment server 137, electronic message server 141, rating server 139, social networking service device 101 and third-party server 137 as illustrated in fig. ia.
When request is for user, from the interest of user, social connections and in some implementations from the nearest search terms inputted by user to obtain inquiry.When request is for channel, inquire about the topic and keyword that comprise for channel.In some implementations, rating engine 221 also uses the related environmental cues transmitted from environment module 213 to tail off further to make the number of candidate content item.
In some implementations, first rating engine 221 performs inquiry, then by result compared with model, to determine whether user finds that candidate content item is very interesting.In some implementations, these steps are performed simultaneously.In some implementations, candidate content item compared with model, is then carried out filter result according to the theme of inquiry by rating engine 211.
Rating engine 211 can mate based on the social relevance between project with user and interest determines interest.Social correlativity can be used, may to the interested possibility of project (such as have similar Demographics other people how to make a response to project) to measure user based on the information of the socialgram from user.Such as, assuming that user stays in the U.S. and likes pop music, user may be interested in the content item relevant with the new artist of Artist X by name.Content-based item and the similarity of model are identified project and to be mated with the interest of user.
By calculating the measurement interest of must assigning to being used for each candidate content item.In some implementations, history is fed to (feed) and is incorporated in scoring by rating engine 211 alternately.In some implementations, not show candidate project, unless their candidate score exceedes certain threshold value.Once calculate the score and threshold value be exceeded, then rating engine 211 generates the content flow for user be sorted according to candidate content item score.
In some implementations, rating engine 211 can also be that each project in content flow generates and explains for display.Explain and be presented in every way, comprise the label (such as skiing) of the theme of content item or more detailed explanation (such as your friend likes this section of article).Other explain that comprising content item mates with particular user interests or similar to the other guide item that user has approved of in the past.User may be used for further refined model to the reaction explained.
In some implementations, rating engine 211 can carry out personalization to the channel of user.Rating engine 211 inquires about the content item in the content flow of channel in channel based on the topic of channel.Rating engine 211 receives the candidate content item with match query.In some implementations, the content item from channel engine 220 to rating engine 211 direct transmission channel.In some implementations, rating engine 221 is based on the topic of channel and keyword query candidate content item in data storage server 265 (below discuss about Fig. 2) or storer 237.
Candidate content item compared with model, and uses a model and calculates score for each candidate content item based on user to the interest of candidate content item by rating engine 211.In some implementations, rating engine 211 is from environment module 213 reception environment clue and environment for use clue reduces the number of candidate content item further.
In some implementations, rating engine 211 is according to the set of from the candidate content item chosen content item of must assigning to of content item.Rating engine 211 identifies the content flow of content item in selected content item and user, from the set of selected content item, remove the content item of repetition, and generate the content flow (channel of the personalization of such as user) of channel according to the content item of selected user.In some implementations, rating engine 211 will be used for the channel allocation of the personalization of user in the whole content flow being used for user.
Still with reference to Figure 1B, collaborative filtering engine 217 can be comprise for being used by collaborative filtering social assembly to generate additional candidate content item and transmitting the software of routine of the other candidate content item obtained from collaborative filtering to rating engine 211.In some implementations, collaborative filtering engine 217 can be by the executable instruction set of processor 235, to provide the function for generating additional candidate content item described below.In some implementations, collaborative filtering engine 217 can be stored in the storer 237 of computing equipment 200 and to be may have access to by processor 235 and can be performed.In some implementations, collaborative filtering engine 217 can be adapted to via bus 221 and processor 235 and computing equipment other assembly cooperations with communicate.
Collaborative filtering engine 217 can obtain social relevant candidate content item from the content flow of user, and the content flow of user has party from user with it and obtains, and collaborative filtering engine 217 transmits candidate content item to rating engine 211.Collaborative filtering engine 217 receives the information relevant with relation from social Figure 179.Such as, the people sending electronic information continually from the friend social networks or user Xiang Qi obtains the content flow of user.Someone seems more important for user, and user is larger to the interested possibility of content item.Therefore, in some implementations, weight is applied to candidate content item based on the social networks of user and friend by collaborative filtering engine 217.Such as, compared with the candidate content item of the second generation friend (friend of such as friend) from user, the candidate content item being generated by the user as friend or consumed receives higher weight.
When user is energetically in response to project, collaborative filtering engine 217 can increase the weight of the candidate content item be applied to from friend.Such as, when user comment project or indicating user find that project is very interesting, collaborative filtering engine 217 increases the weight of this friend, with the part making the more candidate content item from this friend become the content flow of user.
Channel engine 220 can be comprise for giving birth to newsy channel, retrieving candidate content item based on topic and keyword, generating the content flow of channel and utilize the content flow of channel to fill the software of the routine of channel according to candidate content item.In some implementations, channel engine 220 can be by the executable instruction set of processor 235, to provide the function that the following describes for generating the channel that the content flow that utilizes channel is filled.In some implementations, channel engine 220 can be stored in the storer 237 of computing equipment 200 and to be may have access to by processor 235 and can be performed.In arbitrary realization, channel engine 220 can be adapted to via bus 221 and processor 235 and computing equipment 200 other assembly cooperations with communicate.
In some implementations, channel engine 220 can determine the topic (such as bicyclist) of channel and keyword corresponding to mark (such as bicycle, bicycle, ride, step on row, bicycle, cycling, player).In some implementations, channel engine 220 from third party or individual reception for creating the request of channel.The request creating channel comprises topic, and may comprise the concise and to the point description that channel engine 220 uses to generate the channel of keyword.Such as, channel engine 220 receives the request of the channel for creating the topic about bird.In some implementations, channel engine 220 determines the keyword of this channel of bird, such as bird, parrot, cockatiel, hawk, cat owl, pigeon etc.Channel engine 220 generates the channel being used for determined topic.
Channel engine 220 can be come, for candidate content item inquiry isomerism data source, to receive candidate content item based on keyword, and the set of from the candidate content item chosen content item of must assigning to according to content item overall.In some implementations, overall score represents candidate content item popularity between users (such as based on clicking, check, unique views, grading, again to share or another of instruction popularity is measured).The example of isomerism data source comprises search engine 143, entertainment server 137, electronic message server 141, rating server 139, social networking service device 101 and third-party server 107.From the keyword associated with topic to obtain inquiry.Such as, the topic due to channel is gourmet, therefore channel engine for comprising cuisines, the project in culinary art and restaurant carrys out query search engine 143.
In some implementations, first channel engine 220 performs inquiry based on keyword, then according to their overall selection result of must assigning to.Such as, the set of channel engine 220 chosen content item from candidate content item, each content item has the overall score meeting threshold value.In some implementations, perform inquiry simultaneously and select, such as, channel engine 220 must be assigned to for candidate content item inquiry isomerism data source based on keyword and the overall of association thereof.Such as, channel engine 220 for comprise word skiing and the project had higher than the overall score of threshold quantity carrys out data query storage server (not shown).Data storage server is further described below with reference to Fig. 2.In some implementations, channel engine 220 must assign to select from candidate content item based on they overall and then according to keyword filter result.In a lot of examples in these examples, channel engine 220 receives the set of the candidate content item relevant to popular topic.
Channel engine 220 uses selected content item to generate the content flow of channel, and uses the content flow of channel to fill channel.Once establishment channel, channel engine 220 to the content flow of subscriber interface module 230 transmission channel, for be incorporated into user display user interface in.In some implementations, content flow is stored in the storer 237 for data storage server 265.
In some implementations, channel engine 220 is (such as per hour, every day, weekly or monthly) more new channel periodically, and invites and acceptor adds channel as member/user.In some implementations, channel engine 220 also receives input or activity by subscriber interface module 230 from user, and in channel, issue these activities.
In some implementations, channel engine 220 based on the content of the submission for user reaction and according to one or more rule meet level determine the reputation of each user in channel.Channel engine 220 distributes indicating user whether believable reputation to each user.In some implementations, user reputation based on user whether submit to other users read, viewing or by submit to comment or by providing the content of the threshold number instruction of the approval of content being carried out to the reaction of affirmative.Such as, channel engine 220 distributes instruction reliable high reputation when user exceedes threshold value.In another example, channel engine 220 distributes instruction reliable low reputation when user exceedes threshold value.
Channel engine 220 determines whether in channel, issue the content item submitted to by user based on the reputation of user, and arranges the content item in the content flow of channel according to the grading of content.In some implementations, channel engine 220 automatically issues the content item submitted to by the user with high reputation in channel.In some implementations, the user that channel engine 220 is asked edition owner or had a high reputation ratifies to issue the content item from the user with low reputation.
Channel engine 220 also deletes the discarded content item or project that are older than certain hour section (such as month).In some implementations, channel engine 220 identifies the content item in the content flow of content item in the content flow of channel and user, removes the content item of repetition, and be assigned in the content flow of user by the content flow of channel from the content flow of channel.In some implementations, channel engine 220 to the content flow of rating engine 211 transmission channel to remove repetition.
In some implementations, channel engine 220 is based on the topic of the next further refinement channel of activity of user.In some implementations, channel is divided into two or more channels with associated topic by channel engine 220.Such as, channel engine 220 creates two new channels according to gourmet's channel: for a channel of vegetarian diet gourmet, for another channel of carnivorous gourmet.In some implementations, the new channel with narrow topic is obtained based on user feedback from current channel.In some implementations, channel engine 220 generates the new channel being used for narrow topic, such as, according to the vegetarian diet channel that gourmet's channel generates.
The disclosed content flow with multiple user is called as channel and can be used for other users.User adds channel, and channel looks like a part for the content flow of user.In some implementations, channel is storage area (bucket), and when each content item is placed in storage area, project is routed to user by channel engine 220 automatically.In some implementations, user selects the channel button generated by subscriber interface module 230 to check the project in storage area.
There is the modes realizing channel different in 3: (1) algorithm channel; (2) (moderated) channel is arbitrated; And (3) non-arbitration (un-moderated) channel.User's input information creates algorithm channel for specified common set about the different entity of the content of special interests and source (such as 5,15,20 etc.).Other users subscribe to channel by following or indicating them to ratify content flow.There is other implementations.Such as, channel can be the mixing of two or more modes in described mode.
For arbitration channel, specify at least one edition owner.In some implementations, the founder of channel is appointed as edition owner automatically.Other edition owners are specified via user interface.Subscriber interface module 230 present there is candidate content item edition owner to be included in the channel from each place, each place comprise with for the project of match query of specifying interest and other users.When edition owner ratifies candidate content item, it appears in the content flow of channel.Other users approval project provide content to channel by indicating them in their content flow.Content flow from other users is designated as alternating content stream, until edition owner ratifies or refuses them.
For non-arbitration channel, any user can add channel and carry out the content flow add items to channel by approval project.The project of approval is sorted by their overall score, and subsequently in response to receive the project of a lot of view, the instruction of approval and from the user of the member as channel comment and be modified.Rearrange content item by the response according to user, effectively arbitrate the content flow of channel.
Subscriber interface module 230 can be the software of the routine comprised for generating the instruction for showing user interface on subscriber equipment 115, user interface comprises the content flow of user, it comprises the channel stream of whole content flow content, user interface receives user feedback, user is allowed to add or remove clear and definite interest, and generate small tool to show on website, it comprises the option for the article in shared channel.User interface can be shown the part as Another Application (such as social networks), or as its oneself independently application.In some implementations, subscriber interface module 230 can be by the executable instruction set of processor 235, to provide the function of the content flow that the following describes for providing user or channel.In some implementations, subscriber interface module 230 can be stored in the storer 237 of computing equipment 200, and be may have access to by processor 235 and can be performed.In some implementations, subscriber interface module 230 be adapted to via bus 221 and processor 235 and computing equipment 200 other assembly cooperations with communicate.The operation describing subscriber interface module 230 in more detail below with reference to Fig. 3 A-11 and the user interface generated by it.
Fig. 2 is that diagram is for the block diagram of generating content stream for the implementation of the system of display.In diagram implementation, the assembly of content application 103 is divided between each server, to make process information efficiently.Illustrated system comprises search server 135, entertainment server 137, rating server 139, electronic message server 141, content obtaining pipeline 250, data storage server 265, model server 255, scoring server 260, social Figure 179, social interaction server device 270 and content application 103.
In some implementations, isomerism data source (such as search server 135, entertainment server 137, rating server 139 and electronic message server 141) is creeped by content obtaining pipeline 250.In some implementations, isomerism data source is to content obtaining pipeline 250 transferring content item.
Content obtaining pipeline 250 comprises the processing module 202 for utilizing specific markers (the overall score that such as characteristic sum is generated by rating engine 211) to carry out notes content item, and the data that process is relevant with User Activity.In some implementations, the user agreeing to data acquisition is obeyed in activity described herein.Once notes content item, processing module 202 just transmits data to data storage server 265.The feature of each content item of data storage server 265 index and they are stored at least one database.In some implementations, organising content items is carried out: sign format (SourceType#UniqueItemID according to the following, such as " VIDEOSERVICE#video_id " and " NEWS#doc_id "), static nature (the such as title of maintenance project, content, classifying content etc.) project static nature row, behavioral characteristics (the such as overall score of maintenance project, clicks, follow number etc.) project behavioral characteristics row, wherein source arranges (the newspaper A in such as news as source (src) static nature of the publisher of project, video uploader A etc. in video host site A), the src behavioral characteristics row of the behavioral characteristics in maintenance source, be kept for the activity description row of activity of constructing, and be kept for the scoring feature of the message that user marks.
In some implementations, data storage server 256 dynamically progressively stops content item.Such as, news item lost efficacy at 24 hours later, and video lost efficacy after 48 hours, and feed is kept 24 hours, or kept only 10 nearest projects, and all the other projects are progressively stopped.
Content obtaining pipeline 250 also to scoring server 260 transferring content item, for overall user's classification.Transmit overall score from scoring server 260 to data storage server 265, it stores the overall score be associated with content item.Overall situation score is very useful for the content item in organising data storage server 265.
Present steering model server 255, model server 255 receives User Activity from processing module 202 or data storage server 265.Model generation engine 207 carrys out generation model based on user's input and/or prior actions.Model server 255 periodically or when asking to scoring server 260 mode.
In some implementations, in response to receiving the request for the content flow of user or the request for channel from user, scoring server 260 asks model.Scoring server 260 receives model from model server 255.Scoring server 260 is asked from socialgram 279 and receives user candidate.Scoring server 260 is asked from data storage server 265 and receives candidate content item.Scoring server 260 is asked from the collaborative filtering engine 217 be stored in social interaction server device 270 and receives the candidate content item from user connected people in social Figure 179.Candidate content item from social interaction server device 270 is marked in advance, and in some implementations, the candidate content item of not reading is saved in the high-speed cache on social interaction server device 270.The amount upgraded due to social activity may be enough large, and make during the write time, perform scoring and realize reading faster, therefore these projects are saved to high-speed cache.
Rating engine 211 by candidate content item compared with model, and to alternating content item rating.When the candidate content item from social interaction server device 270, rating engine 211 receives candidate content item from social interaction server device 270, by candidate content item compared with model, and again marks to candidate content item according to model.Rating engine 211 generates the content flow of user based on the candidate content item of having marked, and transmits the content flow for user to content application 103.
Content application 103 comprises channel engine 220 as described above and subscriber interface module 230, and this subscriber interface module 230 receives the content flow of user from scoring server 260 and shows it in the user interface.In some implementations, subscriber interface module 230 generates small tool, shows on third party website, and this small tool allows user can share content with channel.In addition, subscriber interface module 230 provides user interface to user, and this user interface, for commenting on content item, retrieves the additional information about specific content item, transition between different content item, and takes various action about content item.
With reference now to Fig. 3 A-3K, the figure describing the various realizations of the user interface 300 of present disclosure represents.Subscriber interface module 230 advantageously provides the user interface 300 comprising the fluid network lattice structure with multiple districts sheet.Although describe interface 300 in the environment of the 2x 2 grid implementation of district's sheet, but should be appreciated that different grid increments can be possible.Fig. 3 A-3H illustrates wherein grid increment and is 2x 2 and the implementation that there is the user interface 300 of three possible district's sheet sizes (small-sized, medium and large-scale).In this example as shown in Figure 3A, user interface 300 has the size that roughly two small-sized district sheets are multiplied by 2 small-sized district sheets.Therefore, as shown in Figure 3A, assuming that the content item that will present in user interface 300 is represented by four small-sized district sheets, then district's sheet A302, B 304, C 306 and D308 be arranged to cover user interface 300 can the grid of most 2x 2 of viewing area.But user interface 300 also allows district's sheet of medium sized district sheet and size.Medium sized district sheet is roughly the twice of the size of small-sized district sheet; Therefore, width can be two small-sized district sheets and vertical direction (vertically) be a small-sized district sheet, or width can be a small-sized district sheet and vertical direction is two small-sized district sheets.The example of such district's sheet is shown in Fig. 3 C (see district sheet A 302) and Fig. 3 D (see district sheet B 304) respectively.These district's sheets can be positioned in tip position in user interface 300, bottom position, leftward position or right positions place.The twice of the size of community Pian Shi median size district sheet greatly, or four times of the size of small-sized district sheet.In Fig. 3 H (see district sheet A 302), example is shown.As described in more detail with reference to figure 9 to 11 below, the system and method for present disclosure advantageously comes selection area sheet size and sheet position, district based on the attribute of the content item presented to user.Therefore, the network shown in Fig. 3 A-3K is dynamic at least two.The first, each attribute of the content-based item of size of each district sheet and content self are by dynamic sizing.Such as, compared with not too interesting content, district's sheet with the more interested content of user can be presented with large district's sheet.In another example, the district's sheet comprising picture can be shown as the district's sheet being greater than and only comprising content of text.The second, the attribute of project-based content and content again, the order presenting district's sheet is dynamic.Such as, can by before having and being presented on not too interesting content to district's sheet of the more interested content of user.
Fig. 3 A-3H illustrates the possible layout of the content item from content flow using dynamic grid (for 2x 2 and have small-sized, the medium and large-scale district sheet of sizing as described above).As already pointed out, the figure that Fig. 3 A diagram has an example user interface 300 of four the small-sized district sheets (district sheet A 302, B 304, C 306 and D 308) being arranged to 2x 2 array represents.The figure that Fig. 3 B diagram has the example user interface 320 of two small-sized district sheets (district sheet A 302 and district sheet B 304) and medium sized district sheet (district sheet C 306) represents.Small-sized district sheet 302,304 is all positioned in above medium sized district sheet 306.The figure that Fig. 3 C diagram has the example user interface 322 of medium sized district sheet (district sheet A 302) and two small-sized district sheets (district sheet B 304 and district sheet C 306) represents.Medium sized district sheet 203 is positioned in above small-sized district sheet 204 and 306.The figure that Fig. 3 D diagram has the example user interface 324 of medium sized district sheet (district sheet B 304) and two small-sized district sheets (district sheet A 302 and district sheet C 306) represents.Medium sized district sheet 304 is positioned in has the right side of vertical stacking to the user interface 324 of two small-sized district sheets (district sheet A302 and district sheet C 306) in the left side of medium district sheet (district sheet B 304).The figure that Fig. 3 E diagram has the example user interface 326 of medium sized district sheet (district sheet A 302) and two small-sized district sheets (district sheet B 304 and district sheet C 306) represents, medium sized district sheet 302 is positioned in has the left side with interface 326 of vertical stacking to two, the right side small-sized district sheet (district sheet B304 and district sheet C 306) of medium district sheet (district sheet A 302).The figure that Fig. 3 F diagram has the example user interface 328 of 2 medium sized district sheets (district sheet A 302 and district sheet B 304, one of them medium district sheet is on another medium district sheet) represents.The figure that Fig. 3 G diagram has the example user interface 330 of two medium sized district sheets (district sheet A 302 and district sheet B 304, wherein these two medium district sheets side by side) represents.The figure that Fig. 3 H diagram has the example user interface 332 of the large-scale district sheet (district sheet A 302) occupying most of user interface represents.A special advantage about dynamic grid described above is, the rotation of 2x 2 grid support equipment.In other words, present data with district's sheet and make equipment can rotate to be transverse mode from vertical pattern, and the outward appearance of user interface and function major part remain unchanged, only have the dimension variation of appropriateness.
With reference now to Fig. 3 I-3K, three figures showing each implementation of user interface 340,342 and 344 represent.How these Fig. 3 I-3K illustrate grid dynamically and the equipment that how can be presented based on user interface, increase width by subscriber interface module 230 thereon.In Fig. 3 I, interface 340 is three col widths, and in Fig. 3 J, interface 342 is two col widths, and in Fig. 3 K, interface 344 is col widths.This can correspond to available displayable real conditions, such as, be respectively used to desk-top computer, flat computer and smart phone.
Should be appreciated that Fig. 3 A-3K only illustrates the information being provided for and showing on equipment in preset time.User can use the input of equipment, such as, rolls or gesture (such as slide), by user interface in advance with to illustrate below the current district's sheet illustrated or above other district's sheet.Such as, Fig. 3 K is to provide the interface of the linear list of district's sheet that may be suitable for showing on smart phone.Based on their correlativity or the interesting property for user, from top to bottom icon is sorted in lists.This has following technique effect: even (namely have the display of little displayable real conditions at the display with very little size, the display of such as smart phone) on, the information with most high correlation and/or interesting property is visible or efficiently addressable for user.The correlativity of content item or the display of interesting Xing Yong district sheet, wherein determine correlativity according to the model determined by model generation engine 207, and determine interesting property by rating engine 211.Similarly, Fig. 3 J is dynamic grid two column width for district's sheet being placed into the configuration described in Fig. 3 A-3H, and wherein district's sheet is sorted from the top-to-bottom of these two row according to correlativity with for the interesting property of user within a grid.In some implementations, presenting of district's sheet is optimized to for presenting to user.Such as, can sort district's sheet at least partly, not have white space in the visibility region guaranteeing 2x 2.In another example, can selection area sheet size at least partly, to guarantee not having white space in the visibility region of 2x 2.In some implementations, for given content item, calculate and sequence nearly ten (10) subsequent user interfaces.
Fig. 4 is the block diagram of the example of assembly for district's sheet 400.The user interface generated by subscriber interface module 230 can be dynamic on the other hand.Subscriber interface module 230 generates district's sheet based on the one or more assemblies in the assembly for district's sheet 400.A lot of assemblies in assembly described below are optional, and such as can not be included in each district sheet when the content of correspondence is unavailable.
With reference now to Fig. 4 A, the basic module of district's sheet 400 comprises reason hurdle 402, author region 404, again shared region 406, media region 408, social hurdle 410 and comment region 412.Reason hurdle 402 is present in the top of district's sheet 400, and to provide about the reason showing this content item to user, content item be information in the stream of user where or other attribute informations.Author region 404 is positioned in below reason hurdle 402, and provides the text message about author, such as name, the pet name (handle) etc.Author region 404 can also comprise the photo or image that are used by author.Author region 404 can also be used for showing the text inputted by author.Again shared region 406 appears at below author region 404, and comprises the instrument or button that can be used by reader, with shared content item, comments on content item or takes to carry out other actions about content item.Again shared region 406 is media region 408 below.Media region 408 is for the expression of display media or media.Such as, photo, emoticon, multi-party communication session (multi-party video of the link such as having or do not arrive session is chatted), the expression of the thumbnail of image, selectable video, the expression etc. of selectable audio frequency can be shown in media region 408.It should be noted that in some implementations, media and attribute thereof can the sizes of designation area sheet.Such as, when image is panoramic picture, medium sized district sheet can be used to replace small-sized district sheet.Social hurdle 410 is arranged on below media region 408.Social hurdle 410 can comprise approves of the instruction of number or number of reviews, for the button of session transition, the mark of the author of comment, the summary etc. of comment relevant to comment.In some implementations, the information in social hurdle 410 is dynamic and is upgraded in real time.Such as, can add to social hurdle 410 based on the number of the social affinity factor or remove the new comment or author that are introduced in the stream of the content item of user from social hurdle 410.The information provided by social hurdle 410 is described in more detail below with reference to Fig. 8 A and 8B.Social hurdle 410 is comment region 412 below.Comment region 412 provides the full text of comment and the additional information about author, and is sorted according to the form being different from social hurdle 410.Such as, comment region 412 can provide comment according to the order of time flashback, and wherein nearest comment is presented on top.Although do not illustrate in Fig. 4 A, but district's sheet 400 can also comprise the advertising area for comprising advertisement in district's sheet.The described order and the position that to should be appreciated that in district's sheet 400 included various hurdle and region are only a kind of implementations, there are other implementations using different positions and order.
In some implementations, district's sheet 400 can comprise other or different assembly.Such as, in some implementations, district's sheet 400 assembly comprises the title block with navigation bar and other button (not shown).In some implementations, title block is locked into the top at interface.In some implementations, district's sheet 400 comprises the preposition hurdle (not shown) be such as positioned in below title block, and it comprises the icon for current or fashion information.In some implementations, preposition hurdle is also for showing community information/model or positional information.In some implementations, district's sheet 400 comprises band of position (not shown).Such as, when user shares the position that the media from this place are shared or generate, this information can be provided in the band of position.Additional information can also be provided in the band of position, such as, arrive the link of the mapping program for position.In some implementations, district's sheet 400 comprises the photo zone of action (not shown) be separated with media region 408.Although be not illustrated, but district's sheet 400 assembly can also comprise other action pallets that can be added to district's sheet 400 when content again shares, comments on or approved of, such as keyboard or emoticon
Fig. 5 is that the figure of the example user interface 500 comprising the district's sheet 502,504,506 had for the content of flat computer equipment represents.As shown in Figure 5, user interface 500 comprises three district's sheets 502,504,506.The layout that the layout of district's sheet 502,504,506 and above reference diagram 3D describe is similar.But Fig. 5 illustrates another modification of district's sheet 502,504,506, and wherein they remain rectangle, but they not according to the predefined ratio as provided in Fig. 3 A-3H by accurately sizing.In this implementation, district's sheet size can have more evolutions.Such as, first district's sheet 502 is less times greater than 1/4th of user interface 500, and second district's sheet 504 has the width identical with first district's sheet 502, but the sub-fraction of second district's sheet 504 is visible in interface 500.Equally, the 3rd district's sheet 506 covers the user interface 500 exceeding half.As already pointed out, in some implementations, subscriber interface module 230 can according to content Lai Dui district sheet 502,504,506 sizing in district's sheet 502,504 and 506.In this example, according to attribute Lai Dui district sheet 502,504,506 sizing of media included in each district sheet 502,504 and 506.First district's sheet 502 has the picture presented in small-sized district sheet.Second district's sheet 504 has the selectable link to video to also presenting in small-sized district sheet.3rd district's sheet 506 is included in the photo presented in medium-to-large district sheet.Only an implementation based on the type Lai Dui district sheet sizing of media included in district's sheet and sequence.
Be to be understood that, the order of district's sheet and the size of district's sheet can be adjusted based on various factors, these factors comprise: image resolution ratio, image orientation, photograph album resolution, amount of text, social data (the interesting property of such as content, whether user follows author, the socialgram of author and the tight ness rating of user, the socialgram of reviewer and the tight ness rating of user, the position of user is to the degree of approach of content, diversity, approve of number, again number is shared, comment number, with the affinity of author, by system recommendation, and other social signals various), and above-mentioned every combination in any.Such as, when the image resolution ratio of photo included in district's sheet is very low, small-sized district sheet can be distributed to this content item.On the contrary, when the image resolution ratio of photo is very high, large-scale district sheet can be distributed to this content item.Similarly, when content item comprises 3 photos with narrow width scales (compacting), the photo that 3 tensionings cause only can need small-sized district sheet; But, when content item comprise 3 there is the photo of general landscape orientation time, can use in district's sheet of medium-sized district sheet (the district sheet C 306 of such as Fig. 3 B) on grid and content item is provided.
Another favorable characteristics of district's sheet 502,504,506 is, when district's sheet 502,504,506 is shown on grid, such as shown in Figure 5, may have access to the some of them function provided by district's sheet 502,504,506.Such as, do not need to more detailed interface (such as Fig. 6 A-6C) zone of transition sheet 502,504,506 with access function.Such as, assuming that district's sheet 506 illustrates a photo of photograph album, the subsurface gridding level as shown in Figure 5 of use, user only needs horizontally slip on the photo of district's sheet 506 (or left and right rolling), with more new district sheet 506 to illustrate next photo in the photograph album in district's sheet 506.In fact, this allows the user in the stream view of dynamic grid can check multiple photos from photograph album.Similarly, can by this access of function is expanded in the dynamic grid view of Fig. 5 on district's sheet to the visible any Action Button of user.The example of Action Button includes but not limited to approve of button, share button, comment etc.Similarly, can be used on district's sheet horizontally slip (or left and right rolling) visits above district's sheet or the content of below.In some implementations, rolling or gesture (such as sliding) can be used in district's sheet to expand or to arrange the content of district's sheet.
Now still with reference to figure 6A-6C, describe interface 500,600, transition between 620 and 640.When showing user interface 500, user such as can carry out selection area sheet 502,504,506 by input selection order or by knocking district sheet 502,504,506, and user interface is from the interface 500 shown in Fig. 5 to interface 600,620 and 640 transition of the correspondence shown in Fig. 6 A-6C.
More specifically, in some implementations, when first district's sheet 502 is by selection, show from user interface 500 to user interface 600 transition shown in Fig. 6 A.User interface 600 has the extended version of the district's sheet 602 with the full text with content item association.In addition, user interface advantageously presents covering user from district's sheet 602 of the shade version of the user interface 500 of its transition.This is particularly advantageous, because it allows user can comment on more detailed information about content item simultaneously with the environment of shade mode display items display.The comparison of Liang Ge district sheet 502,602 illustrates how many more texts from content item and is illustrated.Should be appreciated that this is only the example of district's sheet of more detailed information comprising more detailed information and can provide.Another example is, the photo or any other assembly that associate with content item or district's sheet can be shown in an expanded format.
When the 3rd district's sheet 506 is by selection, show from user interface 500 to user interface 620 transition shown in Fig. 6 B.Transition between the user interface 500 of Fig. 5 and the user interface 620 of Fig. 6 B shows another example for transition between interface.In this implementation, district's sheet is expanded so that the full frame media region 408 (such as photo) that illustrates and author region 404, again shared region 406, social hurdle 410 and comment region 412 are coated in media region 408.This implementation is advantageous particularly, because its permission presents information that is nearly all and content item association, even on the display with small-sized size to user in unique user interface.A part in other assemblies 404,406,410 and 412 of district's sheet is coated in media region 408 in the lower left corner.This has the advantage that minimally hinders the view of media region.Should be appreciated that this covering can be positioned in other positions various in interface 620.
In some implementations, when the 3rd district's sheet 506 is by selection, show from user interface 500 to user interface 640 transition shown in Fig. 6 C.Transition between the user interface 500 of Fig. 5 and the user interface 640 of Fig. 6 C shows another implementation for transition between interface.In this implementation, the photograph album utilizing the image in grid to present covers in the media region 408 (such as photo) that is expanded to cover whole screen.New district's sheet shown in Fig. 6 C can comprise for allowing user can to the button of photograph album transition, the text of this button instruction number of pictures, association and the grid from n thumbnail image before in the photo of photograph album.Should be appreciated that Fig. 6 A, 6B and 6C are only three examples presenting the additional detail from content item in the assistant interface how can access at the major interfaces 500 by Fig. 5.
With reference now to Fig. 7 A-7C, the figure described for the example user interface of mobile device represents.Fig. 7 A illustrates and how district's chip module can be rendered as the single district sheet for mobile device by minimizing mode.How Fig. 7 B diagram can present photograph album in district's sheet of mobile device.How Fig. 7 C diagram can present the implementation for forming the assistant interface shared or comment on district's sheet.Should be appreciated that the size of the assembly that can reduce district's sheet, to reduce to present the upper content eliminated completely from mobile device.Similarly, can also reduce or eliminate the button provided by district's sheet or function with adapt on the mobile apparatus can function.
Fig. 8 A and 8B is that the figure on the social hurdle 410 of example represents.Fig. 8 A illustrates the implementation for social hurdle 410.In this realization, social hurdle 410 comprises the designator 812 of the reviewer approving of button 802, expansion button 804, reviewer's list 806, the instruction 808 commenting on number, comment frame 810 and instruction to make comments in comment frame 810.In some implementations, button 802 is approved of to cause interface to another interfaces transition allowing user to approve of the content presented in district's sheet.Expansion button 804 makes interface (such as interface 600) to another interface (such as interface 620) transition, in another interface, shows the more information about content item in the sheet of single expansion area.The user list of the comment about content item is puted up in reviewer's list 806 Shi district sheet.In some implementations, the image of reviewer is shown.Such as, Fig. 8 A illustrates 4 reviewers and image thereof.In some implementations, in 806, name or the pet name is presented and non-image.In some implementations, add and the maximally related reviewer of user to reviewer's list 806.In some implementations, can by correlativity determine to reviewer's list 806 add reviewer, such as relevant to one or more affinity of user threshold value, temporal proximity, reviewer whether approved of by user or follow, when popular reviewer is or usually approved of etc. meets, and adds reviewer to reviewer's list 806.In some implementations, flow to user add new comment time, dynamically update reviewer's list 806 in real time.Should be appreciated that because new comment is received, so meet threshold value and those reviewers be included in list 806 can change, is dynamic to make the reviewer in list 806.Number of reviews designator 808 tells that user has puted up how many comment about the content item in district's sheet.Comment frame 810 provides a part for comment or comment.In some implementations, the comment being provided for and presenting to user in comment frame 810 is changed with predetermined space.Such as, the comment of transition from different user can be carried out by comment frame 810 (as paper tape).As another example, comment can be changed with predetermined time interval (such as every 15 seconds).Designator 812 is used to indicate the comment user corresponding with it.Such as, in fig. 8 a, the comment in comment frame 810 is corresponding with first user, to indicate first user to be review source below the image that designator 812 is positioned in first user.By comparing, in the fig. 8b, the comment in comment frame is corresponding with the second user (user on the right side of first user), and designator 812 is positioned in below the image of the second user, to identify the second user for review source.In some implementations, comment frame 810 is updated and cycles through each user shown in reviewer's list, and when commenting on change, designator 812 moves to be positioned in below the user as review source.Will be appreciated that, designator 812 is only an example of designator, there is other designators.
With reference now to Fig. 9, the exemplary method 900 for generating the user interface comprising the dynamic grid with one or more districts sheet is described.Method 900 starts to receive 902 content flows comprising one or more content item.Such as, content flow can be received by subscriber interface module 230 from content application 103.Subscriber interface module 230 is chosen content item from content flow.Then subscriber interface module 230 determines 904 district's sheet types, provides content item with the attribute of content-based item.Such as, the attribute of content item can be in any one factor of media and the description of attribute, image resolution ratio or above reference diagram 5 thereof.Then, method 900 uses 906 content items to carry out fill area chip module.Then, the attribute of method use content item organizes the content regions sheet in dynamic grid.The attribute of content file can be used to come in dynamic grid content regions sheet sequence 908.Such as, can sort according to two rule Lai Dui districts sheets: first guarantees do not have white space in the dynamic grid (such as 2x 2 grid) provided to user, second provides district's sheet according to the order of correlativity, wherein presents more relevant content at the top of grid.In some implementations, method 900 continues, and makes district's sheet variation 910.Can based on the content source of the type of presented content, the type of district's sheet presented or size, district's sheet or other be because usually making district's sheet variation.As already pointed out, in some implementations, nearly 10 interfaces are generated.Such as, assuming that the dynamic grid of 2x 2 is visible for user, in some implementations, the grid of 2x 20 is arranged and creates, make it possible to provide 2x 20 continuous part of grid in response to input to user, with the continuous part transition to grid, wherein a part for 2x 20 grid can be 2x 2 grid comprising 4 district's sheets, these 4 district's sheets, by sizing and layout, can once be shown to make them.Method continues, and provides a part for the dynamic grid of 912 district's sheets for display.
In some implementations, district's sheet can have predefined largest amount.In the realization that some are such, the step utilizing the content from content item to fill 906 district's chip modules can comprise: reduce the size of different assembly until the iterative process of size sum below the minimal size for district's sheet of assembly.Such as, these processes can be, first reduce the size of text, then reduce the size of photo, then reduce the function provided in district's sheet, then assess district sheet size whether below the maximal value allowed.If so, then fill area sheet; If not, then method can again be selected each assembly and determine whether that their size can not be reduced until total size of all component is below the maximal value allowed.Additionally or alternatively, if need to reduce district's sheet size, then some assembly of district's sheet can be eliminated.In some implementations, district's sheet can have predefined minimal size.In the implementation that some are such, the content item not having additional media or there is little content can be expanded.In such an example, the size of text can be increased, can icon sizes be increased, or other buttons can be added, to reduce the blank amount of district's sheet with limited content.
Figure 10 illustrates the exemplary method 1000 of the user interface of the details for generating the district's sheet provided about the dynamic grid from district's sheet.Method 1000 starts with the input receiving the district's sheet in 102 selection dynamic grids.Method 1000 identifies and inputs the district's sheet and content item that associate, and the additional information that then retrieval is relevant to content item.Then subscriber interface module 230 creates 1006 detailed sheet interfaces, district.The information of retrieval in step 1004 is utilized to fill detailed sheet interface, district.Then 1008 detailed sheet interfaces, district are provided to show for user.User can input additional command to handle assistant interface.Subscriber interface module 230 receives 1010 for the request of the further details relevant to content item.Utilize additional information to upgrade 1012 detailed user interfaces, and provide the detailed user interface after 1014 renewals to show for user.The example of this method is illustrated in the interface of Fig. 6 A and 6B.These user interfaces can receive input with the additional text of retrieval except the text provided and show.Under these circumstances, user can be rolled to the additional text below the current text shown in the user interface shown in Fig. 6 A and 6B.Described in step 1012 and 1014, retrieve this additional text, and upgrade and provide go back to interface to user.
In some implementations, when providing additional text and user scrolls through the text, automatically close detailed user interface, and user returns to sheet interface, initial dynamic grid district.In some implementations, not dynamically close auxiliary user interface, but be provided for when user arrives the ending of text the button making this transition.Such as, when user is rolled to the ending of the text in the program 602 of Fig. 6 A, interface will transit back into the interface 500 of Fig. 5 automatically.Should be appreciated that secondary user interface can have the various different mechanism at the interface 500 for returning Fig. 5.Such as, various feature can comprise and pulls to close, pulls that next model is shown, is rolled to ending and retrieves next model or release to close automatically to close, to pull.
Figure 11 illustrates the exemplary method 1100 for upgrading district's sheet for new content or dynamic grid in real time.Method 1100 starts for showing to provide 1102 district's sheets or dynamic grid interface.Then, subscriber interface module 230 receives 1104 contents relevant to the district's sheet be shown or dynamic grid.Subscriber interface module 230 utilizes the new content received to upgrade 1106 interfaces, and provides the sheet interface, district after 1108 renewals to show for user.
