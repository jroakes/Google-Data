Description
- This application makes reference to and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/697,051, filed on Sep. 5, 2012, entitled “AUTOMATICALLY GENERATING MUSIC PLAYLISTS BASED ON AN IMPLICITLY SELECTED SEED,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- Aspects of the present application relate generally to the field of processing digital media content. More specifically, certain implementations of the present disclosure relate to system and/or method for automatically generating music playlists based on an implicitly selected seed.
- Users frequently want to quickly start playing an enjoyable mix of music with a minimum of effort spent selecting what to play. There are existing solutions for automatically creating a playlist based on a user selected seed song, from which similar songs are chosen by a music-management system in order to populate the playlist. For example, manually-seeded music services, such as Pandora and iTunes Genius, require the user to select a seed song so that a playlist can be created. However, with the continuously growing personal music libraries, the manual selection of seed songs still requires a fair amount of user effort and time to navigate through their music collection and select an appropriate seed song.

media backend 106, theAPGM 115 may automatically generate a list with a plurality of digital media seeds (e.g., seed songs) based on user A's affinity for certain digital media items within thedigital media library 108. TheAPGM 115 may then generate one or more playlists based on at least one digital media seed selected (e.g., randomly) from the generated plurality of digital media seeds. The generated playlists may be communicated to theuser device 102 and may be automatically displayed on thescreen 102 as soon as theuser device 102 is turned ON or user A accesses digital media management functionalities provided by the media backend 106 (e.g., user A accesses a music or other digital media online store or digital media collection management functionalities related to user A's digital media collection ofitems 120, . . . , 122). -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating automatically generating music playlists based on an implicitly selected seed, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. Referring toFIG. 2 , there is illustrated an example process of automatic generation of music playlists by theAPGM 115, based on one or more implicitly selected seeds. - The
APGM 115 may comprise aseed filter 202, aselector module 204, and asimilarity engine 206, which may be used during the automatic generation of playlists. More specifically, theseed filter 202 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to use implicit information from a user's digital media library to generate one or more seed list. More specifically, theseed filter 202 may use one or more selection criteria associated with digital media (e.g., song) popularity, as well as user behavior that indicates affinity to specific digital media, for selecting a seed list from thedigital media library 108. For example, theseed filter 202 may use the following selection criteria associated with user affinity to a song during the seed list selection: - Song rating (e.g., the user gave the song a high rating, such as recent “thumbs up” or 4-5 stars);
- High play count (e.g., the user has played the song more than X times in a given time period);
- Recently purchased (e.g., the user has recently purchased a song);
- “Old favorite” song (e.g., the user has listened to the song more than X times in the past, but has not heard the song in the last certain number of days/weeks/months);
- Social network popularity (e.g., the user's friends with similar music tastes have listened to the song more than X times in a given time period); and
- Genre Popularity (e.g., the user owns or listens to a lot of music from a specific genre).
- In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the
seed filter 202 may use the above criteria as well as other selection criteria associated with user affinity to a song in order to select a seed list from thedigital media library 108. Based on the selection criteria selected, theseed filter 202 may assign weights (or scores) for each song in the user A's digital media library ofDMIs 120, . . . , 122. Theseed filter 202 may use one or more of the selection criteria at any given time, where the one or more selection criteria may be selected (e.g., randomly) by theCPU 118, or may be pre-selected by user A. - For example, if “song rating” and “social network popularity” are selected as filtering criteria, the
seed filter 202 may obtain metadata information associated with song rating for each ofDMIs 120, . . . , 122. If the song rating for a song is above a certain threshold, then the song may be assigned certain weight (or score). Theseed filter 202 may then obtain “social network popularity” information based on profile information 112 and/or posts/shares information 113 associated with user A on thesocial network 104. For example, user A may have a post that he enjoys classical music. Theseed filter 202 may then assign an additional weight (or score) to all classical music tracks within theDMIs 120, . . . , 122. Theseed filter 202 may then rank theDMIs 120, . . . , 122 according to total score and may select a determined number of the top scoring DMIs (e.g., songs with the highest weight or score given) as the seed list. - The
selector module 204 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to perform a selection of one or more seed songs from the seed list generated by theseed filter 202. For example, theselector module 204 may be operable to perform a random selection of one or more seed songs from the seed list generated by theseed filter 202. - The
similarity engine 206 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to generate a playlist based on a seed song or metadata from the seed song. More specifically, after receiving a seed song (or metadata from the seed song), thesimilarity engine 206 may generate a playlist with a determined number of songs selected from, for example, theDMIs 120, . . . , 122 in thedigital media library 108. The determined number of songs may be selected based on similarity to the received seed song. Various techniques may be used in selecting songs similar to the seed song, such as acoustic similarity, genre similarity, artist similarity, as well as other techniques. - Even though the
seed filter 202, theselector module 204 and thesimilarity engine 206 are illustrated as implemented within themedia backend 106, the present disclosure may not be limited in this regard. More specifically, theseed filter 202, theselector module 204 and thesimilarity engine 206 may be implemented as separate functional modules or as part of other network devices. - In operation, the
seed filter 202 in themedia back end 106 may find seed tracks based on implicit information from user A's digital media library (e.g.,DMIs 120, . . . , 122). More specifically, theseed filter 202 may select (e.g., randomly) one or more of the selection criteria described above (or other similar criteria) and apply the selection criteria to theDMIs 120, . . . , 122 in thedigital media library 108. After applying the selection criteria, aseed list 208 may be generated withseed songs 210, . . . , 212 that have the highest weight (or score) after applying the selection criteria. Theselector module 204 may randomly select one or more of the seed songs (e.g., 210, . . . , 214), which may be used by the similarity engine to generatecorresponding playlists 224, . . . , 226 based on selectedseeds 210, . . . , 214. - The
playlists 224, . . . , 226 may be generated as a background process to theuser device 102, based on metadata, play/purchase history, social signals (e.g., from the social network 104) or other implicit information from a user's digital media library to generate one or more seeds, and at least one playlist from the one or more seeds. - For example, the
seed filter 202 may use the “recently purchased song” selection criteria (or filter). Theseed filter 202 may then search theDMIs 120, . . . , 122 for the most recently purchased song. The most recently purchased song will be selected as the seed song (e.g., seed 210). Metadata associated with theseed song 210 may then be communicated to thesimilarity engine 206 to generate a playlist (e.g., playlist 224), which may include the seed song (seed 210) and additional songs (216, . . . , 218) which are similar to the seed. The one or more generated playlists (e.g., 224, . . . , 226) may be communicated to theuser device 102 and displayed to user A the next time theuser device 102 is turned ON and user A logs into digital media storage/management services platform of themedia backend 106. - In accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure, more than one selection criteria may be used, and each playlists may combine songs that are similar to a plurality of selected seeds, instead of just one seed. For example, the
seed filter 202 may use the “recently purchased song” and the “total play count” (or “high play count”) selection criteria (or filters). Theseed filter 202 may then search theDMIs 120, . . . , 122 for the most recently purchased songs (e.g., the top 100 most recently purchased songs). Theseed filter 202 may then search the top 100 most recently purchased songs for the songs with the highest play count and most recently purchased songs (e.g., the top 50 highest play count songs). The highest play count song (after “recently purchased song” filter has been applied) may be selected as the seed song (e.g., seed 210). Metadata or social network related information (e.g., 112, 113) associated with theseed song 210 may then be communicated to thesimilarity engine 206 to generate a playlist (e.g., playlist 224), which may include the seed song (seed 210) and additional songs (216, . . . , 218) which are similar to theseed 210. The one or more generated playlists (e.g., 224, . . . , 226) may be communicated to theuser device 102 and displayed to user A the next time theuser device 102 is turned ON and user A logs into digital media storage/management services platform of themedia backend 106. - In accordance with another example embodiment of the disclosure, each of the
playlists 224, . . . , 226 may include songs from the corresponding seed for that playlist as well as songs from another seed from theseed list 208. For example,playlist 224 may include the seed song (seed 210) and additional songs (216, . . . , 218) which are similar to theseed 210. However,playlist 224 may also include additional songs (e.g., one or more ofDMIs 220, . . . , 222), which are similar to another seed (e.g., seed 214) from theseed list 208. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example graphical user interface (GUI) used with automatically generated music playlists, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. Referring toFIG. 3 , theGUI 300 may appear on thedisplay 103 after user A turns ONdevice 102 and logs into the digital media storage/management services platform offered by themedia backend 106. - As seen in
FIG. 3 , theGUI 300 may include “Recent Purchases”portion 302 and “Play songs like . . . ” (or “Playlists”)portion 304. The “Playlists” portion may include automatically generatedplaylists 306, . . . , 314, based on one or more selection criteria (as described above). Each of the auto-generated playlists may include icon art representations from one or more of the songs within the specific playlist (each square art icon of theplaylists 306, . . . , 314 includes nine smaller squares which represent icon art of nine songs within the playlist). Additionally, the auto-generatedplaylists 306, . . . , 314 may be different every time user A turns ON thedevice 102 or logs into the digital media storage/management services platform offered by themedia backend 106. User A may also be given an option to permanently save one or more of theplaylists 306, . . . , 314 for repeat use in the future. - Additionally, user A may have an option to delete one or more of the auto-generated
playlists 306, . . . , 314 or generate one or more additional playlist automatically (after one is deleted) or upon demand. In either of these cases, a request for a new playlist may be communicated to themedia backend 106 to generate a new automatic playlist, as described above in reference toFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating example steps of a method for generating a playlist, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. Referring toFIGS. 1 , 2, and 4, themethod 400 may start at 402, when a plurality of seed songs (e.g., 210, . . . , 212) may be automatically selected from a music library (e.g., 108) based on at least one selection criteria associated with song popularity (e.g., selection criteria used by the seed filter 202). At 404, one of the plurality of seed songs (e.g., seed 210) may be selected (e.g., randomly or otherwise, by the selector module 204). At 406, a first playlist (e.g., 224) may be generated with a plurality of songs (DMIs 216, . . . , 218 and seed 210) from the music library (e.g.,DMIs 120, . . . , 122 in digital media library 108).
