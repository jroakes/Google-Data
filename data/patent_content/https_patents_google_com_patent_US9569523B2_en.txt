- the bundle analysis engine 110 can evaluate each identified content element from both the first content elements 115 and the second content elements 120 according to one or more performance parameters.
- the identified content elements can be monitored with respect to a click-through rate; a click-to-play rate; an aggregate cost; and/or a consumption.
- the identified content elements can be evaluated by monitoring the past performance of the elements according to the one or more performance parameters.
- the identified content elements can be evaluated by monitoring the performance of the elements relative to other content pages 105 , e.g. web pages, in a similar genre or category. Other performance parameters can be used to monitor the performance of the first content elements 115 and the second content elements 120 .
- the bundle analysis engine 110 can select first content elements 115 and the second content elements 120 that can be combined in a bundle 140 that is optimized for a higher performance with regards to, for example, monetization and relevance. For example, the bundle analysis engine 110 can determine the total number of first content elements 115 and the second content elements 120 to include in the bundle 140 . Furthermore, the bundle analysis engine 110 can determine the optimal number of first content elements 115 to show in combination with the second content elements 120 , and in what sequence these elements will be shown.
- the bundler 130 can combine the first content elements 115 and the second content elements 120 that were identified by the bundle analysis engine 110 into a bundle 140 .
- the bundle 140 can be transmitted to a user requesting the content page 105 .
- the bundle analysis engine 110 can determine that the best combination of first content elements 115 and second content elements 120 would be a bundle 140 that includes advertisements for a sporting goods store that sells baseball equipment along with instructional videos teaching how to hit a baseball.
- Additional first content elements 115 and second content elements 120 could also be included in the bundle 140 that is created by the bundler 130 .
- the bundle 140 can be transmitted to a publisher of the content page, such as a web page.
- the publisher can embed the bundle within the web page, and the bundle can be displayed to a user who has requested the web page.
- the performance of a first bundle of first content elements 115 can be monitored by a monitoring engine 135 at a content page 105 .
- the performance of the first bundle can be monitored with a monitoring engine 135 by evaluating the first bundle of advertisements and media files according to one or more performance parameters. If the monitored performance of the first bundle is less than a threshold, the bundle analysis engine 110 can generate a second bundle of advertisements and media files.
- Other performance parameters can be used to monitor the performance of a first bundle of first content elements 115 and the second content elements 120 by the monitoring engine 135 .
- the performance of a first bundle can be monitored with respect to an aggregate click-through rate, a click-to-play rate, an aggregate cost, and a consumption.
- the monitoring engine 135 can determine whether the values of the one or more measured performance parameters meet a threshold.
- the bundle analysis engine 110 can generate a second bundle of advertisements and media files.
- the bundle analysis engine 110 can generate a second bundle by repeating the process used to create the first bundle. For example, the bundle analysis engine 110 could identify a set of first topics 107 related to the content page 105 and can also identify a set of second topics 109 related to the first content elements 115 and second content elements 120 based on the first topics 107 . The bundle analysis engine can also identify a set of common topics that were common to the first topics 107 and the second topics 109 , and generate a second bundle from first content elements 115 and second content elements 120 based on the common topics. In some implementations, bundle elements can be substituted over time. The performance of the new bundle configuration can be measured and compared to previous bundle configurations. An optimal configuration can be derived over time.
- the bundle analysis engine 110 can adjust the first bundle of advertisements and media files in response to the monitoring engine 135 determining that the values of the one or more measured performance parameters do not meet a threshold. For example, bundle analysis engine 110 can remove the advertisements and/or media files from the first bundle that do not meet the threshold values. The bundle analysis engine 110 can identify additional advertisements from the first content elements 115 and/or media files from the second content elements 120 that would be relevant to replace the removed elements. The bundle analysis engine 110 could transmit these additional elements to the bundler 130 that could combine the additional advertisements and/or media files into a second bundle with the remaining advertisements and/or media files from the first bundle.
- the performance of the bundle can be monitored with respect to an aggregate click-through rate.
- the aggregate click-through rate can represent the number of times the first bundle was selected by a user viewing the first bundle in a ratio to the number of times it was displayed. Therefore, if the aggregate click-through rate of the first bundle is low, the monitoring engine 135 can analyze the advertisements and/or media files from the first bundle to determine which elements are performing below a threshold with respect to the click-through rate. Based on the analysis, the bundle analysis engine 110 can decide to replace any and/or all of the advertisements and/or media files from the first bundle with additional advertisements and/or media files into a second bundle with the goal of improving the aggregate click-through rate of the bundle.
