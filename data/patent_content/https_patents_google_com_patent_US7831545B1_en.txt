Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to fact databases. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to identifying a subject for a source document and facts included in the document.
- the World Wide Web also known as the “Web” and the web pages within the Web are a vast source of factual information. Users may look to web pages to get answers to factual questions, such as “what is the capital of Tru” or “what is the birth date of George Washington.”
- the factual information included in web pages may be extracted and stored in a fact database.
- any facts extracted from the web page are more likely than not associated with the same subject. If the subject is not known, not only are the extracted facts less useful, organization and management of the extracted facts in the fact database may become more complicated.
- the manner of labeling the subject may vary. For example, some web pages may indicate their subject in the main text of the web page, while some other web pages may indicate their subject in the HTML title text. The variety of manners of labeling the subject making the process of identifying the subject difficult.
- a method of processing a set of documents includes identifying a source document; identifying a set of linking documents that include links, with anchor text, to the source document; generating a set of candidate labels based on the respective anchor texts; selecting a first label of the candidate labels according to first predefined criteria; and associating the selected first label with the source document.

- the starting and ending anchor tags define, the hyperlink.
- a destination attribute 210 indicates that the hyperlink 206 is a source anchor that links to a destination document.
- the location value 212 of the destination attribute 210 specifies the location and/or identity of the destination document to which the hyperlink links. In FIG. 2 , the destination document is the source document 202 , and thus the location value 212 of each hyperlink 206 is the location or identifier of the source document 202 .
- the starting anchor tag 208 may also include one or more additional parameters 214 .
- the anchor text 216 is textual content in the linking document 204 that becomes the source anchor to the destination document based on its location between the starting anchor tag 208 and the ending anchor tag 218 .
- the anchor text 216 is the text in the linking document that becomes the hyperlink.
- the anchor text 216 may be of any length.
- the anchor text 216 is text that is to be rendered for presentation to a user.
- the anchor text may be rendered by the client application differently from other text rendered for presentation to the user, in order to differentiate the hyperlink anchor text from normal text.
- the anchor text may be underlined and/or have a different font color than normal text after rendering.
- the hyperlink if clicked by a user, triggers a request (e.g., an HTTP request) for the source document.
- the linking document 204 is a document written in HTML.

- FIG. 3A is a flow diagram illustrating a process for associating a label with a source document and/or facts extracted from the source document, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a source document that includes one or more facts identifiable as attribute-value pairs (hereinafter “A-V pairs”) is identified ( 302 ).
- One or more linking documents that include links to the source document are identified ( 304 ).
- a search engine may be queried to search for linking documents that include a link to the source document.
- one or more link maps may be consulted.
- the one or more link maps map the linkage between one or more documents stored in document hosts 102 .
- the link maps may be located within the fact repository engine 106 or located at a search engine that is accessible to the fact repository engine 106 .
- Anchor texts of the links to the source document are identified ( 306 ). From the identified linking documents, the anchor texts of the links to the source documents are identified. Each linking document is parsed to find the starting and ending anchor tags that define the hyperlink to the source document. The anchor text between the tags is identified and extracted.
- the label generation includes converting the extracted anchor texts to a canonical form by applying a set of transformations to the extracted anchor texts.
- the transformation may include removing punctuation marks from the anchor texts and converting them to all lower case characters.
- additional processing may be performed on the anchor texts to generate the candidate labels in canonical form.
- the anchor texts may be processed to remove from anchor texts words that tend to be not useful as subject labels, or words of low value, such as “click here.” If an anchor text is made up entirely of low value words, it may be the case that the entire anchor text is eliminated and no candidate label is generated from that anchor text.
- Each generated candidate label is distinct from another; two anchor texts that are exactly the same (before or after conversion to canonical form) will yield one candidate label.
- a first label is selected from the candidate labels according to one or more first predefined criteria ( 310 ).
- the first predefined criteria are defined such that the selected first label is most representative of the anchor texts associated with the hyperlinks to the source document. Further details regarding the selection of the first label are described below, in relation to FIGS. 3B and 3C .
- the selected first label is associated with the source document and/or any A-V pairs extracted from the source document ( 312 ). Before the first label is associated with the source document and/or A-V pairs, the first label may be processed to more resemble the corresponding anchor text (e.g., by reversing one or more of the transformations used to convert the anchor text to canonical form, or by applying a subset of these transformations to the original anchor text). The selected label becomes the label for the subject of the source document and/or of any A-V pairs extracted from the source document.
- one or more second labels may be selected from the candidate labels based on one or more second predefined criteria ( 314 ). The second labels may also be associated with the source document and/or the A-V pairs ( 316 ).
- the selected first label, and any selected second labels are associated with the source document and/or the A-V pairs extracted from the source document, by adding an entry or value to a corresponding data structure.
- the selected first label, and any selected second labels are associated with the extracted A-V pairs by adding these labels as names to the object data structure 400 ( FIG. 4 ) in which the A-V pairs are stored.
- Each name of an object is represented by either a fact entry 404 having a “name” attribute, or by a name entry.
- the fact entry in which a selected label is stored may include in its sources field 420 ( FIG. 4 ) the URL or identifier of the source document.
- the selected label is attributed to the source document.
- the fact entry in which a selected label is stored may include in its sources field 420 ( FIG. 4 ) the URL or identifier of the linking document. In other words, the selected label is attributed to the linking document.
- the fact entry in which a selected label is stored may include in its sources field 420 ( FIG. 4 ) the URLs or identifiers of the source document and the linking document. In other words, the selected label is attributed to both the source document and the linking document.
- FIG. 3B illustrates one process for selecting a label to associate with a source document and/or A-V pairs, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the first predefined criterion for selection of the first label is based on the number of linking documents that have links, to the source document, with anchor text corresponding to the candidate label.
- a score for each candidate label may be determined based on how many linking documents include a link, to the source document, with the corresponding anchor text.
- a score is determined for each candidate label ( 322 ). In some embodiments, the score is simply a count of how many linking documents include a link, to the source document, with anchor text corresponding to the respective candidate label.
- anchor text corresponding to a candidate label means that the anchor text, after applying a predefined set of transformations (e.g., removing punctuation marks and converting to all lower case), matches the candidate label exactly.
- the match required for the correspondence may be less stringent.
- the candidate label may be a proper substring of the anchor text.
- the score may be weighted by the page importance metrics of the linking documents having the links to the source document. This may help bias the vote toward candidate labels generated from anchor texts extracted from more important documents. Thus, each “vote” in the score is multiplied by the page importance metric of the linking document corresponding to the vote.
- the weighted score is the sum of the page importance metrics of the linking documents that include the link, to the source document, with the corresponding anchor text:
- Score ⁇ ( candidate ⁇ ⁇ label ) ⁇ linking ⁇ ⁇ documents ⁇ P ⁇ ( linking ⁇ ⁇ document ) , where P (linking document) is the page importance metric of a linking document that includes a link, to the source document, with anchor text corresponding to the candidate label.
- the candidate label with the highest score is selected as the first label ( 324 ).
- the process proceeds to block 312 , as shown in FIG. 3A .
- the second predefined criteria are based on the scores of the candidate labels.
- the second predefine criteria are that the any candidate label (not including the already selected first label) with a score above a predefined threshold may be selected as a second label.
- the predefined threshold may be a fixed score or a fixed percentage of the score of the selected first label.
- the second predefined criteria are that the M candidate labels with highest scores (not including the selected first label) are selected as second labels, where M is a fixed positive integer.
- FIG. 3C illustrates another process for selecting a label to associate with a source document and/or attribute-value pairs, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a first label may be selected based on a first predefined criterion of highest similarity to a “center” of the candidate labels generated for the source document. To determine the “center” of the candidate labels and to determine the similarity to the “center,” the candidate labels are embedded into a vector space.
- a frequency vector is generated for each candidate label ( 332 ).
- the frequency vector is a vector of numbers of occurrences (frequencies) of n-grams in a candidate label.
- An n-gram is an n-character substring of a given string, disregarding any white spaces.
- the given string is “good day,” then the 3-grams (3-character substrings) of “good day” are “goo,” “ood,” “odd,” “dda,” and “day.”
- each n-gram is formed from an n-character sliding window along the length of the candidate label.
- the frequency vector of a candidate label includes frequencies of all possible n-grams.
- the frequency vector of a candidate label is a 26 n dimensional space vector.
- a frequency vector of 3-grams a 26 3 dimensional space vector, has frequencies of “aaa” through “zzz” in the candidate label.
- the candidate labels can include numerical digitals (0 to 9) and lower case letters, the frequency vector is a 36 3 dimensional space vector. In either case, most frequencies in a frequency vector are 0 and the only non-zero frequencies are the frequencies of n-grams that actually occur in the candidate label.
- n-grams of the candidate label are identified and frequencies of the n-grams within that candidate label are determined.
- a frequency vector for that candidate label is generated based on the determined frequencies.
- the n-grams are 5-grams (i.e., a 5-character sliding window).
- centroid vector is determined ( 334 ).
- the centroid vector represents a “center,” an “average” of sorts, of the frequency vectors of the candidate labels.
- the centroid vector is determined by normalizing the generated frequency vectors of the candidate labels (i.e., converting each frequency vector into a unit vector), adding the normalized frequency vectors, and normalizing the resulting vector sum. Because the centroid vector is a normalization of the resulting vector sum, the length of the centroid vector is 1.
- each frequency vector after normalization but before the addition, may be weighted (i.e., scalar multiplication) by the sum of the page importance metrics of linking documents (i.e., documents which have links to the source document) with anchor text corresponding to the candidate label associated with each respective frequency vector.
- the candidate label with the corresponding frequency vector that has the shortest distance to the centroid vector is identified ( 336 ). That is, the candidate label corresponding to the frequency vector that is closest to the centroid vector is identified.
- the candidate label with the closest frequency vector is the most similar to the “center,” represented by the centroid vector.
- the closeness of a frequency vector to the centroid vector is measured by the cosine distance (also called the cosine similarity):
- Cos 0 is equal to 1, which is the largest positive number that cos ⁇ can ever be.
- a frequency vector f that is closest to the centroid vector c will yield the largest positive cos ⁇ (i.e., nearest to 1).
- the frequency vector that has the shortest distance to the centroid vector is the frequency vector that has the largest positive cosine distance value with respect to the centroid vector.
- the candidate label with the frequency vector that is closest to the centroid vector is selected as the first label ( 336 ).
- the process proceeds to block 312 , as shown in FIG. 3A .
- the second predefined criteria are based on the cosine distances of the frequency vectors of the candidate labels.
- the second predefine criteria are that the any candidate label (not including the already selected first label) with a cosine distance above a predefined threshold may be selected as a second label.
- the predefined threshold may be a fixed cosine distance value or a fixed percentage of the cosine distance of the selected first label.
- the second predefined criteria are that the L candidate labels with highest positive cosine distances (not including the selected first label) are selected as second labels, where L is a fixed positive integer.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary data structure for an object within the fact repository 114 , according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the fact repository 114 includes objects, each of which may include one or more facts.
- Each object 400 includes a unique identifier, such as the object ID 402 .
- the object 400 includes one or more facts 404 .
- Each fact 404 includes a unique identifier for that fact, such as a fact ID 410 .
- Each fact 404 includes an attribute 412 and a value 414 .
- facts included in an object representing George Washington may include facts having attributes of “date of birth” and “date of death,” and the values of these facts would be the actual date of birth and date of death, respectively.
- a fact 404 may include a link 416 to another object, which is the object identifier, such as the object ID 402 of another object within the fact repository 114 .
- the link 416 allows objects to have facts whose values are other objects. For example, for an object “United States,” there may be a fact with the attribute “president” whose value is “George W. Bush,”, with “George W. Bush” being another object in the fact repository 114 .
- the value field 414 stores the name of the linked object and the link 416 stores the object identifier of the linked object.
- facts 404 do not include a link field 416 because the value 414 of a fact 404 may store a link to another object.
- Each fact 404 also may include one or more metrics 418 .
- the metrics may provide indications of the quality of the fact.
- the metrics include a confidence level and an importance level.
- the confidence level indicates the likelihood that the fact is correct.
- the importance level indicates the relevance of the fact to the object, compared to other facts for the same object.
- the importance level may optionally be viewed as a measure of how vital a fact is to an understanding of the entity or concept represented by the object.
- Each fact 404 includes a list of sources 420 that include the fact and from which the fact was extracted.
- Each source may be identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Web address, or any other appropriate form of identification and/or location, such as a unique document identifier.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- some facts may include an agent field 422 that identifies the module that extracted the fact.
- the agent may be a specialized module that extracts facts from a specific source (e.g., the pages of a particular web site, or family of web sites) or type of source (e.g., web pages that present factual information in tabular form), or a module that extracts facts from free text in documents throughout the Web, and so forth.
- an object 400 may have one or more specialized facts, such as a name fact 406 and a property fact 408 .
- a name fact 406 is a fact that conveys a name for the entity or concept represented by the object 400 . For example, for an object representing the country Spain, there may be a fact conveying the name of the object as “Spain.”
- a name fact 406 being a special instance of a general fact 404 , includes the same parameters as any other fact 404 ; it has an attribute, a value, a fact ID, metrics, sources, etc.
- the attribute 424 of a name fact 406 indicates that the fact is a name fact, and the value is the actual name.
- the name may be a string of characters.
- An object 400 may have one or more name facts, as many entities or concepts can have more than one name.
- an object representing Spain may have name facts conveying the country's common name “Spain” and the official name “Kingdom of Spain.”
- an object representing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may have name facts conveying the agency's acronyms “PTO” and “USPTO” and the official name “United States Patent and Trademark Office.” If an object has one or more name facts, one of the name facts may be designated as a primary name and the other name facts may be designated as secondary names.
- first or second labels associated with A-V pairs extracted from a source document may be made into name facts for the object with which the A-V pairs are associated.
- the first label may be made into a name fact that serves as a primary name for the object and the second label(s) may be made into name facts that serve as secondary names for the object.
- a property fact 408 is a fact that conveys a statement about the entity or concept represented by the object 400 that may be of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, a property fact may convey that Spain is a country in Europe.
- a property fact 408 being a special instance of a general fact 404 , also includes the same parameters (such as attribute, value, fact ID, etc.) as other facts 404 .
- the attribute field 426 of a property fact 408 indicates that the fact is a property fact, and the value field is a string of text that conveys the statement of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, the value of a property fact may be the text string “is a country in Europe.”
- Some objects 400 may have one or more property facts while other objects may have no property facts.
- each object may have additional special facts aside from name facts and property facts, such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, organization, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object.
- name facts and property facts such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, organization, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object.
- an object's name(s) and/or properties may be represented by special records that have a different format than the general facts records 404 associated with the attribute-value pairs of an object.

- the “score” of a candidate label is a count (which may or may not be weighted) of linking documents that include a link, to the source document with the corresponding anchor text.
- the “score” of a candidate label is the cosine distance of a frequency vector, corresponding to the candidate label, to a centroid vector.
- the label association module 534 inserts the selected labels into objects or records in a facts database, for instance by adding name facts 404 to an object 400 containing the A-V pairs with which a particular selected label is to be associated.
- the system 500 also includes a fact storage system 536 for storing and indexing facts. As described above, in some embodiments each fact stored in the fact storage system 536 includes a corresponding list of sources from which the respective fact was extracted.

- items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated.
- some items shown separately in FIG. 5 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers.
- the actual number of servers used to implement a document processing system and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
Abstract
Description
where P (linking document) is the page importance metric of a linking document that includes a link, to the source document, with anchor text corresponding to the candidate label.
where f·c is the dot product of frequency vector f and the centroid vector c, ∥f∥ is the length of frequency vector f, ∥c∥ is the length of the centroid vector c (which is 1 since the centroid vector is already normalized, as described above), θ is an angle between frequency vector f and the centroid vector c, and cos θ (the cosine of angle θ) is the cosine distance between the two vectors. A smaller θ (i.e., as θ approaches 0) means that f and c are closer to each other. Cos 0 is equal to 1, which is the largest positive number that cos θ can ever be. A frequency vector f that is closest to the centroid vector c will yield the largest positive cos θ (i.e., nearest to 1). Thus, the frequency vector that has the shortest distance to the centroid vector is the frequency vector that has the largest positive cosine distance value with respect to the centroid vector.
