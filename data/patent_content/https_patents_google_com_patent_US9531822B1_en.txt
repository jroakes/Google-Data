Some or all of the identification information may or may not be accessible to the various participants of online video group discussion as is discussed in further detail hereinbelow.
- a server computing device such as computer 12 may host a plurality of these live, multi-participant, communication sessions, which may be transmitted over networks (e.g. networks 14 and 18 shown in FIG. 1 ) and may be broadcast at various computing devices (e.g. 38 , 40 , 42 , 44 , etc.).
- Embodiments of ranking process 10 may be used to rank these conversations in order to identify the most appropriate conversations for a particular user.
- ranking process 10 may identify ( 402 ), using one or more computing devices, a plurality of live communication sessions (e.g. social networking based communication sessions).
- server computing device 12 may be configured to store information related to current and/or future communication sessions. This information may include, but is not limited to, date of the communication session, starting time and ending time of the communication session, the topic of the communication session, the organizer of the communication session, etc.
- ranking process 10 may apply ( 404 ) one or more parameters to each of the live communication sessions.
- the parameters may be based upon the information associated with each communication session.
- some parameters may include, but are not limited to, the number of participants in a live communication session, a popularity metric associated with an organizer of a live communication session (e.g. the number of followers a user may have on a social network), an affinity of a user to one or more live communication session participants, an affinity of a user to an organizer of a live communication session, an average watch time associated with an organizer of a live communication session, a reshare count, a comment count, a view count, and a user favorability count.
- these parameters are provided merely by way of example as any suitable parameter may be applied in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure.
- ranking process 10 may determine ( 406 ) a non-adjusted value for the parameters for each of the plurality of live communication sessions. For example, given a first communication session involving a cooking class a second communication session involving a baseball focused talk show, and a third communication session involving a political discourse, ranking process may determine a value for each parameter. In this particular example, if one of the parameters is the number of participants and the first session includes 17 participants, the second session includes 2500 participants and the third session includes 312 participants, ranking process may determine that the third session has a value of (2), the second session has a value of (3) and the first session has a value of (1). In other words, the communication session having the greatest number of participants may receive the highest ranking.
- ranking process 10 may be configured to generate a combined value for each of the plurality of live communication sessions.
- the combined value may be the sum of the parameter values associated with each communication session.
- ranking process 10 may determine ( 408 ) whether the at least one parameter has been assigned a predetermined weight adjustment. For example, the number of participants may be more heavily weighted than the comment count and, as such, may have a multiplier associated therewith.
- the weight may be user-selectable (e.g. if a user would prefer to see the most popular communication sessions he/she may set a higher importance upon the number of participants in a communication session. Additionally and/or alternatively, if the user is less interested in, for example, the popularity of the organizer of a video, this weight may be set at a lower importance and may therefore have a smaller multiplier associated therewith. It should be noted that this weight may be applied at any suitable time, for example, prior to the generation of the combined value.
- ranking process 10 may be configured to adjust ( 410 ) the value for the parameter based upon, at least in part, the predetermined weight that has been assigned. In some cases, no weight may be assigned or the same weight may be assigned to each parameter therefore resulting in no adjustment.
- ranking process 10 may be configured to generate ( 412 ) a combined value for each of the plurality of live social networking based communication sessions. This combined value may be based upon the non-adjusted value and/or the adjusted value. Accordingly, in the event that all parameters have been assigned the same weight ranking process 10 may utilize only the non-adjusted value.
- ranking process 10 may be configured to rank ( 414 ) each of the live communication sessions. Using the example provided above, in some embodiments, this may involve comparing the combined values for each communication session and providing the ranking to one or more users. Additionally and/or alternatively, ranking process 10 may utilize the ranking in order to determine the most appropriate communication sessions for a particular user.
- ranking process 10 may utilize the ranking in order to provide a web search ranking, social networking content ranking, or in any other suitable fashion.
- a user's social networking profile may be linked to a web search or social networking search in order to effectuate the ranking process described herein.
- Interface 500 may be generated and presented to one or more users such as user 46 shown in FIG. 1 .
- one or more communications sessions may be generated (e.g. communication session interfaces 502 , 504 , 506 , 508 , and 510 ).
- ranking process 10 may scan through all of the current and/or future communications sessions to determine that the “Lunch Brunch Featuring Chris ABC” may be of most interest to user 46 based upon the factors identified herein.
- communication session interface 502 may be more prominently displayed to the user.
- communication session interfaces 504 , 506 , 508 , and 510 may be presented to the user in the order in which ranking process 10 has determined are of greatest interest to user 46 .
- the applied parameter may be focused upon a potential user's particular interests. These interests may be obtained from various sources. For example, from the user's social networking profile or from transcriptions of audio or video conversations that the user has been a member of. In this way, keywords (either from the profile, transcription, etc.) may be compared to the description of the communication session in order to determine whether there is a commonality.
- ranking process 10 may be configured to determine a commonality metric between a user's interests and a transcription of audio associated with a live communication session.
- the live communication session may have started and a transcription created. The words of this transcription may be compared to the user's interests or other information associated with the user in order to determine the likelihood of that particular communication session being of interest.
- Communication sessions having a higher commonality metric may receive a higher value, which may result in an adjusted ranking.
- some or all of the user devices described herein may be electronically coupled to an electronic communication session.
- the electronic communication session may be server application 20 running on server computing device 12 .
- user devices, 38 , 40 , 42 , 44 , 500 may communicate with server application 20 via one or more networks, for example, network 14 , 18 , etc.
- modalities may include, but are not limited to, video-based, audio-based, text-based and hybrid modalities.
- any number of participants may be included within the electronic communication session. And some or all of the participants may be participating in the session using any suitable mode of communication. Accordingly, multiple synchronous and asynchronous communication messages may be transmitted of any modality type and any number of modality conversions may occur during a particular electronic communication session.
- the present disclosure may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present disclosure may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a “circuit,” “module” or “system.” Furthermore, the present disclosure may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium.
- the computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device.
- the computer-usable or computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.
- a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.
- Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present disclosure may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present disclosure may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the “C” programming language or similar programming languages.
- the program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server.
- the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- Internet Service Provider for example, AT&T, MCI, Sprint, EarthLink, MSN, GTE, etc.
- These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.
- the computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.
- each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).
- the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.
