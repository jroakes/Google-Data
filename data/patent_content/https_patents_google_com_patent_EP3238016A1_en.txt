For instance, the computing device may user various sensors and communication components to determine that the user is walking and wearing gloves. The computing device may account for the degree to which the gesture accuracy is affected by the user state by modifying the respective probabilities of one or more candidate text strings. Accordingly, the computing device may select a particular candidate string based at least in part on the gesture and the one or more determined user states. In this way, the computing device may more accurately determine and predict character strings intended by the user based on the user state thereby allowing the computing device to infer text input more accurately.

As one example, keyboard module 108 may adjust one or more parameters, such as one or more motor-noise parameters, used to determine a physical cost value for each candidate string of the one or more candidate strings. As another example, keyboard module 108 may reduce reliance on the accuracy of the input information when determining the one or more candidate strings by adjusting a relative weighting between physical cost values and lexical cost values for each of the one or more candidate strings. Further details of the physical cost values and the lexical cost values are discussed below with reference to FIG. 2.
- the user may perform one or more gestures that may be detected by presence-sensitive display 104. For instance, the user may perform a plurality of tap gestures intending to enter the phrase "Let's go" 120.
- Gesture module 110 may receive an indication of the gestures and determine that alignment points 129A-129F (collectively, "alignment points 129") are traversed by the gestures.
- User state module 1 14 may receive sensor input and select one or more user states associated with gesture accuracy. For example, user state module 114 may detect that the user is walking (i.e., user state 103C) which may reduce gesture accuracy relative to sitting or standing still.
- keyboard module 108 may determine one or more candidate strings. For instance, as opposed to determining candidate string "Lrtd ho" without accounting for the user state, keyboard module 108 may- determine candidate string "Let's go" 120 by reducing reliance on the accuracy of the alignment points 129 or increasing reliance of lexical models, in this way, techniques of this disclosure may improve the selection of candidate strings from touch data based at least in part on one or more detected user states.

- Keyboard module 208 may use a language model 252 to determine language model scores (or "language model probabilities") for one or more characters strings based on the sequence of keys corresponding to touch events. For example, each key of the keyboard may represent a character or a keyboard operation. Keyboard module 208 may determine, based on the sequence of keys, particular characters represented by one or more key selections. A character such as a number or a lowercase letter may require a single character key selection (e.g., ⁇ letter-key>, ⁇ number-key>, etc.) and a character such as a capitalized letter may require two key selections (e.g., ⁇ shift ⁇ key> + ⁇ letter-key>, etc.).
- Keyboard module 8 may access language model 252 of computing device 202 to determine language model scores for a group of one or more character strings based on sequences of keys corresponding to a gesture. That is, keyboard module 208 may incrementally generate a group of one or more character strings using language model 252 in response to receiving indications of one or more gestures, in some examples, the language model score for a character string may be referred to as a lexical cost value for the character string.
- a character string may be a group of characters comprising a prefix or portion of a character string included in language model 252 or an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) character string not included in language model 252, in some examples, a character string may be a group of characters comprising a complete character string included in language model 252 or a complete OOV character string.

- keyboard module 208 may incrementally determine spatial and language model scores (e.g., physical cost values and lexical cost values) corresponding to character strings. Using the spatial and language model scores, keyboard module 208 may determine a combined score for each character string based on the spatial and language model score for each respective character string.

- keyboard module 208 may, while receiving a plurality of indications of one or more gestures detected at a presence-sensitive screen, update a language model score based on a language context, wherein the language context changes in response to at least one the plurality of indications of one or more gestures.
- the language model scores associated with character strings in language model 252 may change in response to character strings that are inputted. Because the combined score may indicate a probability that a character string corresponds to a gesture, keyboard module 208 may rank the character strings by their respective combined scores as further described in this disclosure.
- Keyboard module 8 may then output the character strings and/or determine other character strings based on the character strings for output.
- language model 252 of computing device 202 may include a list of character strings, e.g., words, within a written language vocabulary.
- language model 252 may be based on and/or include a set of character strings based on a dictionary (e.g., that includes a vocabulary of words) stored at computing device 202 or a remote computing device that is accessible by computing device 202.
- the dictionary may include a vocabulary of words.
- a vocabulary of words may be a body of words used in a written and/or spoken language.
- a dictionary may be implemented as a data structure that stores one or more words of a vocabulary in a structured manner.
- Language model 252 may indicate a probability of each respective character string based on the frequency with which the character string occurs in a given language context. For instance, the character string "door” may be more frequently used in the English language following the character string “the” and therefore associated with a larger probability than, for example, the character string "run” following the character string “the.”
- keyboard module 208 may use language model 252 to determine a language model score for a character string based on a language context that may include, but is not limited to, e.g., a character corresponding to indication of the gesture performed by the user, character strings in a dictionary and/or previously inputted character strings, etc.
- keyboard module 208 may determine a group of characters associated with keys corresponding to a gesture. The group of characters may be a prefix or portion of a character string. The character string may be included in language model 252 or may be an out-of-vocabulary character string.
- Keyboard module 208 may search or "look ahead" to determine one or more character strings in language model 252 that correspond respectively to the prefix.
- keyboard module 208 may perform a lookup of multiple different groups of characters associated with keys corresponding to a gesture, for example, where each group of characters may be a prefix or portion of a character string. Keyboard module 208 may use language model 252 to identify one or more character strings in language model 252 that include a part of or all of the characters of the group of characters that may be a prefix or portion of the character string. For instance, a user may perform a gesture at display component 256 that traverses the keys s-a-r-t. Keyboard module 208 may therefore perform a lookup of prefix s-a-r to determine a group of character strings that begin with s-a-r. Similarly, keyboard module 208 may perform a lookup of prefix s-a-t to determine a group of character strings that begin with s-a-t.
- keyboard module 208 may determine a combined score for each character string based at least in part on the respective spatial and language model scores for each respective character string.
- the combined probability for a character string may therefore represent the probability of the character string based on a language context and the accuracy of a gesture given a set of keys.
- Keyboard module 208 may order each character string in a group of character strings by combined score in descending order from most probable character string to least probable character string.
- keyboard module 208 may determine one or more character strings based on the one or more character string with the highest probabilities, display component 256 may output such character strings as suggested character strings.
- keyboard module 208 may determine the one or more candidate strings based at least on the one or more user states detected by user state module 214. For instance, when determining a combined score for a character string, keyboard module 208 may adjust, based at least in part one the one or more user states detected by user state module 214, at least one of a spatial model score for the character string or a language model score for the character string. As one example, when user state module 214 detects a state of the user of computing device 202 may reduce gesture accuracy, keyboard module 208 may- determine the combined score such that the spatial model score is not weighted as much as the language model score.
- keyboard module 208 may adjust the weighting based on a value received from user state module 214 that indicates a degree, in a range of degrees, to which the detected user state affects gesture accuracy. In this way, as opposed to adjusting the weighting in the same manner for all user states, keyboard module 208 may adjust the weighting based on the particular detected user state(s).
- keyboard module 208 may adjust the determination of the spatial model scores based at least on the one or more user states detected by user state module 214. For instance, keyboard module 208 may modify the spatial model of spatial models 251 used to determine the spatial model scores based at least on the one or more user states detected by user state module 214. For example, where spatial models 251 include a bivariate Gaussian model for each key, keyboard module 208 may modify the bivariate Gaussian model based on the value received from user state module 214 that indicates the degree to which the detected user state affects gesture accuracy. Further details of how keyboard module 208 may modify spatial models are discussed below with reference to FIG. 3.
- keyboard module 208 may select, based at least in part on the adjusting, a particular candidate string from the one or more candidate strings. For instance, as discussed above, keyboard module 208 may rank the character strings by their respective combined scores, and select the candidate string with the best rank (i.e., most probable) as the particular candidate string. Keyboard module 208 may output the particular candidate string, such as for display at display component 256. In this way, keyboard module 208 may compensate for one or more detected user states when selecting candidate strings.
- FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating spatial models for a particular key, in accordance with one or more techniques of this disclosure.
- graph 360 includes a horizontal axis representing locations along a surface of display component 256 of presence-sensitive display 204 of FIG. 2, a vertical axis representing the probability that a touch event corresponds to key 364, and curves for spatial models 362A and 362B (collectively, "spatial models 362").
- spatial models 362 may be examples of spatial models that may be included in spatial models 251 of FIG. 2,
- a keyboard module such as keyboard module 108 of FIG. 1 or 208 of FIG. 2, may use one or more of spatial models 362 to generate a probability that key 364 was selected.
- keyboard module 208 may modify a spatial model used to determine the spatial model scores based at least on the one or more user states detected by user state module 214. For instance, responsive to user state module 214 detecting a user state that reduces gesture accuracy, keyboard module 208 may modify spatial model 362A to generate spatial model 362B. Alternatively, as opposed to modifying spatial model 362 A to generate spatial model 362B, keyboard module 208 may select spatial model 362B based at least on the one or more user states detected by user state module 214.
- keyboard module 208 may compensate for one or more detected user states when selecting candidate strings. For example, if the user of computing device 202 touches location 366, as detected by presence- sensitive input component 258 and determined by gesture module 210, while user state module 214 detects that the user is walking, as selected by the user state module 214, and the spatial model used to determine the spatial model scores is not modified or selected based at least on the detected user state (i.e., spatial model 362A is used without modification), keyboard module 208 may determine that a touch event at location 366 of display component 256 has less than a 50% probability of corresponding to key 364.
- keyboard module 208 may determine that a touch event at location 366 of display component 256 has greater than a 50% probability of corresponding to key 364.

- GUI 616 may be a user interface generated by one or more of keyboard module 108 of FIG. 1 and application module 1 12A of FIG. 1 that allows a user to interact with a computing device, such as computing device 102 of FIG. 1 .
- text editor control 622 may display text content entered by a user, generated by computing device 102, and/or received by computing device 102 from another computing device that is operably coupled to computing device 102.
- text content may include "Lrtd ho" 620.
- Keyboard module 108 may cause presence- sensitive display 104 to display text editor control 622 with the included text content.
- Graphical keyboard 624 may be displayed by presence-sensitive display 104 as a set of selectable keys. Keys may represent a single character from a character set (e.g., letters of the English alphabet), or may represent combinations of characters.
- a graphical keyboard may include a traditional "QWERTY" keyboard layout. Other examples may contain characters for different languages, different character sets, or different character layouts.
- graphical keyboard 124 includes a version of the traditional "QWERTY" keyboard layout for the English language providing character keys as well as various keys (e.g., the "up arrow” key that provide "shift” functionality) providing other functionality.
- Example keys include "E” key 630 and "S" key 628.
- graphical keyboard 624 includes one or more word suggestions, such as word suggestion 632 that includes the word "out.”
- computing device 102 may implement a user state module 114 to improve the accuracy of user selections at keyboard 124.
- User state module 114 may select one or more user states associated with gesture accuracy, output an indication of the one or more detected user states to one or more other components of computing device 102, such as keyboard module 108.
- user state module 114 and keyboard module 108 may determine, based at least in part on the detected one or more user states, a particular candidate string for display, in some examples.
- the user may perform one or more gestures that may be detected by presence-sensitive display 104. For instance, the user may perform a swipe gesture intending to enter the phrase "Let's go” 120. As shown in the example of FIG. 6, the swipe gesture performed by the user to enter the phrase "Let's go” 120 may begin near to the "L" key, follow path 680, and end near the "O" key.
- Gesture module 110 may receive an indication of the gestures and determine that alignment points 629A-629F (collectively, “alignment points 629”) are traversed by the gestures.
- User state module 1 14 may receive sensor input and select one or more user states associated with gesture accuracy. For example, in the example of FIG.
- user state module 1 14 may detect that the user is sitting which may not reduce gesture accuracy relative to walking or running. Based on the detected user state from user state module 114 and alignment points 629A-629F from gesture module 110, keyboard module 108 may determine one or more candidate strings. For instance, as opposed to the example of FIG. 1 where the detected user state reduces gesture accuracy and keyboard module 108 reduced reliance on the accuracy of alignment points 129 by using a spatial model more like 362B than 362A and/or increased reliance on lexical models, in the example of FIG. 6, keyboard module 08 may determine candidate string "Lrtd ho" without reducing reliance on the accuracy of the alignment points 629 or increasing reliance of lexical models. While, in the example of FIG.
- the candidate string determined by keyboard module 108 may not be the string that the user desired to enter (i.e., "Let's go"), keyboard module 108 may not correct for the user's sloppy gesture entry when the detected user state does not affect gesture accuracy.
