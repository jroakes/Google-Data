Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical field of communications, and in one embodiment, to a method, system and apparatus of property billboarding and financial revenue distribution to property owner in a geo-spatial environment.
- Billboarding may be used to promote products and/or services. Advertisements are sometimes displayed on buildings and/or other structures. For example, advertisers may pay building owners to display the advertisements on faces of city buildings, barns, etc. The advertisements may provide a promotional profile sought by the advertisers and may generate revenue sought by the building owners. Sometimes, however, local ordinances may prohibit advertising in the form of billboarding.
- Billboarding may also be found in a geo-spatial environment. For example, sponsors of geo-spatial environments may display the advertisements on representations of real life buildings and/or structures. The advertisers may pay the sponsors of the geo-spatial environments for the billboarding services. Owners of the buildings and/or structures represented in the geo-spatial environment, however, may not receive any compensation for the advertisements displayed in conjunction with the representations.
- A method, apparatus and system of property billboarding and financial revenue distribution to property owner in a geo-spatial environment are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes generating a community network of user profiles, each user profile associated with a specific geographic location, determining a first user profile, generating advertisements, determining a first advertisement, generating a first display view to include a three-dimensional map view embodied by the community network, the first user profile represented at a location in the three-dimensional map view corresponding with the associated specific geographic location, and the first advertisement displayed in conjunction with the first user profile, and generating a commerce transaction associated with the first user profile.
- The first advertisement may also be displayed in conjunction with a property representation selected from a group including a representation of an outside surface of a structure associated with the first user profile, a representation of an inside area of a structure associated with the first user profile, a representation of an outside property area associated with the first user profile, a wiki associated with the first user profile, and content associated with the wiki.
- The method may further include generating a revenue transaction associated with the first user profile. The method may also include generating an online payment transaction associated with the first user profile. The method may include generating a link between the first advertisement and a website, tabulating clicks of the link, determining revenue based on the tabulation of the clicks, and generating the online payment transaction associated with the first user profile based on the revenue.
- In addition, the method may include apportioning a first portion of the revenue and a second portion of the revenue associated with the online payment transaction, associating the first portion of the revenue with a claimant of the first user profile, and associating the second portion of the revenue with a sponsor of the community network.
- The method may include providing at least a portion of the advertisements available for placement in conjunction with a particular user profile. The method may further include providing at least a portion of the user profiles available to accept an advertisement. In addition, the method may include selecting a geographic region, and selecting a particular user profile of the portion of the user profiles available to accept an advertisement having a specific geographic location associated with the geographic region.
- The method may also include receiving a preference (e.g., may include an advertiser, a product, and/or a service) associated with a second user profile of the portion of the user profiles available to accept an advertisement, determining a second advertisement that matches the preference, and generating a second display view to include a three-dimensional map view embodied by the community network, the second user profile represented at a location in the three-dimensional map view corresponding with the associated specific geographic location, and the second advertisement displayed in conjunction with the second user profile.
- The method may further include providing search categories associated with the advertisements, selecting at least one search category, determining a third advertisement associated with the search category, determining a third user profile associated with the third advertisement, and generating a third display view to include a three-dimensional map view embodied by the community network, the third user profile represented at a location in the three-dimensional map view corresponding with the associated specific geographic location, and the third advertisement displayed in conjunction with the third user profile.
