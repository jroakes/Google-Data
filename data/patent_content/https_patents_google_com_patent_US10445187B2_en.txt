Definitions
- This invention relates generally to data management. More specifically, this invention relates to a system and method for performing searching and indexing of large backup data sets.
- Businesses and consumers have large quantities of backed up data at rest. These backups can be automatically created or done manually on demand. In order to efficiently store these large backups they are often compressed or otherwise stored in formats that do not lend themselves to easy browsing or searching or restoring subsets of the backup. In addition, their sheer size makes these tasks challenging.
- Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods of providing search capabilities for data backups by indexing multiple time-based versions of the data backups such that the multiple time-based versions of each of the data backups are factored into a search result.
- first data associated with a first backup of a data set is received, the first data including a list of changes associated with the data set between a first point in time associated with the first backup and a second point in time associated with a second backup, the second point in time being prior to the first point in time, the data set being located on a customer application server and being protected by a data management system.
- an index representative of difference data is created, the difference data associated with changes in the data set between each of the first backup, the second backup and the one or more intermediary backups, and a corresponding prior backup most recent in time to each of the first backup, second backup and the one or more intermediary backups, each intermediary backup occurring at an associated intermediary point in time occurring between the first backup and the second backup.
- second data associated with a search request is received, the search request including an attribute of the data set, the attribute of the data set including a file within the data set and at least one backup time associated with the file.
- a version of the file associated with the at least one backup time associated with the file is retrieved, wherein retrieving the version of the file comprises generating the version of the file by combining the difference data from each of the indices associated with the at least one backup time and intermediary backup times between the at least one backup time and the second point in time, thereby providing search capabilities for data backups by indexing data backups at a plurality of backup times such that multiple versions of each of the data backups are factored into a search result.
- the attribute of the data set further comprises at least one of a file name associated with the file, a directory name associated with a directory, a backup name associated with a backup, date ranges associated with the file and the backup, and file metadata associated with the file.
- the list of changes include changes to at least one of a file path associated with the file, file type associated with the file, creation date associated with the file, modification date associated with the file, file size associated with the file, and file status associated with the file.
- file status includes at least one of the file being created, the file being deleted, file content associated with the file being modified, and metadata associated with the file being modified.
- each index includes a status associated with the difference data, the status including at least one of a no change operation, an add operation, an update operation, and a delete operation.
- combining indices comprises combining the status for each index across the backup times.
- the systems and methods described herein further include receiving a request associated with expiring a third backup.
- the third backup comprises one of the second backup or an intermediary backup, merging difference data associated with an index of a fourth backup that is most recent in time after the third backup into difference data of an index associated with the third backup.
- the third backup comprises the first backup
- the request to expire the third backup is received at a request time after the first point in time and before a backup point in time associated with the fourth backup, the fourth backup being taken after the first point in time, disabling search capability of an index associated with the first backup, receiving a request associated with a backup for the fourth backup at the fourth backup point in time, and merging, at the computing device, difference data associated with an index of the fourth backup into difference data associated with an index associated with the third backup.
- the merged difference data comprises a first update operation, when the difference data associated with the third backup index includes one of the add operation or a second update operation and the difference data associated with the fourth backup index includes the first update operation; a delete operation, when the difference data associated with the third backup index includes the update operation and the difference data associated with the fourth backup index includes the delete operation; and a no change operation, when the difference data associated with the third backup index includes the add operation and the difference data associated with the fourth backup index includes the delete operation.

- a search appliance receives changelists from application and file system backup processes and stores information about the files in searchable indices.
- the specific algorithms utilized for storing and querying the backup data allow for fast indexing, space-efficient storage and fast searching and browsing of arbitrarily large backup data sets. They also provide for the removal of backups and their indexed data in an efficient manner.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an overall system architecture for searching, indexing and expiring data, as described in some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 1 shows a customer application server 102 , customer data source 104 , Connector 106 , Copy Data Storage (CDS) 108 , search server 110 , and a user interface (UI) 112 .
- CDS Copy Data Storage
- UI user interface
- Customer application server 102 is a server containing data that the customer wants protected.
- Customer application server 102 includes a customer data source 104 , and a connector 106 .
- Customer data source 104 can include data stored on a virtual machine (VM), NAS Server, file system, database, etc.
- VM virtual machine
- NAS Server file system
- database etc.
- Connector 106 is software on customer application server 102 .
- Connector 106 is used to protect data source 104 .
- Connector 106 communicates with the CDS 108 and performs the backups on the customer applications. It also generates the changelists for the search server 110 .
- CDS 108 uses the network to communicate with the Connector and the search server 110 .
- CDS 108 contains a scheduler for protecting customer applications and acts as a point of communication between the UI 112 , the Connector 106 , and the search application 112 .
- the scheduler is used to determine when to perform backups or expire backups based on schedules set by the end-user.
- the CDS 108 is the central point of communication for the UI 112 , the connector 106 and the search server 110 .
- Search server 110 is a search application used to browse and search the contents of the backups of the customer data source 104 . It may be a single physical or virtual server or a cluster of physical and/or virtual servers.
- User interface 112 is either a graphical or command-line interface that an end-user uses to interact with CDS 108 . As explained in more detail below, an end-user, through user interface 112 , can either send HTTP commands or enter full or portion of the filename or directory or pattern as an input in GUI to search for matching files or backups containing matching files.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating searching and indexing data, as described in some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- a search and indexing process 200 begins with CDS 108 sending a request to the Connector 106 for a backup of customer data 104 (process 202 ).
- the request can include any information required to back up the data source.
- the request can include information about the backup request such as the location of the data or the information identifying the application. This can include the server containing the application or data, file paths on the server, or identifying names of applications. It can also include information required to perform the backup such as what to include/exclude, logins, whether to truncate application logs after the backup, etc.
- Connector 106 provides search server 110 with a changelist 204 .
- a changelist is a list of files that have changed since the last backup. Changelist is described in more detail in FIG. 3 .
- search server 110 indexes the changelist 206 .
- indexing the changelist includes iterating through the changelist and creating an incremental index of changes to the files and an alias of the contents of the entire backup.
- Browse/search process can include information about the backup/application to be searched. It can also include information such as file names or patterns, directory names or patterns, date ranges of files or backups, specific backups, and file metadata.
- CDS 108 makes a search request to search server 110 ( 210 ).
- CDS 108 transforms the UI 112 request into the search syntax used by the search server 110 .
- search syntax may include language defining exact or fuzzy matching of text fields such as file names or paths including the use of wildcards or regular expressions. It can also include date ranges and Boolean logic to combine search terms.
- Search server 110 performs a search based on the search syntax, and processes the result ( 212 ). Processing of the result includes transforming the search results from a historical view of each files' lifecycle into a representation of the contents of each backup. Search server 110 then aggregates each of the results from each backup into a single search result set.
- search server 110 After processing the results, search server 110 returns the results to the CDS 108 ( 214 ).
- processing the results includes transforming the results into user-friendly formats, and in the case of large result sets, providing pagination to the CDS 108 so that it can fetch reasonable portions of the results across the network incrementally.
- CDS 108 then returns the search results to UI 112 ( 216 ).
- CDS 108 sends the results to the UI 112 in a format that allows the UI to present the results to the end-user in a variety of formats, such as a list view or a file system hierarchy and to enable sorting or filtering.

- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating how the contents of backup are spread across incremental indices and then exposed through aliases that span the physical indices, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- Table 400 includes a list of files and their changes across four backups 402 , 404 , 406 and 408 .
- FIG. 4 also shows indexed data in four indices 410 , 412 , 414 and 416 .
- FIG. 4 also shows four aliases 418 , 420 , 422 and 424 .
- table 400 there are 10 files that change across four backups.
- the first backup since there are no previous backups, all of the files appear as being added. All of these files are indexed into index 410 . Alias 418 is created to represent index 410 .
- backup 404 five files are updated.
- the changelist contains only these files, each marked as changed. Only these files are indexed into index 412 .
- Alias 420 is created and contains both physical indices 410 and 412 to represent the entire backup.
- the changelist contains only these files, each marked as changed. These three files are indexed into index 414 . Alias 422 is created and spans the physical indices 410 , 412 , and 414 .
- backup 408 two files are deleted.
- the changelist contains these two files marked as deleted.
- Index 416 is created with these two files.
- Alias 424 is created and contains physical indices 410 , 412 , 414 , and 416 to represent all of the files in that backup.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating how a search is performed across incremental indices, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 5 shows search server 110 , two indices 502 and 504 , and one alias 506 .
- Search server 110 receives a request to search for file 4 within the backup represented by the alias 506 .
- Alias 506 includes data in indices 502 and 504 .
- Index 502 includes files file 1 , file 2 , file 3 and file 4 .
- Index 504 includes file 2 ′, the changed version of file 2 , and file 4 ′, the changed version of file 4 . If a search request is looking for file 4 , the search result will use alias 506 and return the results file 4 from index 502 and file 4 ′ from index 504 ; showing file 4 ′ as a later version of file 4 .
- the post-processing looks at these results and determines that since file 4 ′ is the most recent version of file 4 , then it is the version that is found in the backup represented by 506 .
- the search server returns file 4 ′ as the result to the CDS 108 .
- FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a search across incremental indices when a file has been deleted, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 6 shows search server 110 , alias 602 , and indices 604 , 606 , 608 , and 610 .
- Search server 110 includes alias 602 and indices 604 606 608 610 .
- Index 604 contains entry file 1 and index 608 contains entry file 1 ′, which, in some embodiments, is a later version of file 1 .
- Index 610 contains entry file 1 ′′ that lists the file as deleted.
- Alias 602 represents a backup that spans all four indices 604 606 608 610 .
- search server 110 When search server 110 receives a request to locate file 1 in the backup represented by alias 602 , search server 110 searches alias 602 and will locate three results. The results are file 1 from 604 , file 1 ′ from 608 and file 1 ′′ from 610 . Post processing examines the timeline of file 1 , file 1 ′, and file 1 ′′ and determines that since file 1 ′′ is created latest in time and that it shows a delete. Post processing determines that file 1 does not exist in the backup. An empty search result is returned to CDS 108 . Post processing looks at the results from aliases that may contains multiple version of the FileMetadata. It aggregates the FileMetadata based on the file system path and sort it based on index timeline. If the last FileMetadata in the aggregated list has status as DELETED, then post processing determines that the file no longer exists from the corresponding alias and forward. An empty search result is returned, otherwise the latest version of the FileMetadata is returned.

- FIG. 7 also shows merged indices 704 ′ and merged aliases 708 ′ and 709 ′.
- the 704 index corresponds to the oldest backup 701
- 705 index corresponds to second backup 702
- 706 index corresponds to the newest backup 706
- the first alias 707 is mapped to only one index: the first index 704 .
- Second alias 708 is mapped to indices 704 and 705 .
- the last alias 709 is mapped to all three indices: 704 , 705 and 706 .
- an expire request corresponds to the request to delete the backup. This could be initiated by the user or by the scheduler on CDS 108 based on the protection policy for the application. The protection policy dictates when the backup image should be removed.
- index 704 ′ contains all the updated document versions from index 705 .
- Index 705 is then deleted and the corresponding alias for backup 702 namely alias 707 is also deleted.
- the final result contains two indices, 704 ′ and 706 and two aliases 708 ′ and 709 ′.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram and table illustrating expiration of a middle backup, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

- the first alias 807 is mapped to only one index 804 .
- the second alias 808 is mapped to indices 804 and 805 .
- the newest alias 809 is mapped to all three indices: 804 , 805 and 806 .
- index 805 ′ contains all the updates from index 806 .
- Index 806 is deleted along with expiring backup alias 808 .
- the final result contains two indices, 804 and 805 ′ and two aliases 807 and 809 ′. Alias 807 is still mapped to index 804 as before. However, alias 809 ′ is now mapped to indices 804 and updated index 805 ′.
- FIG. 9 is a diagram and table illustrating expiration of the newest backup, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 9 shows two indices 903 904 and two aliases 905 906 corresponding to two backups: 901 902 .
- FIG. 9 also shows virtual alias 907 , alias 910 merged index 904 ′ and backup 908 .
- Index 903 is the oldest index and index 904 is the newest index.
- the first alias 905 is mapped to only one index 903 .
- the second alias 906 is mapped to both indices 903 and 904 .
- backups subsequent to a first backup are incremental. Since backups are incremental except for the first backup 901 , the second backup 902 index 904 contains only the changes made after the first backup 901 index 903 . When expiring the newest backup 902 , the corresponding index 904 cannot be deleted. Index 904 cannot be deleted because the next backup will only contain the changes made after 904 and the changes in 904 will be lost if it is deleted. The same rule applies when there is only one backup to be expired.
- the expiring backup index 904 is kept until a new backup is available for indexing.
- the documents in this index should not be searchable. Therefore its alias 906 is removed from the searchable aliases and marked as a virtual alias 907 .
- search server 110 receives a request for a new backup 908 , the new document changelist 909 is merged into index 904 ′. Therefore index 904 ′ contains its original changes with updates from the new changelist 909 .
- the updated index 904 ′ is added back to a searchable alias 910 .
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating search results before and after expiring a backup, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 10 shows three indices 1004 1005 1006 and three aliases 1007 1008 1009 corresponding to three backups: 1001 1002 1003 .
- FIG. 10 also shows merged index 1004 ′ and merged aliases 1008 ′ and 1009 ′.
- the first backup index 1004 contains 3 documents file 1 , file 2 and file 3 .
- the second backup index 1005 contains file 1 ′ which is a newer version of file 1 and the deleted marker file 3 ′ for file 3 .
- the third backup index 1006 contains file 2 ′ which is a newer version of file 2 .
- search server When user searching for backups matching document file 1 , search server will looks for it in the latest alias 1009 . Alias result will include index 1004 , file 1 and index 1005 , file 1 ′ The post processing looks at these results and determines that file 1 was added in index 1004 but never deleted. It will find all the indices and their corresponding backups. Therefore the final result after post processing will contain all 3 backups: 1001 , 1002 and 1003 .
- searching for backups containing file 3 returns only backup 1001 since file 3 was deleted in backup 1002 . Only a delete marker for file 3 is present in the second index 1005 .
- a user searching for backups containing file 1 gets the result with only two backups: 1002 and 1003 .
- searching for backups containing file 3 returns an empty result because the backup 1001 containing file 3 has already been expired.
- FIG. 11 is a table illustrating merge rules during expiration, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 11 shows merge rules for different versions of the same document between two indices. Snapshot N is a newer version of the index and snapshot N ⁇ 1 is a prior version of the index. The documents are merged from the recent index into the previous index.
- indexing statuses There are 3 indexing statuses for a document, ADD, UPDATE and DELETE.
- ADD When a document is first seen for indexing, its status is ADD.
- UPDATE For an existing document, if its content or metadata has been modified, its status is considered an UPDATE.
- DELETE When a document is deleted, its status is DELETE.
- ADD and DELETE are markers that show the life cycle of a document.
- snapshot N ⁇ 1 is associated with UPDATE and snapshot N is associated with DELETE
- the merged result of N into N ⁇ 1 is associated with DELETE.
- the DELETE version is kept for reference, as described above.
- snapshot N ⁇ 1 is associated with DELETE and snapshot N is associated with ADD/UPDATE
- the merged result of N into N ⁇ 1 is associated with ADD/UPDATE.
- snapshot N ⁇ 1 is associated with ADD and snapshot N is associated with DELETE, the two operations cancel each other out and the merged result is associated with no action.

- the number of FileMetadatas directly corresponds to the number of changes in the changelist provided by the Connector. Files that has been added, updated or deleted are recorded in the change set. The four types of status from the changelist can be converted to corresponding integer for indexing. Files that are seen for the first time by the Connector can be indexed with status 1—ADDED. Either the content of the file or its metadata has been changed then it indexed with status 3—CONTENT MODIFIED or 4 METADATA MODIFIED. When the file is deleted, it can be indexed as status DELETE. DELETE is a special marker and it signifies that the life cycle of that file has ended.

Abstract
Description
-
- Created indicates that the file did not exist in the prior backup but exists in the current backup.
- Contents changed indicates that the contents of the file have changed since the prior backup.
- Metadata changed indicates that the file metadata has changed (Access Control List such as owner, groups, permissions, etc.) but not the contents of the file. If both the contents and the metadata have changed, contents changed is reported.
- Deleted indicates that the file existed in the prior backup but does not exist in the current backup. In this case, the file metadata reported in the changelist is empty.
