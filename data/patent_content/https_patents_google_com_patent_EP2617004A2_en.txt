Definitions
- ADVERTISING the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the present disclosure relates to content presentation, including advertising.
- Advertisers provide advertisements in different forms in order to attract consumers.
- An advertisement is a piece of information designed to be used in whole or in part by a user, for example, a particular consumer.
- Ads can be provided in electronic form. For example, online ads can be provided as banner ads on a web page, as ads presented with search results, or as ads presented in a mobile application.
- An advertising system can include an ad in a web page, for example, in response to one or more keywords in a user search query input to a search engine. If a user selects the presented ad (e.g., by "clicking" the advertisement), the user is generally taken to another location associated with the ad, for example, to another, particular web page.
- a particular user action associated with an ad can be referred to as a conversion.
- a conversion can be online or offline.
- An example of an offline conversion is when a user views an ad online for a particular product and then purchases the item at an offline retail store.
- Advertising can be location-based. For example, an advertiser can specify that a certain online ad should only displayed to users in a certain geographical region. An advertising system can identify users who are likely within the specified geographical region and serve the ad to those users.
- this specification relates to content presentation.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a target region and an exclusion region of the target region, where the target region encompasses the exclusion Attorney Docket No. 161 13-2054WO1 region; identifying a target user within the target region and not within the exclusion region encompassed by the target region; selecting a target advertisement for the target user based on the target user being within the target region and not within the exclusion region encompassed by the target region; sending the target advertisement to the target user; identifying an exclusion user within the exclusion region encompassed by the target region; selecting an exclusion advertisement different from the target advertisement for the exclusion user based on the exclusion user being with the exclusion region; and sending the exclusion advertisement to the exclusion user.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Identifying the exclusion region includes receiving an identifier of a physical store from an advertiser and determining the location of the physical store. Identifying the target region and the exclusion region encompassed by the target region includes receiving target region information and exclusion region information from an advertiser.
- Target region information or exclusion region information includes one or more of: a geographic name, a zip code, a telephone area code, or a shape corresponding to a region on a map.
- the actions further include comparing the target region information with the exclusion region information; and determining whether the target region specified by the target region information encompasses the exclusion region specified by the exclusion region information.
- the actions further include determining whether a predicted rate of advertisements sent to users in the target region exceeds or is less than a threshold rate.
- Identifying the target user or the exclusion user includes receiving one or more of: global positioning system (GPS) coordinates from a mobile device, location coordinates from a router for a wireless local area network (LAN), an internet protocol (IP) address, or one or more search queries.
- the actions further include identifying an additional exclusion region encompassed by the target region; identifying an additional exclusion user within the additional exclusion region encompassed by the target region; and sending an additional exclusion advertisement to the additional exclusion user.
- Identifying the additional exclusion region includes receiving additional exclusion region information from an advertiser, and where the additional exclusion region information includes one or more of: a demographic specification or an online behavior specification.
- the actions further include providing a suggestion to an advertiser to change the size of the exclusion region of the target region or to introduce additional exclusion regions.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a request to serve a content item to a user; determining one or more candidate content items; identifying a location associated with the user; determining whether any of the candidate content items are associated with a target region including the location of the user; determining whether any of the candidate content items are associated with an exclusion region including the location of the user, where the target region encompasses the exclusion region; boosting a score of each candidate content item determined to be associated with the target region and not associated with the exclusion region encompassed by the target region; restricting candidate content items determined to be associated with the exclusion region; selecting a content item of the one or more candidate content items to serve to the user using the scores for the candidate content items; and serving the selected content item to the user.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Restricting candidate content items includes removing them as candidates.
- Restricting candidate content items includes decreasing a score of each candidate content item associated with the exclusion region.
- Restricting candidate content items includes substituting an alternative candidate content item for one of the one or more candidate content items.
- the actions further include determining whether any of the candidate content items are associated with one or more additional exclusion regions including the location of the user, where the target region encompasses each additional exclusion region; and restricting candidate content items determined to be associated with one of the one or more additional exclusion regions.
- Advertisers can target users in a target geographical region while explicitly excluding user's locations within one or more specified portions of the region.
- the target region and the specified parts of the target region can be specified conveniently, for example, by geographical name or zip code.
- An advertising system can suggest whether to expand the specified parts of the region, for example, to increase an ad effectiveness (e.g., a click-through rate).
- An advertiser can focus on regions where a competitor has an advantage (e.g., a higher concentration of local stores) to compete for the competitor's customers.
- An advertiser can avoid paying for advertisements to Attorney Docket No. 161 13-2054WO1 customers who have already converted or are likely to convert (e.g., customers who are already in the store).
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example content presentation system.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example advertising system for regional location-based advertising.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for regional location-based advertising.
- FIG. 4A is a flow diagram of an example process for selecting an advertisement based on a user's location.
- FIG. 4B is a flow diagram of an example process for selecting an advertisement based on a user's location.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process for generating suggestions to change target and exclusion regions.
- Advertisers seek to have content items (e.g., advertisements) presented to users likely to be interested in the content items. For example, content items can be targeted to users based on the user's location. In some cases, advertisers seek to target content items to some users in a geographical region, and exclude content items to other users within the geographical region. For instance, an advertiser can seek to target a content item to users in a geographical region (e.g., a mall) but withhold that content item from users in sub-region of the geographical region (e.g., a store within the mall). Content items associated with a region or sub-region can be boosted by a system when determining content items to serve to users. Attorney Docket No. 161 13-2054WO1
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example content presentation system 100.
- one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in an advertising management system 104.
- advertising other forms of content, including other forms of sponsored content, can be delivered by the system 104.
- the ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, and so on.
- the ads can also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 can submit requests for ads to the system 104.
- the advertising management system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on, or association with, one or more of the publisher's content items (e.g., web properties).
- Example web properties can include web pages, television and radio advertising slots, or print media space.
- Other entities can provide usage information to the system 104, for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction) or a click-through related to an ad (e.g., a user has selected an ad) has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- the advertising management system 104 performs financial transactions, for example, crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a network 112 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102, the system 104, the publishers 106, and the users 108 and 1 10.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof
- One example publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, and so on), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for ads to an advertisement server in the advertising management system 104.
- the ad request can include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request can also include content request information.
- the content request information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, Attorney Docket No.
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, and so on
- part or all of the content request e.g., content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, and so on), geo-location information, and so on.
- the content server (or a client browser or the like) can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the advertising management system 104.
- the combined content and ads can be served (e.g.,
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in hypertext markup language (HTML) or JavaScriptTM).
- HTML hypertext markup language
- JavaScriptTM JavaScript
- search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number (e.g., ten) of search results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the advertising management system 104.
- the request can include a number of ads desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, and so on. In some implementations, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for ads can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- the information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers of "docIDs"), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval ("IR") scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, and so on.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, and so on.
- the advertising management system 104 includes an auction process to select ads from the advertisers 102.
- the advertisers 102 can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click) of an ad, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an ad.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of an ad based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, ads can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to the users 108 and 110 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid ads and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more publishers 106 can submit requests for ads to the advertising management system 104.
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property.
- the advertising management system can provide sports -related ads to the publisher 106.
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the users 108 and 110, e.g., by the execution of a javascript when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application.
- the ads can be received from the system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- advertisers specify that certain target ads should be preferentially shown in a target geographical region 1 14.
- the advertising management system 104 can accommodate these geographical specifications in various ways. For example, the advertising management system 104 can boost a score for the specified ads when it determines that it is selecting an ad for a user 108 in the target region 1 14.
- the advertising management system 104 charges a fee or increases a fee for the advertisers 102 who specify geographical regions. For example, the advertising management system 104 can charge a flat fee (e.g., monthly), or the advertising management system 104 can charge a fee each time a particular ad is boosted based on a user's location.
- advertisers specify that their targeted ads should not be shown (or not preferred over other ads) in certain exclusion regions 1 16 encompassed by the target region 114.
- the advertising management system 104 can accommodate these specifications in various ways. For example, if the advertising management system 104 determines that it is selecting an ad for a user within the exclusion region 116 of a target region 1 14, the advertising management system 104 can decrease a score for specified ads, or eliminate the specified ads as candidate ads for the user. In some implementations, the advertising management system 104 charges additional fees for specifying exclusion regions.
- the advertising management system 104 can charge a revenue premium for allowing location based targeting or regional ad targeting or both. For example, where locally targeted ads can be more appealing to users and hence lead to more clicks, the advertising management system 104 can charge an extra fee for location based advertising. In some implementations, the advertising management system 104 charges a revenue premium because an advertising performance metric (e.g., click-through rate) is greater in the combined target region and exclusion region than it would be using a single region.
- an advertising performance metric e.g., click-through rate
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example advertising system 202 for regional location-based advertising.
- the ad system 202 includes an ad repository 204, location information 206 for target regions 208 and exclusion regions 210, ad-region mapping 212, and ad logs 214. Users 216 and 218 can interact with the ad system 202 to receive ads 226 and to provide location information 224 to the advertising system 202.
- the ad system 202 can select one or more ads from the ad repository 204 and send the selected ads to users 216 and 218. Typically, the ad system 202 selects different ads to send to users 216 and 218 depending on where the users 216 and 218 are located.
- the ad system 202 identifies at least one target region 220 and an exclusion region 222 of the target region 220, where the target region 220 encompasses the exclusion Attorney Docket No. 161 13-2054WO1 region 222.
- identifying the target region 220 and the exclusion region 222 includes receiving location information 206, for example, from an advertiser.
- the target region information 208 and the exclusion region information 210 can be specified using various techniques.
- the target region information 208 or the exclusion region information 210 can include one or more of: a geographic name (e.g., "New York City"), a zip code, a telephone area code, a shape corresponding to a region on a map (e.g., a circle or a square drawn by a person over an electronic map), and so on.
- a target region and/or an exclusion region can be a semantic location or a region surrounding a semantic location.
- a semantic location can be, for example, a shopping mall, a park, a landmark, or some other area of interest.
- location information includes an identifier for a physical store.
- An advertiser specifies the identifier and the ad system 202 determines the location of the physical store using the identifier.
- Some example identifiers include, "store 51,” “the Menlo Park store,” “Noe Valley branch,” and "ABC corp. home store.”
- the ad system 202 determines the location of the physical store and defines a region (typically, an exclusion region) for the store. This is useful, for example, when an advertiser is targeting users in San Francisco with a target ad, but does not want those users to receive the target ad when they are in a store associated with the advertiser.
- the advertiser only has to provide a store identifier to define the exclusion region.
- Ad-region mapping 212 associates ads with regions. For example, an ad from the ad repository 204 for agricultural equipment can be associated with a target region of the state of Illinois. Ad-region mapping 212 also associates ads with exclusion regions of target regions. For example, an ad for agricultural equipment (associated with a target region of the state of Illinois) can also be associated with an exclusion region of the city of Chicago.
- the ad logs 214 identify ads presented to users and users' locations.
- the ad logs can include the ad, a timestamp for the ad delivery, one or more identifiers for the user (e.g., one or more devicelDs, user IDs, or the like), and so on.
- the ad system 202 identifies locations associated with users 216 and 218.
- the ad system 202 receives explicit location information 224, for example, global positioning system (GPS) coordinates from users (e.g., a user's mobile device), information from an indoor communication system (e.g., WiFi), information from an indoor positioning system (e.g., based on ultrasound or Bluetooth), or the like.
- GPS global positioning system
- the ad system 202 determines a location associated with Attorney Docket No.
- IP internet protocol
- LAN wireless local area network
- search queries e.g., as from a search service, not shown
- the ad system 202 determines whether the users are in a target region 220 (e.g., user 216) or an exclusion region encompassed by the target region 222 (e.g., user 218).
- the ad system 202 can use various techniques to determine that a user is in a certain region given that the user's location is only known approximately. For example, in some implementations, the system identifies the inaccuracy of the user location source and determines whether the user's actual location is likely within a region. In another example, where the accuracy of the user's location is unknown, the ad system 202 can use various heuristics to choose or estimate the accuracy of the source.
- the ad system 202 sends target ads (e.g., ad 226) to users (e.g., user 216) in the target region 220, or boosts scores for target ads to increase the number of target ads sent to users in the target region 220.
- the ad system 202 withholds target ads from users in the exclusion region 222, or decreases scores for target ads to decrease the number of target ads sent to users in the exclusion region 222.
- the ad system 202 sends alternative ads (e.g., ad 228) (or boosts scores for alternative ads) to users in the exclusion region 222.
- alternative ads e.g., ad 228, or boosts scores for alternative ads
- a single advertiser provides both a target ad (for display or boosting in the target region, except for in exclusion regions of the target region) and an alternative ad to be shown (or boosted) instead of the target ad to users in an exclusion region encompassed by the target region.
- a store owner can provide a target ad intended to drive customers into his store, and provide an alternative ad intended to encourage customers to make purchases once they are inside the store.
- the store owner can associate the target ad with a target region of a mall, and he can associate the alternative ad with an exclusion region of his store.
- an advertiser can provide only a target ad and associate it with an exclusion region, allowing ad system 202 to select an alternative ad from another advertiser for the exclusion region.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for regional location-based advertising.
- the process 300 is performed by a system (e.g., advertising management system 104 or ad system 202).
- a system e.g., advertising management system 104 or ad system 202).
- Target region information is received (step 302).
- the target region information is received from one or more advertisers (e.g., advertisers 102).
- the target region information is received from one or more publishers (e.g., publishers 106) or other entities.
- Exclusion region information is received (step 304).
- the exclusion region information is received from one or more advertisers (e.g., advertisers 102).
- the exclusion region information is received from one or more publishers (e.g., publishers 106) or other entities.
- target region information is associated with a particular advertiser or publisher who submitted the target region.
- exclusion region information is typically associated with the particular advertiser or publisher who submitted the exclusion region.
- the target region and the exclusion region define a pairing of regions associated with that advertiser or publisher.
- target region information and exclusion region information can be specified in various ways.
- target region information or exclusion region information can include one or more of: a geographic name, a zip code, a telephone area code, or a shape corresponding to a region on a map.
- additional steps are taken to identify the target region and the exclusion region using the target region information and the exclusion region information.
- a geographic name can be used to identify a set of latitude and longitude coordinates bounding a region.
- the target region information is compared with the exclusion region information and a determination is made as to whether the target region specified by the target region information encompasses the exclusion region specified by the exclusion region information. If the target region does not encompass the exclusion region, the target region information or exclusion region information can be rejected, or an alert can be sent (e.g., to an advertiser that provided the information), or other actions can be taken.
- information for one or more additional exclusion regions of the target region is received, where the target region encompasses the additional exclusion regions.
- the information defining the additional exclusion regions can be based whether users fall into a certain demographic, whether they have exhibited a particular online behavior, and so on. The information can be further based on geographical location.
- Ads and ad/region mapping information is received (step 306).
- Target ads and information associating those target ads with target regions are received.
- information associating target ads with exclusion regions is received.
- alternative ads and information associating those alternative ads with exclusion regions are received. For example, an advertiser can provide a target ad for users in a target region and not an exclusion region, and the same advertiser can provide an alternative ad to be shown instead of the target ad to users in the exclusion region.
- recommendation can be sent (e.g., to an advertiser 102) to reduce the size of the exclusion region (in an effort to increase the rate). If the predicted rate is above a threshold rate, a recommendation can be sent to increase the size of the exclusion region.
- a user interface is presented (e.g., to an advertiser 102) showing a recommendation for changing the size of a region (a target region or an exclusion region).
- the advertiser or publisher specifying the region can consider whether or not to accept the recommendation using the user interface. For example, the advertiser or publisher can weigh its original goal of having an exclusion region against the predicted rate of advertisements using the recommended region.
- Specified threshold rates or received threshold rates can be used with the location information (e.g., from an advertiser 102). In some implementations, a determination is made as to whether a predicted rate of advertisements sent to users in the exclusion region exceeds or is less than a threshold rate.
- the a determination is made as to whether the precision of location signals in a region will be sufficient to distinguish whether users are in the target region or are in an exclusion region of the target region. For example, if the target region is a mall and certain stores are exclusion regions, department stores can be large enough to distinguish users while boutique stores can be clustered too closely to reliably determine which store a user is in.
- a request for an ad for a user is received (step 308).
- a request from a publisher e.g., publisher 106
- a request from a publisher can be received.
- a location associated with the user is identified (step 310).
- explicit location information is received, for example, global positioning system (GPS) coordinates from the user (e.g., the user's mobile device), information from an indoor communication system (e.g., WiFi), information from an indoor positioning system (e.g., based on ultrasound or Bluetooth), or the like.
- GPS global positioning system
- a location associated with the user is determined based on other available information, for example, using an internet protocol (IP) address, location coordinates from a router for a wireless local area network (LAN), one or more search queries (e.g., from a search service), or the like.
- IP internet protocol
- Candidate ads are identified (step 312).
- the ads can be, for example, from an ad repository 204.
- An ad is selected from the candidate ads to serve to the user, based on the user's location (step 314). Selecting the ad is described in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 4A and 4B.
- the selected ad is served to the user (step 316).
- the selected ads are provided directly to the user's device (e.g., for incorporation into content presented on the device).
- a user's mobile browser can integrate the ads into presented web content, search results, etc.
- mobile applications can incorporate received ads into the displayed application content.
- the ads are sent to a publisher (e.g., publisher 106 or a search system) for incorporation into content prior to sending the content to the user.
- FIG. 4A is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for selecting an
- the process 400 is performed by a system (e.g., advertising management system 104 or ad system 202).
- a request is received to serve an ad to a user, for example, from a publisher (e.g., publisher 106), a search system, directly from the user, etc. (step 402).
- a location associated with the user is identified.
- a determination is made as to whether the user is in a target region or an exclusion region of a target region (step 404).
- a target ad associated with that region is served to the user (step 406). If the user is within an exclusion region of a target region, a determination is made as to whether an alternative ad is associated with the exclusion region (step 408). If an alternative ad is associated, the user is served the alternative ad (step 410). If no alternative ad is associated, the target ad is withheld (step 412). In some implementations, another ad is served.

- the process 420 is performed by a system (e.g., advertising management system 104 or ad system 202).
- a request to serve an ad to a user is received, for example, from a publisher (e.g., publisher 106), a search system, directly from the user, etc. (step 422).
- a publisher e.g., publisher 106
- a search system directly from the user, etc.
- One or more candidate ads are determined (step 424).
- Candidate ads can be determined using various techniques. For example, the candidate ads can be selected from an ad repository 204 based on a context provided from a publisher (for instance, the context can be sports, music, finance, or the like). In another example, candidate ads can be selected based on the user's browsing history, or keywords of a search query entered by the user.
- a location associated with the user is identified, and whether the user is in a target region or an exclusion region of the target region is determined (step 426). If the user is in the target region and not an exclusion region of the target region, steps 428 - 434 are performed. If the user is in the exclusion region of the target region, steps 442 - 448 are performed.
- a score of the target ad is optionally boosted (step 434).
- each candidate ad has an associated score that will be used during ad selection. For example, each score could be based on how closely each candidate ad matches a requested context, or how much an advertiser has paid for each ad, or the like.
- the target ad is only boosted if an advertiser has paid an extra fee. The amount of boosting can be based on, for example, the amount of the extra fee.
- Whether an alternative ad is associated with the exclusion region is determined (step 440). If an alternative ad is associated, whether it is already included as a candidate ad is determined (step 442). If the alternative ad is not a candidate ad, whether to add the alternative ad is optionally determined (step 444). For example, a determination can be made as to whether the context of the alternative ad matches a context provided with the ad request. In some other implementations, the alternative ad is not added if it is not already included with the candidate ads. If it is determined to add the alternative ad to the candidate ads, the alternative ad is added (step 446). A score of the alternative ad can be optionally boosted (step 448).
- An ad is selected from the candidate ads (step 450). In some implementations, the candidate ad having the highest score is selected. The ad is served to the user (step 452).
- FIG. 4A and 4B show ad selection based on whether a user is in a target region or an exclusion region of a target region.
- Ad selection can also be based on other factors, for example, the user's device type, or a type of application running on the user's device.
- ads are targeted to users using certain devices within a target region or exclusion region.
- a target region or exclusion region For example, consider an advertiser of a type of mobile devices, where the mobile devices are sold in stores. Ads for the mobile devices can be targeted to users, who are not already using that type of mobile device, within a target region including the stores. Ads for upgrades of the mobile devices can be targeted to users, who are using that type of mobile device, and are within the target region. Ads for that type of mobile device can be withheld from users who are actually inside the stores (in exclusion regions).
- ads are targeted to users based on whether the users are using a certain type of application on a mobile device. For example, consider an advertiser for video games (e.g., a video game company). Ads for games can be targeted to users in target regions who are using a video game application (e.g., where the video game application requests the ad), and withheld from users in exclusion regions or who are not using a video game application.
- a video game application e.g., where the video game application requests the ad
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for generating suggestions to change target and exclusion regions.
- the process 500 is performed by a system (e.g., advertising management system 104 or ad system 202).
- Ads are served to users (step 502).
- a target ad is served (exclusively or with greater frequency) to users in a target region and not in any exclusion regions of the Attorney Docket No. 161 13-2054WO1 target region, and an alternative ad is served (exclusively or with greater frequency) to users in an exclusion region of the target region.
- no alternative ad is associated with the exclusion region.
- Ads served and users' locations when those ads are served are logged (step 504).
- users' locations are logged anonymously.
- information is stored to identify each user.
- the ads presented to the users can be logged in an ads log (e.g., ads log 214).
- Information logged in the ad logs can include, for example, for each logged
- an advertisement identifier e.g., advertisement title, advertisement number
- a creative or advertising group identifier e.g., creative or advertising group identifier
- an advertisement campaign identifier e.g., a device identifier of a mobile device to which the advertisement was presented, a timestamp indicating when the advertisement was presented on the mobile device, an indicator of whether the user was within a target region or an exclusion region of a target region, and so on.
- a device identifier can be, for example, a unique alphanumeric identifier associated with the mobile device (or an identifier derived from the device identifier to protect user privacy), or can be a username (or other user identifier) of the user of the mobile device.
- a device identifier stored in the ads log can be obfuscated for privacy reasons.
- a stored identifier can be a random identifier derived from an actual device identifier, or a stored identifier can be an encrypted version of a device identifier.
- an advertising metric e.g., click through rate, offline conversion rate, or the like
- advertisers and publishers can specify assumptions (e.g., regarding advertising performance metrics) when they define target and exclusion regions. In those implementations, those assumptions are compared against measured data periodically (e.g., after a certain period of time, or after a certain number of ads are served). The comparison is presented to the advertisers and publishers (e.g., with a user interface in a web page) so they can remember and re-evaluation those assumptions.
- a suggestion is provided to an advertiser (or other entity, e.g., whatever entity provided the previous size of the exclusion region) (step 508).
- location information can be sent for an enlarged exclusion region used to make a prediction for an advertising metric.
- a determination can be made as to whether the size or shape of the target region should be changed.
- a suggestion can be provided to an advertiser to change the target region.
