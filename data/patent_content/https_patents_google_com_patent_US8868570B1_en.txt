Definitions
- This disclosure relates to selection and display of online content items.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content items (e.g., advertisements) to be provided for presentation to a user with the resources.
- content items e.g., advertisements
- the pairing of content items with requested resources can generate value by increasing the likelihood that users will interact with content items.
- a web page can include content slots in which advertisements or other content items (e.g., search result snippets) can be presented. These content slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, in a pop-up window.
- one aspect of the subject matter described herein can be embodied in a method that includes receiving a first query associated with a user request and determining a score for a word in the first query based at least in part on user interaction with a content item served for display in response to a past query that includes the word.
- the method may further include selecting a keyword derived from the first query based at least in part on the score.
- the method may further include identifying candidate content items using the selected keyword.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding system, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the keyword may be derived from the first query in part by dropping the word from the first query.
- One of the candidate content items that matches the keyword may be selected.
- Information reflecting the one of the candidate content items may be transmitted to a user device.
- One of the candidate content items may be an advertisement.
- One of the candidate content items may be a search result snippet.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a first count of clicks on content items that were associated with keywords derived from the past query that include the word and determining a second count of clicks on content items that were associated with keywords derived from the past query by dropping the word.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a ratio of the first count to the second count.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a first click through rate for a first keyword derived from the past query that included the word and determining a second click through rate for a second keyword derived from the past query by dropping the word.
- the second click through rate may be determined in part by dividing the a first count of clicks on content items that were associated with the second keyword by a second count of the number of content items that were associated with the second keyword and transmitted to a user device.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a first average click through rate for keywords derived from the past query that included the word and determining a second average click through rate for keywords derived from the past query by dropping the word.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a ratio of the first average click through rate to the second average click through rate.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a first count of clicks on content items that were associated with single word keywords derived from the past query that include the word and determining a second count of clicks on content items that were associated with single word keywords derived from the past query by dropping the word.
- the score may be determined in part by determining a ratio of the first count to the second count.
- a metric for measuring the significance of individual words in search queries may be provided.
- the metric can facilitate efficient and effective search by focusing the search on the most significant words in a query (e.g., words associated with content items that most likely to be of interest to a user submitting the query). Searching for content using keywords derived from a query using this information about the significance of words in the query may result in more focused and relevant lists of matching content items. Providing more relevant search results may increase the chances of clicks and conversions and increase value of a search service to users, content publishers, advertisers, and content aggregators.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment.
- FIG. 2 is an example of a web browser displaying example online content, including advertisements.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for providing a content item in response to a request.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process for determining scores for words based on past user interaction data.
- FIG. 5 is block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to facilitate the display of advertisements.
- a word-score for a word occurring in a query may be used to derive and/or select relevant keywords for the query.
- the keywords may be used to identify content items (e.g., advertisements) relevant to the query.
- One or more of the content items may be paired with online resources provided to a user in response to a user request associated with the query.
- a “word” associated with a word-score may take a variety of forms.
- the words tracked are each an arbitrary character string delimited by spaces, punctuation, or other designated delimiting characters or symbols.
- word-scores may be determined for words occurring in dictionary and may also be determined for misspellings of words that commonly occur in queries.
- the words tracked may include compound words or phrases (e.g. New York), i.e. commonly occurring sequences of simple words, and include internal spaces or other delimiting characters or symbols.
- the words tracked may include symbols (e.g. Chinese characters or common sequences of Chinese characters) that are not delimited by designated delimiting characters or symbols.
- word-scores are maintained for related groups of words including canonicalized forms of words, i.e. word stems, instead of word forms (e.g. a word-score for “child” may determined and used for occurrences of both “child” and “children”).
- the word-score is a metric associated with the word that is indicative of the word's typical significance to the meaning of queries.
- the word-score may be determined based on data reflecting past user interactions with content items associated with keywords derived from queries including the word.
- the associated keywords may have kept the word or they may have dropped the word.
- keywords derived from the query “cheap car rentals” by keeping the word cheap may include the keyword “cheap”, the keyword “cheap rentals”, the keyword “cheap car”, the keyword “cheap car rentals”, or other permutations of the words of the query including “cheap” or rewrites of those words.
- keywords derived from the query “cheap car rentals” by dropping the word cheap may include the keyword “car”, the keyword “rentals”, the keyword “car rentals”, or other permutations of the words of the query other than “cheap” or rewrites of those words.
- a high rate of past user interactions with content items associated with keywords that kept the word may indicate that the word is significant to the meanings of queries.
- a high rate of past user interactions with content items associated with keywords that dropped the word may indicate that the word is not significant to the meanings of queries.
- the word-score may be based on statistics of past user interactions that indicate the rate at which users have interacted with keywords that kept the word and the rate at which users have interacted with keywords that dropped the word.
- the word-score may account for user behavior, word misspellings and situations in which a word is actually more relevant than its frequency suggests (e.g., based on commercial value).
- An online content delivery service may provide content items (e.g., advertisements or search result snippets) for presentation to a user in response to a request for content associated with a query.
- a query may be a text string and may include one or more words.
- a query may be supplied by a user, for example in the form of text based search query submitted through a webpage.
- a query may be associated with an online resource (e.g., a webpage, audio, video, etc.) that is selected by a user.
- a streaming video resource may have associated meta-data, including a text string that includes information related to the content of the video. This associated text string may be treated as query for the purpose of identifying content items (e.g., advertisements) most relevant to the requested video resource that may be paired with the resource for presentation to a user.
- the value of a particular resource request to an online resource provider may correspond to the value to the resource provider of the presentation of one or more content items to a user in response to the resource request.
- a request for an online resource may correspond to opportunities for providing one or more content items (e.g., sponsored content items, such as advertisements) to a user that initiated the request.
- An opportunity to pair a content item with other content in the requested resource and provide the content item to a user for presentation in response to the request may be referred to as a content slot or an impression.
- each resource request represents one or more impressions that may each be allocated to a content item (e.g., an advertisement) that is selected to be provided in response to the resource request.
- the value of allocating an impression to a particular content item may depend on how a user is likely to react to presentation of the content item in the context of the impression.
- the value of an allocation may be estimated based on information about the impression and the content item.
- relevant information about an impression may include information about other content in the requested resource (e.g., keywords), the time of the request, and data about the user who made the request (e.g., cookies or geographic location).
- a content or advertisement allocation system may seek to allocate impressions to content items in a manner that maximizes the estimated value of the allocations.
- a content delivery service may attempt to identify content items that are most relevant to content or online resources requested by a user.
- content items eligible or well suited to be paired with a request for content may be identified by searching a collection of content items using one or more keywords derived from a query associated with the request for content.
- Content items that are eligible to be provided to a user device and match a keyword are candidate content items.
- These candidate content items may be further evaluated using quality scores (e.g., a predicted click through rate) as metric for relevance to the request for content that may be used to rank the candidate content items.
- Ranked candidate content items may be selected for provision to a user device for presentation to the user along with other content, such as an online resource requested by the user.
- a higher score indicates a higher likelihood that the candidate content item will be interacted with if displayed on a web page (e.g., a web page displaying search results).
- the quality score may be based on other factors, such as the relevance and quality of a web page liked to by the candidate content item.
- keywords are used to identify matching or candidate content items the manner in which the keywords are derived from the query can significantly impact the performance of a content delivery service.
- a keyword can be a sequence of one or more words associated with a content item that characterizes queries that the content item should be paired with.
- Content items may be associated with one or more keywords.
- the system may analyze the query to derive one or more keywords.
- a collection of content items may then be searched for content items associated with a keyword that matches one of the one or more derived keywords. The matching content items become candidate content items.
- Keywords may be derived from a query in a variety of ways.
- deriving a keyword from a query may involve dropping one or more of the words in the query or rewriting some words in the query.
- the keyword ‘rent car’ could be derived by dropping the word ‘cheap’, rewriting ‘rental’ to ‘rent’, and reordering the words.
- ‘cheap’ can be dropped from the query without radically altering its meaning
- dropping ‘rentals’ or ‘car’ alters the meaning of the query significantly.
- ‘cheap’ is less relevant to the meaning of the query than are ‘car’ or ‘rental’.
- There may be many possible keywords that could be derived from even a simple query. Deriving and selecting the most relevant keywords may significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of a keyword based content delivery system by leading to more focused and relevant lists of candidate content items.
- the derivation and selection of keywords from a query may be facilitated using a metric or score that is indicative of the typical significance of individual words to the meaning of a query.
- a score for certain words or groups of related words e.g., ‘rent’ and ‘rental’
- the score may be a metric that generally reflects the significance of the word to the meaning of a query.
- the score for a word may be derived from data regarding past user interactions with content items associated with keywords including or omitting the word.
- Selection of a content item for presentation in response to a resource request is interchangeably referred to as allocation of an impression to the selected content item (e.g., an advertisement).
- a conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, registering on a website, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- a click through rate for a content item may be defined as the number of user clicks on the content item divided by the number of impressions (i.e. showings to users) that the content item has been allocated.
- An aggregate click through rate for multiple content items may be the sum of all clicks on qualified content items divided by the total numbers of impressions allocated to all qualified content items.
- a click through rate for a keyword may be defined as the number of clicks on content items that were associated with the keyword divided by the number of impressions allocated to content items that were associated with the keyword.
- a click through rate for a keyword may be defined as an aggregate click through rate for content items associated with the keyword.
- a click through rate for keyword may also be defined as an average of click through rates for content items associated with the keyword.
- a predicted click through rate for a content item may be an estimate of the future click through rates for a content item and may be based in part on data reflecting past user interactions with the content item or similar content items in similar impressions.
- a predicted click through rate may be generated using a machine learning system to process data reflecting past user interactions, among other information, and estimate or predict future click through rates.
- a content item is any data that can be provided over a network to cause a visual and/or auditory presentation on a user device.
- a content item may include the presentable content itself (e.g., a picture, a video, or an audio file).
- a content item may include instructions or other information (e.g., a pointer) that causes presentable content to be loaded or retrieved (e.g., from a remote server).
- the processes described below are illustratively applied to content items that are advertisements provided in response to a request from an online resource, but the processes are also applicable to other content items provided over a network. Additionally, the description that follows describes the advertisements being selected by an allocation subsystem that is implemented as an element of an advertisement server. However, the allocation subsystem can be implemented as an independent system that communicates directly, or over a network, with the advertisement server or another data processing apparatus.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment ( 100 ).
- the online environment ( 100 ) facilitates the serving of content items for display on user devices ( 102 ).
- content items can include web pages ( 104 ) and advertisements ( 106 ) (e.g., advertisements related to the web pages ( 104 )).
- Web pages ( 104 ) and advertisements ( 106 ) can be provided to user devices ( 102 ) through a network ( 107 ).
- Network ( 107 ) can be a wide area network, local area network, the Internet, or any other public or private network, or combination of both.
- User devices ( 102 ) can connect to web server ( 116 ) (or the advertisement server ( 110 )) through the network ( 107 ) using any device capable of communicating in a computer network environment and displaying retrieved information.
- Example user devices ( 102 ) include a web-enabled handheld device, a mobile telephone or smartphone, a tablet device, a set top box, a game console, a personal digital assistant, a navigation device, or a computer.
- web pages ( 104 ) can be provided by a web server ( 116 ) for display on a user device ( 102 ), and advertisements ( 106 ) can be provided by an advertisement server ( 110 ) for display on the user device ( 102 ).
- the advertisements ( 106 ) are provided directly to the web server ( 116 ) by the advertisement server ( 110 ), and the web server ( 116 ) then provides the advertisements ( 106 ) to the user devices ( 102 ) in association with one or more particular web pages ( 104 ), e.g., web pages related to the advertisements ( 106 ).
- the web server ( 116 ) queries the advertisement server ( 110 ) for advertisements ( 106 ) related to one or more particular web pages ( 104 ), and the advertisement server ( 110 ) evaluates a pool ( 109 ) of advertisements and chooses one or more advertisements ( 106 ) that are related to the web pages ( 104 ), e.g., advertisements that pertain to subject matter referenced by or described within the web pages ( 104 ).
- the advertisements ( 106 ) can be displayed with the web page ( 104 ) on a web browser ( 112 ) of a user device ( 102 ).
- the advertisements ( 106 ) can also be requested as part of the delivery of a web page ( 104 ) in response to a user device ( 102 ) requesting the web page ( 104 ) from a web server ( 116 ).
- FIG. 2 is an example of a web browser interface ( 200 ) displaying online content, including advertisements.
- the web browser interface ( 200 ) includes a browsing portion ( 202 ) for displaying requested content (e.g., a web page ( 104 ) or search results presented in response to a user-entered query) and an advertisement portion ( 204 ), e.g., for displaying advertisements ( 106 a - h ) related to the web page or search request.
- requested content e.g., a web page ( 104 ) or search results presented in response to a user-entered query
- advertisement portion 204
- the web page ( 104 ) is a presentation of search results ( 206 ) representing references (e.g., hyperlinks to uniform resource locators) to other web pages selected by a search engine (not shown) to be related to a user query previously entered by a user of the web browser interface ( 200 ).
- the advertisements 106 a - h have been identified (e.g., by an advertisement server ( 110 ) as shown in FIG. 1 ) in response to the particular content displayed within the web page ( 104 ).
- the advertisements ( 106 a - h ) can be associated with keywords that also appear in the search results ( 206 ), or the advertisements ( 106 a - h ) can contain links to another web page (e.g., hyperlinks to a uniform resource locator of the web page). Advertisements that are relevant to the content of a web page may be more likely to be of interest to a user viewing the web page, and more likely to be followed up upon by the user (e.g., leading to the user clicking on the advertisement, submitting a product inquiry, or engaging in a commercial transaction solicited by an advertisement).
- advertisements can appear in multiple locations within web browser interface ( 200 ). For example, in addition to advertisements ( 106 a - h ) displayed along an advertisement portion ( 204 ) on the right-hand side of web browser interface ( 200 ), other advertisements ( 108 a - b ) can be displayed in another advertisement portion ( 208 ) in an upper area of web browser interface ( 200 ). In some examples, advertisements are displayed in a lower area of web browser interface ( 200 ) or on the left-hand side of web browser interface ( 200 ).
- Advertisements ( 106 a - h ) displayed in web browser interface ( 200 ) can be chosen, e.g., by an advertisement server ( 110 ) ( FIG. 1 ), based on a quality score associated with the advertisements. For example, an advertisement server can identify many possible candidates to display in web browser interface ( 200 ) based on the degree to which the advertisement candidates are related to the content displayed in the web browser, e.g., the search results ( 206 ). The advertisement server can then select one or more advertisements from the advertisement candidates for display.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process ( 300 ) for selecting advertisements for display.
- the process utilizes word-scores for words in a query associated with a user request to determine relevant keywords that are in turn used to identify and select relevant advertisements for display in response the user request.
- the process ( 300 ) can be used, for example, by the advertisement server ( 110 ) of FIG. 1 to determine which advertisements ( 106 ) should be displayed with a web page ( 104 ).
- the advertisement server ( 110 ) is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of the process ( 300 ).
- the data processing apparatus may be the apparatus described in FIG. 5 .
- a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computing device (e.g., a computer system) cause the device to perform actions of the process ( 300 ).
- a request for content associated with a query is received ( 302 ).
- the request is a request for an advertisement to be provided with a publisher's resource.
- the request can be a request for an advertisement or other content item to be provided in a particular content slot that is defined in the publisher's webpage or a content slot that is defined to be presented with search results as depicted in FIG. 2 .
- the request is associated with a query.
- the query is a string of text submitted by a user, for example, through a web browser ( 112 ) interface.
- the query is meta-data associated with an online resource (e.g., a web page, video, audio, etc.) requested by a user.
- the query may include one or more words.
- the words are extracted ( 304 ) from query.
- a text parser may be used to extract words from the query. For example, words may be delimited within the query by space characters or other designated delimiting characters.
- Word-scores are metrics based upon user interaction data. In general word-scores may be indicative of the relevance or significance of a word within a query.
- These word-scores may be stored in a database or another storage device.
- the storage device may be connected directly to a processing apparatus implementing process ( 300 ) or may be accessible via communications over a network (e.g., network ( 107 )).
- word-scores may be stored in volatile memory in the processing apparatus performing process ( 300 ). Word-scores may be determined or updated by the same processing apparatus or by another system. For example, word-scores may be updated using the process described below in relation to FIG. 4 . In some implementations, some words may not have a stored word-score associated with them. A default word-score (e.g., 1) may be used for words lacking an associated word-score. Word-scores are typically, but not always, positive real numbers in the range of about 0 to 10.
- a word that is significant to the meaning of queries may have a relatively high value (e.g., around 8 or 9) while a word with that conveys less independent meaning in the query, such as a preposition, may have a relatively low value (e.g., around 0.6).
- the extraction of words and retrieval of word-scores may be performed by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- a list of keywords is generated ( 306 ) by deriving keywords from the query. Keywords may be derived from the query by dropping one or more words from the query. In some implementations, keywords may be derived from a query by reordering words from the query. In some implementations, keywords are derived in part by altering or rewriting a word in the query (e.g., substituting a related word with the same root). For example, consider the query ‘cheap car rentals’. By dropping different words, the following list of keywords may be generated: ⁇ ‘cheap car’, ‘cheap rentals’, ‘car rentals’, ‘cheap’, ‘car’, ‘rentals’ ⁇ .
- More keywords may be derived by reordering the words and/or rewriting the words (e.g., ‘rent car’).
- the list of keywords generated includes all permutations of the words in the query.
- the list includes only a subset of the possible permutations of the words in the query. For example, less keywords may be derived that include a word with a low word-score than are derived including a word with a high word-score.
- the likelihood of dropping a given word during the keyword derivation process may be inversely proportional to the word-score for the word.
- the list of keywords for the query may then be filtered ( 308 ) using a keyword filtering model.
- a keyword filtering model classifies keywords as good or bad matches for a query and discards the bad keywords.
- a keyword filter model may incorporate information from a number of sources and apply that information to make its classifications. For example, a keyword filtering model may base its classification in part upon an inverted document frequency (IDF) for a word in a keyword being classified.
- IDF inverted document frequency
- An IDF may be based on data about a collection of documents or files to which a query is directed. For example, an IDF may be defined as a logarithm of the number of documents to be searched minus the logarithm of the number of documents including the word.
- a keyword filter model may incorporate a metric reflecting the quality of a rewrite of one of the query words kept in a keyword. Such a metric would have a high value for simple rewrites that don't significantly alter the meaning of the word (e.g., car ⁇ cars) and could have a relatively low value for rewrites that substantially affect the scope or meaning of the word (e.g., car ⁇ SUV). For example, one such metric based on past interaction data for multiple users is a ratio of the click through rate for keywords that include the rewrite to the click through rate for keywords that keep the base word.
- a keyword filter model may determine a keyword score for each keyword it classifies. For example, a keyword may be classified by comparing its keyword score to a threshold or to the keyword scores for other keywords being considered by the filter.
- the keyword filtering model takes word-scores as input and bases its classification of keywords in part on the word-score for a word included in a keyword.
- the classification of a keyword may be based in part on a word-score for a word in the query that has been dropped from the keyword.
- a keyword filter may determine a keyword score for a keyword based in part on a word-score for a word in the keyword. The keyword score may be increased by a factor proportional to the word-score for a word in the keyword. In some implementations, a keyword score may be decreased by a factor that is proportional to a word-score for a word in the query that was dropped from the keyword.
- the keyword filter includes a machine learning module (e.g., a neural network or a support vector machine) that takes one or more word-scores as inputs, along with other possible inputs (e.g., an IDF), and outputs a keyword quality signal.
- a machine learning module e.g., a neural network or a support vector machine
- the filtering of keywords may be performed by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- Candidate advertisements may be associated with keywords that match a filtered keyword. For example, advertisers may specify keywords describing online resources or other content they want their advertisements paired with when they purchase impressions from an online publisher. Keywords may be associated with advertisements or other content items in a database maintained or accessible by the advertisement server ( 110 ). The filtered keywords from a query may be used to search a collection of content items for candidates by matching a filtered keyword with a keyword associated with a candidate advertisement. A list of matching advertisements may be generated, where each candidate associated with at least one of the filtered keywords.
- Allocation scores are determined ( 312 ) for each of the candidate advertisements. Allocation scores may be based on a large number of factors including, for example, characteristics of an impression incident to the request for content (e.g., timing of the request, and characteristics of the user who requested the content, such as demographic information and geographic location), characteristics of a candidate advertisement or a webpage linked by the candidate advertisement, a content publisher's contractual obligation to allocate impressions to a candidate advertisement and time remaining to fulfill that obligation, etc. Allocation scores may be determined using a machine learning system. For example, an allocation score may be a predicted click through rate for advertisement when paired with content in the impression. In some implementations, an allocation score may depend in part on a word-score for a word in the keyword that was matched to the candidate advertisement. For example the allocation score for an advertisement may be increased by a factor that is proportional to a word-score for a word included in the keyword that matched the candidate advertisement. The determination of allocation scores may be performed by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- One or more advertisements may be selected ( 314 ) and served to a user device that initiated the request.
- the candidate advertisements may be ranked based on their allocations scores and the advertisements with the highest scores may be selected for provision to the user who initiated the request.
- the selected advertisement can be provided to a user device that requested the online resource with which the advertisement is being provided.
- the advertisement can be provided to the user device, for example, over a content delivery network.
- the advertisement can be provided with presentation instructions that specify a content slot in which the advertisement is to be presented. In turn, the advertisement can be presented on a user device according to the presentation instructions.
- the selection and serving of advertisements may be performed by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- data reflecting a user interaction with the advertisements may be received ( 316 ). For example, data reflecting user clicks on advertisements ( 106 ) displayed in a web browser interface ( 200 ) may be received. In some implementations, data reflecting other types of conversions may be received. For example, information reflecting whether a user consummated a purchase at a website linked by an advertisement may be received. Reception of data reflecting clicks or other conversions may be performed by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- a query record may be logged that includes the query, a keyword associated with each advertisement that was selected and provided to the user, and whether or not the each advertisement was clicked by the user.
- the keyword associated with an advertisement in the log may be a keyword that was matched to a filtered keyword during the identification of candidate advertisements.
- a query record may include information about other types of user interactions.
- a query record may include data reflecting other types of conversions, such as a purchase consummated by the user after viewing or clicking an advertisement.
- the logged query record is stored in a file or a database located on a storage device.
- the storage device may be connected directly to a processing apparatus implementing process ( 300 ) or may be accessible via communications over a network (e.g., network ( 107 )).
- query records may be stored in volatile memory in the processing apparatus performing process ( 300 ).
- a query record may be logged by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process ( 400 ) for determining word-scores for words based on past user interaction data.
- the process ( 400 ) can be implemented, for example, by the advertisement server of FIG. 1 .
- Process ( 400 ) may be performed periodically (e.g., weekly, daily, hourly, etc.) and/or upon the occurrence of an event.
- process ( 400 ) may be performed when the number of unprocessed query entries in a query session log or database exceeds and threshold or when an operator of the advertisement server ( 110 ) initiates an update.
- a system making less frequent updates of the word-scores may be more computationally efficient, so there may be a tradeoff between using the most current and accurate word-scores and reduced complexity associated with a lower frequency of updates.
- Operations of the process ( 400 ) may include opening ( 402 ) query session logs.
- Query session logs may be stored in a file or a database located on a storage device.
- the storage device may be connected directly to a processing apparatus implementing process ( 400 ) or may be accessible via communications over a network (e.g., network ( 107 )).
- Opening the query session log may include establishing a communications session with database running on a remote storage device.
- query records may be stored in volatile memory in the processing apparatus performing process ( 400 ).
- Query session logs may be opened by the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- query records may be read ( 404 ) and processed.
- query records may include the query, a keyword associated with each advertisement that was selected and provided to the user, and whether or not the each advertisement was clicked by the user.
- a query record may include information about other types of user interactions.
- a query record may include data reflecting other types of conversions, such as a purchase consummated by the user after viewing or clicking an advertisement.
- the query may be parsed to extract ( 406 ) one or more words from the query.
- an object or record corresponding to the word is accessed.
- the word object may include a word-score for the word or other state variables that may be used to determine the current word-score for the word.
- These records or objects may be stored on a remote storage device accessible via communications over a network (e.g., network ( 107 )).
- the records or objects associated with words are stored in volatile memory on a device performing process ( 400 ), such as the advertisement server ( 110 ).
- the new word-score may be determined in a variety of ways.
- the new word-score for the word may depend on a keep-count for the word.
- a keep-count is a state variable used to compute the word-score that is indicative of the frequency with which users have interacted with (e.g., clicked on) content items (e.g., advertisements) associated with a keyword that includes the word.
- the keep-count is a count of the number of clicks on advertisements associated with a keyword including the word.
- the keep-count is a count of the number clicks on advertisements associated with keywords that drop all words from a query except the word.
- the keep-count is an aggregate or average click through rate for advertisements associated with keywords that include the word.
- the keep-count is an estimate of the number of clicks expected for advertisements served in response to the query and associated with a keyword that includes the word.
- the keep-count may be an average of the predicted click through rates for the advertisements served in response to the query and associated with a keyword that includes the word.
- This implementation receives its information regarding user behavior indirectly from a machine learning system that generates the predicted click through rates and is dependent on the performance of that system, but has the advantage of being less sensitive to low sample size associated with low levels of user interactivity in the dataset.
- the keep-count may be based in part on data reflecting other types of conversions, such as user consummation of a purchase through website linked by an advertisement.
- the new word-score may depend on a drop-count for the word.

- the drop-count is a count of the number of clicks on advertisements associated with a keyword that dropped the word.
- the drop-count is a count of the number clicks on advertisements associated with keywords that drop all words from a query except a word distinct from the word.
- the drop-count may be updated based on the number of clicks on advertisements associated with the keyword “car” or the keyword “rentals.”
- the drop-count is an aggregate or average click through rate for advertisements associated with keywords that dropped the word from the query.
- the drop-count is an estimate of the number of clicks expected for advertisements served in response to the query and associated with a keyword that dropped the word.
- the drop-count may be an average of the predicted click through rates for the advertisements served in response to the query and associated with a keyword that dropped the word.
- the drop-count may be based in part on data reflecting other types of conversions, such as user consummation of a purchase through website linked by an advertisement.
- the new word-score may be determined by comparing the keep-count and the drop-count for a word.
- the word-score may be calculated by dividing the keep-count by the drop-count.
- a word-score may be calculated as a logarithm of the ratio of a keep-count to a drop-count.
- the drop-count may be biased by a small positive value (e.g., 0.001) to avoid a singularity in the word-score calculation.
- the word-score may be a function of the keep-count alone.
- the word-score may be directly proportional to the word-score.
- the word-score may be a function of the drop-count alone.
- the word-score may be inversely proportional to a biased drop-count.
- the keep-count for the word may be determined ( 408 ).
- the previous keep-count may be stored as part of the object or record associated with a word.
- the new keep-count may be determined based in part on the old keep-count and on data gathered from the current query record. For example, the new keep-count may be determined as a sum of the old keep-count with the keep-count for data in the current query record.
- the keep-count for the current query record may be input to a digital filter that outputs the current keep-count for the word.
- the state of the digital filter may be stored in the object or record associated with the word.
- a higher order digital filter may be used and W ⁇ KC is a vector of state variables.
- Digital filtering may be used to incorporate data reflecting user interactions across multiple sessions and users.
- the keep-count may be determined from scratch each time the word score is determined by collecting data for all users within a sliding analysis window of time and taking the ratio between the sum of all clicks on content items associated with keywords that keep the word and the sum of all impressions for such content items.

After the last word is processed, a check ( 416 ) can be performed to determine if any other query records are available. If so the next query record is processed, until all available records have been processed.

Abstract
Description
W·KC=f(W·KC)+g(count(w)) (1)
where w is the word, count( ) is a function that returns the keep-count for w in the current query record, f( ) and g( ) are mappings or functions, W is the object associated with w, and W·KC is a state variable stored in the object reflecting the keep-count for the word across multiple records or users which is updated in accordance with Equation (1). For example, f( ) and g( ) may be linear scale factors (e.g., f(x)=0.9*x, g(y)=0.1(y)), thus implementing a linear first order recursive filter. In some implementations, a higher order digital filter may be used and W·KC is a vector of state variables. Digital filtering may be used to incorporate data reflecting user interactions across multiple sessions and users. In some implementations (not shown), the keep-count may be determined from scratch each time the word score is determined by collecting data for all users within a sliding analysis window of time and taking the ratio between the sum of all clicks on content items associated with keywords that keep the word and the sum of all impressions for such content items. The keep-count may be determined by the advertisement server (110).
W·DC=u(W·DC)+v(count(w)) (2)
where w is the word, count( ) is a function that returns the drop-count for w in the current query record, u( ) and v( ) are mappings or functions, W is the object associated with w, and W·KC is a state variable stored in the object reflecting the drop-count for the word across multiple records or users which is updated in accordance with Equation (2). For example, u( ) and v( ) may be linear scale factors (e.g., f(x)=0.9*x, g(y)=0.1(y)), thus implementing a linear first order recursive filter. In some implementations, a higher order digital filter may be used and W·KC is a vector of state variables. In some implementations (not shown), the drop-count may be determined from scratch each time the word score is determined by collecting data for all users within a sliding analysis window of time and taking the ratio between the sum of all clicks on content items associated with keywords that drop the word and the sum of all impressions for such content items. The drop-count may be determined by the advertisement server (110).
W·Score=h(W·KC/W·DC) (3)
where h( ) is a mapping or function and W·Score is the word-score for the word or a group of related words associated with the object W. For example, h( ) may be a linear scale factor (e.g., h(x)=1*x). In some implementations, h( ) is a logarithm (e.g., the natural logarithm). The word-score may be determined by the advertisement server (110).
