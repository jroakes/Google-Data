Definitions
- This disclosure relates to content distribution.
- Advertising is presented in one or more of a variety of communication media, such as online, in periodicals, on billboards, or by radio or TV broadcast, to name just a few of many examples.
- online mediums are increasingly being used for distributing ads or other content in novel ways.
- Advertisers can create an advertising campaign that seeks to target ads to a particular demographic. For example, a website devoted to a particular trade or hobby is a popular location for businesses specializing in that trade or hobby to advertise to potential customers in an effort to increase their sales. The increase in advertising has created an incentive for targeting advertisements to consumers.
- Success in distribution of content can be defined in terms of one or more measureable entities or variables.
- ad performance is sometimes quantified in terms of a number of distinct conversions of the ad, wherein a conversion is defined as the occurrence of at least one specific interaction.
- a conversion criterion can require a user click (or other selection) of a displayed ad; or the user click plus some modicum of user activity on the advertiser's landing page; or the user click plus a completed transaction on the landing page.
- a computer-implemented method for defining a segment based on interaction proneness includes receiving online activity data that specifies instances of presentation for one or more content items, and instances of user interaction detected for any of the content items.
- the method includes training at least one predictive model on the online activity data, the predictive model trained to predict interaction proneness based on one or more characteristics associated with the instances of user interaction.
- the method includes identifying, using the predictive model, at least one of the characteristics as being associated with the interaction proneness.
- the method includes generating at least one segment definition that takes into account the identified characteristic.
- a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage medium can include instructions that when executed by one or more processors perform the method.
- a computer system can include one or more processors and a computer-readable storage medium having stored therein instructions that when executed by the one or more processors perform the method.
- the identification involves determining a coefficient for the predictive model that reflects whether and how the instances of user interaction vary with the instances of presentation.
- At least one of the content items is a displayed advertisement
- the instances of user interaction include at least one click on the displayed advertisement
- the interaction proneness reflect a user tendency to click on the displayed advertisement.
- the characteristics are selected among signals comprising: user location; user device information; publisher; local query time; local time of page request; page identity; content item properties; keyword in page request; keyvalue; page visiting history; content item interaction history; and combinations thereof.
- At least one of the characteristics includes a cross product of at least two of the signals.
- Training the predictive model includes dividing the online activity data into first and second portions and using the first portion to train the predictive model, and identifying the characteristic involves applying the trained model to the second portion.
- the method further includes ranking at least some of the characteristics with regard to the interaction proneness, the ranking being taken into account in distributing the content item.
- Implementations can provide any or all of the following advantages.
- a more flexible marketing model for content distribution can be provided.
- Content distribution can be targeted more effectively.

- the interaction proneness can be determined by training one or more prediction models on collected data.
- FIG. 1 schematically shows an example of a system 100 for determining and using interaction proneness.
- one or more user devices 102 are configured for communication with each other and/or others using any kind of network 104 , including, but not limited to, the internet, a mobile device network, or a local area network.
- the user devices 102 can include personal computers, laptops, mobile devices, and/or cell phones, to name just a few examples.
- Each of the user devices 102 can download or otherwise access one or more pages 106 or other form of content (e.g., audio or video) via the network 104 .
- the page 106 is generated by a browser on the user device 102 that executes code according to one or more markup languages (e.g., hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), or versions thereof).
- markup languages e.g., hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), or versions thereof.
- the user device 102 requests the page 106 from one of multiple publisher systems 110 , and the page 106 includes a script (or any other form of executable code) that provides for an advertisement (“ad”) 108 to be sent to the user device and inserted at a particular place in the page 106 .
- the page 106 can be any type of online page including, but not limited to, a web page or other internet page.
- the content accessed using the user device 102 includes one or more particular content items, in this example an ad 108 .
- the ad 108 can be displayed using any suitable graphics technique, such as in form of an image file that when executed by the user device 102 generates one or more images on the screen of the user device.
- the content item can instead have another format, e.g., an audio or video clip.
- the ad 108 is configured for one or more types of user interaction.
- a displayed graphic is configured so that the user can take one or more actions with regard to the ad.
- the user can click on the ad using any suitable kind of pointing device, keypad or touch-sensitive surface.
- the corresponding input received by the user device can trigger one or more responses.
- user navigation can be initiated to present or otherwise play a message from the advertiser (e.g., the browser is redirected to an advertiser's page that is associated with the ad).
- the ad 108 (or other content) can be provided for insertion in the page 106 by the publisher system 110 or by a separate advertisement distributor or other third party.
- Online activities can be tracked, for example as a basis to compensate publishers for publishing the ad(s) and/or to aid advertisers in creating advertisement campaigns.
- the system 100 includes an online data gathering component 112 that registers some or all of the interactions that occur with the ad 108 .
- the component 112 can receive its information from one or more sources. For example: when the user clicks on the ad 108 , this can prompt the user device 102 to notify the component 112 directly, or via the publisher system 110 , that the ad has been clicked. As another example, the advertiser whose ad is clicked can automatically notify the component 112 .
- privacy rights of users are respected. For example, privacy policies regarding how information is collected and/or used can be created and enforced.
- An implementation can be designed as an “opt-in only” regime, such that the implementation will only be used for persons who have explicitly agreed to participate.
- an “opt-out” regime gives users the right and ability to decline participation.
- the identities of users are protected by use of one or more anonymization processes.
- certain information associated with users is anonymized or partially redacted.
- user history and login association, or device history and address association can be anonymized by use of collision-resistant hashes that hash the identification data.
- user identities such as user names or user electronic mail addresses
- user Internet Protocol addresses can be processed to eliminate some information such as, for example, the class C and class D subdomain information
- user browsing history can be disassociated with a particular user identity and replaced with a user interest category
- user interest categories can be generalized to minimize association with specific user identities or user browsing histories, and the like.
- Additional privacy protection techniques can also be used, such as the use of one or more encryption processes.
- the online data gathering component 112 stores information about the user interactions that take place with respect to presented ads (or other content).
- the component 112 stores information in a click-through repository 114 , such as one or more characteristics regarding each individual click action. Such gathered information is sometimes referred to as a signal that relates to the click.
- signals examples include, but are not limited to: user location (e.g., by country, city or other category); user device information (e.g., browser type, operating system type, cookie identifier); publisher (e.g., on whose page the ad appears); local query time (e.g., when the user submits a search engine query that triggers content distribution); local time of page request (e.g., when the user accesses a page that triggers content distribution); page identity (e.g., a URL or other identifier for the page); content item properties (e.g., ad identifier, ad size, advertiser name); keyword in page request (e.g., information about another page from which the user navigates to the page having the ad); keyvalue (e.g., information about the tile, section, channel, or content group associated with the content presentation); page visiting history (e.g., how many times the user has visited the same page in the past); content item interaction history (e.g., how many
- the online data gathering component 112 also has access to information about the content that has been presented (e.g., displayed ads), regardless of whether the content triggered any user interaction.
- an impressions repository 116 is provided that catalogs all instances where the ad 108 (or any other ads) has appeared on a page, including, but not limited to, the page 106 .
- impression data is provided by one or more ad serving organizations who act on advertisers' behalf in providing ads for publication.
- a predictive-model training environment 118 can be provided.
- the predictive-model training environment 118 includes suitable tools for fitting one or more predictive models 120 to the data. Training of different predictive models within the predictive-model training environment 118 can be done using statistical software packages. For example, and without limitation, the statistical computing software package known as R (created by “The R Project for Statistical Computing”), or a statistical package in MATLAB from The MathWorks, Inc., can be used. As another example, models can be trained on very large data sets (e.g., on the order of tens of billions of instances or more).
- the prediction(s) can include any suitable type of estimation or appreciation regarding users' proneness to interact with presented content.
- one or more coefficients of the predictive model 120 can be set, adjusted, or readjusted so that the predictive model makes the best possible prediction based on the available data.
- the predictive model may include a coefficient that reflects whether and how the number of user interactions varies with variations in the number of impressions.
- the predictive model 120 can depend on which content is being presented; where the content is being presented; who the likely recipients of the content are; and/or the timing of the content presentation, to name just a few examples.
- the training of the predictive model 120 can make use of one or more statistical approaches.
- the gathered online activity data is divided in two portions, where one portion is used to train the predictive model, and the other portion is used as input to test the model and/or to obtain predictive results.
- some or all of the data in the click-through repository 114 can be divided (in any arbitrary way) into a 90% portion and a 10% portion, meaning that 9/10 of all detected clicks are in the 90% portion and the remaining 1/10 of the clicks are in the 10% portion.
- the predictive model can then be trained on the 90% portion, for example by setting model coefficients according to the data.
- the trained model can then be applied to the 10% portion, and one or more results can be evaluated.
- the online activity data can be processed multiple times.
- the 90/10 partitioning mentioned above can be performed differently on the same data, meaning that the respective 90% and 10% portions now include at least partly different sets of click records. Because the 90% portion is not exactly the same as it was before, the training may result in somewhat different coefficients for the predictive model. For example, ten different 90/10 partitions can be done and processed substantially as described above, and the obtained sets of model coefficients can be aggregated (e.g., averaged) to obtain a final version of the coefficients.
- the training can be used in analyzing how the occurrence of user interaction is influenced by one or more characteristics.
- one or more characteristics can be identified using the predictive model as being associated with interaction proneness.
- Such knowledge about interaction proneness e.g., user tendency to click
- one or more segments 124 can be defined to take into account the characteristic(s) identified as influencing interaction proneness.
- the segment 124 can be defined to include the URL or other identifier for the page 106 . That is, the advertiser may enter into an ad distribution agreement that the ad(s) should be eligible for publication in one or more contexts defined by the segment 124 (e.g., for display on a particular page).
- the segment 124 can be defined as a subset of another, already existing, segment. For example, assume that a particular ad is currently associated with a segment definition that lists fifty publications (e.g., web pages). A more restrictive segment definition can then be generated that includes only some (e.g., thirty) of the current publications. This can be done by analyzing the interaction proneness for each of the publications, and then defining the subset of publications based on the pages whose rates of interaction proneness meet at least a particular threshold (e.g., the rate is among the top 50% of analyzed rates, or the rate value exceeds a threshold).
- a particular threshold e.g., the rate is among the top 50% of analyzed rates, or the rate value exceeds a threshold.
- FIGS. 2A-B show example graphs 200 and 250 of model coefficients that take time into account.
- a model coefficient is measured against a vertical axis 202 as a function of hour values along a horizontal axis 204 .
- the model coefficient is a sensitivity coefficient for the predictive model. That is, the sensitivity coefficient indicates how one variable (e.g., the click-through rate) varies depending on another variable (e.g., the time of day). Generally, a positive sensitivity coefficient indicates that the click-through rate increases with an increasing number of impressions. In contrast, a negative sensitivity coefficient indicates that increasing the number of impressions tends to lower the click-through rate.
- the sensitivity coefficient indicates how one variable (e.g., the click-through rate) varies depending on another variable (e.g., the time of day).
- a positive sensitivity coefficient indicates that the click-through rate increases with an increasing number of impressions.
- a negative sensitivity coefficient indicates that increasing the number of impressions tends to lower the click-through rate.
- the graph 200 includes a coefficient set 206 for each of the twenty-four hours in the day on which the corresponding online activity data was collected. That is, the coefficient set 206 includes a number of sensitivity coefficients calculated for the same online activity data. In some implementations, each of the coefficients in the set 206 corresponds to a particular instance of training the prediction model. For example, the online activity data is portioned in different ways and the model is trained based on one portion at a time, while registering the coefficient(s) resulting from the training.
- the coefficient set 206 includes a max value 206 A and a min value 206 B indicating the respective extreme values of the sensitivity coefficients for the corresponding hour.
- a box 206 C indicates the variability, or spread, in the set of coefficients.
- the upper and lower edges of the box 206 C may indicate a certain number of standard deviations (e.g., one standard deviation) from the average of the coefficients.
- the coefficient set 206 here also includes a median 206 D of the coefficients.
- the graph 200 indicates that relatively high coefficients are found in the evening and night hours (e.g., from 6 pm until about 3 am). That is, this approximate time interval is characterized in that an increase in the number of impressions has a relatively strong positive impact on the click-through rate. It can therefore be said that for the particular online activity data that underlies the graph 200 , the evening and night users show a relatively high degree of interaction proneness. Stated another way, time of day may be a useful signal for interaction proneness during the evening and night hours.
- the graph 250 is based on a different collection of online data.
- coefficient sets 252 have negative values from about 9 am to midnight, indicating that more impressions during those hours will decrease, not increase, the click-through rate.
- the coefficient sets 252 In the early morning, however (until about 8 am), the coefficient sets 252 have positive values. In other words, more impressions in this time period are likely to generate a higher click-through rate. The time-of-day signal may therefore be useful during those hours.
- FIG. 3A shows an example bar chart 300 of click-through rate as a function of the number of past clicks. That is, the online activity data on which the bar chart 300 is based indicates, for each cookie identifier associated with a click, how many times the same cookie identifier has been associated with other clicks (i.e., past clicks) on the same page in a particular time interval (e.g., the past seven days).
- Each staple 302 includes a bar 302 A with a height that indicates the corresponding click-through rate.
- the staple 302 also includes data 302 B, such as the range of the number of past clicks (e.g., more than 30, but less than 36, past clicks), and the number of impressions (e.g., eight).
- the graph 300 shows that the more times a user clicked on a page in the past, the more likely it is that the user will click on the page again. Whether past clicks is a useful signal may depend also on other factors, such as the relation between the number of users revisiting the page and the total number of visitors.
- FIG. 3B shows an example graph 350 of model coefficients that take number of past clicks into account.
- the graph 350 includes coefficient sets 352 that are analogous to the coefficient sets described above.
- FIGS. 4A-B show example graphs 400 and 450 of model coefficients that take number of page requests into account. That is, the collections of online activity data for the graphs 400 and 450 , respectively, here reflect how many times a user has visited the same page during a particular time interval (e.g., the past seven days).
- the determined model coefficients are indicated by coefficient sets 402 and 452 analogous to the ones above.
- the graph 400 indicates that the number of past visits can be used as an indicator of interaction proneness.
- the number measured against the horizontal axis is the number of queries; e.g., the number of times that the user utilized a particular search engine and obtained a results page that included advertisements.
- the coefficient sets 452 all have negative values, meaning that the number of past visits is not a good indicator of interaction proneness.
- FIGS. 5A-B show example graphs 500 and 550 of model coefficients that take keyvalues and/or keywords into account. That is, the online activity data for the graph 500 here reflects keyvalues from the click records, such as various characteristics associated with the user, the user's device, the page where the ad was placed, or other circumstances regarding the user's click. Based on this, the sensitivity coefficients are determined for the respective keyvalues and are plotted as staples 502 . In the graph 500 , the coefficient values are positive for a group 504 of keyvalues. Accordingly, these keyvalues can be said to indicate interaction proneness. Similarly, in the graph 550 a group 552 of keyvalues are associated with positive sensitivity coefficients.
- FIGS. 6A-B show example graphs 600 and 650 of model coefficients that take page identities into account. That is, each staple 602 here corresponds to a particular page where the ad was served.
- the graph 600 shows that a group 604 of pages has positive sensitivity coefficients and therefore indicate interaction proneness.
- a group 652 of pages has positive sensitivity coefficients.
- FIGS. 7A-C show examples of identifying one or more characteristics as being associated with interaction proneness. For example, this involves testing five different logistic regression models with regularization.
- Each of graphs 700 , 750 and 770 reflects an area-under-the-curve (AUC) variable as a function of different models.
- AUC area-under-the-curve
- models 702 A-E are used. That is, multiple instances of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve can be generated using the respective models, with the ROC curves showing the sensitivity values determined using the models 702 A-E.
- the ROC curves can then be analyzed, for example to determine the AUC, to evaluate the models 702 A-E.
- the AUC for the respective models is then plotted in the graph 700 .
- ROC receiver operating characteristic
- the model 702 A is here called “Base Model” and has the following characteristics.
- the model 702 A considers all input features as linear terms. That is: log( p /(1 ⁇ p )) ⁇ Ax
- A is a vector of linear coefficients and x is a set of input features.
- the model 702 B is called “BaseAdsUser” and incorporates a cross product of two feature sets, in this example called “Ad” and “User” feature sets.
- the model 702 C is called “BaseCountsCrit” and incorporates a cross product of “Keyword/keyvalue” and “User access behavior” feature sets.
- the model 702 D is called “BasePubCount” and incorporates a cross product of “Publisher” and “User access behavior” feature sets.
- the model 702 E is called “BaseUserCrit” and incorporates a cross product of “User” and “Keyword/keyvalue” feature sets.
- the graph 700 shows that for this online activity data, incorporating the cross product between “User” and “Ad” properties (i.e., the model 702 B) consistently performs well, almost always better than the other models 702 .
- the graph 750 shows the AUC as a function of models 752 A-C, wherein different values of the regularization constant are being tested.
- the graph 750 can be generated by starting with the best-performing of the models 702 A-E (i.e., here the model 702 B) and run training with different values of the regularization constant.
- the graph 770 illustrates an evaluation whether adding “Keyword/keyvalue” or “User access counts” features sets improve the quality of click-through rate predictions.
- models 772 A-D are here used, in which each of the “Keyword/keyvalue” or “User access counts” features sets are taken into account as follows:
- Model “Keyword/keyvalue” used “User access counts” used 772A — — 772B Y — 772C — Y 772D Y Y
- the graph 770 indicates that consistent gains in the AUC values are obtained compared to the base model that does not use these feature sets.
- FIGS. 8 and 9 present examples of results from offline experiments run on past data.
- FIGS. 8 and 9 present examples of segments that are created using results/coefficients of training using the best performing model.
- the best performing model is identified using the AUC metric (in the current examples, this was the BaseAdsUser model that incorporated the product of ad and user features).
- the training is performed on some data set (i.e., the data from a month-long time interval).
- the coefficients are obtained, for example as described above with reference to FIGS. 2-6 .
- positive coefficients indicate user proneness to interact with ads with these properties.
- click-through rate performance from segments is sought, one can define the segments using feature values with positive coefficients.
- click-through rate is shown for respective segments 802 A-F.
- the segment 802 A is the current segment definition.
- Segments 802 B-F are examples of model-based segment definitions that each include a different set of features in their definitions.
- Data 804 A-F indicates the numbers of clicks and impressions.
- the data 804 A shows the segment 802 A obtaining 653 clicks with 965,200 impressions, to name just one example.
- the model is being used to shrink the segment and increase the click-through rate.
- the data 804 B shows that the numbers of impressions and clicks have been reduced. In other words, this increase of the click-through rate comes at the expense of muss less traffic and clicks.
- Each of the segments 802 C-F involves a different model-based modification of the segment that increases both the number of impressions and the click-through rate. That is, FIG. 8 illustrates that one can potentially obtain a significant boost in CTR performance (proportion of clicks).
- FIG. 9 includes an analogous set of examples for a different data set.
- a graph 900 shows click-through rate for various segments 902 A-D.
- the model 902 D is a base segment, and the models 902 A-C are adapted segments that take one or more signals into account.
