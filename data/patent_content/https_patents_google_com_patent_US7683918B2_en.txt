Accordingly, the apparatus components and method steps have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the present invention, so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, having the benefit of the description herein.
- a device 100 is illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the device 100 is illustrated as a mobile communication device, such as cellular telephone for a wide area network (WAN) or internet phone for a wireless local area network (WLAN).
- WAN wide area network
- WLAN wireless local area network
- the device could alternately be any device that a user manipulates to control movement on a screen or scrolling through a list, such as a computer, a video device (portable or fixed terminal such as a home television), a music device (MP3 player), or a the like.
- the device 100 includes a display 102 , a speaker port 104 , a microphone port 106 , and a keypad 108 in housing 101 .
- the keypad includes a traditional 4 row by 3 column telephone key arrangement for the numbers 0-9, and the characters * and #. These keys may also have letters or stroke characters, as is known.
- Soft keys 110 and 112 are positioned below the display. The function associated with the soft keys changes depending on the mode of the device, and the function at any particular time will appear on the display 102 adjacent the keys.
- Function keys 114 and 116 are positioned below the soft keys, and may for example comprise dedicated function keys, such as those for activating music player or a camera.
- the send key 118 and end key 120 are illustrated below the function keys.
- a navigation and scroll user interface 122 is positioned on the front surface of the device 100 for user navigation of images, menus, and lists presented on the display.
- the device 100 thus includes a menu system that produces images, menus, and/or lists presented in display 102 .
- the illustrated device includes the keypad 108 , it is envisioned that fewer or more control elements could be provided with the navigation and scroll user interface, and further that the navigation and scroll user interface can be the exclusive control for the device.
- FIG. 2 a first embodiment of a navigation and scroll user interface 122 is illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- the user interface 122 includes a scroll strip 200 and a directional navigation input 202 .
- the illustrated scroll strip 200 comprises a circular strip that partially circumscribes the directional navigation input 202 .
- the illustrated scroll strip is a touch sensitive device, and may be implemented using one or more capacitive sensor, one or more resistive sensor, or any other suitable sensor.
- the illustrated scrolling strip does not completely circumscribe the navigation input, but has a first end 203 and a second end 205 at opposite ends of the strip.
- An optional, additional touch sensitive “key” 230 is positioned between ends 203 and 205 and completes the circle circumscribing the navigation device 202 .
- the key 203 can be a sensor region, a mechanical switch, or any other suitable construction.
- the scroll strip can be implemented using touch pad technology, such as resistive or capacitive sensing technologies.
- touch pad technology such as resistive or capacitive sensing technologies.
- very thin touch sensing stacks can be used to detect the digit presence, allowing the scrolling device to be implemented on very thin devices.
- mechanical switches could be used to implement the scrolling strip.
- keys can be individual keys, such as mechanical switch assemblies, which may for example include a physical key that activates a poppel associated with a printed circuit board.
- a key can be an area of a touch sensor, such as a labeled surface over a capacitive or resistive sensor.
- Such sensors can detect “contact” or “contacting” when a digit is very close proximity to the surface of the sensor or actual contact with the surface of the sensor, depending upon the sensitivity of the sensor.
- the illustrated scroll strip 200 has three zones.
- a proportional zone 204 is for proportional scrolling, wherein the rate and direction of movement of the user's digit, such as a finger or pointer (for example a rod), around the strip results in a corresponding rate and direction of vertical menu scrolling.
- a proportional zone 204 is for proportional scrolling, wherein the rate and direction of movement of the user's digit, such as a finger or pointer (for example a rod), around the strip results in a corresponding rate and direction of vertical menu scrolling.
- slow movement of the digit across the surface of proportional zone 204 in a clockwise direction will cause the device to slowly move down a menu or list visual on display 102 .
- Faster movement of the digit across the proportional zone 204 in the clockwise direction will cause the device to move quickly down the menu or list.
- Slow digit movement in the counterclockwise direction across the proportional zone 204 in the counter-clockwise direction will cause the device to move slowly up a menu or list
- a reverse multi-mode zone 206 is positioned at first end 203 of scrolling strip 200 , and extends from the proportional zone 204 to the end 203 .
- a forward multi-mode zone 208 is positioned at the other end 205 of the proportional scrolling strip 200 and extends from the proportional zone 204 to the second end 205 .
- the multi-mode zones 206 and 208 can have fixed or variable lengths, as described in greater detail herein below. It is envisioned that in the preferred embodiment, the multi-mode zones 206 and 208 provide both continuous and proportional scrolling because this provides a more intuitive user experience. However, the zones 206 and 208 can alternatively provide only non-proportional scrolling in these zone. For example, the distance moved into the zones 206 and 208 could determine the rate of scrolling such that the further the digit moves from the boundary, the faster continuous scrolling occurs.
- the menu will continue scrolling at a rate determined by the speed at which the digit was last moving before the digit speed dropped below the threshold.
- the user can thus move a digit into the multi-mode zone 206 very quickly and leave their digit on the zone to achieve rapid continuous scrolling without digit motion to search for an item on a long list. If the user moves a digit into a multi-mode zone and lifts it up, the menu will scroll until the digit is lifted at which time the scrolling will stop. If the user moves in the multi-mode zone without stopping, the menu will scroll at a proportional rate.
- the multi-mode zones 206 and 208 can also be used for accelerated scrolling responsive to tapping. For example, each time the user taps the multi-mode zone 208 , the menu can move to the next letter. In this way, if the first letter of an item displayed by the menu is an A, tapping the multi-mode zone 208 once will move the menu to the first item beginning with the letter B. Tapping the multi-mode zone 208 again will move the menu to the first item beginning with a C. Tapping the multi-mode zone again will move the menu to the first item beginning with a D. In this way, the user can tap through the alphabet.
- tapping the multi-mode zone 208 will move the menu back to the beginning of the list, such as a title beginning with a number or the letter A. It is envisioned that items beginning with a number will be ahead of items beginning with the letters A through Z. Alternatively, items beginning with a number could be behind items beginning with a letter.
- Tapping the multi-mode zone 206 has a similar effect as tapping the multi-mode zone 208 , except that the tapping will move the menu backwards through the listing by letter. For example, if the current cursor is on an item beginning with the letter B, tapping multi-mode zone 206 will cause the cursor to move to the first item in the menu beginning with the letter A.
- tapping the multi-mode zones could result in stepping through any index. For example, a tap could cause the menu to move sequentially to a next or previous category. It is also envisioned that tapping could move the menu by a fixed predetermined number of lines.
- the five-way navigation interface 202 includes an up key 210 , a right key 212 , a down key 214 and left key 216 .
- a select key 218 is positioned in the center.

- FIG. 4 discloses another alternative embodiment of a scroll and navigation user input 400 .
- User input 400 can include a joystick, such as a 5-way joystick 402 positioned inside in the center of the navigation strip 200 .
- a 5-way joystick rocks to permit up, down, right and left navigation, as well depression such as z-axis actuation, whereby the user can press the joystick straight down to “select” or “enter”.
- This embodiment permits the overall surface dimensions of the scroll and navigation input to be reduced, or allows the scroll strip to be wider in the same footprint as the scroll and navigation user input 122 .
- a joystick permitting more directions of manipulation could be employed without departing from the invention.
- FIG. 5 discloses another alternative embodiment of a scroll and navigation user input 500 .

- the scroll strip 200 partially circumscribes the center select key 508 .
- the up key 510 , right key 512 , and left key 514 are integrated on the scroll strip.

- the operation of the improved user interface will now be described with reference to FIGS. 8-14 .
- the operation enables rapid and intuitive scrolling through large amounts of data, such as phone lists, music, videos, and the like. It also maintains traditional navigation functions which users expect in a multi-modal device.
- the need for a user to perform repetitive motion can be reduced, while enabling the small surface footprint and low volume desired for implementing the navigation and control user interface on a compact portable device.
- a circuit 800 is illustrated in block diagram form in FIG. 8 .
- the illustrated circuit is for a radio communication device.
- the circuit includes an antenna 801 , a transceiver 800 , a microphone 806 , a speaker 808 , a controller 802 , a display 102 , keys 804 , and scroll strip 200 .
- the transceiver would not be required if the scroll strip is not associated with a communication device.
- the controller can be implemented using a digital signal processor, controller, microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic unit, discrete circuits, or the like, or a combination thereof.
- the keys can be implemented using distinct or integrated physical switches, touch sensors, or a combination thereof.
- the controller 802 start logic 900 initiates that device in a conventional manner.
- the start logic is described in more detail with reference to FIG. 10 .
- the logic switching manager 902 transitions between rate scrolling 904 , page logic 906 , and proportional scrolling 908 depending upon how the user is interacting with the scrolling strip.
- the controller 802 is in a standby state 1002 waiting for a digit contact with the scrolling strip 200 as detected at step 1004 .
- Touchdown occurs when an object, such as a finger or pointer, touches the scrolling strip 200 .
- the time is recorded at step 1006
- the position on the strip is noted at step 1008
- the “last” scroll rate is set to zero at step 1010
- the scroll distance and direction are set to “none” at step 1012 .
- the device is then initiated for the logic switching manager function at step 1014 .
- the logic switching manger operation is illustrated in FIG. 11 .
- the controller 802 Upon entering the logic manager, the controller 802 detects a lift-off event in step 1100 . Detection of lift-off in a multi-mode zone indicates the user has lifted the digit in contact with the scrolling strip and that the user may be tapping a multi-mode zone to step rapidly though a list, such that the paging logic is executed as indicated at step 1102 .
- Paging, or step scrolling can be stepping a page size in a program where pages are defined, or by a predetermined block size such as 10 entries or screen lines, 20 entries or screen lines, 30 entries or screen lines, or any other suitable incremental amount.
- paging can be stepping through the alphabet or another indexing element such as album names, genres, musician by names, actor by names, directors, or any other suitable indexing category.
- the rate logic 1106 is executed to determine the multi-mode zone behavior. If the digit remains in the proportion zone, the controller 802 executes the proportion logic 1108 .
- the controller 802 determines if the conditions to activate paging are met in step 1200 .
- the following conditions must be met:
- Proportional scrolling is shown in FIG. 13 .
- the controller 802 waits for input in step 1300 . If the controller detects lift-off in step 1302 , indicating the user tapped the sensing strip, it exits proportion scrolling mode and returns to the logic switching manager at step 1304 to transition to paging logic. It will be recognized that other gestures could be used to pass control to the paging logic, such as press and hold, double tap, or any other suitable gesture. If lift-off is not detected at step 1302 , the controller determines at step 1306 the direction and number of lines to scroll. The digit moving speed profile will determine a value, represented by variable x, which is a rate variable, to set the proportion of menu movement for a particular distance of digit travel.
- variable x which is a rate variable
- the value x is thus the ratio of digit movement distance to screen display movement distance.
- the value x can depend on the display 102 size, the scrolling strip 200 size, and will be selected such that a movement across the scrolling strip produces a rate that permits the user to see the items that are scrolled while the menu moves through the list.
- the number of lines to scroll will equal the distance D of digit travel divided by the variable x (D/x).
- step 1308 determines whether the number of lines to scroll is 0, the controller determines whether the conditions are met to activate rate scrolling in step 1310 . All of the following conditions must be met to activate rate scrolling:
- an alternate embodiment may use some type of gesture (e.g., stop) in place of, or in conjunction with, a rate activation zone (that may have an associated directionality) as one of the conditions for activating rate scrolling. If rate scrolling conditions are met as determined at step 1312 , the controller repeats last proportion scroll in step 1312 and exits proportion logic scrolling to return to the logic switching manager in step 1304 and transition to rate scrolling.
- some type of gesture e.g., stop
- a rate activation zone that may have an associated directionality
- step 1310 If the conditions are not met for rate scrolling as determined at step 1310 , following determination of a 0 distance, the controller returns to step 1300 to wait for an input.
- step 1308 If it was determined in step 1308 that the number of lines to scroll does not equal zero, the scrolling command is issued in step 1314 .
- the controller will then store the last proportional scrolling rate, distance, direction time, and direction since last scroll or touchdown in step 1316 , and return to step 1300 to wait for the next input.
- the rate scrolling logic is illustrated in FIG. 14 .
- the multi-mode regions is defined, or set, in step 1400 .
- the multi-mode region is the area on the sensor in which continuous scrolling occurs.
- the multi-mode zone will be described with reference to FIGS. 15-17 .
- the exemplary strip 1500 is straight only for purposes of simplifying the explanation, but those skilled in that art will recognize that the explanation applies also to an arcuate strip, such as a round, oval or u-shaped strip. Regardless of the shape of the scroll strip, the operation of the proportional and multi-mode zones is equally applicable.
- a first, or right, multi-mode zone 1506 extends from the right boundary 1510 to the end 1511 of the scrolling strip 1500 in FIG. 15 .
- a second, or left, multi-mode zone 1508 extends from the left boundary 1512 to the end 1513 of the scrolling strip 1500 .
- Contact in the multi-mode zones can produce proportional mode (proportional scrolling), continuous mode (scrolling occurs without digit movement), or page mode (scrolling is stepped by predetermined increments such as an index number of screen lines for each tap).
- the boundaries thus demark the transition point between the portions 1506 , 1508 of the scroll strip 1500 in which rate and page scrolling can be initiated and the portion 1504 of the scroll strip in which rate and page scrolling can not be initiated. Rate and page scrolling can not be initiated in the proportional zone 1504 .
- continuous scrolling in the multimode zone occurs when there is digit movement on the strip in multi-mode zones 1506 , 1508 that starts out above a threshold speed and falls below the threshold speed without lifting off from the strip.
- the scrolling rate will be determined by the last speed of digit movement measured prior to stopping.
- the conditions for continuous movement in the right multi-mode zone 1506 are: movement in the multi-mode zone 1506 in the direction away from the boundary 1510 toward the end 1511 , continuous contact of a digit on the scroll strip 1506 , and reduction in digit movement speed to below a threshold (which can rest or near at rest) in the multi-mode zone 1506 . If these conditions are met, continuous screen scrolling will occur without additional digit movement.
- the conditions for continuous screen scrolling in the left multi-mode zone 1508 are: movement in the multi-mode zone 1508 in the direction away from the boundary 1512 toward the end 1513 , continuous contact of a digit on the scroll strip in the multi-mode zone 1508 , and reduction in digit movement speed to below a threshold (which can rest or near at rest) in the multi-mode zone 1508 . If these conditions are met, continuous scrolling will occur.
- Variable continuous scrolling can advantageously be provided.
- Variable continuous scrolling means that the user can move the digit in contact with the scroll strip to change the rate of continuous scrolling.
- a dynamic variable rate region is illustrated by triangle 1601 ( FIG. 16 ), having a transition point TRANSITION 1 , a stop-point STOP 1 , and a maximum continuous scroll rate MAX 1 .
- the stop-point is the location in the multi-mode zone where the speed of the user's digit movement dropped below the threshold speed of digit movement, which will be the initial distal end of the rate region.
- the maximum rate MAX 1 is the maximum rate the menu will keep moving, and is set to the last rate measurement taken prior to digit movement dropping below the speed threshold (e.g., the previous scroll rate stored in steps 1214 or 1316 ).
- the maximum rate MAX 1 is thus a function of, or derived from, the previous rate of scrolling prior to initiating continuous scrolling, and it is associated with a contact position on the scroll strip 1500 located at the stop point STOP 1 .
- the user can slow down the rate of continuous scrolling by moving from the stop point STOP 1 toward the transition point TRANSITION 1 .
- the rate of continuous movement will drop linearly with movement of the digit along the strip, until the transition point TRANSITION 1 is reached.
- the transition point is the lowest rate of continuous scrolling. If the user moves their digit to the left of TRANSITION 1 , the menu will return to proportional scrolling.
- the region is dynamic in that it varies. It can vary in scroll strip size, location and/or the rate of scrolling.
- the slope of the triangle and the transition point are a function of the maximum rate MAX 1 , and thus are derived from the maximum rate.
- the maximum scrolling rate MAX 1 may be any suitable rate, such 50 lines per second in FIG. 16 .
- the continuous scrolling rate will vary depending upon where the digit contacts the scrolling strip in the variable rate continuous scrolling region. More particularly, if after coming to rest at STOP 1 , the user moves their digit to position 1620 and holds it there, the rate of continuous scrolling will be reduced to a rate 1621 , such as 40 lines per second. Thus the menu will keep scrolling, but at a lower rate.
- rate 1623 such as 30 lines per second.
- the user can move the digit to the right or left, and it will continue scrolling at a rate that varies along as represented by the slope 1602 , as long as the user stays on the strip between the transition point TRANSITION 1 and the stop point STOP 1 .
- FIG. 17 illustrates two additional aspects of the variable continuous scrolling region.
- the rate MAX 2 is faster than MAX 1 , indicating that the digit was moving faster prior to dropping below the speed threshold (or coming to rest).
- the rate MAX 2 may for example be 80 lines per second. As can be seen, the slope is steeper, and the length of continuous variable rate region is greater. The rate will decrease rapidly with distance to the transition rate.
- FIG. 17 illustrates that the user can move the region to the right. After establishing position STOP 2 , if the user moves further to the right (beyond STOP 2 toward the end of the strip 1511 ), and then again stops at STOP 3 , the variable region will move to position 1703 .
- the region characteristics will not change, such that the transition point will also move to the right to point TRANSITION 3 .
- the distance between the stop point and the transition point does not change, and the slope will not change, as the triangle shift right.
- the multi-mode zones operate the same, although they are mirrors of one another.
- the multi-mode zone has the following characteristics:
- the multi-mode zone will now be described with reference to FIG. 14 .
- the controller 802 waits for an input in step 1402 . If the next event is determined to be a lift-off in step 1404 , the controller exits the rate scrolling logic and goes to the logic switch state to await another input as indicated in step 1406 . If the next event is a non-lift-off movement, the multi-mode zone is updated in step 1408 .
- a multi-mode zone is updated as follows. If the digit moved to a position in the multi-mode zone (e.g., 1506 ) between the STOP-point and the end of the scroll strip (outside the continuous region), the multi-mode zone is shifted to align the STOP-point with the current digit position). If the digit is still in the multi-mode zone as determined in step 1410 , and it is within the existing continuous rate scrolling region, the continuous scrolling is executed in step 1412 . In continuous scrolling, scrolling occurs automatically at a rate determined by where the digit is located in the continuous scrolling region. The user can vary the rate by moving their digit towards the transition point, to reduce the scrolling rate, or towards the STOP-point, to increase the rate.
- the maximum scrolling rate is the last proportional scrolling rate (the rate that the digit was moving across the scroll strip when it entered the multi-mode zone from the proportional zone). If it was determined in step 1410 that a digit is no longer in the multi-mode region (e.g., it is to the right of the transition point), in step 1414 the controller resets the last scroll rate to zero, the scroll distance and direction to “none”, and stores the current time. The controller then returns to the logic switching manager in step 1406 .
- the multi-mode zone could produce continuous scrolling which is not variable.
- the rate of continuous scrolling may be the maximum rate no matter where the digit is positioned in the multi-mode zone, so long as the digit remains in the multi-mode zone. This would provide non-variable continuous scrolling based on a digit speed measurement.
- the digit speed measurement associated with the continuous rate can be that rate associated with the last digit speed sampling prior to stopping, or it can be the speed that the digit crosses the boundary between the proportional zone.
- the scroll strip 1800 is illustrated to be a full circle around the navigation interface 202 .
- the scroll strip includes a proportional zone 1802 and a multi-mode zone 1804 .
- the boundaries 1805 , 1806 separate the proportional zone 1802 from the multi-mode zone 1804 .
- the proportional zone 1802 and multi-mode zone 1804 operate mostly the same as the other proportional zones and multi-mode zones described above. However, the conditions for continuous scrolling are slightly different. In the embodiment of FIG. 18 , the direction of continuous scrolling will be determined from the direction of travel in the multi-mode zone prior to the digit speed dropping below the speed threshold.
- a digit that comes to rest after moving clockwise in multi-mode zone 1804 will result in downward continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed measurement (the previous speed measurement being the last measurement prior to the digit speed dropping below the threshold).
- a digit that comes to rest after moving counter-clockwise in multi-mode zone 1804 will result in upward continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed measurement. It is thus the speed that the digit is traveling away from the proportional zone that rate of continuous scrolling.
- the scroll strip 1900 extends part of the way around the navigation interface 202 .
- the scroll strip includes proportional zones 1902 and 1903 , a multi-mode zone 1904 .
- the boundaries 1905 , 1906 separate the proportional zones 1902 , 1903 from the multi-mode zone 1904 .
- the operation of the multi-mode zone 1904 is the same as multi-mode zone 1804 .
- the direction of continuous scrolling will be determined from the direction of travel in multi-mode zone prior to the digit speed dropping below the speed threshold.
- a digit that comes to rest after moving clockwise in multi-mode zone 1904 will result in downward continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed measurement (the previous speed measurement being the last measurement prior to the digit speed dropping below the threshold).
- a digit that comes to rest after moving counter-clockwise in multi-mode zone 1904 will result in upward continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed measurement. It is thus the speed that the digit is traveling away from the proportional zone that rate of continuous scrolling.
- the proportional zones 1902 and 1903 can support proportional scrolling in either direction of travel, such that clock-wise movement will produce downward scrolling and counter-clockwise movement will produce upward scrolling.
- the embodiment of FIG. 19 may be found to be advantageous for right handed operation of zones 1903 and 1904 using the right thumb when holding the device in the right hand, whereas zones 1902 and 1904 may be found advantageous for left handed control using the left them while holding the device in the left hand.
- Scrolling speeds are exemplary. It is envisioned that they will vary depending upon user preferences, and may vary from 0-100 lines per second for a typical small display, such as that found on a mobile phone.
- the surface area of the user interface will vary depending upon the size of the device. For example, the size of navigation and scrolling interface 122 may be less than 25 millimeters in diameter, and the area of the navigation interface 202 may be less than 20 millimeters.
Abstract
Description
-
- touchdown and lift-off positions must be within a specified range of the strip (for example must occur in a multi-mode zone);
- lift-off time and touchdown time must be within a predetermined value (a value should be selected such that tapping is detected without over triggering responsive to a press and hold); and
- a scroll can not occur between touchdown and lift-off.
If any of the three conditions are not met, the controller proceeds to step 1204 to wait for touchdown. If all three conditions are met, then the page command is generated instep 1202. Paging is defined as scrolling a set number of lines or scrolling to a next index point, such as the next letter of the alphabet. Touchdown is detected atstep 1208. The touchdown time is stored atstep 1210. The touchdown position is noted atstep 1212. The previous scroll rate is set to 0 instep 1214. The scroll distance and direction are set to “none” instep 1216. The program returns to the logic switching manager instep 1220.
-
- digit is at rest (or near at rest; this is calculated by current time minus last scroll time is greater than or equal to the last scroll duration) in the rate activation zone (range of positions on the sensor corresponding to the multi-mode zone where rate activation occurs);
- last portion scroll rate greater than 0; and
- last scroll direction matches rate activation zone direction (left-to-right movement in the right multi-mode zone and right-to-left movement in the left multi-mode zone).
-
- movement to the left in right multi-mode zone 1506 (from the
end 1511 toward boundary 1510), or movement to the right in left multi-mode zone 1508 (from theend 1513 toward the boundary 1512); or - movement in the multi-mode zone that does not fall below the speed threshold; or
- movement in the multi-mode zone that never exceeds the speed threshold.
- Any of these conditions will result in proportional scrolling.
- movement to the left in right multi-mode zone 1506 (from the

- if a user contacts the strip in the
proportional zone 1504 and moves into themulti-mode zone - if the user puts the digit down in the
multi-mode zone 1506, moves the digit toward theboundary 1510, proportional scrolling will occur; - if the user puts the digit down in the
multi-mode zone 1508, moves the digit toward theboundary 1512, proportional scrolling will occur; - if the user moves a digit across the multi-mode zones without stopping, proportional scrolling occurs;
- if the user is moving toward
end 1511 in themulti-mode zone 1506 or moving towardend 1513 inzone 1508, and then stops moving while still in the multi-mode zone, the menu or list will continue to scroll at the rate associated with the last speed measurement before the digit stopped moving; - the display will continue to scroll through a list or menu at the same rate as the menu was moving just prior to the user stopping their digit movement until the user moves their digit back toward the boundary;
- the user can stop the scrolling by lifting the digit from the scroll strip; and
- tapping the digit in the multi-mode zones will result in paging.
