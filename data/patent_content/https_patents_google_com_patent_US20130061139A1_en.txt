Definitions
- This specification relates to spell checking text.
- a spell checker aims to flag textual terms that may be spelled incorrectly.
- a conventional spell checker generally includes a dictionary and routines for comparing input text with terms in the dictionary. When a match between the input text and the terms in the dictionary cannot be found, the spell checker can flag the input text, and may provide a spelling suggestion.
- the dictionary is typically stored at a user device, for example, on a memory device that is part of a personal computer, smart phone, or tablet computer, and the spell check is performed locally at the user device.
- a search query spell checker can perform spell checking remotely.
- a query spell checker located remotely from the user device, e.g., one co-located with, or implemented as part of, a search engine, can spell check the user-entered text.
- a query spell checker can be based on an n-gram language model and a noisy channel model. The language model and noisy channel model can be generated from a collection of anonymized user queries received over time. Based on the language model and the noisy channel model, the query spell checker can perform a spell check on the search query, which typically contains no more than five or six words.
- the query spell checker can provide spelling suggestions resulting from the spell check to the user device for display in a response to the search query, in the form of query suggestions, for example.
- This specification describes technologies relating to text spell checking performed by a server remote from user device.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods performed by a server.
- the methods include the actions of receiving a request to spell check text; dividing the text into multiple segments, each segment including no more than a predetermined number of terms; providing each segment to a spell checker programmed to spell check an input including no more than the predetermined number of terms; receiving, from the spell checker, one or more spelling correction suggestions, each spelling correction suggestion corresponding to a term in a segment, the term being designated as misspelled by the spell checker; and assembling the received one or more spelling correction suggestions into a response to the request to spell check the text.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods performed by a user device.
- the methods include the actions of receiving user input text; identifying a candidate term for spelling correction from the received text, the candidate term including a term designated as a misspelled term by a local spell checker, the local spell checker executing on the user device; sending the candidate term to a remote spell checker, the remote spell checker executing on a server that is connected to the user device through a communications network; receiving, from the remote spell checker, a spelling correction suggestion for the candidate term; and providing the spelling correction suggestion for display on the user device.
- Spell checking can be performed based on a fixed dictionary as well as based on data reflecting customary and popular usage. Popular usage of a word can change frequently.
- the techniques described in this specification allow a spell checker to dynamically adapt to changes in how people spell or use a word.
- Spell checking can be performed on text in multiple languages, for example, on a sentence or phrase that contains both English and Spanish words.
- Spell checking a term can be performed based on a context of the term, in addition to the term itself.
- a system can use words before or after a term to determine whether a word is correctly spelled. For example, when spell checking a term “Lear,” a system can designate the term as correctly spelled when the term appears in “King Lear,” but designate the term as incorrectly spelled when the term appears in “Princess Lear.” In the latter case, the system can provide a term “Leia” as a spelling correction suggestion.
- Spell checking can be customized automatically.
- the system can record user-specific terms (e.g., a name in a user's contact list) if the user opts into the system and allows the system to use the user's personal information to spell check the user's text.
- the system can then, without requiring the user to add the term to a customized dictionary, avoid flagging the user-specific term (e.g., a last name “Teh” in the contact list) as misspelled.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example system for server-based spell checking
- the system can include a user device 102 and a server 104 .
- the user device 102 and server 104 can interact over a data communications network 105 .
- the user device 102 can be any kind of personal computing device, e.g., a personal computer, smart phone, or tablet computer.
- the user device 102 is programmed to perform a two-tiered spell checking on text input, first locally, then remotely.
- the user device 102 includes a local text editor 106 and a local spell checker 108 .
- the text editor 106 is an application program configured to receive text input from a text edit area.
- the text editor 106 is configured to provide the received text input to the local spell checker 108 for spell checking.
- the local spell checker 108 includes a program module that spell checks the text input using a local dictionary.
- the local spell checker 108 identifies, based on the local dictionary, a term 110 in the input text that appears to be spelled incorrectly, the local spell checker 108 sends a notification to the text editor 106 .
- the text editor 106 can mark the term 110 in the text edit area, for example, by highlighting, underlining, or changing a display color of the term, to indicate it may be misspelled.
- the text editor 106 can automatically determine that the term 110 requires further spell checking, or receive user input (e.g., a mouse click on the marked term 110 ) that indicates the term needs further spell checking.
- the text editor 106 sends, in a request, the term 110 to the server 104 through the communications network 105 using a client-side spell check interface (CSCI) 112 .
- the CSCI 112 is a software program that operates in communication with the text editor 106 and that is programmed to perform text selection operations and communication operations. Examples of the CSCI 112 include stand-alone programs, plugins to a word processing application program, or a JavaScriptTM component that executes in a browser that renders a text editing box.
- the text selection operations include selecting additional text to send to the server 104 to provide a context for the term 110 .
- the communication operations include sending the request including term 110 and the additional text to the server 104 and processing information returned from the server 104 in response to the request.
- the server 104 includes one or more computers programmed to perform functions of server-based spell checking
- the server 104 can receive from the user device 102 text having one or more terms.
- the server 104 is programmed to divide the text into multiple segments, if the text includes more than one term.
- the server 104 can perform spell check on a segment that includes term 110 .
- the server 104 includes a server-side spell check interface (SSCI) 114 .
- the SSCI 114 is a software component of the server 104 programmed to communicate with the CSCI 112 of user device 102 through communications network 105 .
- the SSCI 114 is programmed to perform operations of receiving the term 110 , and optional text in addition to the term 110 , if any, from the user device 102 .
- the SSCI 114 is programmed to perform operations of providing spelling correction suggestions 116 to the user device 102 in response to the request from the CSCI 112 .
- the SSCI 114 Upon receiving the term 110 and the optional text, if any, the SSCI 114 provides the term 110 and optional text to a customizable spell checker 120 .
- the customizable spell checker 120 includes a spell checking program that is configured to spell check a term without context or a term in a context.
- the context of a term can be several terms before or after the term.
- a software component executing on the server 104 can divide long text into short segments, each short segment including a term to be spell checked and a context of that term. Further details on the techniques of dividing text into segments are described below in reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 .
- the customizable spell checker 120 is configured to perform the spell check using a noisy channel model and a language model.
- a model builder 130 generates the noisy channel model and the language model used by the customizable spell checker 120 .
- the customizable spell checker 120 generates one or more spelling correction suggestions 116 for a term using the noisy channel model, the language model, and, if a context is provided, the context. Each of the spelling correction suggestions 116 can be associated with a confidence score.
- the server 104 then sends the one or more spelling correction suggestions 116 , and associating confidence scores, if any, to the CSCI 112 of the user device 102 through the communication network 105 .
- the user device 102 can display the one or more spelling correction suggestions 116 in the text editor 106 , in proximity to the term 110 .
- the text editor 106 can display both spelling correction suggestions from the local spell checker 108 and spelling correction suggestions 116 from the server 104 in an integrated suggestion list. Accordingly, a possibly misspelled term can be spell-checked in both a prescriptive manner (by using the local dictionary of local spell checker 108 ) and in a descriptive manner (by using data reflecting current common usage captured by the language model builder 130 ).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example user device 102 configured for server-based spell checking
- the user device 102 includes text editor 106 .
- the text editor 106 is configured to provide for display a text editing area 202 .
- the text editing area 202 can be a text box rendered by a web browser or a text editing window of a word processing program.
- the text editor 106 receives user input text, for example, “Where Elph, the sacred river, ran ⁇ cr>Through caverns measureless to man ⁇ cr>Down to a sunless sea.”
- the notation “ ⁇ cr>” represents a line break character.
- a local spell checker 108 automatically or upon receiving a user request to spell check the input text, performs a local spell check on the input text using a local dictionary 204 .
- the local dictionary 204 can include a pre-determined collection of common misspelled terms and their correct spelling forms.
- the local spell checker 108 determines that a term in the input text, e.g., “Elph,” is not a correctly spelled term in the local dictionary 204 .
- the local spell checker 108 determines, based on the local dictionary 204 , one or more spelling correction suggestions for the received term.
- the local spell checker 108 can determine that the spelling correction suggestions for the term “Elph” are terms “Alpha,” “Delphi,” or “Echo.”
- the local dictionary 204 provides an indication to the text editor 106 that a term (“Elph”) may be misspelled, and provides the spelling correction suggestions to the text editor 106 .
- the CSCI 112 of text editor 106 designates the term “Elph” as a candidate term for further spell checking by a server.
- the CSCI 112 can operate in various modes.
- the CSCI 112 of text editor 106 can send the candidate term (e.g., “Elph”) alone to a remote spell checking server without additional text.
- the SCSI 112 of text editor 106 can send the candidate term to the remote spell checking server with additional text. In either case, the SCSI 112 of text editor 106 can send an identifier to the remote spell checking server identifying which term is the candidate term to be spell checked.
- the text editor 106 provides a block of text (e.g., all text in the text editing area 202 ) to the remote spell checking server, without identifying a candidate term. In these cases, each term in the block of text can be spell checked.
- the CSCI 112 can send the candidate term to the spell checking server automatically or upon user request.
- the CSCI 112 of the text editor 106 can send the candidate term (e.g., “Elph”) to the spell checking server upon receiving an indication from the local spell checker 108 that the term may be misspelled.
- the CSCI 112 can mark the term (e.g., using a pre-specified font type, style, or color) for user attention upon receiving an indication from the local spell checker 108 that the term may be misspelled.
- the CSCI 112 can make the term interactive, e.g., operable to receive a user input indicating a request for further spell check.
- the CSCI 112 provides the candidate term to the remote spell checking server for spell checking upon receiving the user input.
- the CSCI 112 of the text editor 106 can automatically select text from the text editing area 202 .
- the CSCI 112 provides text to the remote server and receives a spelling correction suggestion, for example, “Alph.”
- the spelling correction suggestion received from the remote server may not be a common term as stored in local dictionary 204 ; the term may be a term commonly used in the context of the additional text.
- the text editor 106 can combine the spelling correction suggestion received from the remote server with the terms received from the local spell checker 108 (“Alpha,” “Delphi,” and “Echo”) to form a combined list of spelling correction suggestions 206 .
- the text editor 106 can provide the combined list of spelling correction suggestions 206 for display in the text editing area 202 , in proximity to the candidate term for a user to select a term with which to replace the candidate term.
- the spelling correction suggestion received from the remote server is associated with a confidence score
- relative positions of the spelling correction suggestion and the terms received from the local spell checker can be determined based on the confidence score. For example, if the confidence score satisfies a threshold, the spelling correction suggestion can be displayed at the top of the combined list.
- the text editor 106 is configured to optimize the use of remote spell checking by using a local cache 208 .
- the local cache 208 is a memory in which the text editor 106 stores a portion of the text being edited, or an index to a portion of the text being edited.
- the portion of the text being edited includes text that has already been remotely spell checked by the server. Accordingly, the text editor 106 can be configured to send only text outside of the local cache 208 to be remotely spell checked by the server, thus saving network bandwidth and server processing resources. After a section of text has been remotely spell checked, the text editor 106 can add the section or an index to the section to the local cache 208 . Likewise, if a section of text stored or indexed in local cache 208 is further edited after being remotely spell checked, the text editor 106 can remove the section of text or the index from the local cache 208 .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example server 104 for server-based spell checking

- the context builder 302 is a software component of the server 104 that is configured to communicate with the SSCI 114 and a customizable spell checker 120 .
- the context builder 302 includes instructions configured to cause the server 104 to create a context for spell checking a term among the one or more terms received by the SSCI 114 , and provide the term and context to the customizable spell checker 120 for spell checking.
- the SSCI 114 receives text that includes multiple terms to be spell checked, and no identifier indicating which term to be spell checked. For example, the SSCI 114 can receive a sentence or a paragraph that includes multiple words.
- the context builder 302 can be configured to cause the customizable spell checker 120 to spell check each term in the text.
- the context build 302 can build a context for each of the terms.
- the context builder 302 divides the text into multiple segments, each segment including a term and a context of the term. The size of each segment can be optimized based on characteristics of the customizable spell checker 120 .
- the context builder 302 can then send the segments to the customizable spell checker 120 for serial or parallel spell checking.
- the customizable spell checker 120 is a spell checker optimized for performing spell checking on a text segment that includes no more than a pre-specified number of terms (e.g., ten terms).
- the customizable spell checker 120 can be a spell checker optimized for spell checking a large number of inputs each of which is short (e.g., fewer than 10 terms) using a noisy channel model and a language model.
- Examples of spell checkers that can be used as the customizable spell checker 120 include spell checkers based on technologies described in Cucerzan et al., Spelling Correction as an Iterative Process That Exploits the Collective Knowledge of Web Users , June 2004, and Ahmad et al., Learning a Spelling Error Model from Search Query Logs , November 2005.
- a model builder 130 includes a system configured to generate a generic noisy channel model 304 and a generic language model 306 based on document data 308 .

- the user information can include, for example, an identifier of a user using the user device that sent a term for spell checking
- the overlay noisy channel model 310 and the overlay language model 312 can be custom built for the user.
- the overlay noisy channel model 310 and the overlay language model 312 can reflect, for example, terms that the user frequently uses. Even though the terms are spelled correctly under circumstances specific to the user, these terms are often treated as misspelled by a generic spell checker.
- the customizable spell checker 120 When the customizable spell checker 120 receives one or more segments of text from context builder 302 , the customizable spell checker 120 performs spell checking on a term in each of the one or more segments using the noisy channel model 304 , overlay noisy channel model 310 , general language model 306 , and overlay language model 312 .
- the customizable spell checker 120 can send results of spell checking for each segment to an assembler 316 .
- the assembler 316 is a software component of the server 104 .
- the assembler 316 is coupled with the customizable spell checker 120 and the SSCI 114 .
- the assembler 316 is configured to assemble the results of spell checking for each segment into a response to a request for spell checking text from the user device.

- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating example segmenting techniques of server-based spell checking
- a context builder 302 receives text 402 for spell checking
- the context builder 302 identifies one or more terms from the received text, and provides a context for each of the one or more terms. Each context includes not more than a pre-specified number of terms.
- the context builder 302 designates the identified term and the context as a segment of the text.
- the context builder 302 sends each segment to a customizable spell checker 120 for spell checking
- the pre-specified number can be configurable to optimize the performance of the customizable spell checker 120 .
- the pre-specified number can be four, such that the each segment includes no more than five terms.
- the customizable spell checker 120 performs spell checking on one term of the five terms.
- the context builder 302 sends one segment to customizable spell checker 120 for spell checking
- the segment includes the single term to be spell checked and an empty context.
- the context builder 302 can generate a segment that includes the identified term and a number of terms before and after the term, up to the pre-specified number or to a boundary.
- the boundary includes one or more signals in the text designated as separators.
- a boundary can be, for example, a beginning of a sentence, an end of sentence, a line break character, or a punctuation mark.
- the context of a term to be spell checked need not include a term across a boundary from the term to be spell checked.
- the context builder 302 can identify each term in the text as a term to be spell checked.
- the context builder 302 can generate multiple segments. Each segment can include a term and a number of terms before and after the term, up to the pre-specified number or to a boundary.
- the context builder can generate the segments by applying a sliding window to the text.
- the sliding window can have a size corresponding to the pre-specified number. For example, if the number is four, the sliding window can have a size of five terms.
- the text 402 is a sequence of, for example, five terms (e.g., A, B, C, D, and E). Each term is a group of one or more characters (e.g., alphabets). In some implementations, a term can be a punctuation mark or a boundary marker. Each term can be encoded in an encoding scheme that is different from an encoding scheme of another term. Each term can be in a language that is different from the language of another term.
- the text 402 can be associated with an identifier indicating which term in text 402 is to be spell checked. In the absence of the indicator, as in the case of the example of FIG. 4 , each of the terms A, B, C, D, and E would be spell checked.
- the context builder 302 provides five segments of the text 402 to the customizable spell checker 120 for spell checking Each segment corresponds to a term in text 402 .
- a text segment 404 includes term A for spell checking, and terms B and C as context.
- a text segment 406 includes term B for spell checking, and terms A, C, and D as context.
- Text segments 408 , 410 , and 412 each includes term C, D, or E, respectively, for spell checking
- Each of the terms C, D, and E is accompanied by respective contexts.
- the customizable spell checker 120 performs the spell check for each of the terms A, B, C, D, and E of the text 402 .
- the customizable spell checker 120 can automatically detect a language of each term based on the encoding scheme of the term, or based on spelling of the term and the context. For example, when all the terms are encoded in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) scheme, the customizable spell checker 120 can designate a term “bien” as possibly misspelled, when the term follows a context “I have.” The customizable spell checker 120 can designate the same term as correctly spelled, when the term follows a context “Je vais.”

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for server-based spell check. One aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods performed by a user device. The methods include the actions of receiving user input text; identifying a candidate term for spelling correction from the received text, the candidate term including a term designated as a misspelled term by a local spell checker, the local spell checker executing on the user device; sending the candidate term to a remote spell checker, the remote spell checker executing on a server that is connected to the user device through a communications network; receiving, from the remote spell checker, a spelling correction suggestion for the candidate term; and providing the spelling correction suggestion for display on the user device.
Description
- This specification relates to spell checking text.
- A spell checker aims to flag textual terms that may be spelled incorrectly. A conventional spell checker generally includes a dictionary and routines for comparing input text with terms in the dictionary. When a match between the input text and the terms in the dictionary cannot be found, the spell checker can flag the input text, and may provide a spelling suggestion. The dictionary is typically stored at a user device, for example, on a memory device that is part of a personal computer, smart phone, or tablet computer, and the spell check is performed locally at the user device.
- A search query spell checker can perform spell checking remotely. When a user enters text as a search query at a user device, a query spell checker located remotely from the user device, e.g., one co-located with, or implemented as part of, a search engine, can spell check the user-entered text. A query spell checker can be based on an n-gram language model and a noisy channel model. The language model and noisy channel model can be generated from a collection of anonymized user queries received over time. Based on the language model and the noisy channel model, the query spell checker can perform a spell check on the search query, which typically contains no more than five or six words. The query spell checker can provide spelling suggestions resulting from the spell check to the user device for display in a response to the search query, in the form of query suggestions, for example.
- This specification describes technologies relating to text spell checking performed by a server remote from user device.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods performed by a server. The methods include the actions of receiving a request to spell check text; dividing the text into multiple segments, each segment including no more than a predetermined number of terms; providing each segment to a spell checker programmed to spell check an input including no more than the predetermined number of terms; receiving, from the spell checker, one or more spelling correction suggestions, each spelling correction suggestion corresponding to a term in a segment, the term being designated as misspelled by the spell checker; and assembling the received one or more spelling correction suggestions into a response to the request to spell check the text. Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods performed by a user device. The methods include the actions of receiving user input text; identifying a candidate term for spelling correction from the received text, the candidate term including a term designated as a misspelled term by a local spell checker, the local spell checker executing on the user device; sending the candidate term to a remote spell checker, the remote spell checker executing on a server that is connected to the user device through a communications network; receiving, from the remote spell checker, a spelling correction suggestion for the candidate term; and providing the spelling correction suggestion for display on the user device.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Spell checking can be performed based on a fixed dictionary as well as based on data reflecting customary and popular usage. Popular usage of a word can change frequently. The techniques described in this specification allow a spell checker to dynamically adapt to changes in how people spell or use a word.
- Spell checking can be performed on text in multiple languages, for example, on a sentence or phrase that contains both English and Spanish words.
- Spell checking a term can be performed based on a context of the term, in addition to the term itself. In some implementations, a system can use words before or after a term to determine whether a word is correctly spelled. For example, when spell checking a term “Lear,” a system can designate the term as correctly spelled when the term appears in “King Lear,” but designate the term as incorrectly spelled when the term appears in “Princess Lear.” In the latter case, the system can provide a term “Leia” as a spelling correction suggestion.
- Spell checking can be customized automatically. The system can record user-specific terms (e.g., a name in a user's contact list) if the user opts into the system and allows the system to use the user's personal information to spell check the user's text. The system can then, without requiring the user to add the term to a customized dictionary, avoid flagging the user-specific term (e.g., a last name “Teh” in the contact list) as misspelled.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example system for server-based spell checking The system can include auser device 102 and aserver 104. Theuser device 102 andserver 104 can interact over adata communications network 105. - The
user device 102 can be any kind of personal computing device, e.g., a personal computer, smart phone, or tablet computer. Theuser device 102 is programmed to perform a two-tiered spell checking on text input, first locally, then remotely. Theuser device 102 includes alocal text editor 106 and alocal spell checker 108. Thetext editor 106 is an application program configured to receive text input from a text edit area. Thetext editor 106 is configured to provide the received text input to thelocal spell checker 108 for spell checking. - The
local spell checker 108 includes a program module that spell checks the text input using a local dictionary. When thelocal spell checker 108 identifies, based on the local dictionary, aterm 110 in the input text that appears to be spelled incorrectly, thelocal spell checker 108 sends a notification to thetext editor 106. Upon receiving the notification, thetext editor 106 can mark theterm 110 in the text edit area, for example, by highlighting, underlining, or changing a display color of the term, to indicate it may be misspelled. - The
text editor 106 can automatically determine that theterm 110 requires further spell checking, or receive user input (e.g., a mouse click on the marked term 110) that indicates the term needs further spell checking. Upon the automatic determination or upon receiving the input, thetext editor 106 sends, in a request, theterm 110 to theserver 104 through thecommunications network 105 using a client-side spell check interface (CSCI) 112. The CSCI 112 is a software program that operates in communication with thetext editor 106 and that is programmed to perform text selection operations and communication operations. Examples of the CSCI 112 include stand-alone programs, plugins to a word processing application program, or a JavaScript™ component that executes in a browser that renders a text editing box. The text selection operations include selecting additional text to send to theserver 104 to provide a context for theterm 110. The communication operations include sending therequest including term 110 and the additional text to theserver 104 and processing information returned from theserver 104 in response to the request. - The
server 104 includes one or more computers programmed to perform functions of server-based spell checking Theserver 104 can receive from theuser device 102 text having one or more terms. Theserver 104 is programmed to divide the text into multiple segments, if the text includes more than one term. Theserver 104 can perform spell check on a segment that includesterm 110. - The
server 104 includes a server-side spell check interface (SSCI) 114. The SSCI 114 is a software component of theserver 104 programmed to communicate with the CSCI 112 ofuser device 102 throughcommunications network 105. TheSSCI 114 is programmed to perform operations of receiving theterm 110, and optional text in addition to theterm 110, if any, from theuser device 102. In addition, theSSCI 114 is programmed to perform operations of providingspelling correction suggestions 116 to theuser device 102 in response to the request from theCSCI 112. - Upon receiving the
term 110 and the optional text, if any, theSSCI 114 provides theterm 110 and optional text to acustomizable spell checker 120. Thecustomizable spell checker 120 includes a spell checking program that is configured to spell check a term without context or a term in a context. The context of a term can be several terms before or after the term. A software component executing on theserver 104 can divide long text into short segments, each short segment including a term to be spell checked and a context of that term. Further details on the techniques of dividing text into segments are described below in reference toFIG. 3 andFIG. 4 . - The
customizable spell checker 120 is configured to perform the spell check using a noisy channel model and a language model. Amodel builder 130 generates the noisy channel model and the language model used by thecustomizable spell checker 120. - The
customizable spell checker 120 generates one or morespelling correction suggestions 116 for a term using the noisy channel model, the language model, and, if a context is provided, the context. Each of thespelling correction suggestions 116 can be associated with a confidence score. Theserver 104 then sends the one or morespelling correction suggestions 116, and associating confidence scores, if any, to theCSCI 112 of theuser device 102 through thecommunication network 105. Upon receiving the one or morespelling correction suggestions 116, theuser device 102 can display the one or morespelling correction suggestions 116 in thetext editor 106, in proximity to theterm 110. - The
text editor 106 can display both spelling correction suggestions from thelocal spell checker 108 andspelling correction suggestions 116 from theserver 104 in an integrated suggestion list. Accordingly, a possibly misspelled term can be spell-checked in both a prescriptive manner (by using the local dictionary of local spell checker 108) and in a descriptive manner (by using data reflecting current common usage captured by the language model builder 130). -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating anexample user device 102 configured for server-based spell checking Theuser device 102 includestext editor 106. Thetext editor 106 is configured to provide for display atext editing area 202. Thetext editing area 202 can be a text box rendered by a web browser or a text editing window of a word processing program. Thetext editor 106 receives user input text, for example, “Where Elph, the sacred river, ran<cr>Through caverns measureless to man<cr>Down to a sunless sea.” The notation “<cr>” represents a line break character. - A
local spell checker 108, automatically or upon receiving a user request to spell check the input text, performs a local spell check on the input text using alocal dictionary 204. Thelocal dictionary 204 can include a pre-determined collection of common misspelled terms and their correct spelling forms. Thelocal spell checker 108 determines that a term in the input text, e.g., “Elph,” is not a correctly spelled term in thelocal dictionary 204. Thelocal spell checker 108 determines, based on thelocal dictionary 204, one or more spelling correction suggestions for the received term. For example, thelocal spell checker 108 can determine that the spelling correction suggestions for the term “Elph” are terms “Alpha,” “Delphi,” or “Echo.” Thelocal dictionary 204 provides an indication to thetext editor 106 that a term (“Elph”) may be misspelled, and provides the spelling correction suggestions to thetext editor 106. Based on the indication, theCSCI 112 oftext editor 106 designates the term “Elph” as a candidate term for further spell checking by a server. - The
CSCI 112 can operate in various modes. In some implementations, theCSCI 112 oftext editor 106 can send the candidate term (e.g., “Elph”) alone to a remote spell checking server without additional text. In some implementations, theSCSI 112 oftext editor 106 can send the candidate term to the remote spell checking server with additional text. In either case, theSCSI 112 oftext editor 106 can send an identifier to the remote spell checking server identifying which term is the candidate term to be spell checked. In some implementations, thetext editor 106 provides a block of text (e.g., all text in the text editing area 202) to the remote spell checking server, without identifying a candidate term. In these cases, each term in the block of text can be spell checked. - When the
CSCI 112 identifies the candidate term to be spell checked, theCSCI 112 can send the candidate term to the spell checking server automatically or upon user request. In the former case, theCSCI 112 of thetext editor 106 can send the candidate term (e.g., “Elph”) to the spell checking server upon receiving an indication from thelocal spell checker 108 that the term may be misspelled. In the latter case, theCSCI 112 can mark the term (e.g., using a pre-specified font type, style, or color) for user attention upon receiving an indication from thelocal spell checker 108 that the term may be misspelled. TheCSCI 112 can make the term interactive, e.g., operable to receive a user input indicating a request for further spell check. TheCSCI 112 provides the candidate term to the remote spell checking server for spell checking upon receiving the user input. - When the
CSCI 112 of thetext editor 106 sends additional text with the candidate term, theCSCI 112 can automatically select text from thetext editing area 202. TheCSCI 112 can select text around the candidate term within natural breaks (e.g., text “Where Elph”), an n term string that includes the candidate term (e.g., text “Where Elph, the sacred river,” when n=5), a line of text in which the term “Elph” is located (e.g., text “Where Elph, the sacred river, ran”), a full sentence, or all text currently in thetext editing area 202. - The
CSCI 112 provides text to the remote server and receives a spelling correction suggestion, for example, “Alph.” The spelling correction suggestion received from the remote server may not be a common term as stored inlocal dictionary 204; the term may be a term commonly used in the context of the additional text. Thetext editor 106 can combine the spelling correction suggestion received from the remote server with the terms received from the local spell checker 108 (“Alpha,” “Delphi,” and “Echo”) to form a combined list ofspelling correction suggestions 206. Thetext editor 106 can provide the combined list ofspelling correction suggestions 206 for display in thetext editing area 202, in proximity to the candidate term for a user to select a term with which to replace the candidate term. - When the spelling correction suggestion received from the remote server is associated with a confidence score, relative positions of the spelling correction suggestion and the terms received from the local spell checker can be determined based on the confidence score. For example, if the confidence score satisfies a threshold, the spelling correction suggestion can be displayed at the top of the combined list.
- In some implementations, the
text editor 106 is configured to optimize the use of remote spell checking by using alocal cache 208. Thelocal cache 208 is a memory in which thetext editor 106 stores a portion of the text being edited, or an index to a portion of the text being edited. The portion of the text being edited includes text that has already been remotely spell checked by the server. Accordingly, thetext editor 106 can be configured to send only text outside of thelocal cache 208 to be remotely spell checked by the server, thus saving network bandwidth and server processing resources. After a section of text has been remotely spell checked, thetext editor 106 can add the section or an index to the section to thelocal cache 208. Likewise, if a section of text stored or indexed inlocal cache 208 is further edited after being remotely spell checked, thetext editor 106 can remove the section of text or the index from thelocal cache 208. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating anexample server 104 for server-based spell checking Theserver 104 includesSSCI 114 configured to receive text from a user device for spell checking The text can include one or more terms. The text can be accompanied by an identifier indicating a specific term in the one or more terms to be spell checked. - The
server 104 includes acontext builder 302. Thecontext builder 302 is a software component of theserver 104 that is configured to communicate with theSSCI 114 and acustomizable spell checker 120. Thecontext builder 302 includes instructions configured to cause theserver 104 to create a context for spell checking a term among the one or more terms received by theSSCI 114, and provide the term and context to thecustomizable spell checker 120 for spell checking. - In some implementations, the
SSCI 114 receives text that includes multiple terms to be spell checked, and no identifier indicating which term to be spell checked. For example, theSSCI 114 can receive a sentence or a paragraph that includes multiple words. Thecontext builder 302 can be configured to cause thecustomizable spell checker 120 to spell check each term in the text. The context build 302 can build a context for each of the terms. Thecontext builder 302 divides the text into multiple segments, each segment including a term and a context of the term. The size of each segment can be optimized based on characteristics of thecustomizable spell checker 120. Thecontext builder 302 can then send the segments to thecustomizable spell checker 120 for serial or parallel spell checking. - The
customizable spell checker 120 is a spell checker optimized for performing spell checking on a text segment that includes no more than a pre-specified number of terms (e.g., ten terms). Thecustomizable spell checker 120 can be a spell checker optimized for spell checking a large number of inputs each of which is short (e.g., fewer than 10 terms) using a noisy channel model and a language model. Examples of spell checkers that can be used as thecustomizable spell checker 120 include spell checkers based on technologies described in Cucerzan et al., Spelling Correction as an Iterative Process That Exploits the Collective Knowledge of Web Users, June 2004, and Ahmad et al., Learning a Spelling Error Model from Search Query Logs, November 2005. - A
model builder 130 includes a system configured to generate a genericnoisy channel model 304 and ageneric language model 306 based ondocument data 308.Document data 308 can include data of multiple web documents, including user input text. The web document can include web pages, anonymized text submitted for spell check, or both. Themodel builder 130 can generate the noisy channel model and language model using a publicly available language model toolkit (e.g., RandLM or the CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling Toolkit). Themodel builder 130 can generate the genericnoisy channel model 304 andgeneric language model 306 dynamically or repeatedly to capture new spellings and usage of terms. - In some implementations, the
model builder 130 can build an overlaynoisy channel model 310 over the genericnoisy channel model 304, and anoverlay language model 312 in addition to thegeneric language model 306, for use by thecustomizable spell checker 120. Themodel builder 130 can build the overlaynoisy channel 310 and theoverlay language model 312 usinguser data 314 that are specific to a user, when the user gives permission to use theuser data 314 to spell check the user's text. The user information can include, for example, an identifier of a user using the user device that sent a term for spell checking The overlaynoisy channel model 310 and theoverlay language model 312 can be custom built for the user. The overlaynoisy channel model 310 and theoverlay language model 312 can reflect, for example, terms that the user frequently uses. Even though the terms are spelled correctly under circumstances specific to the user, these terms are often treated as misspelled by a generic spell checker. - When the
customizable spell checker 120 receives one or more segments of text fromcontext builder 302, thecustomizable spell checker 120 performs spell checking on a term in each of the one or more segments using thenoisy channel model 304, overlaynoisy channel model 310,general language model 306, andoverlay language model 312. Thecustomizable spell checker 120 can send results of spell checking for each segment to anassembler 316. Theassembler 316 is a software component of theserver 104. Theassembler 316 is coupled with thecustomizable spell checker 120 and theSSCI 114. Theassembler 316 is configured to assemble the results of spell checking for each segment into a response to a request for spell checking text from the user device. - The
assembler 316 is additionally configured to determine correct capitalization of the assembled response. Determining the correct capitalization of the assembled response can include applying a generictruecasing language model 320 to the assembled result. The generictruecasing language model 320 can be a language model generated by themodel builder 130 or generated by another mechanism based ondocument data 308. The generictruecasing language model 320 can include indicators of estimated likelihood of capitalization on text being correct. In some implementations, determining the correct capitalization of the assembled response can include applying an overlaytruecasing language model 322 to the assembled result. The overlaytruecasing language model 322 can be generated based onuser data 314. By applying the overlaytruecasing language model 322, theassembler 316 can determine the correct capitalization based on user-specific preference or habit. Theassembler 316 can send the assembled and truecased response to theSSCI 114, which then provides the response to an application program of a user device. -
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating example segmenting techniques of server-based spell checking A context builder 302 (in reference toFIG. 3 ) receives text 402 for spell checking Thecontext builder 302 identifies one or more terms from the received text, and provides a context for each of the one or more terms. Each context includes not more than a pre-specified number of terms. Thecontext builder 302 designates the identified term and the context as a segment of the text. Thecontext builder 302 sends each segment to acustomizable spell checker 120 for spell checking The pre-specified number can be configurable to optimize the performance of thecustomizable spell checker 120. For example, the pre-specified number can be four, such that the each segment includes no more than five terms. Thecustomizable spell checker 120 performs spell checking on one term of the five terms. - If the received text includes a single term, the
context builder 302 sends one segment tocustomizable spell checker 120 for spell checking The segment includes the single term to be spell checked and an empty context. - If the received text includes multiple terms and is associated with an identifier of a term, the
context builder 302 can generate a segment that includes the identified term and a number of terms before and after the term, up to the pre-specified number or to a boundary. The boundary includes one or more signals in the text designated as separators. A boundary can be, for example, a beginning of a sentence, an end of sentence, a line break character, or a punctuation mark. The context of a term to be spell checked need not include a term across a boundary from the term to be spell checked. - If the received text includes multiple terms and is not associated with an identifier, the
context builder 302 can identify each term in the text as a term to be spell checked. Thecontext builder 302 can generate multiple segments. Each segment can include a term and a number of terms before and after the term, up to the pre-specified number or to a boundary. The context builder can generate the segments by applying a sliding window to the text. The sliding window can have a size corresponding to the pre-specified number. For example, if the number is four, the sliding window can have a size of five terms. - In this example, the text 402 is a sequence of, for example, five terms (e.g., A, B, C, D, and E). Each term is a group of one or more characters (e.g., alphabets). In some implementations, a term can be a punctuation mark or a boundary marker. Each term can be encoded in an encoding scheme that is different from an encoding scheme of another term. Each term can be in a language that is different from the language of another term. The text 402 can be associated with an identifier indicating which term in text 402 is to be spell checked. In the absence of the indicator, as in the case of the example of
FIG. 4 , each of the terms A, B, C, D, and E would be spell checked. - In the example shown in
FIG. 4 , thecontext builder 302 provides five segments of the text 402 to thecustomizable spell checker 120 for spell checking Each segment corresponds to a term in text 402. For example, a text segment 404 includes term A for spell checking, and terms B and C as context. A text segment 406 includes term B for spell checking, and terms A, C, and D as context.Text segments 408, 410, and 412 each includes term C, D, or E, respectively, for spell checking Each of the terms C, D, and E is accompanied by respective contexts. - The
customizable spell checker 120 performs the spell check for each of the terms A, B, C, D, and E of the text 402. Thecustomizable spell checker 120 can automatically detect a language of each term based on the encoding scheme of the term, or based on spelling of the term and the context. For example, when all the terms are encoded in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) scheme, thecustomizable spell checker 120 can designate a term “bien” as possibly misspelled, when the term follows a context “I have.” Thecustomizable spell checker 120 can designate the same term as correctly spelled, when the term follows a context “Je vais.” -
FIG. 5A-5C are illustrations of example user interfaces of user-side application programs for server-based spell checking.FIG. 5A illustrates anexample user interface 500 provided in some implementations of server-based spell checking Theuser interface 500 displays, on a user device, atext editor 106 that includes atext editing area 202. A user device receives, from a user, an example text input in thetext editing area 202. The text input can be a rich text string. The rich text string includes text and formatting information (e.g., font or color) of the text. In the example shown, the text is “According to Andrew Neil's essay Britannia Ruuse the Waves, the British merchant fleet no longer dominates the high seas.” Upon receiving the text input, thetext editor 106 sends the string to a local spell checker, which can execute on the user device. The local spell checker determines that the term “Ruuse” may be misspelled. Based on similarity of the term “Ruuse” to words in a dictionary, the local spell checker mark the term “Ruuse” with a distinctive highlight, e.g., an underline or boldness. Other highlights are possible. The local spell checker can provide spelling correction suggestions “Rules” and “Ruse” which are popular words. - The
text editor 106 receives a user input, which includes a selection of the highlighted term “Ruuse” by acursor 502. Upon receiving the user input, thetext editor 106 sends the term, as well as additional text, to a server for remote spell checking Thetext editor 106 receives a spelling correction suggestion “Rues,” which is determined by the server based on a context (e.g., “essay Britannia”). Thetext editor 106 can present the spelling correction suggestion “Rues” received from the server in addition to the local spelling correction suggestions “Rules” and “Ruse” in asuggestion box 504 as options. Upon receiving a user selection of a suggestion, thetext editor 106 can replace the term “Ruuse” with the selected term. -
FIG. 5B illustrates anexample user interface 510 provided in some implementations of server-based spell checking Theuser interface 510 displays, on a user device, atext editor 106 that includes atext editing area 202. Thetext editor 106 receives input text, for example, “I can correctly spell greetings in many languages: welcom, bienvenu, wilkommen, benvento.” Thetext editor 106 can automatically send the input text to a server for remote spell checking Before receiving and response from the server, thetext editor 106 can continue receiving user inputs. In some implementations, thetext editor 106 can optionally display atimer 512 indicating that thetext editor 106 is waiting for a server response. -
FIG. 5C illustratesexample user interface 510 when an application of a user device receives a response from a server. The response can include atext string 514 in which the server automatically replaces terms regarded as misspelled with spelling correction suggestions. The spelling correction suggestion for each replaced term can be in a language of the term replaced. The spelling correction suggestions can be marked (e.g., underlined) to indicate that these suggestions differ from the terms in the input text as entered by the user. Theuser interface 510 is operable to receive a user input on a marked spelling correction suggestion, and accept or reject the spelling correction suggestion based on the user input. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating anexample process 600 performed by a software component of a server for server-based spell checking The server can include theserver 104 as described above. - The software component of the server receives (602) a request to spell check text. The software component can receive the request from an application executing on a user device. The user device can include the
user device 102 as described above. - The software component divides (604) the text into multiple segments. Each segment includes no more than a predetermined number of terms. Dividing the text can include dividing the text into one or more sentences, and dividing each sentence into one or more segments. A segment can partially or completely overlap with another segment. Additional details on operations of dividing the text into multiple segments are described above in reference to
FIG. 4 . - The software component provides (606) each of the segments to a spell checker. The spell checker is programmed to spell check an input including no more than the predetermined number of terms.
- The software component receives (608), from the spell checker, one or more spelling correction suggestions. Each spelling correction suggestion corresponds to a term in a segment. The term is a term being designated as misspelled by the spell checker. In some implementations, the server can receive, from the spell checker, a dirty word indicator indicating the term includes a word that is a pornographic, obscene, or offensive word.
- The software component can process a multilingual text string. When the text includes a first term in a first language and a second term in a second language, the software component can receive a first spelling correction suggestion for the first term and a second spelling correction suggestion for the second term. The first spelling correction suggestion can be in the first language. The second spelling correction suggestion can be in the second language.
- The software component assembles (610) the received one or more spelling correction suggestions into a response to the request to spell check the text. The software component can send the response to the user device from which the request is received. The response to the request to spell correct the text can include a first spelling correction suggestion in a first language and a second spelling correction suggestion being in a second language. In some implementations, assembling the received one or more spelling correction suggestions includes truecasing the one or more spelling correction suggestions based on a truecasing language model. In some implementations, assembling the received one or more spelling correction suggestions into a response includes associating a dirty word indicator with the term in the response.
- In some implementations, the
process 600 can include generating a language model from a collection of documents, and configuring the spell checker using the language model. Generating the language model from a collection of documents can include generating a generic language model and generating an overlay language model. The server can generate the overlay language model using information specific to a user (e.g., the user's emails, blogs, and contact list). The server can collect the user specific information if the user provides consent to use personal information for spell checks. In some implementations, theprocess 600 can include generating a noisy channel model from a collection of documents and configuring the spell checker using the noisy channel model. -
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating anexample process 700 performed by a software component of a user device for server-based spell checking The user device can include theuser device 102 as described above. - The software component can receive (702) text. The text can be user input text. Receiving the text can include receiving the text in a text editing window of a browser executing on the user device.
- The software component can identify (704) a candidate term for spelling checking from the received text. The candidate term includes a term designated as a misspelled term by a local spell checker. The local spell checker can be an application program executing on the user device.
- The software component sends (706) the candidate term to a remote spell checker. The remote spell checker executes on a server that is connected to the user device through a communications network. The server can include
server 104 as described above. - In some implementations, sending the candidate term to the remote spell checker can be done automatically when the local spell checker identifies the candidate term. In some implementations, sending the candidate term to the remote spell checker can be done upon receiving a user input. The user device can provide for display an indicator indicating that the candidate term is designated as a misspelled term. The indicator can be an interactive user interface element configured to receive a user input selecting the candidate term. The user device can receive, through the interactive user interface element, a user input selecting the candidate term. The user device can then send the selected candidate term to the remote spell checker in response to the user input.
- In some implementations, the software component can send all text in the text editing window to the remote spell checker as addition information for spell checking the candidate term. In some implementations, the software component can send a neighboring term to the remote spell checker as addition information of the candidate term to the remote spell checker as addition information for spell checking the candidate term. The neighboring term can be a term located within a pre-specified threshold distance to the candidate term in the text. The distance can be a distance measured in number of terms. In some implementations, the user device can from the text a sentence in which the candidate term appears, and send the sentence to the remote spell checker as addition information for spell checking the candidate term.
- The software component receives (708), from the remote spell checker, a response. The response includes a spelling correction suggestion for the candidate term. In some implementations, the response can include a dirty word indicator indicating that the candidate term may include a pornographic, obscene, or offensive word.
- The software component provides (710) the spelling correction suggestion for display on the user device. For example, the spelling correction suggestion can be displayed at a location proximate to (e.g., next to or at least partially overlapping) a location of the candidate term in the text editing window from which the text is received. Providing the spelling correction suggestion for display can include providing the spelling correction suggestion in a rich text format such that the spelling correction suggestion is interactive.
- In some implementations,
process 700 includes storing a state of the text. The state corresponds to a portion of the text, and indicates that the portion of the text has been spell checked by the remote spell checker. The user device can store, in a local storage device, the candidate term and the spelling correction suggestion. Additionally, if the remote spell checker associated a dirty word indicator with the candidate term, the user device can store in the local storage device the dirty word indicator. Identifying the candidate term can include determined that the term designated as a misspelled term is not stored in a local storage device that stores terms previous spelling checked and their corresponding spelling correction suggestions. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
