Definitions
- This document relates to augmented reality applications.
- Augmented reality applications allow a user to see a presentation of the world augmented with or superimposed by computer-generated imagery.
- the imagery may be graphical or textual.
- the presented world may be presented directly to the user, such as when the user is looking through a display, and the imagery is applied to or projected on the display.
- the world may also be presented indirectly, such as when a user is navigating previously captured images of the real world, rather than the world that is presently in front of the user.
- Augmented reality is now being implemented on mobile computing devices that include digital cameras.
- the view that is currently being captured by the camera can be displayed as a scene on a screen of the mobile device, and data about items that are shown in the scene may have textual annotations added to them.
- Non-visible objects may also be represented by annotations.
- a user in a city may hold their smartphone in front of them and may be shown the names of restaurants around them, in the compass direction at which they are currently aiming the camera of their phone.
- the information may change as a user spins, so that only restaurants that are in front of the user/device are shown at any time.
- it can be difficult to determine precisely where the user is aiming their device because the camera may simultaneously show multiple items, such as buildings, particularly when the items are at different distances from the user, and thus overlap within the device's field of view.
- This document discusses systems and techniques to indicate uncertainty to a user of an augmented reality application.
- a system may have trouble determining precisely which object the user is directing his or her attention to. It may also be difficult to determine exactly where the user is looking if the position-gathering sensors on the device are imprecise. For example, there may be several feet of uncertainty regarding a user's geographical location when GPS is used to identify the location, and there may be much more uncertainty when Cell ID triangulation and other access point location determination methods are used. Likewise, there may be uncertainty of several degrees regarding a compass direction of the device, and a level of tilt of the device (i.e., is the user looking high in the air or lower down).
- the techniques described here may make a determination of the zone that is created when such uncertainties combine so as to prevent the system from knowing exactly where the user is focusing, and the system may generate a visual indicator for presentation to the user so that the user knows how uncertain the system is about the user's intent.
- the indicator may, for example, be a circle that is centered over the calculated point of interest, and the size of the circle may encompass the other areas that the system have determined could be the user's focus.
- the system may layer, on top of this determination of combined measurement error in the system, certain inferences about the user's intended focus point. For example, each of the items that is within the zone of uncertainty can be reviewed and its importance to the user can be determined to decide whether the user's focus is likely to be on that item. For example, if a user frequently searches for coffee shops when traveling, that information can be used to infer that, if a particular coffee shop is within the zone of uncertainty, then the use is likely to be most interested in the item that corresponds to the coffee shop.
- Similar inferences can be made with respect to general popularity of certain items, e.g., coffee shops can be given a higher weight than are tobacco shops, if it turns out that “coffee shops” is a search term that is used with a search engine much more frequently than the term “tobacco shops.”
- Such an implied point of interest may be displayed to the user so that they can select an icon and immediately be shown that point of interest in preference to others that might otherwise be displayed on the augmented reality application.
- the zone of uncertainty could be represented by a blue circle while the inferred interest may be shown by a red dot or small circle that is within the blue circle.
- a computer-implemented augmented reality method comprises obtaining electronic information that indicates a location and direction of aim of a user in a virtual space of an augmented reality application running on a computing device; determining, with one or more computer processors, factors that represent potential uncertainty in the obtained electronic information; generating from the factors a combined level of uncertainty for a focus of the user, the focus representing an item within the user's field of view in the augmented reality application at which the user is directing attention; generating data for making a graphical indication of the level of uncertainty; and providing the data for making the graphical indication of the level of uncertainty for display as an overlay over an image of the field of view in the augmented reality application.
- the obtained electronic information can include global positioning system data generated by the computing device, and the information that indicates a direction of aim comprises information from a compass and accelerometer on the computing device.
- the obtained electronic information can also include data from a wireless access point location determination system, and generating data for making a graphical indication comprises generating data for making a visible computer icon whose size reflects the combined level of uncertainty, wherein a larger icon represents a higher level of uncertainty.
- the size of the icon can be generated so that the icon overlaps with items in the user's field of view that are determined to be the potential focus of the viewer, based on the generated combined level of uncertainty.
- generating data for making a graphical indication comprises generating data to produce one or more user-selectable icons, wherein each icon is displayed over an item in the user's field of view that is within an area defined by the combined level of uncertainty.
- a tangible, non-transient recordable storage media has recorded thereon instructions, that when executed, perform actions that comprise determining a location and direction of aim of a user in a virtual space of an augmented reality application running on a computing device; obtaining uncertainty data that has been generated by (a) determining, with one or more computer processors, factors that represent potential uncertainty in the obtained electronic information, (b) generating from the factors a combined level of uncertainty for a focus of the user, the focus representing an item within the user's field of view in the augmented reality application at which the user is directing attention, and (c) generating the uncertainty data for making a graphical indication of the level of uncertainty; and using the uncertainty data to make a graphical indication on a display of the computing device, of the level of uncertainty as an overlay over an image of the field of view in the augmented reality application.
- a computer-implemented augmented reality system comprises one or more position sensors for identifying information that reflects a physical position in space of a computing device, a positional uncertainty computation module programmed to determine a degree of uncertainty regarding a focus point of the computing device in an augmented reality application and to generated data to visually communicate the degree of uncertainty, and an augmented reality application on the computing device programmed to display one or more icons overlaid on a virtual space, wherein the one or more icons visually represent the degree of uncertainty.
- the one or more position sensors can comprise a global positioning system (GPS) sensor and a compass.
- GPS global positioning system
- the degree of uncertainty can be a combination of error values for each of the one or more position sensors, and can represent an area of an augmented reality application display within which a user's focus cannot be determined.
- the obtained electronic information can include data from a wireless access point location determination system.
- the positional uncertainty computation module can further be programmed to generate data for making a visible computer icon whose size reflects the degree of uncertainty, wherein a larger icon represents a higher degree of uncertainty.
- the size of the icon is generated so that the icon overlaps with items in the user's field of view that are determined to be the potential focus of the viewer, based on the generated combined level of uncertainty.
- the positional uncertainty computation module can be further programmed to generate data to produce one or more user-selectable icons, wherein each icon is displayed over an item in the user's field of view that is within an area defined by the degree of uncertainty.

- the remote computing device returns the identified information to the mobile device 102 .
- the mobile device displays the icon 106 . In this example, the user selects the icon 106 , causing information about the deli to be displayed.
- the information may include the name of the deli, a phone number, an address, a link to a landing page (e.g., a webpage for the deli), a menu for the deli, operating hours, customer reviews, news articles, or a listing of web search results.
- selecting the icon 106 causes a map to be displayed on the display screen 103 .
- the map may indicate the current location of the mobile device 102 and the location of the building 104 A.
- uncertainty associated with the placement of the icon 106 is due to uncertainty associated with some or all of the positional information determined by the mobile device 102 .
- transmission tower triangulation is used to determine a geographic location for the mobile device 102 , the results may be less accurate than if GPS signals are used to determine the location of the mobile device 102 .
- transmission tower triangulation is used if the mobile device 102 is not GPS capable, or if the mobile device 102 is located in a dense urban environment and unable to receive GPS signals from satellites.

- a position determination made using transmission tower triangulation is determined by a wireless access point location determination system.
- transmission tower triangulation may only be able to identify the location of the mobile device 102 to within 3,000 feet, whereas a GPS unit may be able to identify the location of the mobile device 102 to within 10 feet or less.
- directional information as determined by a compass of the mobile device 102 may be imprecise.
- an accelerometer of the mobile device 102 may be able to determine the vertical viewing angle of the mobile device 102 to within 10 degrees, but cannot determine the precise vertical viewing angle.
- uncertainty associated with positional information for the mobile device 102 is represented visually on the display screen 103 .
- the building 104 A is identified as being within the viewing scope of the mobile device 102 .
- the icon 106 is placed at the center of an area at which the image 1048 of the building 104 A is believed to be located on the display screen 103 .
- a bounding shape 108 is displayed on the display screen 103 to indicate areas on the display screen 103 that depict locations for which the information associated with the icon 106 may actually relate to.
- information associated with the icon 106 may relate to any of the locations on the display screen 103 that fall within the bounding shape 108 .
- a building 116 A is located next to the building 104 A.
- a user of the mobile device 102 performs a search for a hair salon.
- the mobile device 102 or a remote computing device identifies information associated with a hair salon located in the building 116 A. Due to uncertainty of the location of the mobile device 102 , the icon 106 is positioned over the image 1048 of the building 104 A rather than over an image 1168 of the building 116 A. However, because of the uncertainty associated with the location of the mobile device 102 , the bounding shape 108 is displayed around the icon 106 to indicate that the salon may be located within any of the areas encompassed by the bounding shape 108 . In the example depicted, the ring covers portions the image 116 B. This indicates that the salon may be located within the building 116 A.
- the size of the bounding shape 108 reflects a degree of uncertainty associated with positional information determined by the mobile device 102 .
- the mobile device 102 may contain a highly accurate GPS unit.
- the bounding shape 108 will be very small or non-existent in order to indicate that current location information for the mobile device 102 is highly accurate.
- the GPS unit may be blocked from receiving satellite GPS signals, causing the mobile device 102 to resort to using transmission tower triangulation in order to determine the location of the mobile device 102 . This causes the bounding shape 108 to appear larger on the display screen 103 since there is a greater degree of uncertainty associated with location information determined using transmission tower triangulation than with location information determined using the GPS unit.
- the area within the bounding shape 108 is shaded or semi-transparent.
- a shape other than a circle is used to indicate a range of possible locations for the icon 106 .
- the bounding shape can take the form of a rectangle, oval, or hexagon.
- the icon 106 changes colors or shades in order to indicate a degree of uncertainty for positional information determined by the mobile device 102 .
- uncertainty associated with a position of the icon 106 is displayed as an uncertainty index. For example, a number from one to one hundred is displayed next to the icon 106 to indicate a level of uncertainty about the position of the icon 106 on the display screen 103 , with one hundred representing high certainty and one representing low certainty.
- the mobile device 102 or the remote computing device can also identify buildings or objects within images captured by the camera of the mobile device 102 and position the icon 106 based on the identification of the buildings or objects (either alone or with assistance with a remote computer system). For example, the mobile device 102 sends an image of the cityscape shown in FIG. 1 to the remote computing device.
- the remote computing device uses image recognition software or edge recognition software to determine the outlines of the buildings in the image. Based on the outlines, the remote computing device determines relative positions for the buildings depicted in the image.
- the remote computing device determines the size and shape of the bounding shape 108 based on uncertainty associated with positional data for the mobile device 102 and positions the bounding shape 108 over the image.
- the bounding shape 108 indicates locations within the image that may be associated with an identified piece of information.
- the remote computing device determines, based on the outlines, that the image 1048 of the building 104 A takes up the majority of the bounding shape 108 .
- the remote computing device determines that the icon 106 is to be placed over the image 104 B of the building 104 A. In other words, the remote computing device snaps the position of the icon to the position of the image 104 B based on the outlines of the buildings.
- the remote computing device then returns indications of the position, shape, and size of the bounding shape 108 and the position of the icon 106 to the mobile device 102 along with specific information about a location associated with the icon 106 .
- the bounding shape 108 can be depicted as an outline of one or more objects within view of the mobile device 102 .
- the outlines of the buildings 104 A and 116 A as determined by the remote computing device may be combined together in order to create one outlined area that defines the bounding shape 108 .
- an outline of the two building images 104 B and 116 B is displayed on the display screen 103 as the bounding shape 108 in order to indicate that locations associated with information associated with the icon 106 may be located in either the building 104 A or the building 116 A.
- the mobile device 102 displays the bounding shape 108 as an outline of the images 104 B and 116 B in order to indicate that an identified bakery is located in either the building 104 A or the building 116 A.
- a calculation 114 is performed to determine the shape and size of the bounding shape 108 .
- the mobile device 102 uses a degree of imprecision associated with longitude and latitude data for the mobile device 102 , a degree of imprecision associated with a compass of the mobile device 102 , and a degree of imprecision associated with an accelerometer of the mobile device 102 in order to determine the shape and size of the bounding shape 108 .
- the degree of uncertainty associated with a vertical angle measurement made by an accelerometer of the mobile device 102 is used to determine a vertical dimension of the bounding shape 108 .
- the vertical dimension of the bounding shape 108 will be relatively small, whereas, if there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the vertical angle measurement, the vertical dimension of the bounding shape 108 will be relatively large.
- the bounding shape 108 takes an oval form having a large vertical length and a shorter horizontal length.
- the calculation 114 can involve determining a cone of uncertainty for the mobile device 102 .
- the cone of uncertainty can be visualized as a cone emanating from the mobile device 102 .
- the bounding shape 108 is determined from the cone of uncertainty by taking a cross section of the cone of uncertainty at a distance from the estimated location of the mobile device 102 . For example, If the distance between the building 104 A and the estimated location of the mobile device 102 is 800 feet, the bounding shape 108 is determined by taking a vertical cross section of the cone of uncertainty at a distance of 800 feet from the mobile device 102 .
- the dimensions of the cone of uncertainty can be dependent on uncertainty associated with positional information for the mobile device 102 . For example, if a vertical angle measurement has a low degree of uncertainty and a horizontal viewing direction measurement has a high degree of uncertainty, the cone of uncertainty will have a greater width dimension than it's height dimension.
- uncertainty associated with the geographic location of the mobile device 102 affects the size of the bounding shape 108 .
- the mobile device can determine a plurality of possible locations of the mobile device 102 based on uncertainty associated with a location measurement.
- a relatively accurate location measurement made by the mobile device 102 will lead to a smaller number of possible locations for the mobile device 102 than a relatively inaccurate location measurement.
- a location measurement based on GPS signals will lead to a smaller number of possible locations for the mobile device 102 than a location measurement based on transmission tower triangulation.
- the mobile device determines a location from the plurality of possible locations that is furthest from a object, building, or location of interest.
- the mobile device 102 identifies a location from the plurality of possible locations for the mobile device 102 that is furthest from the building 104 A.
- the cone of uncertainty for the mobile device 102 is determined as emanating from the identified furthest location.
- a cross section of the cone of uncertainty is taken where the cone of uncertainty meets the object of interest (e.g. the building 104 A) in order to define the bounding shape 108 .
- the object of interest e.g. the building 104 A
- the bounding shape 108 is the further the identified furthest location is from the building 104 A. Therefore, a higher degree of uncertainty associated with a location measurement will lead to a larger bounding shape 108 than a lower degree of uncertainty.
- the bounding shape 108 can also define a zone of uncertainty.
- the zone of uncertainty indicates the mobile device 102 's degree of uncertainty with regard to an intended focus point of the user of the mobile device 102 .
- the areas of the display screen 103 that are within the bounding shape 108 are determined as being possible intended focus points for the user.

- the user may have previously searched for ATMs when using the augmented reality application.
- the mobile device 102 would list an indication of an ATM being located within the zone of uncertainty above an indication of a toy store being located within the zone of uncertainty.
- user profile information for the user indicates that the user prefers sandwiches to Chinese food.
- the mobile device 102 displays a data item associated with a deli over a data item associated with a Chinese restaurant based on the user profile information.
- general search information collected from searches performed by a broad group of people indicates that people generally search for public transit stops more often than wig stores.

- the user then changes the vertical angle of the mobile device 202 so that the camera is facing a direction that is 45 degrees above horizontal, without changing the geographic location or horizontal viewing direction of the mobile device 202 .
- the change in vertical angle can cause the augmented reality application 210 to change the position of annotations on the display screen 203 as well as change what annotations are displayed. For example, annotations associated with buildings that are no longer in view after the vertical angle of the mobile device 202 is changed can be removed from the display.

For example, a user can enter in a search string or otherwise indicate a search term of “pizza.” In some implementations, the augmented reality application 210 supplies the search string along with location and viewing direction data to the remote server 232 . The remote server then returns geo-coded data related to pizza places in relative proximity to the mobile device 202 and within the viewing direction of the mobile device 202 . In other implementations, the mobile device 202 receives a large set of geo-coded data associated with locations in relative proximity to the mobile device 202 .
- the augmented reality application 210 uses the search string to identify geo-coded data within the large set of geo-coded data that is associated with pizza places.
- the augmented reality application 210 can then generate annotations that include information about the pizza places which can be displayed on the display screen 203 .

- the mobile device 202 includes user data 228 .
- the user data 228 can include user preferences or other information associated with a user of the mobile device 202 .
- the user data 228 can include a list of contacts. Some of the contacts may be associated with addresses. If an address associated with a contact is in relative proximity to the mobile device 202 and within the viewing range of the camera, the augmented reality application 210 can provide an annotation showing information about the contact. For example, the augmented reality application 210 can create an annotation that includes the text “Dave: work” to indicate that the contact “Dave” has a work address within the viewing direction of the camera.

- a degree of uncertainty may exist with respect to values determined by the GPS unit 218 , the compass unit 216 , the accelerometer unit 214 , or the range finding module 224 .
- the GPS unit 218 may be unable to receive GPS signals from satellites.
- the mobile device 202 may use transmission tower triangulation in order to determine a present location for the mobile device 202 . Since location determinations made using transmission tower triangulation are generally less accurate than location determinations made using GPS satellite signals, a degree of uncertainty is associated with a location determination that relies on transmission tower triangulation. This can lead to uncertainty in determining what objects, buildings, or locations are actually within the viewing scope of the camera of the mobile device 202 .
- the server 232 includes a positional uncertainty computing module 236 for determining an uncertainty zone based on uncertainty associated with positional information received from the mobile device 202 .
- the uncertainty zone takes the form of a visual depiction of positional uncertainty.

- the mobile device 202 captures an image and transmits the captured image and positional information to the server 232 .
- the server 232 identifies geo-coded data items from the store of geo-coded data 234 that is associated with a building believed to be within the viewing range of the mobile device 202 based on positional information determined by the GPS unit 218 , the compass unit 216 , and the accelerometer unit 214 .
- the server 232 determines a position for an icon associated with the geo-coded data items on the display screen 203 . In some implementations, a user can select the icon in order to cause the annotation to be displayed.
- the position for the icon as determined by the server 232 is a position within the captured image that the server 232 believes corresponds to a location a building within the image that is associated with the geo-coded data items.
- the positional uncertainty computing module 236 determines a size, shape, and position of an uncertainty zone for the geo-coded data items.
- the uncertainty zone covers areas of the image in which the building associated with the geo-coded items could possibly be located, based on a determined uncertainty of the location information.
- the uncertainty zone is shaded, or semi-transparent, so that portions of the image captured by the camera are partially visible.
- the uncertainty zone can take the form of circle, rectangle, hexagon, or other shape.
- the uncertainty zone is centered around the icon. In some implementations, selecting within the uncertainty zone will cause annotations derived from the geo-coded data items to be displayed.
- the degree of uncertainty associated with a measurement affects the size of the uncertainty zone. For example, a larger degree of uncertainty associated with a location measurement made by the GPS unit 218 will cause the uncertainty zone to be larger than if the degree of uncertainty associated with the location measurement were relatively small.
- the accelerometer unit 214 is relatively more accurate than the compass unit 216 , then vertical angle measurements will have a lower degree of uncertainty than horizontal viewing direction measurements. In such instances, the positional uncertainty computing module 236 determines a height for the uncertainty zone that is smaller than the width of the uncertainty zone to reflect that the vertical viewing direction is relatively accurate, whereas the horizontal viewing direction is less accurate.
- the server 232 transmits size, shape, and position information for the uncertainty zone as determined by the positional uncertainty computing module 236 to the mobile device 202 through the network 230 along with information derived from the identified geo-coded data items.
- the mobile device 202 displays the uncertainty zone overlaid on the captured image.

- the functions of the positional uncertainty computing module 236 are performed by the augmented reality application 210 .
- FIG. 3 shows a flow chart of a process 300 for identifying uncertainty in focus of an augmented reality application.
- the process 300 is performed by a client device.
- An augmented reality program of the client device obtains positional values (e.g. location, viewing direction, etc.) and identifies a level of uncertainty associated with each of the positional values.
- the augmented reality program then determines an area that includes possible points of focus for a user of the client device. A visual representation of this area is then displayed to the user.
- Step 302 of the process 300 launches the augmented reality application.
- a user of the mobile device 102 can use touch screen functionality of the display screen 103 to scroll through a list of applications and select an augmented reality application. This causes the mobile device 102 to execute the augmented reality application.
- Step 304 obtains positional values for a mobile computing device.
- the GPS unit 218 determines latitude and longitude values for the current position of the mobile device 202
- the compass unit 216 determines a current viewing direction within the horizontal plane of the mobile device 202
- the accelerometer unit 214 determines a vertical viewing angle of the mobile device 202 .
- the range finding module 224 optionally determines the distance between the mobile device 202 and an object within the viewing scope of the mobile device 202 .
- Step 306 identifies uncertainty levels for each of the positional values. For example, referring to FIG. 2 , a level of uncertainty for the GPS unit 218 is determined based on specifications for the GPS unit 218 or on past location measurements made by the GPS unit 218 . In this example, specifications for the model of the GPS unit 218 may indicate that the GPS unit 218 is accurate to within a range of ten feet. As another example, a degree of accuracy of the accelerometer unit 214 is determined based on past vertical angle measurements made by the accelerometer unit 214 . In this example, the degree of accuracy of the accelerometer unit 214 is determined to be within a range of 5 degrees.
- uncertainty levels for measurements made by the compass unit 216 are determined based on a location of the mobile device 202 . For example, compass readings within a dense urban area may be less accurate than compass readings in an uninhabited area. A degree of uncertainty associated with a direction measurement of the compass unit 216 is determined based on known levels of uncertainty for compass readings associated with a particular geographic location. The computation of uncertainty levels for the positional values can be performed by the mobile computing device or by a remote server. In some instances, known uncertainty values associated with different positional value measuring components are retrieved from a remote database.
- Step 308 determines focus for the mobile computing device.
- the mobile device 102 or a remote computing device in communication with the mobile device 102 , determines the focus of a user of the mobile device 102 .
- Positional information such as geographic location, horizontal viewing direction, and vertical viewing angle, are used to determine a point of focus for the mobile device 202 .
- the building 104 A is identified as the point of focus.
- the mobile device 102 indicates that the building 104 A has been determined as the point of focus by displaying the icon 106 over the image 1048 of the building 104 A.
- an object or building believed to be located at or near the center of an image captured by the mobile device 102 is identified as the point of focus.
- the object or building that is believed to be located at or near the center of the image is determined using positional information.
- an object or building believed to be within the viewing direction of the mobile device 102 that is associated with geo-coded data items matching a search term indicated by the user is identified as the point of focus.
- a geo-coded data item that is deemed to be of high interest to the user and within the viewing direction of the mobile device 102 is identified and a location, object, or building associated with the geo-coded data item is identified as the point of focus.
- the geo-coded data item may be identified as being of high interest based on past searches performed by the user of the mobile device 102 , user profile data associated with the user, or general search information derived from a large number of users.
- Step 310 computes a level of uncertainty for the focus of the mobile computing device.
- the level of uncertainty for the focus is based on uncertainty levels for positional values as identified at step 306 . For example, referring to FIG. 2 , if the uncertainty level of a geographic location measurement made by the GPS unit 218 is five feet, the level of uncertainty associated with the focus will be lower than if the uncertainty level of the geographic location measurement is 1,000 feet. As another example, a high degree of uncertainty with regard to a vertical angle measurement made by the accelerometer unit 214 will lead to a high level of uncertainty with regard to a vertical position of the point of focus. As yet another example, a highly accurate direction measurement made by the compass unit 216 will lead to a low level of uncertainty for a horizontal position of the point of focus.
- Step 312 generates user interface components to show the level of uncertainty to a user of the mobile computing device.
- the mobile device 102 displays the icon 106 over the captured image to represent the identified point of focus.
- the mobile device 102 visually displays the level of uncertainty computed at step 310 using the bounding shape 108 .
- the icon 106 represents a position within the captured image that is believed to be the focus of the user of the mobile device 102 .
- the bounding shape 108 surrounds areas of the captured image that could be the focus of the user, based on uncertainty levels for each of the positional values as identified at step 306 .
- the building 104 A is believed to be the focus point of the user.
- selecting within the bounding shape 108 causes a list of data items associated with locations within the bounding shape 108 to be displayed.
- selecting the icon 106 causes a data item identified as a most relevant data item to be displayed.
- user interface components used to show the level of uncertainty to a user of the mobile computing device can take forms other than a bounding shape.
- the mobile device displays an icon over each building or object within view of the mobile device that could possibly be a point of focus for the user.
- the user selects one of the icons to indicate which object is the actual point of focus.
- the mobile devices shades portions of an image corresponding to objects or buildings that could possibly be a point of focus for the user. In such implementations, the shading for an object that has been deemed a more likely focus point can be darker than shading for an object that is deemed a less likely focus point.
- the steps of the process 300 can be performed in a different order than that shown.
- the focus of the mobile computing device can be determined before the uncertainty levels for each of the positional values is identified.
- FIG. 4 is a swim lane diagram 400 diagram showing actions performed by an example client and server for controlling the display of augmented reality items.
- Step 402 captures position information.
- the client device includes a module for determining a geographic location of the client device based on transmission tower triangulation.
- the geographic location is identified as geographic area defined by a plurality of latitude and longitude coordinates.
- the client device further includes a compass for determining a viewing direction of the mobile device within the horizontal plane and an accelerometer for determining a vertical viewing direction of the client device.

- the server can estimate a general geographic location for the client device based on the locations of the transmitters located near the client device using triangulation.
- the server may not receive any geographic location information from the client device.
- the client device may only transmit horizontal viewing direction and vertical viewing angle information to the server.
- Step 408 determines an uncertainty of a user's focus.
- the server determines a focus point or focus area of the user based on the position information.
- a degree of uncertainty is associated with determining a focus point or focus are for the user.
- server identifies two or more objects within the viewing scope of the client device as possible focus points.
- the server identifies one object as being the most likely focus point and identifies other objects as being less likely focus points.
- a focus point probability value is assigned to each object to indicate a probability that the associated object is the focus point of the user.
- the uncertainty associated with the user's focus comes from uncertainty in one or more positional measurements. For example, in implementations in which the server estimates a geographic location for the client device using the location of one or more transmitters, the determination of the location of the client device will have a greater degree of uncertainty than if a GPS unit of the client device is used to determine the location of the client device. As another example, a known degree of uncertainty for a particular type of compass included in the client device creates uncertainty in determining a user's focus.
- Step 410 gather's items for objects in the user's view.
- the server 232 accesses the geo-coded data 234 and identifies geo-coded data items that are associated with locations within the user's view, based on positional information received from the mobile device 202 .
- the server will gather only those geo-coded data items that are associated with a location or locations that have been determined to be probable focus points of the user.
- the server will identify geo-coded data items for all locations within the user's view.
- the server will identify geo-coded data items for locations within a viewing direction of the client device up to a specified distance.
- the server will generate annotations based on information contained in the geo-coded data items.
- the server will perform one or more searches (e.g. database searches, web searches) to identify additional information associated with locations within the user's view.
- Step 412 generates one or more icons that represent an uncertainty level.
- the server generates the bounding shape 108 for display on the mobile device 102 .
- the bounding shape 108 identifies an uncertainty level of the user's focus by indicating areas of the captured image that are probably focus points for the user.
- the server indicates that icons are to be displayed over the images 104 B and 116 B to indicate that the buildings 114 A and 116 A are probable focus points of the user.
- Step 414 transmits overlay information to the client.

- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram 500 of actions taken in an augmented reality system.
- a change in location occurs.
- a user of a mobile device walks down a city street, causing the position of the mobile device to change.
- the mobile device is equipped with a GPS unit that detects a change in the location of the mobile device.
- a user starts an augmented reality application on a mobile device.
- the augmented reality device uses a GPS unit or another location determination method to determine an approximate location for the mobile device. If the mobile device has moved since the last time the augmented reality application was executed, the augmented reality application determines that a change in location has occurred.
- a new focus point is computed.
- new focus point is computed in response to a change in location taking place at stage 502 .
- the new focus point is computed in response to a change in viewing direction (stage 504 ) or a change in vertical orientation (stage 506 ). For example, a user of a mobile device is walking down the street and turns around to face the opposite direction. A compass of the mobile device detects the change in direction and causes stage 508 to be performed in response to the change in direction. The new focus point is computed based on current position information.
- the mobile device uses geographic location information, viewing direction information, and vertical angle information to determine objects, buildings, or locations that are within the viewing scope of a camera of the mobile device.
- the mobile device (or a remote server) uses the positional information to determine one or more objects, buildings, or locations that are within the viewing scope of the camera that are probable focus points of the user. For example, a building that is the closest to the center of a viewing direction of the mobile device can be identified as a probable point of focus.
- a new uncertainty range is computed.
- the uncertainty range reflects uncertainty in positional measurements. For example, a measurement of a geographic location may only be accurate to within 50 feet. This can lead to a degree of uncertainty being associated with a point of focus for the user.
- the amount of uncertainty associated with a positional measurement does not change even when the value of the positional measurement itself changes. For example, a particular compass unit of a mobile device is accurate to within five degrees. Therefore the range of uncertainty for directional measurements made by the compass is always five degrees, even when a directional measurement made by the compass changes.
- the size and shape of an uncertainty range may remain the same while the position of the uncertainty range changes.
- the amount of uncertainty associated with a particular measurement may change.
- a mobile device computes a location using GPS signals. A user of the mobile device walks down a street, causing the position of the mobile device to change.
- the mobile device is unable to receive GPS signals in the new location, and instead uses transmission tower triangulation in order to estimate a location for the mobile device. Since transmission tower triangulation is less accurate than GPS based location measurements, the level of uncertainty associated with the location measurement of the mobile device has changed, along with the actual value of the location measurement changing. In this particular example, the increased uncertainty associated with the new location measurement leads to an increase in the size of the new uncertainty range.
- the most likely selection is a data item that is most likely to be of interest to the user.
- the data item is associated with a location within the previously computed uncertainty range.
- the most likely selection is determined based on user profile data for the user. For example, a user profile for the user indicates that the user is interested in jazz music. If a jazz club is located within the uncertainty range, information on the jazz club is identified as a most likely selection.
- user profile data indicates that the user has an interest in high end fashion. If a high end clothing retailer is located within the viewing range of the mobile device, information associated with the clothing retailer is identified as the most likely selection.
- the most likely selection is based on past searches performed by the user, or general search data gathered from a plurality of users.
- the term “Metrodome” may be a popular search term for users located in downtown Minneapolis. If the user of the mobile device is in downtown Minneapolis, information associated with the Metrodome is identified as the most likely selection.
- the display is changed. For example, an annotation that includes information associated with the most likely selection is displayed on a display screen of the mobile device.
- a visual representation of the uncertainty range such as for example, the bounding shape 108 of FIG. 1 , is displayed on the display screen.
- the user can select within the visual representation of the uncertainty range to cause information about the most likely selection to be displayed.
- selecting within the visual representation of the uncertainty range causes a map from the current location of the mobile device to a location within the uncertainty range to be displayed.
- a new change in location, direction, or vertical orientation of the mobile device will cause the process to start over.
- the actions depicted in the diagram 500 are not performed every time a change in the value of a positional measurement occurs.
- a change in a positional measurement must exceed a specified threshold before a new focus point is computed.
- a mobile device may require a change in location of five feet or more before stage 508 is performed.
- the mobile device requires a change in horizontal viewing direction of 10 degrees or more before stage 508 is performed.
- a slight change a position measurement will cause icons or annotations displayed on the mobile device to be repositioned, without a new focus point and uncertainty range being computed.
- a first threshold must be met for a change in position measurement in order for a new focus point to be computed, and a second different threshold must be met for a change in position measurement in order for a new uncertainty range to be computed.
