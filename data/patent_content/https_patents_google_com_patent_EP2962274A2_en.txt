- connections are identified by analyzing social connection data associated with, for example, a social networking platform.
- a potential social connection is identified based on a friends-of-friends relationship
- a friends -of- friends relationship occurs where a first person is connected to a second, person, who is connected to a third person.
- a proposed social connection between the first and the third person is identified, based on the shared connection with the second person.
- potential connections are identified using data other than, or in addition to, social connection data. For example,
- Unstructured content refers to text, audio, video, and other content that is not categorized, labeled, or otherwise identified as relating to a particular type, of information in a universal way.
- data contained in the labeled fields of a database is considered, to be structured data, while a. plain text document contains unstructured data.
- the information "Name: Michael; City: San Francisco,- Date of birth June 1, 1975" is considered structured content because each piece of
- a social network is a system that maintains relationships between persons.
- an entity is a thing or concept that is singular, unique, well-defined and distinguishable.
- an entity may be a person, place, item, idea, abstract concept, concrete element, other suitable thing, or any combination thereof.
- a person, as defined above may be an entity.
- a social network contains a number of persons, and contains information related to the connections that exist between at least some of those persons.
- social connection data relationships between persons in a social network.
- a person in a social network has associated social connection data
- Social connection data may include, for example, a. list or graph of connections.
- a relationship between persons in a social network represents a known connection between two or more persons. Connections may be
- a unidirectional relationship exists where only one person in the relationship has confirmed a connection with the other person.
- a first person may establish a unidirectional relationship with a famous celebrity without the celebrity knowing or acknowledging the first person.
- a bidirectional relationship requires both persons in the relationship to acknowledge the
- a first person may request a relationship with a second person, and the system may receive confirmation from the second person acknowledging the
- connection before a relationship is confirmed In an example, a bidirectional relationship between two persons on a social network is indicative of a real-life friendship or other acquaintanceship between those persons. It will foe understood that a real-life friendship need not exist for a relationship to be reflected by social connection data.
- social connection data represents a web of business relationships between
- social connection data represents a web or network of connections between individuals within a certain community, region, or worldwide
- the system may identify connections between a person and a non-person entities, and between non-person entity and a non-person entity, In an example, the system identifies a connection between a person and a topic or activity such as a
- the system identifies a
- connection between related topics such as the relationship between a computer operating system and software programmed to run on that operating system.

- System 100 may be any suitable hardware, software, or both for implementing the features described in the present disclosure and will generally be referred to, herein, as "the system,"
- processing block 102 identifies a potential social connection between a first and a second person based on, for example, unstructured content of
- content block 104 includes electronic documents.
- the electronic documents include webpages from the world wide web or elsewhere on the internet, text files, database files, private network content, videos, audio, images, any other suitable public or private data, an index of the
- processing block 102 processes data from content 104 to determine potential social connections.
- Processing steps include identifying references to persons in the content, calculating a metric based on the references, and determining a potential connection between persons based on that metric.
- connection in potential connection block 106 is provided as a recommended connection to at least one person of the potential connection.
- processing block 102 receives an acknowledgement from a user confirming that the potential connection is an actual connection
- Confirmed connection block 108 includes a confirmed connection based on the potential connection of potential connection block 10 ⁇ being acknowledged as an actual connection,
- acknowledging a connection includes accepting a friend request or confirming a relationship.
- the techniques of system 100 are described in detail below in relation to flow diagram 400 of FIG. 4,
- System 100 provides potential social connections in potential connection block 106
- potential connection block 106 includes one or more potential pairs of persons that system 100 expects to represent a connection.
- a potential connection between two persons in a social network is identified by the names of the two persons appearing near to one another in one or more documents. In an example, the names of two scientists in the same university research group appear in a journal article that is retrieved from content block 104, The
- connection between the two persons is identified by processing- block 102 based on the co-occurrence of both persons, and provided in potential connection block 106.
- Co-occurrence refers to the occurrence of two or more
- the names of a first and second politician appearing in a. news article are said to co-occur.
- the system determines a co-occurrence value based on, for example, the distance between the occurrences and the number of occurrences within a. document.
- one or more names are associated with a unique identifier, and co-occurrence is determined between the identifiers. For example, a common name such as "John Smith" may be associated with a unique identification number in order to disambiguate occurrences of that name .
- the system may receive input acknowledging from a. user or from another system that a potential connection provided in potential connection block 106 is a confirmed connection. In some implementations, the system provides the confirmed connection in confirmed
- connection block 108 the data from confirmed connection block 108 is used to augment the social connection data of one or both persons in the confirmed connection.
- a connection is confirmed between a first person and a. second person, then the second person is then added to a list of friends maintained by the system for the first person and the first person is added to a list of friends maintained for the second person.
- FIG. 2 shows an illustrative example of identifying social connections in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIG, 2 includes documents 200

- the relationship metric will be described in detail in step 404 of FIQ, 4 below.
- the relationship metric may be based in part on any one or more of the frequency of occurrence, distance between occurrences , and location of one or both occurrences, of the references in the unstructured text.
- the relationship metric includes co-occurrence.
- co-occurrence is based in part on the number of times the two references occur in a document, the distance between the references in the text, the position of one or both occurrences within the unstructured content, the
- the system may identify the co-occurrence of two names adjacent in the text, such as "Bob Smith” text 204 and ''Paul Tomas" text 206 as a stronger relationship than the two names relatively farther apart, such as "Bob Smith” text 204 and "J.E, McGee” text 208.
- the position of "Ron Donn" text 220 near the top of journal article 218 may indicate that its relationship to the other names in the article are relatively stronger than if the "Ron Donn” text 220 appeared at the bottom of the page.
- co-occurrence may be determined based on document text or other content, unique identifiers associated with text or other content, any other suitable information, or any combination thereof.
- a number of times that, names co-occur in a text is based on an absolute count of occurrences, a count of occurrences relative to the length of the document, that is to say, a frequency of cooccurrence, any other suitable count of occurrences, or any combination thereof .
- a potential connection may be identified between "Paul Tomas” entity 252 and "J.E, McGee” entity 5$ based on the strength indicated by triple line 2 ⁇ € . Identifying potential connections is described in further detail below in step 406 of FIG. 4.

- the system identifies a first reference to a first person and second reference to a second person. It will be understood that the system may identify any suitable number of references to any suitable number of persons in identifying social connections.
- step 404 the system calculates a relationship metric between the first reference and the second reference.
- the relationship metric is based at least in part on the co-occurrence of the first reference and the second reference.
- the distance between a first reference and a second reference is used in part to determine a relationship metric such as co --occurrence .
- the system determines a relatively stronger relationship metric
- the system determines the relationship metric based in part on the number and/or frequency of occurrences of one or both references in a document, where number is an absolute count within a document and frequency is a count within the document divided by the length of the document. I some implementations, the system determines the relationship metric based in part on the number and/or frequency of occurrences of one or both references across a number of documents .
- a relationship metric is based on properties associated with the first reference, properties associated with the second reference, properties associated with the combination of references, any other suitable properties, or any combination thereof.
- properties associated with the first or second reference include the location of the reference within the document, the location of the reference within a paragraph or text block, how many times the reference occurs within the document, any other suitable parameters, or any combination thereof.

Description
CCMTEOT ΒΆ3ΕΏ DISCOVERY OF SOCIAL CQKMECTIGNS
Background
[0001] This disclosure generally relates to identifying social connections. Social connections exist between persons in, for exarrtple; a social network. Connections are suggested to users of the social network based on user input and existing social connections as defined in a structured social connection data maintained by the social network,
Surri ary
[0002] In some implementations, social connections are identified based on unstructured content. For example, the system may extract information from unstructured Internet content to identify connections between persons that may not otherwise be known, such as in, for example, a social network. In an example, a. professor and a graduate student may both appear in a number of journal publications, and the system may identify a relationship between them based on these
appearances .
[0003] In some implementations, a computer-implemented method includes identifying an occurrence of a first reference to a first person and a second reference to a second person in an unstructured collection of electronic documents. The method includes calculating a relationship metric between the first reference and the second reference, wherein the
relationship metric is based at least in part on the cooccurrence of the first reference and the second reference. The method includes determining the existence of a potential connection between the first reference and the second
reference based at least in part on the relationship metric. The method includes providing a recommendation to at least one of the first person and the second person to acknowledge the
potential connection as an actual connection, T e method includes receiving input from at least one of the first person and the second person confirming the potential connection as an actual connection. Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems and computer programs,
configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
[0004] These and other r plementations can each include one or more of the following features. In some implementations,, identifying an occurrence of at least one of the first reference and the second reference comprises mapping a reference in at least one document of the collection of electronic documents to a reference in a list. In some implementations, determining the existence of a potential connection comprises comparing the relationship metric to a threshold. In some implementations, the relationship metric is determined based at least in part on the location of at least one of the first reference and the second reference in one of the documents of the collection of electronic
documents . In some implementations, the relationship metric is determined based at least in part on the distance between the occurrence of the first reference and the occurrence of the second reference in one of the documents of the collection of electronic documents. In some implementations, the.
relationship metric is determined based at least in part on a number of occurrences of at least, one of the first reference and the second reference in at least one of the documents of the collection of electronic documents. In some
implementations , the relationship metric is determined based at least in part on a quality metric associated with one or more of the documents of the collection of electronic
documents. In some implementations., the method further comprises augmenting social connection data associated with at
least one of the first person and the second person based on the actual connection.
[0005] One or more of the implementations of the subject matter described herein may provide one or more of the following advantages. In some implementations, social connections may foe identified in situations where, a social connection would not otherwise have been known. In some implementations, emerging connections that might appear recent news articles or other publications ma be identified,

disclosure ,
Detail d Description of the Figures
[0012] In some implementations, potential social
connections are identified by analyzing social connection data associated with, for example, a social networking platform.
In an example, a potential social connection is identified based on a friends-of-friends relationship, A friends -of- friends relationship occurs where a first person is connected to a second, person, who is connected to a third person. In the example, a proposed social connection between the first and the third person is identified, based on the shared connection with the second person. In some implementations, potential connections are identified using data other than, or in addition to, social connection data. For example,
potential and actual social connections may be identified from unstruc ured, content.
[00133 Unstructured content, as used herein, refers to text, audio, video, and other content that is not categorized, labeled, or otherwise identified as relating to a particular type, of information in a universal way. In an example, data contained in the labeled fields of a database is considered, to be structured data, while a. plain text document contains unstructured data. In another example , the information "Name: Michael; City: San Francisco,- Date of Birth June 1, 1975" is considered structured content because each piece of
information is given a defined category, while the information "Michael lives in San Francisco and was born on the first of July in 1975" is unstructured content referring to the same information .
[0014 J In some implementations, a social network is a system that maintains relationships between persons. The term "person, " as used herein, includes, for example, one or more individuals, one or more groups of individuals, one or more companies, any other suitable entity, or any combination thereof. As used herein, an entity is a thing or concept that is singular, unique, well-defined and distinguishable. For example, an entity may be a person, place, item, idea, abstract concept, concrete element, other suitable thing, or any combination thereof. For example, a person, as defined
above, may be an entity. In an example, a social network contains a number of persons, and contains information related to the connections that exist between at least some of those persons. In some implementations, the collection of
relationships between persons in a social network is referred to as social connection data. In an example, a person in a social network has associated social connection data
containing confirmed connections with other persons in the social network. Social connection data may include, for example, a. list or graph of connections.
[0015] In some implementations, a relationship between persons in a social network represents a known connection between two or more persons. Connections may be
unidirectional or bidirectional. n some implementations, a unidirectional relationship exists where only one person in the relationship has confirmed a connection with the other person. In an example, a first person may establish a unidirectional relationship with a famous celebrity without the celebrity knowing or acknowledging the first person. In some implementations,, a bidirectional relationship requires both persons in the relationship to acknowledge the
relationship. In an example, a first person may request a relationship with a second person, and the system may receive confirmation from the second person acknowledging the
connection before a relationship is confirmed. In an example, a bidirectional relationship between two persons on a social network is indicative of a real-life friendship or other acquaintanceship between those persons. It will foe understood that a real-life friendship need not exist for a relationship to be reflected by social connection data.
[0O16J In some implementations, social connection data represents a web of business relationships between
individuals, companies, groups, and other persons. In some implementations, social connection data represents a web or
network of connections between individuals within a certain community, region, or worldwide,
[0017] It will be understood that while the system is described in terms of identifying social connections, the technique may be applied to determining other types of connections between any suitable persons, For example, the system of FIG. 1, below, may identify potential relationships between entities such as organizations, universities,
companies, groups, and other collections of individuals. It will also be understood that while the. system is described in terms of identifying connections between persons, it may identify connections between a person and a non-person entities, and between non-person entity and a non-person entity, In an example, the system identifies a connection between a person and a topic or activity such as a
relationship between an actor and a movie in which he or she performed, In another example, the system identifies a
connection between related topics, such as the relationship between a computer operating system and software programmed to run on that operating system.
[00183 FIG, 1 is a high level block diagram of a system for identifying social connections in accordance with some implementa ions of the present disclosure. System 100
includes processing block 102, content block 104, potential connection block 106, and confirmed connection block 108,
System 100 may be any suitable hardware, software, or both for implementing the features described in the present disclosure and will generally be referred to, herein, as "the system," In some implementations, processing block 102 identifies a potential social connection between a first and a second person based on, for example, unstructured content of
electronic documents. In some implementations, content block 104 includes electronic documents. In some implementations, the electronic documents include webpages from the world wide
web or elsewhere on the internet, text files, database files, private network content, videos, audio, images, any other suitable public or private data, an index of the
aforementioned content, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, processing block 102 processes data from content 104 to determine potential social connections.
Processing steps include identifying references to persons in the content, calculating a metric based on the references, and determining a potential connection between persons based on that metric. In some implementations, the potential
connection in potential connection block 106 is provided as a recommended connection to at least one person of the potential connection. in some implementations, processing block 102 receives an acknowledgement from a user confirming that the potential connection is an actual connection, Confirmed connection block 108 includes a confirmed connection based on the potential connection of potential connection block 10β being acknowledged as an actual connection, In some
implementations, acknowledging a connection includes accepting a friend request or confirming a relationship. The techniques of system 100 are described in detail below in relation to flow diagram 400 of FIG. 4,
[0019] System 100 provides potential social connections in potential connection block 106, In some implementations, potential connection block 106 includes one or more potential pairs of persons that system 100 expects to represent a connection. In some implementations, a potential connection between two persons in a social network is identified by the names of the two persons appearing near to one another in one or more documents. In an example, the names of two scientists in the same university research group appear in a journal article that is retrieved from content block 104, The
connection between the two persons is identified by processing- block 102 based on the co-occurrence of both persons, and
provided in potential connection block 106. Co-occurrence, as used herein, refers to the occurrence of two or more
references to persons, for example, names, within a document. In an example, the names of a first and second politician appearing in a. news article are said to co-occur. In some implementations, the system determines a co-occurrence value based on, for example, the distance between the occurrences and the number of occurrences within a. document. It will be understood that in some implementations , one or more names are associated with a unique identifier, and co-occurrence is determined between the identifiers. For example, a common name such as "John Smith" may be associated with a unique identification number in order to disambiguate occurrences of that name .
[0020] In some implementations, the system may receive input acknowledging from a. user or from another system that a potential connection provided in potential connection block 106 is a confirmed connection. In some implementations, the system provides the confirmed connection in confirmed
connection block 108, In some implement tions, the data from confirmed connection block 108 is used to augment the social connection data of one or both persons in the confirmed connection. In an example, a connection is confirmed between a first person and a. second person, then the second person is then added to a list of friends maintained by the system for the first person and the first person is added to a list of friends maintained for the second person.
[0021] FIG. 2 shows an illustrative example of identifying social connections in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure. FIG, 2 includes documents 200
illustrating three academic journal articles from which the system determines potential social connections, and entity map 250 which illustrates how the system identifies connections, In the illustrated example, a potential relationship is
identified between two of the authors, "Paul Tomas" and "J.E. McGee . "
[0022] Documents 200 includes journal article 202, journal article 210,. and journal article 218. Entity map 250 shows references identified in the articles. In the illustrated example, the system identifies references corresponding to persons in the articles, ;' Bob Smith" text 204, "Paul Tomas" text 206, and "J.E, McGee" text 208 are identified in article 202. The texts are identified as references by mapping to entity map 250. For example, the system identifies "Bob
Smith" text 204 as corresponding to "Bob Smith" entity 256, the system identifies "Paul Tomas" text. 206 as corresponding to "Paul Tomas" entity 252, and the system identifies "J.E. McGee" text 208 as corresponding to "J.E, McGee" entity 254. The mapping of, for example, unstructured text to entities will be described in detail below in step 402 of FIG, 4.
[0023] Journal article 210 includes "Don Kep" text 212 which is mapped to "Don Kep" entity 258, "Paul Tomas" text" 214 which is mapped to "Paul Tomas" entity 252, and "J.E, McGee" text 216 which is mapped to "J.E. McGee" entity 254. Journal article 218 includes "Ron Donn" text 220 which is mapped to "Ron Donn" entity 260, "Paul Toinas" text" 226 which is mapped to "Paul Tomas" entity 252, and "J.E. McGee." text 224 which is mapped to "J.E. McGee" entity 254.
[0024J A relationship metric describing the strength of a relationship between entity pairs occurring in journal articles 202, 210, and 218 is represented by the lines between the entities in entity map 250. The relationship metric will be described in detail in step 404 of FIQ, 4 below. In an example, the relationship metric may be based in part on any one or more of the frequency of occurrence, distance between occurrences , and location of one or both occurrences, of the references in the unstructured text. In some implementations, the relationship metric includes co-occurrence. In some
implementa ions, co-occurrence is based in part on the number of times the two references occur in a document, the distance between the references in the text, the position of one or both occurrences within the unstructured content, the
appearance of one or both references in structured content, contextual information, any other suitable one or more criteria, or any combination thereof. For example, the system may identify the co-occurrence of two names adjacent in the text, such as "Bob Smith" text 204 and ''Paul Tomas" text 206 as a stronger relationship than the two names relatively farther apart, such as "Bob Smith" text 204 and "J.E, McGee" text 208. In an example related to the position of one or both occurrences within unstructured content, the position of "Ron Donn" text 220 near the top of journal article 218 may indicate that its relationship to the other names in the article are relatively stronger than if the "Ron Donn" text 220 appeared at the bottom of the page. In some
implementations, co-occurrence may be determined based on document text or other content, unique identifiers associated with text or other content, any other suitable information, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, a number of times that, names co-occur in a text is based on an absolute count of occurrences, a count of occurrences relative to the length of the document, that is to say, a frequency of cooccurrence, any other suitable count of occurrences, or any combination thereof .
[0025] In the illustrated example, "Bob Smith" and "Paul Tomas " occur together once, in journal article 202. This is reflected by a single line 2S8 in the entity map connecting "Bob Smith" entity 256 and "Paul Tomas" entity 252. The cooccurrence of text, mapped to "Paul Tomas" entity 252 and text mapped to "J.E, McGee" entity 254 in the three journal articles is reflected by the triple line. 266 connecting "Paul Tomas" entity 252 and "J.E. McGee" entity 254. In some
implementations, the strength of the relationship metric as represented by the number of lines between entities of entities map 250 is used to determine potential connections. In the illustrated example, a potential connection may be identified between "Paul Tomas" entity 252 and "J.E, McGee" entity 5$ based on the strength indicated by triple line 2§€ . Identifying potential connections is described in further detail below in step 406 of FIG. 4.
[0026] The illustrated example of FIG. 2 indicates a relationship metric based on a count of times that two names co-occur in journal articles. It will be understood that, as described above, the relationship metric may depend, on other data in addition to or in place of the number of cooccurrences .
[0027] FIG, 3 shows an exemplary user interface sequence for providing potential social connections in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure. Illustrative steps to provide a social connection, receive input from a user acknowledging the connection, and update social
connection data associated with a user based on the received input are shown. In the example illustrated in FIG, 2 above, the system determines a potential connection between "Paul Tomas" and "J.E. cGee." The system may provide the potential connection to a user associated with the entity "Paul Tomas," and if he acknowledges that the proposed connection is a real and/or desired connection, "J.E. McGee" may be added to Paul Tomas ' s social connection data, which may be, for example, a list of friends. In some implementations, social connection data includes a list of social connections, a graph containing edges and nodes that represent social connections to other persons, any other suitable representation of connections, or any combination thereof.
[00283 User interface 300 shows social connection data 302 associated with Userl . In the illustrated example, social
connection data 302 includes a list of User! ' s friends,, which includes User2 and User3. In some implementations, social connection data 302 includes a collection of confirmed friends for Userl . In the illustrated example, Userl has previously acknowledged or otherwise, confirmed that he or she is friends with User2 and User3.
[0029] In some implementations,, social connection data 302 includes a list, grid, matrix, or other arrangement of data. In some im lementations, friends are displayed using text, images, video, audio, demographic information, any other suitable content, or any combination thereof.
[00303 User interface 310 shows the system providing a potential social connection to Userl, In the example, the system has identified a potential connection between Userl and User4 , The system asks question 312 including the text
"Userl, do you know User4?'' to Userl, In some
implementations, the potential connection is identified as shown in relation to FIG, 2 and as described below in step 404 of FIG. 4. The system includes two input response buttons, "Yes" button 314 and "No" button 316, The system receives input from a user using- the. buttons to confirm or reject the potential connection. For example, if Userl wants to add
User4 to his or her social graph, Userl may click "Yes" button 314 using a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, or other suitable input. The system receives this input as an acknowledgement of the potential connection as being an actual and/or desired connection.
[0031] User interface 320 shows exemplary social connection data 322 after the system receives an acknowledgement of the proposed connection in user interface 310 using "Yes" button 314, As shown, social connection data 322 of Userl includes User2 , User3, and User4. In some implementations, social connection data 322 corresponds to social connection data 302
after augmenting the graph with the information that there is a relationship between Userl and User ,
[0032] FIG* 4 shows flow diagram 400 including illustrative steps for identifying social connections in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure,
[0033] In step 402, the system identifies an occurrence of a first reference, to a first person and a second reference to a second person. In some implementations, the system
identifies references in an unstructured collection of electronic documents. A reference to a. person in an
electronic document includes the name, part of the name, any other suitable identifying information associated with that person, or any combination thereof, A reference may occur in the text, p.ictux'e captions, anchor text, metadata, page title, any other suitable location, or any combination thereof. For example, a particular person's first and last, name ma appear in the tex,t. of a webpacfe. In another example, a person's last name may appear in the page title of a webpage. In another example, the system may associate identifying information such as "the 42nd president of the United States'' appearing in the text of a webpage with the person President Bill Clinton.
[0034] In some implementations, the system identifies a reference to a person as corresponding to a particular unique individual. In an example, the name "Michael Jackson" appears on a webpage. The system associates the reference "Michael Jackson" with either" the musician Michael Jackson or the author Michael Jackson in a disambiguation step. The system may perform the disambiguation based on other text in the document, contextual information, metadata, links, for example, hyperlinks, to and from the document where the reference appears, contextual information related to the unique individual such as a popularity score or known social connections, any other suitable information, or any
combination thereof. In some implementations, the system
correlates references in a document to a maintained collection of previously known unique individuals. The collection of individuals is generated based on, for example, previous processing of social connections, crawling of ebpages, a clustering process, manual input to social networks, any other suitable technique, or any combination thereof.
[0035] In some iraplement tions, the system identifies a first reference to a first person and second reference to a second person. It will be understood that the system may identify any suitable number of references to any suitable number of persons in identifying social connections.
[0036] In step 404, the system calculates a relationship metric between the first reference and the second reference. In some implementations, the relationship metric is based at least in part on the co-occurrence of the first reference and the second reference.
[0037] In some, implementations, the distance between a first reference and a second reference is used in part to determine a relationship metric such as co --occurrence . In an example, the system determines a relatively stronger
relationship metric between references that are close together as compared to references that are further apart. In some implementations, the system determines the relationship metric based in part on the number and/or frequency of occurrences of one or both references in a document, where number is an absolute count within a document and frequency is a count within the document divided by the length of the document. I some implementations, the system determines the relationship metric based in part on the number and/or frequency of occurrences of one or both references across a number of documents .
[0038] In some implementations, a relationship metric is based on properties associated with the first reference, properties associated with the second reference, properties
associated with the combination of references, any other suitable properties, or any combination thereof. In an example, properties associated with the first or second reference include the location of the reference within the document, the location of the reference within a paragraph or text block, how many times the reference occurs within the document, any other suitable parameters, or any combination thereof. For example, the relationship metric may be based in part on a reference occurring at the top of the page, a reference occurring in the first sentence of a paragraph, a reference occurring within a title, a reference occurring within a picture caption, a reference occurring a large number of times, a reference occurring a large number of times with respect to the total length of the document, a reference occurring in any other suitable location or manner, or any combination thereof.
[0039] In some im lementations, the. system determines a relationship metric based in part on the document where the reference occurs. For example, a webpage may be associated with a popularity score, a freshness score, a rating based on the number of hyperlinks to and from that, page, a manual ranking, any other suitable metric, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, the system determines the relationship metric based in part on one or more of those document, rankings .
Ϊ004 ] In some implementations, the system may scale, normalize, weight , combine with other data, or otherwise adjust a relationship metric, such as a co-occurrence value, based on page quality, freshness, popularity, user input, system design, any other suitable criteria, or any combination thereof. In an example, the co-occurrence value from a recently updated webpage may be weighted with a higher weight than a co-occurrence value from an older webpage. In another example, the co-occurrence value across a number of webpages
may be normalized such that each document has the same
relative contribution to an aggregate score. In another
exam le, co-occurrence values from highly visited webpages are assigned a higher weight than co-occurrence values from inf equently visited websites.
[0041] An illustrative expression for determining cooccurrence C(FR,SRj) is shown by Eq, 1:
P(FR,SRj)
CiFR R)
P(FR)
in which P(FR) is the probability of finding first reference FR in a text corpus, e.g. one or more webpages, and P(FR, SRj is the probability of finding both the first reference FR and the related second reference SRj , indexed by index, j , in the text corpus. Another illustrative expression for determining co-occurrence C(FR, SRj) is shown by Eq. 2;
N {FR, SR()
C (FR, SRj)
N(FR) + N(SRj) - N(FR,SRj)
in which N(FR) is the number of instances of first reference FR in a text corpus, e.g. one or more webpages, N(SRj) is the number of instances of second reference SRj in the text corpus, e.g. one or more, webpages, and N(FR,SRj) is the number of instances of both the first, reference FR and the second reference SRj the text corpus. In some implementations, the system may normalize, scale, shift, or otherwise alter the co¬ occurrence metric. It will be understood that the
aforementioned equations are merely an example and that the system may use any suitable equation, technique,, other suitable processing, or any combination thereof, to determine a co-occ rrence metrie.
[0042] It will be understood that any suitable technique or combination of techniques may be used to determine a
relationship metric. For example, determining a metric may include analysis of co-occurrence, analysis of demographic information, analysis of geographic information, analysis of contextual information, any other suitable analysis or technique, or any combination thereof, For example, a relationship between a first person and a second person may be based on their occurrence in unstructured text in combination with other information from a social network such as
demographic or geographic information. In another example, the system may include contextual information such as other words or content nearby the person reference in determining a relationship metric. In some implementations, the system may identify references in unstructured data, structured data, or any combination thereof,
[0043] In step 406, the system determines the existence of a potential connection between the first reference and the second reference. In some implementations, the system determines the potential connection based in part on the relationship metric defined by the first reference and the second reference. For example, the system determines a potential relationship by comparing the metric to one or more thresholds, to other relationship metrics, to any other suitable criteria, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, thresholds and criteria are determined based on user input, system design, predetermined parameters, system settings, machine learning based on previous determinations of relationships, user preferences, any other suitable data, or any combination thereof. In an example, the relationship
metric determined between a first reference and a second reference is compared to a threshold to determine if it represents a potential connection.
[00443 It will be understood that, in some im lementations, the system need not use a threshold in step 406. In an example, the system may determine the existence of a potential connection based on a relative comparison between two or more metrics. In another example, the system may identify all of the relationships between a first and second person as potential connections. In another example, the system may include user input in determining the existence of a potential connection, for example, a user providing content, access to content, or identification of content where potential
connections are identified.
CG9453 In step 408, the system provides a recommendation to at least one of the first person and the second person to acknowledge the potential connection as an actual connection, In an. example, the system may provide a connection as shown in user interface 310 of FIG. 3. In an example, the system may provide a recommendation to the first person, where the first person and the second person are determined to have a
potential connection. In another example, the system may- provide a recommendation to both the first person and the second person. In some implementa ions, the system may provide the recommend tion to one or both of the persons based on the relationship metric, user preferences, system design, previous user interactions with the system, any other suitable information, or any combination thereof,
[004S3 n an example, the system, provides a list, grid, matrix, or other display of potential connections to one or both persons. In an example, a potential connection is only displayed to a second person after it is confirmed by the first person.
[9047] in step 410, the system receives input from at least one of the first person and the second person confirming the connection, In some implementations, the system receives confirmation regarding a recommendation of a potential connection provided in step 408. In an example, the system may receive input as shown in user interface 310 of FIG. 3. For example, the system may provide information to a first person that there exists a potential connection between that first person and a second person. The first person may confirm that they know the second person or otherwise desire to establish a connection with that person, thus acknowledging that the potential connection is an actual connection. In some implementations, acknowledging potential connection includes acknowledging a real-world connection, a previously known connection, a desired connection, any other suitable connection, or any combination thereof. In some
implementations, receiving input, may include receiving mouse input, keyboard input, touchscreen input, voice input, input from another system, any other suitable input, or any
combination thereof. In an example, the person may confirm one or more actual connections from a list or grid of
potential connections provided in step 408, In another example, the system may provide a potential connection to a second person, where the potential connection has been confirmed and/or requested by the first person. The system may receive from the second person an acknowledgement, denial, deferral, or other input regarding the connection.
[0048] In some implementations, the system provides a recommendation to a third person not otherwise included in the potential connection. The system ma provide the third person the ability to acknowledge the connection as a real
connection. In an example , in acknowledging potential historical social connections, such as connections between U.S. Presidents of the 1800s based on a collection of
newspaper articles, the system presents potential connections to a historian for acknowledgment as real connections.
[004S] It. will be understood that person-to-person
connections identified by the system in a. social network are unidirectional or bidirectional. In some implementations, a unidirectional social connection exists where a first person, establishes a connection with a second person, but there is no confirmed connection between with second, person with the first. In an example, a first person may subscribe or follow a famous person's postings on a social network platform, without the famous person acknowledging a connection with the first person. In some implementations, a bidirectional connection may exist where a connection must be confirmed by both the first person and the. second person, and both persons may receive contacts, postings, and other social in ormation from the other person. In an example, a social network may require a connection request from a first person to be confirmed by t e second in order to establish any social connection. In some implementations, group memberships include social connections between more than two persons. It will be understood that some social networks include
unidirectional connections, bidirectional connections, group memberships, any other suitable connec ions, or any
combination thereof .
[00503 In step 412, the system augments the social
connection data of at least one of the first person and the second person based, on the confirmed connection. In an example, the system augments the social connection data as shown in user interface 320 of FIG, 3. In some
implementations , social connection data associated with a person includes a graph and/or listing of known social connections. n an example, persons are. represented as nodes of a graph and connections between persons are represented as edges of the graph, It will be understood that in some
implementations, a social graph is an illustrative construct and that connections between persons may be. represented by lists of names and connections. In some implementations, augmenting the social connection data includes adding the acknowledged social connection to the previously known social connections associated with one or both persons. In an example, where a social connection is confirmed, in step 410, that connection is added to the social connection data of the person that confirmed the connection. in another example, the connection is added to the social connection data of both persons in the. confirmed, connection.
[0051] It will be understood that the steps above are exemplary and that in some implementations, steps may be added, removed, omitted, repeated, reordered, modified in any other suitable way, or any combination thereof. In an
example, multiple connections are confirmed in step 410 before, augmenting the social connection data in step 412. In another example, the system may augment social connection data in step 412 without receiving confirmation in step 412, That is to say. in some implementations the system considers a potential connection to be an actual connection.
[0052] In another example, the existence of a potential connection determined in step 406 may be used, without
providing the recommenda ion to at least one person and/or receiving confirmation, to suggest other related social connections, to determine or adjust rankings of search
results, to determine or adjust rankings of other information such as social connections, to provide search results or other information to a user, for any other suitable purpose, or any combination, thereof. For example, a potential connection between a first and second person may be used to suggest a relationship between a. third person and a fourth person. In another example, a potential connection between a first person and a second person may be used to provide search results
based in part on a first person to the second person, It will be understood that the aforementioned, uses of the potential social connection without acknowledgement are merely exemplary and that the system may use the potential social connection in any suitable way.
