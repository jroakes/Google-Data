- the rating engine 205 uses the user activities that relate to user's interaction with one or more websites to rate the user.
- the rating engine 205 receives the user activities from an overlay generated by the dialog engine 209 .
- the rating engine 205 receives the user's activities from an overlay including a toolbar to allow the user to annotate a website.
- the rating engine 205 receives the user activities from user data stored in the memory 237 .
- the rating for the user includes an overall rating and a website rating for a first website.
- the overall rating for a first user is an overall assessment for the first user based at least in part on the first user's activities on a set of websites.
- the set of websites include websites on which the first user has elected to share information with other users.
- the set of websites are the websites listed in the first user's profile.
- the rating engine 205 receives the first user's activities relating to the set of websites to generate the overall rating for the first user.
- the rating engine 205 categorizes the set of websites according to topics, rates the first user on each category, and generates the overall rating for the first user based at least in part on the ratings on each category.
- the rating engine 205 uses a weighted average of ratings on different categories of websites as the overall rating for the first user.
- the website rating for the first website is a reflection of the first user's activities on the first website.
- the first website is the current website that the first user shares with other users based at least in part on an overlay generated for the first website.
- the overall rating and the website rating are represented by percentages. The higher the percentage, the better the rating. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the overall rating and the website rating can be represented in other scales.
- the rating engine 205 receives a set of ratings for the first user from other users and generates the rating for the first user based at least in part on the set of ratings.
- the other users are users who have registered to share information on the first website with the first user (e.g., the members of the first website).
- a piece of bi-directional communication between the first user and the other users is needed for the other users rating the first user.
- a second user from the group of other users rates the first user based at least in part on messages sent and received from the first user to the second user and from the second user to the first user. This ensures that the first user does not receive a poor rating from other users with whom the first user has not interacted, such as spammers or people with malicious intent.
- the filter module 207 is software including routines for filtering users that are included in the overlay according to at least one condition.
- the filter module 207 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for filtering a user.
- the filter module 207 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235 . In either instance, the filter module 207 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 .
- the filter module 207 receives at least one condition from a first user or according to a default setting that the filter module 207 uses to remove users from the overlay associated with a website.
- the conditions include demographic conditions, a topic, a rating level, etc.
- the filter module 207 filters users that have a website rating or an overall rating that fall below a threshold value. For example, if the conditions show that the first user prefers users who are interested in wind power, live in California and have a 90% website rating level or above to share the first website, the filter module 207 filters the other users that are associated with the website to identify users who satisfy the three conditions and transmits instructions to the dialog engine 209 to generate an overlay that satisfies the conditions.
- the conditions are stored in the first user's profile and presented as part of the user interface so that the user can apply the same filter in the future.
