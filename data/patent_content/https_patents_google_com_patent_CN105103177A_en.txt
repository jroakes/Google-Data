I. summarize
Be provided for auctioning in map for the scheme of the white space of the display of business data (" advertisement ") (such as text or the advertisement of vision) and for distributed map of fixing a price to allow third party to share advertising income and the method bought for having various advertisement and exist an access of various types of map products of level is useful, to wish that about them the quantity of the advertisement comprised at map datum balances third-party demand and the preference of income and the purchase map datum generated from the advertisement be inserted into the map datum that distributes better.
This theme is openly provided for contributing to auctioning the method and system of the scheme in space in the map for the display of map datum and business data (" advertisement ") (such as text or the advertisement of vision).The access without advertisement map space that the technology that the program contributes to the map distributed for fixing a price further is shared advertising income to allow third party map provider and bought for varied number.The system and method provided herein provides bid framework, in the architecture in many ways can about appearing at map area (such as, position with on the map of specific zoom level) on content bid, this content can be map content or advertisement in this region.
In one implementation, in certain region that advertisement (text or vision) just can be placed on map by advertiser somewhere (such as, as limited by rectangle or polygon) bid, and advertisement can be selected with which map zoom level will to show.Except advertiser, there is provided map datum above in visual map area (such as, being defined as the region of a part for the map of specific zoom level) " special bid " (similar with auction reservation price) can be placed with the map content supplier (" supplier ") generating map.
In some implementations, bid framework allows the value for the income equality map datum obtained from the advertisement be placed on map in many ways.Such as, the advertiser that (such as, in the centre in tundra) is interesting arbitrarily in real empty space will not compete with supplier.On the other hand, in densely populated space (such as, main metropolis), supplier will produce a large amount of competition by placing special bid on the map datum comprising ground truth label relevant in space and map feature.
When placing special bid, supplier at random can cover them for the map feature bid high price of some type to prevent advertisement.Map feature can be need to retain that think from diagram data " ground truth " label and/or supplier objectively can not uncared-for organic map content in order to support that advertisement is enough important.
The special bid of being placed by the supplier of map datum in map area can be based on many factors.These factors can be similar to the factor for determining whether display label in dynamic Online Map.This factor can comprise zoom level, such as, for world's level map, country's title should have very high special bid, but for the map of neighbours' rank, cancels special bid, on the other hand, local feature only should obtain special bid in closely zoom level.Factor also can comprise the inherent importance of characteristic type.Such as, special bid should be unlimited or maximum (such as, the maximum quantity that can be expressed in bid system) or for retaining the almost maximum of metropolitan title on the level map of state, but relatively low for brook title on the level map of city.In addition, the amount of the search inquiry be associated with label can be the factor of distributing special bid.The interested level of user (or, the potential or actual beholder of map) in this factor instruction map entities.Such as, when water valve hotel is same size about with local vehicle hotel in Washington area on map, queries will indicate people more may be interested in the former, so require the special bid that the local vehicle hotel near being compared to for " water valve hotel " label on identical map is higher.
How important supplier also can have based on district, place special bid to prevent covering of useful non-label information for district (district such as, in ground truth label).Such as, the cover part on its title still coloured long road should with the same high minimum bid of advertisement request from advertiser covering crossroad or street name.This also can be extended to the special bid on completely empty region, if filled with advertisement, cognitive load-such as can be forced to user in this region, space between two text labels, if filled with text advertisements, this label can look like the text of single continuous lines, fuzzy label/advertisement border.
In some implementations, except supplier and advertiser, the third party's (such as, using API) distributing map also can have special interests for some feature of the map shown with some zoom level.In one implementation, third party is similar to supplier and advertiser and can submits bid to for some map feature (such as, except the special bid of advertiser).This can such as be interested in carry out when they need not be shown or purely have based on supplier's standard and show some map feature (such as ground truth label) in the region of high priority (such as, more reducing horizontal indicating characteristic than their other places) wherein third party.
Such as, restaurant owner can on such as website at the restaurant to client (such as, reality or potential customer) distribute map and even can occur with many cities zoom level to make it for the title bid high price in the street at place, restaurant, wherein otherwise it will not be shown.In some implementations, until then under the hammer between other ground truth label and advertisements at remaining space, third party can pay to be allowed to some map feature mobile in " at utmost most important " classification separately outside auction structure, ensures be shown on map or have shown comparatively high likelihood.In one or more implementations, third party user can pay to prevent any advertisement to be fundamentally displayed in particular geographic area (as specified outside auction structure, such as, pass through rectangle), or on map arbitrarily local or regulate concrete region on map or arbitrarily in place in map advertisement there is level (such as, specific zoom level).
In some implementations, third party user can ask advertisement exist level with cover for ask in response to third party and map datum supplier is provided cost.In one example, there is the constraint of level restriction for the advertisement expected in asked map in advertisement, comprise the total quantity of advertisement on map (such as, the region of whole request or ask in region some region), the total value of advertisement in map (such as, the region of whole request or ask in region some region), or for allowing or the geometrical constraint of unallowed location advertising.In one or more implementations, third party can partly pay (such as, than supplier can be without advertisement map the less money paid) to receive some map feature or certain map without advertising level of having and being guaranteed to present.Third party user also can ask to have higher advertisement and there is the map of level (such as, lower " special bid ", or each viewport can more advertisement positions), with the part as contract, be provided income and share agreement to share the part map that distributes of comfortable third party showing the advertising income of advertisement.
In one example, the bid of being placed by third party's Map Services business and/or advertiser can be run with the special bid of being placed by supplier in identical auction.In some implementations, the auction for any specific map area can run in many rounds.Such as, " important " map content (such as, based on supplier's standard or third party service provider's preference or bid) of such as ground truth label can be selected in the first auction round.In the first round, competition only can think that another such ground truth label makes way between map provider believes the ground truth label that cannot be omitted unless necessary.And when the third party service provider has asked map and indicated important map feature, important map feature also can be included in the first round auction.
Once important map feature is selected in primary round, so supplier can remove any bid for those projects, comprise ground truth label or district (such as, supplier can make unlimited or maximum bid or can remove those districts from bid for all districts be finished in the first round).Then the second round bid can be carried out, comprise low priority map feature (such as, brook title, enterprise name and other map feature arbitrarily, the untapped or interested ground truth label of third party's map server in such as the first round) and advertisement.About map feature and advertisement priority presenting of requiring of particulate more, can carry out having the auction of three or more rounds.
Except conventional 2-D map, method described herein may be used on to participate in geographical relevant mutual in other visual representations various of geography of user.Such as, the user utilizing GPS navigation to drive can emulate in the blank parts of live view at GPS and be shown advertisement.Similarly, in blank/uncorrelated district that advertisement can be displayed in three-dimensional map or streetscape (such as, the picture of sky, walkway, blank wall or actual notice board can show advertisement).
Except above-mentioned standard, when perform multilevel and/or in many ways bidding process time bidding process can merge other bid technology.Such as, bid (such as, by advertiser, third party or supplier) or can be able to determine to classify or other similar standards at the website of the expectation being presented at the content in map (such as, the map feature of such as ground truth label and/or advertisement) based on user's demographics, user model, map appearance third party's website thereon.In certain embodiments, if the user installation application of being correlated with and/or select relevant service about his or her account, so user will only receive the benefit of described technology herein.And ad quality can be the factor in bidding process.Several feature can be used to predict click through rates.These can comprise the advertisement observed from behavior with it, and for new advertisement, the feature of such as cognitive load (such as, if any, the complicacy of the amount/picture of text), text feature (such as, the known term race causing higher or lower click-through rate).When map is shown together with other signals of particular search query or the interested particular term of user or phrase, the feature being similar to conventional sponsored search system also can be integrated in bidding process.The feature being similar to conventional ads auction also can be integrated in bidding process.
Once bidding process completes, map area can be played up, and this region comprises the content (such as, map feature or advertisement) of the best bid had for map area.In one example, when playing up advertisement and covering, printing difference between the data of map feature and commercial placement (such as, by distributing that advertising creative material is limited to and being guaranteed not by some color that the ground truth feature of map uses) can be presented to safeguard practicality and the consistance of map.
Once advertisement is displayed in map, advertiser be collected and be exposed to the various analysis data about ad impression, click and other user behaviors can person's of being provided (or its other party) to notify that advertisement determines better.Use described method herein, except conventional analysis, new analysis is also possible, and what advertisement and/or the map viewport that comprise what zoom level trend towards causing maximum click.
II. the example client end-server network environment of the auction of ad placements in map is contributed to
Fig. 1 illustrates example client end-server network environment, and this network environment provides the auction space for the display of map feature and business data in map.Network environment 100 comprises the many electronic equipments 102,104 and 106 being connected to server 110 by network 108 communicatedly.One or more remote server 120 is coupled to server 110 and/or one or more electronic equipment 102,104 and 106 further.Server 110 comprises treatment facility 112 and data store 114.Treatment facility 112 service data stores the computer instruction stored in 114, such as, on the map being shown to of providing and electronic equipment 102,104 and 016 mutual one or more users, show space in the map of map feature and business data with auxiliary auction.
