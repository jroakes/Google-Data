Definitions
- the present invention relates to wireless telecommunication systems, and more particularly to the use of antenna arrays in wireless telecommunication systems.
- An important goal in designing a wireless communication system is to maximize system capacity, that is, to maximize a number of users that may simultaneously be served by the communication system.
- One way of increasing system capacity is to lower the transmit power allocated to each user. By lowering the allocated transmit power, interference for all users is lowered, which allows for the addition of new users to the system.
- One way to lower the transmit power allocated to each user, or subscriber unit is to increase the efficiency of the wireless link, or communication channel, between the subscriber unit and the base station serving that user.
- One method of increasing the efficiency of the link is to broadcast information to a target subscriber unit using a transmit antenna diversity system.
- a transmit antenna diversity system allows the transmitted signal to be beamformed so that a narrower, more focused beam is transmitted to the user.
- Antenna beamforming allows for a base station to lower the transmit power allocated to the signal, since the allocated power is less widely dispersed.
- Antenna beamforming also reduces multipath fading of the transmitted signal and interference with non-targeted users since the beam is more narrowly focused.
- Two-antenna diversity uses an antenna array consisting of two antennas, or array elements, to transmit a signal and then applies an optimization technique to improve the quality of the transmitted signal over the performance that would be afforded by the use of a single antenna.
- One of the simplest forms of two-antenna diversity is two-antenna selection transmit diversity (STD). As its name implies, this method involves selecting one of two antennas as the antenna that will be utilized as the transmitter for a particular communication.
- a typical method of selecting an antenna involves choosing the antenna that has the highest received power with respect to training, synchronization, or data communications exchanged with the target subscriber unit.
- Another method of antenna beamforming involves separately weighting the signal transmitted by each element of the antenna array. If the elements of the antenna array are weighted and phased appropriately, the signals broadcast from these elements will add constructively at a receiver of the target subscriber unit.
- two conditions must be met before an optimal weighting can be applied to the transmit array. First, the channel between each of the array elements and the subscriber of interest must be known. Secondly, it must be possible to compute the signal-to-noise ratio of the subscriber unit of interest.
- TxAA Current methods for weighting the coefficients
- TxAA are optimal only if the interference environment of the target subscriber unit is dominated by inter-cell interference (optimal in the sense of maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio at the subscriber unit for a given level of transmit power).
- the target subscriber unit is close to the base station, where self-interference is the dominant source of interference. In these conditions, the existing method for optimizing the transmitter weighting coefficients can be highly non-optimal.
- current methods for weighting the coefficients do not account for the self-interference introduced by multipath delay.
- the current method is optimal only if one of the following two conditions hold; (i) the propagation channel has only a single path, or (ii) the ratio of intra-cell interference power to inter-cell interference power is zero. The latter condition can never be met precisely, but may be an acceptable approximation in some circumstances. In the absence of conditions (i) or (ii), situations arise where the current methods for weighting the coefficients perform worse than a much simpler selection transmit diversity (STD) weighting system.
- STD transmit diversity
- an antenna array beamfoming technique is needed that optimizes performance of an antenna array in a high multipath fading environment or in environments of significant self-interference or where intra-cell interference dominates inter-cell interference.

- an antenna array beamforming technique employs independent transmit weighting coefficients for multiple subscriber units served by a transmitting communication device. Optimization of the weighting coefficients is a joint, rather than an independent, venture of the multiple subscriber units. Joint optimization preferably is implemented at the transmitting communication device and involves the communication device optimizing based on knowledge of the channels between itself and each of the subscriber units, as well knowledge of the inter-cell and intra-cell interference observed at each of the subscriber units.

- base station 101 In order to optimize the strength of an RF signal received by a target subscriber unit (i.e., subscriber unit 105 ) from the target units serving base station (i.e., base station 101 ), and to minimize the interference of the RF signal with communications between the serving base station and other active subscriber units (e.g., subscribers unit 106 , 107 ) in the cell 111 corresponding to the serving base station, base station 101 employs an antenna array beamforming technique for the broadcast of the RF signal.
- the antenna array beamforming technique allows base station 101 to broadcast a narrowly focused signal to target subscriber unit 105 based on weighting coefficients assigned by the base station to each element 121 , 122 of the base stations antenna array 120 .
- a “joint optimization” embodiment weighting coefficients applicable to each of the multiple subscriber units 105 – 107 serviced by base station 101 , and respectively applied to a transmission to each of the subscriber units, are jointly optimized.
- the joint optimization of the weighting coefficients is performed by, and implemented at, serving base station 101 , and is preferably preformed by processor 206 of the base station.
- the weighting coefficients are optimized jointly at serving base station 101 .
- FIG. 4 is a logic flow diagram 400 of antenna beamforming steps executed by a transmitting communication device, such as base station 101 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the logic flow begins ( 401 ) when each of multiple receiving communication devices, that is, subscriber units 105 – 107 , transmits information to, and the transmitting communication device, that is, base station 101 , receives ( 402 ) from each subscriber unit, information concerning a propagation channel between the subscriber unit and each of the antenna elements 121 , 122 and the autocorrelation of background interference from AWGN and from cells other than the cell serviced by serving base station 101 , that is, from cells 112 and 113 .
- the background interference may include interference from sectors in cell 111 other than the sector in which the subscriber unit is located.
- a subscriber unit 105 – 107 measures the propagation channel between the subscriber unit and an array element 121 , 122 by correlating a signal received from the element with a known version of the signal. For example, base station 101 may transmit, via the element, a pilot code, such as a predetermined pilot Walsh code, or a sequence of pilot symbols that is known to the subscriber unit and that is assigned to the element. When the subscriber unit receives the transmitted signal, the subscriber unit correlates the received signal with the known pilot code or symbols. Based on the comparison, the subscriber unit then determines the signal distortion attributable to the channel.
- a pilot code such as a predetermined pilot Walsh code, or a sequence of pilot symbols that is known to the subscriber unit and that is assigned to the element.
- a subscriber unit 105 – 107 measures the autocorrelation of the background interference by demodulating a signal received from base station 101 (all channels) and subtracting the demodulated signal from an arriving signal.
- the resulting signal consists only of background interference, and the autocorrelation of this signal can be readily obtained by correlating the signal against itself.
- the subscriber unit may measure the autocorrelation by base station 101 periodically blanking its transmitted signal for short intervals of time. During the brief intervals in which the transmitted signal is turned off, the received signal consists only of background interference. Again, the interference autocorrelation can be measured by correlating the signal against itself.
- a subscriber unit 105 – 107 may measure the autocorrelation of the background interference by measuring the correlation of a received signal that is transmitted by base station 101 (by correlating the signal against itself). This correlation is the sum of the signal correlation function and the interference correlation function.
- the subscriber unit transmits both the channel propagation information and the received signal correlation function to base station 101 .
- Base station 101 computes the signal correlation for the transmitted signal, as observed at the subscriber, based on knowledge of both the propagation channel and the transmitted signal (e.g., a pilot signal).
- the interference correlation is then obtained by subtracting the computed correlation for the transmitted signal from the correlation function of the received signal.
- base station 101 determines ( 403 ) the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each subscriber unit for any power allocation and set of base station weighting coefficients as described in greater detail below.
- Base station 101 jointly optimizes ( 404 ) the weighting coefficients by selecting the weighting coefficients that yield a maximum value of a joint optimization SNR expression, as described in greater detail below.
- processor 206 conveys ( 405 ) the appropriate weighting coefficients to weighters 322 , 324 of base station 101 .
- Each wieghter 322 , 324 uses the weighting coefficient conveyed to the weighter by processor 206 to modulate ( 406 ) the signal being transmitted over the corresponding antenna array element 121 , 122 , which signal is then transmitted ( 407 ) via the corresponding array element, and the logic flow ends ( 408 ).
- base station 101 knows the loading of its corresponding cell 111 (i.e., the number of subscribers in the cell), or alternatively of the sector where target subscriber unit 105 is located. For example, assume that the data rate requirements for each of subscriber unit 105 – 107 are known, as are the data encoding and decoding schemes. With this information, the SNR requirements for each of subscriber units 105 – 107 are known. In this case, base station 101 first determines whether a feasible solution exists to the joint optimization of the optimal antenna array 120 weighting coefficients. In other words, base station 101 first determines whether any power and weighting allocation will meet the SNR requirements of all subscribers. When a feasible solution does exist, base station 101 can choose the solution that minimizes the total power transmitted by the base station.
- base station 101 may choose the power and weighting allocations which maximizes the percentage of the loading that can be met by the base station.
- approximations can be used to allow the weighting coefficients for the various subscribers to be optimized independently.
- base station 101 uses approximations ( 409 ) to determine an approximation of the joint optimization SNR expression.
- the approximations allow base station 101 to optimize ( 410 ) the weighting coefficients corresponding to each subscriber unit independent of the other subscriber units based on the approximation of the joint optimization SNR expression.
- Such an approach has an advantage of reducing the computational burden for base station 101 (although the computational burden placed on each subscriber units 105 – 107 may be slightly increased).
- Such an approach has a further advantage that independent optimization of the weighting coefficients utilized by base station 101 typically requires less uplink bandwidth for transmitting channel and interference information to the base station. If the optimal weighting coefficients are computed at the subscriber unit, only the weighting coefficients need be transmitted to the base station.
- Base station 101 determines weighting coefficients corresponding to each subscriber unit 105 – 107 by optimizing weighting coefficients w 1,i and w 2,i , respectively corresponding to multiple antenna array elements 121 , 122 for the subscriber unit, wherein “i” is an index corresponding to the i-th subscriber unit for which the weighting coefficients are being optimized.
- Processor 206 optimizes the weighting coefficients corresponding to i-th subscriber unit by determining the weighting coefficients w 1,i , w 2,i that maximize an SNR of an output of the matched filter Rake receiver of the subscriber unit, wherein the SNR is given by the following joint optimization expression of the SNR (wherein the index, i, is arbitrarily set to 1, corresponding to the first subscriber unit, for the purpose of illustrating the principles of the present invention),
- the vectors ⁇ tilde over (f) ⁇ 1 and ⁇ tilde over (f) ⁇ 2 denote the respective propagation channels between the elements 121 , 122 of antenna array 120 and the subscriber unit of interest (i.e., the i-th subscriber unit, or in the terminology of equation (1), the first subscriber unit).
- K denote the number of communication channels occupied on the forward link
- K denote the set of amplitudes assigned to the communication, or spreading code, channels.
- the multiple subscriber units 105 – 107 are indexed such that the i-th Walsh code is assigned to the i-th subscriber unit.
- the propagation channels between each of the multiple elements 121 , 122 and the subscriber unit of interest are not required to have equal energy.
- a i ( A i ⁇ ( ⁇ f 1 ⁇ ⁇ 2 + ⁇ f ⁇ 2 ⁇ 2 ) ) 1 / 2 .
- Each of the K communication channels, or code channels, in system 100 is assigned a complex weighting coefficient corresponding to each antenna array element 121 , 122 .
- a pair of complex weighting coefficients ⁇ w 1,i , w 2,i ⁇ is assigned to each of the K code channels.
- Each weighting vector is required to have unit energy, so that
- 2 1 for all i.
- the weights ⁇ w 1,i , w 2,i ⁇ applied to the i-th code channel are chosen in such a way as to maximize the SNR at the output of the matched-filter Rake receiver for the i-th subscriber unit.
- the total power transmitted by the serving base station, that is, base station 101 is given by
- the above inequalities are useful in developing expressions for the optimal transmit weighting coefficients in cases in which the interference is dominated alternately by intra-cell and inter-cell interference. Since the weighting coefficients affect the level of intra-cell signal power observed by the subscriber, Î or , cannot be held constant during the optimization of ⁇ w 1,i , w 2,i ⁇ . However, with the above inequalities, the intra-cell interference observed by the i-th subscriber unit can be bounded above and below, so that ⁇ I or ⁇ Î or ⁇ I or . Thus, a subscriber environment dominated by inter-cell interference I oc can be investigated by forcing or I or /I oc ⁇ 0, since this implies that Î or /I oc ⁇ 0. Similarly, a subscriber environment dominated by intra-cell interference can be investigated by forcing I or /I oc ⁇ , since this implies that Î or /I oc ⁇ .
- the mean and variance of the multiple Rake fingers included in a Rake receiver must be evaluated in order to compute the SNR at the output of the matched-filter Rake receiver of each subscriber unit 105 – 107 .
- the vector R denote the length-M vector of the outputs of the multiple Rake fingers of the subscriber unit.
- N is the number of chips per symbols.
- the inter-cell interference is in general non-white because all of the CDMA signals from a given base station (an essentially white source) pass through a common channel en route to the subscriber unit. As a result, the inter-cell interference may be substantially non-white if dominated by a single base station. However, in order to simplify the analysis, the inter-cell interference is be assumed to be white, so that
- the weighting coefficients w 1,1 , w 2,1 can be optimized independently so long as values of E c /I or and I or /I oc are known, wherein E c is a power or energy of a desired signal, I or is a power or energy of the intra-cell interference, and I oc is a power or energy of the inter-cell interference
- a value of I or /I oc can be estimated as follows. First, base station 101 is blanked for a brief interval so that I oc can be measured by the subscriber unit of interest, that is, subscriber unit 105 . Subscriber unit 105 then measures the impulse response energy of signals received from each of the multiple array elements 121 – 122 (using a pilot signal allocated to each antenna) and transmits these energies back to base station 101 . With these values, I or can be calculated by subscriber unit 105 in one of several ways.
- subscriber unit 105 can transmit the energy values to base station 101 and the base station computes the value of I or and transmits the computed value back to the subscriber unit.
- base station 101 can transmit the weighting coefficients to subscriber unit 105 so that I or can be computed in the subscriber unit.
- subscriber unit 105 can compute the weighting coefficients for base station 101 .
- subscriber unit 105 knows the weighting coefficients used by base station 101 , and I or can be computed in the subscriber unit. Subscriber unit 105 then computes the ratio of I or /I oc from the separate estimates of I or and I oc .
- the problem of jointly optimizing the weighting coefficients for all subscribers 105 – 107 in a cell 111 or a sector can be translated into a set of independent optimization problems, whereby the weighting coefficients for each of subscriber unit 105 – 107 are independently optimized.
- the complexity of the resulting independent optimization depends on the approximation being used.
- the optimization problem can also be simplified by using a low geometry approximation, for which I or /I oc is approximately zero. However, since the low geometry approximation is infrequently applicable, the use of the other approximations yields more nearly optimal weighting coefficients.
- the SNR expressions herein are given for a CDMA signal, transmitted from an antenna array 120 , and received using a matched filter Rake receiver at a subscriber unit 105 – 107 .
- Each set of weighting coefficients are designed to maximize the SNR at the output of a matched-filter (Rake) receiver in a corresponding subscriber unit 105 – 107 .
- the SNR expressions yield the following results: (1) the SNR criteria which should be optimized in the selection of the weighting coefficients for antenna array 120 for each of subscriber units 105 – 107 , (2) the fact that when self-interference is considered, the weighting coefficients for antenna array 120 for each of subscriber units 105 – 107 can be optimized jointly, (3) the set of information which must be fed back from the subscriber units 105 – 107 to base station 101 in order compute the jointly optimal array weighting coefficients, (4) the SNR behavior of a subscriber unit 105 – 107 in environments dominated by self-interference (“high geometry” environments), and (5) robust approximations to the SNR which can be optimized independently, rather than jointly.
- ⁇ 2 A 1 2 ⁇ ( 1 - E c I or ) ⁇ ( ⁇ 1 , 1 + ⁇ 2 , 2 ) + I oc I or ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( m - l ) .
- This approximation is equal to ⁇ 2 when half of the output signal power of the serving base station, that is base station 101 , is transmitted over each of the two elements 121 , 122 of antenna array 120 and when the weighting vectors are randomly oriented so that
- each subscriber unit's weighting coefficients can be optimized independently from the other subscriber units.

- a serving base station i.e., base station 101
- a serving base station that includes a multiple element antenna array optimizes weighting coefficients that are applied to transmissions to each subscriber unit 105 – 107 serviced by the base station by determining the weighting coefficients that maximize an expression (equation (1)) for the exact SNR of the forward link (base station-to-subscriber unit) of the base station and the subscriber unit.
- Joint optimization preferably is implemented at serving base station 101 and is based on the base stations knowledge of the channels between itself and each of its subscribers, as well knowledge of the ratio I or /I oc observed at each of the subscribers. This information could be transmitted from each of the subscribers to the base station via a reverse link.
- weighting coefficients Due to its complexity, joint optimization of the weighting coefficients may have limited applicability. However, optimization criteria can be defined which allow the subscribers to be optimized independently rather than jointly. For example, more nearly optimal weighting coefficients can be computed by substituting the average interference covariance matrix into the expression for the SNR. Since the average interference covariance matrix does not depend on the transmit coefficients of the subscribers, each subscriber can be optimized independently from the others. Because this method accounts for self-interference, it yields a weighting that is more nearly optimal than the current methods of transmit antenna array weighting
Abstract
Description
This equation is derived as follows.
so that
∥f 1∥2 +∥f 2∥2=1.
The propagation channels between each of the
|w 1,i|2 +|w 2,i|2=1 for all i.
Ideally, the weights {w1,i, w2,i} applied to the i-th code channel are chosen in such a way as to maximize the SNR at the output of the matched-filter Rake receiver for the i-th subscriber unit. The total power transmitted by the serving base station, that is,
and the total power received by the i-th subscriber unit from this base station, Îor, is given by
Due to the interaction of the weighting coefficients {w1,i, w2,i}i=1 K and the channels f1 and f2, the received signal power Îor at the i-th subscriber unit depends on the weighting coefficients. Thus, unless the amplitude Ai is adjusted during the optimization of {w1,i, w2,i}, the intra-cell interference Îor will not be held constant at subscriber unit i. For this reason, a separate quantity Ior is defined as
Application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality then yields
and thus, for the definitions used here, Îor≦Ior. Also, it is apparent that
where
γ={∥αf 1 +βf 2∥:|α|2+|β|2=1}.
Note that γ>0 so long as the channels f1 and f2 are linearly independent.
γIor≦Îor≦Ior.
Thus, a subscriber environment dominated by inter-cell interference Ioc can be investigated by forcing or Ior/Ioc→0, since this implies that Îor/Ioc→0. Similarly, a subscriber environment dominated by intra-cell interference can be investigated by forcing Ior/Ioc→∞, since this implies that Îor/Ioc→∞.
fi,j=0 if j≦0 or j>M.
Let the vector R denote the length-M vector of the outputs of the multiple Rake fingers of the subscriber unit. Let μ denote the mean vector of R, which has components given by
μi =E(R 1)=N A 1(w 1,1 f 1,l +w 2,1 f 2,l).
where N is the number of chips per symbols. For random-orthogonal codes (Walsh codes with random spreading), the M×M correlation matrix Γ1,m has elements given by
where NIocφ((m−l) is the covariance of the inter-cell interference and noise. The inter-cell interference is in general non-white because all of the CDMA signals from a given base station (an essentially white source) pass through a common channel en route to the subscriber unit. As a result, the inter-cell interference may be substantially non-white if dominated by a single base station. However, in order to simplify the analysis, the inter-cell interference is be assumed to be white, so that
where Ioc denotes the power of the inter-cell interference. Let Ω denote the normalized covariance of the vector R, which is given by
Ω=E((R−μ)(R−μ)*/N I or)=(Γ−μμ*)/(N I or),
and has components
where the matrix Ψi,j has elements
Ω=Ω1+Ω2 k,
where the first term Ω1 is the contribution of the signal of the subscriber unit of interest to the covariance, and the second term Ω2 k is the contribution of all of the other subscriber units signals to the covariance. The SNR at the output of the matched filter Rake receiver of the subscriber unit of interest is given by
where the notation Ω1(w1,1w2,1) has been used to denote the fact that Ω1 is a function of the weighting coefficients {w1,1, w2,1}.
With this approximation, the SNR for the subscriber unit of interest no longer depends on the weighting coefficients used for the other subscriber units. As a result, the weighting coefficients w1,1, w2,1 can be optimized independently so long as values of Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc are known, wherein Ec is a power or energy of a desired signal, Ior is a power or energy of the intra-cell interference, and Ioc is a power or energy of the inter-cell interference
can be simplified further. In one such embodiment of the present invention, for high-speed data, almost all of the power in the serving cell, or the serving sector when the cell is sectorized, may be allocated to the subscriber unit of interest (a single user, or “high allocation,” embodiment) so that Ec/Ior is approximately 1. In such an embodiment, the following approximation may be used:
In another such embodiment of the present invention, where the subscriber unit of interest is located in a “high geometry” environment, that is, when Ior/Ioc is large, the following approximation may be used:
Combinations of these two cases can be considered as well.
This approximation is equal to Ω2 when half of the output signal power of the serving base station, that is
Since the expression does not depend on the transmit coefficients of the subscribers, each subscriber unit's weighting coefficients can be optimized independently from the other subscriber units.
Equation (6), corresponding to the SNR in the absence of intra-cell interference, is an expression of SNR of a
Because this matrix does not depend on the weighting coefficients of the other channels, there is no interaction between the weighting coefficient optimizations performed by the
Due to the dependence of the matrix Ω on {w1,1, w2,1}, no direct method exists for finding the optimal transmit weighting vector, and thus, in general, a search of the space
({w 1,1 ,w 2,1 }:|w 1,1|2 +|w 2,1|2=1). (10)
is required to determine the optimal weighting vector.
In this environment, it can reasonably be argued that
Ω=Ω1(w 1,1 ,w 2,1)+Ω2 k≈Ω2 k, (12)
so that Ω is approximately independent of {w1,1, w2,1}. With this approximation, the SNR at the output of the matched filter Rake receiver of the subscriber unit of interest becomes
where
The symmetric positive semi-definite matrix Φ has a unique symmetric positive semi-definite square root Λ, such that
Φ=ΛΛ.
If the positive semi-definite matrix Λ is positive definite, then Λ will have a uniquely defined inverse Λ−1. Let w denote the vector {w1,1, w2,1} and define the vector y such that
y=Λw.
With these definitions, it follows that
The upper bound in the above expression is met only if
y=αvmax,
for some complex scalar α, where vmax is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, λmax, of the matrix
The optimal weighting unit-energy transmit weighting vector is thus given by
and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio is given by
where the matrices Ψ1,1, Ψ1,2, and Ψ2,2 have been defined above.
The optimal vector of weighting coefficients for the above can be shown to be equivalent to the weighting vector which maximizes the ratio
where {circle around (x)} has been used to denote convolution, and TR * has been used to denote the time reverse conjugate of the given vector. In general, a search will be required to determine the optimal transmitter weighting coefficients.
f1={1,0}
f 2={1/√{square root over (2)},1/√{square root over (2)}}
The TxAA weighting vector is proportional to the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvector of the matrix
This matrix has eigenvalues and eigenvectors given by
Thus, the normalized TxAA vector wAA of weighting coefficients is given by
For the purposes of this example, it will be assumed that half of the total power allocate for code channels 2 through K is transmitted over each of the two antennas, so that
α1=α2=1.
Without loss of generality, the coefficient w1,j can be assumed to have zero phase. If the weighting coefficients {w2,j}j=2 K are randomly oriented with respect to each other, then the mean value of α3 will be zero. Thus, for the purposes of this example, it will be assumed that α3=0.
and the signal-to-noise ratio for selection transmit diversity (STD) is given by
Thus, the relative performance of TxAA and STD is given by
