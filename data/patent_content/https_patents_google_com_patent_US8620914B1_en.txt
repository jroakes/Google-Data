- FIG. 3 is another screenshot of a user interface to a marketplace of digital goods.
- FIG. 4 is another screenshot of a user interface to a marketplace of digital goods.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a process for making digital goods in a marketplace.
- FIG. 1 is a screenshot of a user interface 100 to a marketplace of digital goods.
- the user interface 100 can be displayed by a browser application that is executed by a computing device that may be connected to a network (e.g., the Internet).
- the browser application can open one or more tabs 102 , one of which may display the user interface to the marketplace when a user navigates to a webpage identified by a uniform resource locator (URL) that provides content to the browser so that the browser can display the user interface to the marketplace in the tab.
- URL uniform resource locator
- the content provided by the webpage to the user can include a plurality of icons 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, 106 F, 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E, 110 A, 110 B, 110 C that represent digital goods that can be downloaded from the webpage by the user for execution by a computing device controlled by the user.
- the digital goods can include applications that can be downloaded from the marketplace to a client computing device where they can be installed on the computing device for execution by a browser running on the computing device.
- Such applications can be known as “installable web applications,” because they are downloadable from the World Wide Web and may be able to access the World Wide Web when executing in the browser.
- the installable web applications may not run natively on the computing device after they have been downloaded, but rather they may be executed through a browser that runs on the computing device.
- the installable web applications can be displayed in a manner that is organized to help a user decide which applications may be useful or relevant to the user.
- the user interface 100 can include a category 112 of applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, 106 F that have been recently released in the marketplace and which a curator of the marketplace may deem to be especially noteworthy to users.
- the applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, 106 F shown in the category 112 can be limited to applications that have been released in the marketplace within a recent period of time (e.g. one week, one month, three months, six months).
- a subset of the applications that have been released into the marketplace within the recent period of time can be selected based on a variety of signals that indicate the noteworthiness of the selected applications to the user, and the selected subset of applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, 106 F can be displayed within the category 112 . That is, the applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, 106 F shown in the New and Noteworthy category 112 of the user interface 100 can be a subset of a larger number of applications that also could qualify as being new and noteworthy but which have not been selected for display in the user interface 100 .
- the user interface 100 can include a category 114 of applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E that have been selected to be featured for display in the user interface 100 .
- the applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E that are selected to be featured in the category 114 can be selected based on criteria evaluated by a curator of the market place. For example, the curator may select the applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E for display in the category 114 from a much larger set of applications based on the curator's opinion of the quality, popularity, or utility of the selected applications. In another implementation, the curator may select the applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E based upon payments made by developers of the applications in return for prominent display of the applications in the user interface 100 .
- the user interface 100 can include a category 116 of applications 110 A, 110 B, 110 C that have been selected for display in the category 116 of the user interface 100 based on a popularity ranking of the selected applications relative to other applications.
- the popularity ranking can be determined based on reviews of the applications by users who have downloaded and used the applications.
- the marketplace may request that users rate applications quantitatively using a system of one to five stars, where five stars is the highest rating, and one star is the lowest rating. Then, applications within the marketplace can be ranked based on their user rating. In one implementation, applications with the highest average rating can be ranked highest. In another implementation, applications with the highest number of five-star ratings can be ranked highest. Then, applications 110 A, 110 B, 110 C with the highest rankings can be selected for display in the user interface 100 of the marketplace.
- the user interface 100 of the marketplace also can include categories of applications in other subportions of the user interface 100 in which smaller icons are used to represent the applications that are used in categories 112 , 114 , 116 .
- category 118 can display “Favorite Paid Apps,” which can be applications for which a user must pay money before being able to download and install the application on the user's computing device.
- Applications listed in the Favorite Paid Apps category 118 can be the most frequently downloaded and/or most frequently installed applications for which the user must pay money.
- category 120 can display “Staff Picks,” which can be applications that are selected by a curator at the marketplace based on the selected applications being deemed especially interesting to users who visit the marketplace in search of applications.
- categories 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 120 can display a subset of applications that are categorized to fall within the category. Because screen space within the user interface is limited, only a subset of the applications that fall within a category may be displayed within the user interface 100 . However, by selecting a hyperlink associated with the category, more applications that fall within the category can be displayed to a user. For example, each category 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 120 is associated with a hyperlink labeled “All,” the selection of which may cause more applications that fall within the category to be displayed.
- an “Apps” section 122 can provide a list of hyperlinks, which each can be selected to display applications that belong to a category identified by the hyperlink.
- selection of the “Education” hyperlink 123 can cause a group of icons that represent applications related to educational topics to be displayed.
- an “Extensions” section 124 can provide a list of hyperlinks, which each can be selected to display extensions that belong to a category identified by the hyperlink, where an extension is executable code that extends the functionality of a browser.
- selection of the “Sports” hyperlink 125 can cause a group of icons that represent extensions related to sports topics to be displayed.
- digital goods e.g., Web applications and extensions
- digital goods also can be located as a result of a query for goods that may be of interest to the user. For example, a user may enter query terms into an query box 126 that may receive the query terms and pass the terms onto a search engine that then locates digital goods that match the query terms and that are available in the marketplace.
- digital goods such as web applications can have a variety of metadata associated with them that are used to index the digital goods, and the query terms can be compared to the metadata associated with the digital goods. Based on the comparison, applications that best match the query terms can be selected from the digital goods available in the marketplace, and the selected goods can be presented to the user in the user interface 100 .
- the user interface 100 also includes a hyperlink 127 that can be selected so that the user can log into the marketplace.
- selection of the hyperlink 127 can trigger the display of a prompt to the user to enter a username and password, and successful entry of the username and password may allow the user to log into a personal account associated the marketplace.
- digital goods can be selected and presented to the user within the user interface 100 , where the selection of the goods can be personalized to the user based on data associated with the user's account.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of an example embodiment of a system 200 for ranking digital goods in a marketplace.

- multiple documents can be displayed in individuals tabs 214 A, 214 B, 214 C. These tabs 214 A, 214 B, 214 C are typically displayed one at a time, and are selectable via a tab-bar which often resides above the contents of an individual window. That is, one selected tab 214 A is “forward-facing” and displays information or content to a user in the window 212 , with the content of other tabs 214 B, 214 C is “hidden.”
- the client computing devices 202 A, 202 B, 202 C may receive online content from one or more server computing devices 230 , 250 , 270 , that may be connected to the client device 202 through a network 290 .
- Each of the client computing devices 202 A, 202 B, 202 C can be connected to the network 290 through a local Internet Service Provider 292 .
- the received online content can be processed and displayed in the window 212 (e.g., in a on a tab 214 of the window 212 ).
- the window 212 can display a user interface of a marketplace for digital goods, similar to the user interface of the marketplace described herein, to a user.
- a user can interact with the displayed content, and an activity metadata generator 218 can monitor the user's interactions with the content and the performance of the application 210 and can generate activity metadata based on the user's interactions with the content and based on the performance of the application 210 .
- a location of the client computing device 202 A can be determined based on a location associated with the ISP 292 .

- the marketplace server 250 can include a repository for database of digital goods 258 , and the digital goods can be served from, or downloaded from, the repository to the client computing devices.
- the digital goods can be stored in, and serve to client computing devices from, a repository that is remotely located from the marketplace server.
- digital goods could be stored and served to client computing devices from individual repositories that are operated and controlled by developers of the digital goods, and digital goods repository 258 of the marketplace server 250 can provide just a reference to the individual repositories that are operated by the developers.
- the marketplace server 250 can include a metadata database 260 that stores metadata associated with the digital goods that are available from or referenced by the digital goods repository 258 .
- the metadata associated with a digital good can include a variety of information about the digital goods including, for example, information about the digital goods that are available from the repository 258 . Such information can include, for example, representative keywords associated with the digital goods, the price associated with the digital goods.
- the metadata may also include demographic data about targeted users of the digital good, a time of year month or day during which the digital goods may be of the highest interest to a user, etc. For example, metadata associated with the surfing videogame may indicate that the good is intended for use by male users between the ages of 15 and 34, who live in coastal California or Hawaii, and that the game may be more popular during summer months than during winter months.
- the marketplace server 250 can include query handler 262 that can be configured to receive and process queries for digital goods available in the marketplace.
- the query handler can receive queries for digital goods that are entered into query box 126 of the user interface 100 shown in FIG. 1 .
- Terms or phrases of the queries then can be compared to terms and phrases (e.g., terms and phrases stored in the metadata database 260 ) that are used to index the digital goods available in the marketplace. Based on the comparison, a subset of digital goods can be selected from the database 258 with which to respond to the query.
- the marketplace server 250 can include a ranking engine 264 that is configured to rank digital goods based on signals relevant to the relative desirability of the goods to a user, where at least one of the signals is based on information that is generated outside the marketplace. For example, the goods can be ranked based on their price in the marketplace, but such a signal such as price is generated within the marketplace because the prices relevant only within the marketplace. However, as described herein, other signals can be generated outside the marketplace and used by the ranking engine to rank the relative desirability of goods to a user.
- the marketplace 250 can include a presentation engine 266 that prepares information for transmission to the client computing devices 202 A, 202 B, 202 C, where the information is used by the client computing devices to display a user interface 100 that shows representations of selected digital goods available in the marketplace.
- the presentation engine 266 can prepare HTML code, XML code, etc. that determines the information that is displayed to a user in the user interface 100 and where the code determines which digital goods will be displayed in the user interface 100 to the user.
- the ranking engine 264 can use a variety of signals to rank the relative desirability to the user of different digital applications available in the marketplace, where some of the signals can be based on information that is generated outside of the marketplace. In one implementation, the signals used by the ranking engine 264 can be based on how a web application available from the marketplace is used by a client computing device or how a web application performs when utilized by a client computing device.
- a signal used by the ranking engine can be based on how often a digital good available from the marketplace is used on a client computing device 202 A, 202 B, 202 C, after the digital good is downloaded from the digital goods repository 258 to the client computing device for execution on the client. For example, when a web application is downloaded from the repository 258 and is executed by a browser application 210 running on the client device 202 A, the browser application can monitor each time the web application is launched within the browser and can report this information to the ranking engine 264 . The ranking engine 264 then can rank the applications based on how often they are launched by client devices after they are downloaded. For example, an application that is launched frequently can be ranked higher than an application is launched less frequently.
- the browser application 210 also can monitor and gather information about how often a user interacts with a web application after the web application has been downloaded from the digital goods database 258 and launched within a browser application 210 of the client computing device 202 A.
- the browser application 210 can provide a window 212 that can include multiple tabs 214 A, 214 B, 214 C where one tab can be front-facing while other tabs are hidden.
- the browser application 210 can monitor how often a web application that is launched in the browser is front-facing, as opposed to hidden, and this information can be provided to the ranking engine 264 to provide an indication of how often a user interacts with the web application.
- the ranking engine 264 then can rank with applications based on how frequently a user interacts with the applications after they are downloaded. For example, an application with which a user interacts frequently can be ranked higher than an application with which a user interacts less frequently.
- a signal used by the ranking engine can be based on at least one application performance metric.
- application performance metrics may include: a rate at which a web application available from the marketplace crashes while being executed by a client computing device 202 A, 202 B, 202 C, a response time of a web application while being executed by a client computing device 202 A, 202 B, 202 C, or a system resource (e.g., processor usage, network bandwidth usage, etc.) usage or consumption a web application while being executed by a client computing device 202 A, 202 B, 202 C, etc.
- a system resource e.g., processor usage, network bandwidth usage, etc.
- a signal used by the ranking engine can be based on a rate at which a web application available from the marketplace crashes while being executed by a client computing device 202 A, 202 B, 202 C.

- information may be provided from the client computing device 202 A to the server 250 only if the user of the client device specifically authorizes the transmission of such information from the client to the server.
- the browser application 210 can communicate easily over the network 290 , the browser application can provide feedback to the ranking engine 264 of the marketplace server about the local usage of the web application on the client computing device.
- the ranking engine 264 can gather a great deal of information about how an application is actually used after it is downloaded from the marketplace server 250 .
- the ranking engine 264 has the ability to rank digital goods available from the marketplace server 250 based on signals relevant to the relative desirability of different applications to users, where such signals can include signals based on information about how applications are actually used, or how applications actually perform, after the applications are downloaded from the marketplace server 250 and installed on a client computing device.
- the ranking of the digital goods in the marketplace can be somewhat more objective than rankings based on subjective user reviews based on users' experience with the web application, which users may enter directly into the marketplace server 250 (e.g., by adding metadata information about a digital goods to the metadata database 260 ).
- signals are but a few examples of signals based on information that is generated outside of the marketplace and that is relevant to the relative desirability to the user of different applications that are available from the marketplace.
- Other signals also can be used by the ranking engine 264 .
- signals based on information that is generated outside of the marketplace and that are used by the ranking engine 264 for ranking the relative desirability of digital goods available marketplace can include signals based on information provided by a search engine.
- signals based on information provided by a search engine can be based on recent trends in query terms received through a search engine.

- the search engine server 230 can monitor the query terms and phrases received from client devices, and based on the query term traffic the search engine server 230 can generate statistics about trends in users' interests.
- search engine traffic may reveal that users are becoming more interested in discovering information about the singer.
- search engine traffic received to the search engine server 230 can automatically reveal the increase in the popularity.
- search engine trends can be driven by seasonal factors, such as search queries for “costumes” rising in the weeks before Halloween, or queries for the purchase of products rising during the winter holiday season.
- Such trends in query term traffic can be provided by the search engine server to the marketplace server 250 , so that the ranking engine 264 of the marketplace server can rank digital goods available in the marketplace based on trends in query traffic.
- the ranking engine 264 can boost or lower the relative ranking of individual digital goods available in the marketplace will 250 based on search engine traffic.
- search engine traffic reveals that a game or a movie is becoming popular, and such information is provided to the ranking engine 264
- the ranking engine can boost the ranking of web applications that are related to the game or the movie.
- signals based on information that is generated outside of the marketplace and that are used by the ranking engine 264 for ranking the relative desirability of digital goods available marketplace can include signals based on information provided by a social network applications or servers.
- signals based on information provided by a social network applications or servers can be based on how digital goods are used by acquaintances of a particular user, and the rankings performed by the ranking engine 264 can be based on such signals and can be specifically tailored for the particular user.
- the system 200 can include a social network server 270 that includes one or more processors to 272 , one or more memories 274 , an operating system 276 , and a social network application 278 .
- the social network application 272 can provide a network, environment, virtual world through which a particular user can interact with selected colleagues, friends, acquaintances (collectively, “friends”) of the particular user. For example, the particular user can exchange information with his or her friends about interests that they may share.
- a user that downloads a digital good from the marketplace server 250 and installs and executes the digital goods within a client computing device controlled by the user may recommend the web application to the user's friends.
- Such recommendations pass through the social application 278 , and anonymous information about such recommendations can be gathered by the social network server 270 and then passed on to the ranking engine 264 .
- the ranking engine then can base its rankings of digital goods in the marketplace on statistical information about such recommendations.
- the ranking engine 264 can boost the ranking of a web application that has received a large number of recommendations within the context of a social network application 278 .
- the ranking engine 264 can boost a user-specific ranking of a web application when the web application has been recommended frequently within the context of a social network application by friends of the specific user to their friends.
- the ranking engine 264 also can use other signals that are generated outside of the marketplace to generate rankings of digital goods available in the marketplace.
- the ranking engine 264 can provide rankings specific to a user of digital goods that are available within the marketplace, where the rankings are based in some way on information that is associated with the user and that is generated outside the marketplace.
- the information associated with the user may include information that the user actively provides or enters (e.g., the user's age, one or more user entered preferences, likes or dislikes, etc.).
- the information associated with a user may include information inferred from user actions (e.g., the user's browsing history, the user clicking on advertisements, etc.) or passively gathered about the user (e.g., the user's location, etc.).
- user actions e.g., the user's browsing history, the user clicking on advertisements, etc.

- a location of a user can be determined in a number of ways, including by the location generator 216 or based on a location associated with the ISP 292 through which the user's client device communicates with a network 290 .
- the location of a user can be compared to metadata associated with digital goods so that the relevance of digital goods to the user can be ranked based on the user's location.
- an application that calculates marine tides generally be of low relevance to a particular user who lives far from the coast, and accordingly should be ranked low for theoxy user by the ranking engine.
- a marine tide web application that is associated with metadata indicating that the application is relevant to coastal users, would have a relatively low ranking for the user.
- information associated with the user can include a browsing history of the user that provides information about content (e.g., websites) that the user has accessed through a browser application 210 . Metadata about the accessed content, or the content itself, can be compared to metadata associated with digital goods available in the marketplace. Based on the comparison, the ranking engine 264 can provide rankings of the available digital goods to a user that are individually-tailored to the interests of the user, as determined from the browsing history of the user. For example, if the browsing history reveals that the particular user is primarily interested in playing computer or video games, then the ranking engine can boost the user-specific rankings of game applications that are available in the marketplace.
- the information that is provided by an application 210 running on a client device to the marketplace server 250 can be provided on an opt-in basis.
- such information may be provided from the client computing device 202 A to the server 250 only if the user of the client device specifically authorizes the transmission of such information from the client to the server.
