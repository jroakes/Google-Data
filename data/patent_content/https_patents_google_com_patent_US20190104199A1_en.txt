- Systems and methods of the present disclosure relate generally to a data processing system that identifies an optimal transmission modality for data packet (or other protocol based) transmission in a voice activated computer network environment.
- the data processing system can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data packet transmission over one or more computer networks by, for example, selecting a transmission modality from a plurality of options for data packet routing through a computer network of content items to one or more client computing device, or to different interfaces (e.g., different apps or programs) of a single client computing device.
- digital components are transmitted to and displayed by computing device a predetermined number of times to achieve an outcome.
- a digital component (or a group of related digital components) may need to be displayed five times within a given time interval such that a user remembers the subject matter of the digital components.
- Content items can also be referred to as digital components.
- a digital component can be a component of a content item.
- the data processing system can also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the data packet transmissions over one of more computer networks by, for example, determining not to transmit digital components to a computing device. For example, the data processing system can select to not transmit a digital component to a computing device, and save bandwidth and computational resources, if the data processing system determines the digital component will not be display the predetermined number of times to achieve the outcome.
- the data processing system can also select digital components such that the digital components are presented the predetermined number of times, such that bandwidth is not wasted by transmitted digital components that have little chance of reaching the predetermined number of exposure times.
- Data packets or other protocol based signals corresponding to the selected operations can be routed through a computer network between multiple computing devices.
- the data processing system can route a content item to a different interface than an interface from which a request was received.
- the different interface can be on the same client computing device or a different client computing device from which a request was received.
- the data processing system can select at least one candidate interface from a plurality of candidate interfaces for content item transmission to a client computing device.
- the candidate interfaces can be determined based on technical or computing parameters such as processor capability or utilization rate, memory capability or availability, battery status, available power, network bandwidth utilization, interface parameters or other resource utilization values.
- the data processing system can reduce network bandwidth usage, latency, or processing utilization or power consumption of the client computing device that renders the content item. This saves processing power and other computing resources such as memory, reduces electrical power consumption by the data processing system and the reduced data transmissions via the computer network reduces bandwidth requirements and usage of the data processing system.
- the systems and methods described herein can include a data processing system that receives an input audio query, which can also be referred to as an input audio signal. From the input audio query the data processing system can identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request. Based on the trigger keyword or the request, the data processing system can generate a first action data structure.
- the first action data structure can include an organic response to the input audio query received from a client computing device, and the data processing system can provide the first action data structure to the same client computing device for rendering as audio output via the same interface from which the request was received.
- the data processing system can select a candidate interface as a selected interface for presentation or rendering of the content item. For example, the data processing system can convert or provide the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the selected interface.
- the selected interface can be an interface of the same client computing device that originated the input audio signal or a different client computing device.
- the data processing system selects a destination for the content item in a manner that can use the least amount of processing power, memory, or bandwidth from available options, or that can conserve power of one or more client computing devices.
- the data processing system can provide the content item or the first action data structure by packet or other protocol based data message transmission via a computer network to a client computing device.
- the output signal can cause an audio driver component of the client computing device to generate an acoustic wave, e.g., an audio output, which can be output from the client computing device.
- the audio (or other) output can correspond to the first action data structure or to the content item.
- the first action data structure can be routed as audio output, and the content item can be routed as a text based message.
- the data processing system can conserve resources utilized by each interface, relative to providing both the first action data structure and the content item to the same interface. This results in fewer data processing operations, less memory usage, or less network bandwidth utilization by the selected interfaces (or their corresponding devices) than would be the case without separation and independent routing of the first action data structure and the content item.
- Service Providers can determine goals for exposure to certain digital components or groups of digital components within their content campaigns. Service Providers may also determine a strategy for what times to serve the digital components to meet their goals for exposure. The strategy may be based on previous exposures of the digital components to the users.
- the service provider can determine a minimum number of exposures for an interval of time.
- the service provider may also determine a maximum aggregate bid value for each user.
- a digital component server determines the probability that a user will meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. Given the probability, the digital component server adjusts bidding within the service provider's maximum aggregate bid value for each user that meets the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time.

- Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and implementations of, methods, apparatuses, and systems for multi-modal transmission of packetized data in a voice activated data packet based computer network environment. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure relate generally to a data processing system that identifies an optimal transmission modality for data packet (or other protocol based) transmission in a voice activated computer network environment. The data processing system can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data packet transmission over one or more computer networks by, for example, selecting a transmission modality from a plurality of options for data packet routing through a computer network of content items to one or more client computing device, or to different interfaces (e.g., different apps or programs) of a single client computing device. In some implementations, digital components are transmitted to and displayed by computing device a predetermined number of times to achieve an outcome. For example, a digital component (or a group of related digital components) may need to be displayed five times within a given time interval such that a user remembers the subject matter of the digital components. Content items can also be referred to as digital components. In some implementations, a digital component can be a component of a content item. The data processing system can also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the data packet transmissions over one of more computer networks by, for example, determining not to transmit digital components to a computing device. For example, the data processing system can select to not transmit a digital component to a computing device, and save bandwidth and computational resources, if the data processing system determines the digital component will not be display the predetermined number of times to achieve the outcome. The data processing system can also select digital components such that the digital components are presented the predetermined number of times, such that bandwidth is not wasted by transmitted digital components that have little chance of reaching the predetermined number of exposure times.
- Data packets or other protocol based signals corresponding to the selected operations can be routed through a computer network between multiple computing devices. For example, the data processing system can route a content item to a different interface than an interface from which a request was received. The different interface can be on the same client computing device or a different client computing device from which a request was received. The data processing system can select at least one candidate interface from a plurality of candidate interfaces for content item transmission to a client computing device. The candidate interfaces can be determined based on technical or computing parameters such as processor capability or utilization rate, memory capability or availability, battery status, available power, network bandwidth utilization, interface parameters or other resource utilization values. By selecting an interface to receive and provide the content item for rendering from the client computing device based on candidate interfaces or utilization rates associated with the candidate interfaces, the data processing system can reduce network bandwidth usage, latency, or processing utilization or power consumption of the client computing device that renders the content item. This saves processing power and other computing resources such as memory, reduces electrical power consumption by the data processing system and the reduced data transmissions via the computer network reduces bandwidth requirements and usage of the data processing system.
- The systems and methods described herein can include a data processing system that receives an input audio query, which can also be referred to as an input audio signal. From the input audio query the data processing system can identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request. Based on the trigger keyword or the request, the data processing system can generate a first action data structure. For example, the first action data structure can include an organic response to the input audio query received from a client computing device, and the data processing system can provide the first action data structure to the same client computing device for rendering as audio output via the same interface from which the request was received.
- The data processing system can also select at least one content item based on the trigger keyword or the request. The data processing system can identify or determine a plurality of candidate interfaces for rendering of the content item(s). The interfaces can include one or more hardware or software interfaces, such as display screens, audio interfaces, speakers, applications or programs available on the client computing device that originated the input audio query, or on different client computing devices. The interfaces can include java script slots for online documents for the insertion of content items, as well as push notification interfaces. The data processing system can determine utilization values for the different candidate interfaces. The utilization values can indicate power, processing, memory, bandwidth, or interface parameter capabilities, for example. Based on the utilization values for the candidate interfaces the data processing system can select a candidate interface as a selected interface for presentation or rendering of the content item. For example, the data processing system can convert or provide the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the selected interface. The selected interface can be an interface of the same client computing device that originated the input audio signal or a different client computing device. By routing data packets via a computing network based on utilization values associated with a candidate interface, the data processing system selects a destination for the content item in a manner that can use the least amount of processing power, memory, or bandwidth from available options, or that can conserve power of one or more client computing devices.
- The data processing system can provide the content item or the first action data structure by packet or other protocol based data message transmission via a computer network to a client computing device. The output signal can cause an audio driver component of the client computing device to generate an acoustic wave, e.g., an audio output, which can be output from the client computing device. The audio (or other) output can correspond to the first action data structure or to the content item. For example, the first action data structure can be routed as audio output, and the content item can be routed as a text based message. By routing the first action data structure and the content item to different interfaces, the data processing system can conserve resources utilized by each interface, relative to providing both the first action data structure and the content item to the same interface. This results in fewer data processing operations, less memory usage, or less network bandwidth utilization by the selected interfaces (or their corresponding devices) than would be the case without separation and independent routing of the first action data structure and the content item.
- Service Providers can determine goals for exposure to certain digital components or groups of digital components within their content campaigns. Service Providers may also determine a strategy for what times to serve the digital components to meet their goals for exposure. The strategy may be based on previous exposures of the digital components to the users.
- The exposures may be determined by a number of devices, e.g., a set-top box, a television, a web page, etc. used to serve the digital components. The devices may include a database to store the number of exposures and the time of exposure.
- Based on the number of exposures of digital components, service providers can determine or update strategies for their proposed, e.g., yet to be served, digital components. For example, service providers concerned with delivering a message believe that users may need to be exposed to the message a minimum number of times, in a given period of time, before the user is aware of the message. Although a click would count as a recognition of the message, clicks are not a reliable source to estimate the minimum number of exposures, e.g., clicks are infrequent and do not acknowledge every time a user is exposed to the message and does not click on the message.
- In a general overview, the service provider can determine a minimum number of exposures for an interval of time. The service provider may also determine a maximum aggregate bid value for each user. A digital component server determines the probability that a user will meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. Given the probability, the digital component server adjusts bidding within the service provider's maximum aggregate bid value for each user that meets the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time.

FIG. 1A is a block diagram of acomputer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation.System 100 includesclient computing device 102, which may communicate with other computing devices via anetwork 106. For example,client computing device 102 may communicate with one or more content sources ranging from a contentprovider computing device 108 up to annth content source 110. Contentprovider computing devices 108 may provide webpages and/or media content (e.g., audio, video, and other forms of digital content) toclient computing devices 102.System 100 may include adata processing system 104, which provides digital component data to other computing devices overnetwork 106. -
Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information betweenclient computing device 102,data processing system 104, and contentprovider computing devices 108.

For example,client computing device 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices innetwork 106. -
Client computing device 102 may be any number of different user electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, etc.).Client computing device 102 is shown to include aprocessor 112 and amemory 114, e.g., a processing circuit.Memory 114 stores machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112,cause processor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ASIC, FPGA, read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), electrically-erasable ROM (EEPROM), erasable-programmable ROM (EPROM), flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer-programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python and Visual Basic. -
Client computing device 102 may include one or more user interface devices. In general, a user interface device refers to any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to a housing of client computing device 102 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client computing device 102 (e.g., a monitor connected toclient computing device 102, a speaker connected toclient computing device 102, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client computing device 102 may include anelectronic display 116, which visually displays webpages using webpage data received from contentprovider computing devices 108 and/or fromdata processing system 104. - Content
provider computing devices 108 are electronic devices connected to network 106 and provide media content toclient computing device 102. For example, contentprovider computing devices 108 may be computer servers (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or other devices that include a processing circuit. Media content may include, but is not limited to, webpage data, a movie, a sound file, pictures, and other forms of data. Similarly,data processing system 104 may include a processing circuit including aprocessor 112 and amemory 114. In some implementations,data processing system 104 may include several computing devices (e.g., a data center, a network of servers, etc.). In such a case, the various devices ofdata processing system 104 may comprise a processing circuit (e.g.,processor 112 represents the collective processors of the devices andmemory 114 represents the collective memories of the devices). -
Data processing system 104 may provide digital components toclient computing device 102 vianetwork 106. For example, contentprovider computing device 108 may provide a webpage toclient computing device 102, in response to receiving a request for a webpage fromclient computing device 102. In some implementations, a digital component fromdata processing system 104 may be provided toclient computing device 102 indirectly. For example, contentprovider computing device 108 may receive digital component data fromdata processing system 104 and use the digital component as part of the webpage data provided toclient computing device 102. In other implementations, a digital component fromdata processing system 104 may be provided toclient computing device 102 directly. For example, contentprovider computing device 108 may provide webpage data toclient computing devices 102 that includes a command to retrieve a digital component fromdata processing system 104. On receipt of the webpage data,client computing device 102 may retrieve a digital component fromdata processing system 104 based on the command and display the digital component when the webpage is rendered ondisplay 116. - According to various implementations, a user of
client computing device 102 may search for, access, etc. various documents (e.g., web pages, web sites, articles, images, video, etc.) using a search engine vianetwork 106. The web pages may be displayed as a search result from a search engine query containing search terms or keywords. Search engine queries may allow the user to enter a search term or keyword into the search engine to execute a document search. Search engines may be stored inmemory 114 ofdata processing system 104 and may be accessible withclient computing device 102. The result of an executed website search on a search engine may include a display on a search engine document of links to websites. Executed search engine queries may result in the display of digital component data generated and transmitted fromdata processing system 104. In some cases, search engines contract with service providers to display digital component to users of the search engine in response to certain search engine queries. - In other implementations, digital component may be displayed in a publication (e.g., a third-party web page) as in a display network. For example, a number of web pages and applications may show relevant digital components. The digital components may be matched to the web pages and other placements, such as mobile computing applications, according to relevant content or themes of the web pages. Specific web pages about specific topics may display the digital component. The digital component may be shown to all the web pages or a select number of web pages.
- In another implementation, service providers may purchase or bid on the search terms such as keyword entries entered by users into a document such as a search engine. When the search term or keyword are entered into the document, then digital component data such as links to a service provider website may be displayed to the user. In some implementations,
data processing system 104 may use an auction model that generates a digital component. Service Providers may bid on keywords using the auction model. The auction model may also be adjusted to reflect the maximum amount a service provider is willing to spend so that a user is exposed to a digital component a minimum number of times. -

provider computing device 160 can include at least one service provider natural language processor (NLP) component 161 and at least oneservice provider interface 162. The service provider NLP component 161 (or other components such as a direct action API of the service provider computing device 160) can engage with the client computing device 102 (via thedata processing system 104 or bypassing the data processing system 104) to create a back-and-forth real-time voice or audio based conversation (e.g., a session) between theclient computing device 102 and the serviceprovider computing device 160. For example, theservice provider interface 162 can receive or provide data messages (e.g., action data structures or content items) to thedirect action API 135 of thedata processing system 104. Thedirect action API 135 can also generate the action data structures independent from or without input from the serviceprovider computing device 160. The serviceprovider computing device 160 and the contentprovider computing device 108 can be associated with the same entity. For example, the contentprovider computing device 108 can create, store, or make available content items for beach relates services, such as sunscreen, beach towels or bathing suits, and the serviceprovider computing device 160 can establish a session with theclient computing device 102 to respond to a voice input query about the weather at the beach, directions for a beach, or a recommendation for an area beach, and can provide these content items to the end user of theclient computing device 102 via an interface of the sameclient computing device 102 from which the query was received, a different interface of the sameclient computing device 102, or an interface of a different client computing device. Thedata processing system 104, via thedirect action API 135, theNLP component 110 or other components can also establish the session with the client computing device, including or bypassing the serviceprovider computing device 160, to for example, to provide an organic response to a query related to the beach. - The
data repository 145 can include one or more local or distributed databases, and can include a database management system. Thedata repository 145 can include computer data storage or memory and can store one ormore parameters 146, one ormore policies 147,content data 148, ortemplates 149 among other data. Theparameters 146,policies 147, andtemplates 149 can include information such as rules about a voice based session between theclient computing device 102 and the data processing system 104 (or the service provider computing device 160). Thecontent data 148 can include content items for audio output or associated metadata, as well as input audio messages that can be part of one or more communication sessions with theclient computing device 102. - The
system 100 can optimize processing of action data structures and content items in a voice activated data packet (or other protocol) environment. For example, thedata processing system 104 can include or be part of a voice activated assistant service, voice command device, intelligent personal assistant, knowledge navigator, event planning, or another assistant program. Thedata processing system 104 can provide one or more instances of action data structures as audio output for display from theclient computing device 102 to accomplish tasks related to an input audio signal. For example, the data processing system can communicate with the serviceprovider computing device 160 or other third party computing devices to generate action data structures with information about a beach, among other things. For example, an end user can enter an input audio signal into theclient computing device 102 of: “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend” and an action data structure can indicate the weekend weather forecast for area beaches, such as “it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach on Saturday, with high tide at 3 pm.” - The action data structures can include a number of organic or non-sponsored responses to the input audio signal. For example, the action data structures can include a beach weather forecast or directions to a beach. The action data structures in this example include organic or non-sponsored content that is directly responsive to the input audio signal. The content items responsive to the input audio signal can include sponsored or non-organic content, such as an offer to buy sunscreen from a convenience store located near the beach. In this example, the organic action data structure (beach forecast) is responsive to the input audio signal (a query related to the beach), and the content item (a reminder or offer for sunscreen) is also responsive to the same input audio signal. The
data processing system 104 can evaluatesystem 100 parameters (e.g., power usage, available displays, formats of displays, memory requirements, bandwidth usage, power capacity or time of input power (e.g., internal battery or external power source such as a power source from a wall output) to provide the action data structure and the content item to different candidate interfaces on the sameclient computing device 102, or to different candidate interfaces on differentclient computing devices 102. - The
data processing system 104 can include an application, script or program installed at theclient computing device 102, such as an app to communicate input audio signals (e.g., as data packets via a packetized or other protocol based transmission) to at least oneinterface 115 of thedata processing system 104 and to drive components of theclient computing device 102 to render output audio signals (e.g., for action data structures) or other output signals (e.g., content items). Thedata processing system 104 can receive data packets or other signal that includes or identifies an audio input signal. For example, thedata processing system 104 can execute or run theNLP component 110 to receive the audio input signal. - The
NLP component 110 can convert the audio input signal into recognized text by comparing the input signal against a stored, representative set of audio waveforms (e.g., in the data repository 145) and choosing the closest matches. The representative waveforms are generated across a large set of users, and can be augmented with speech samples. After the audio signal is converted into recognized text, theNLP component 110 can match the text to words that are associated, for example, via training across users or through manual specification, with actions that thedata processing system 104 can serve. - The audio input signal can be detected by the sensor 151 (e.g., a microphone) of the client computing device. Via the
transducer 152, theaudio driver 153, or other components theclient computing device 102 can provide the audio input signal to the data processing system 104 (e.g., via the network 106) where it can be received (e.g., by the interface 115) and provided to theNLP component 110 or stored in thedata repository 145 ascontent data 148. - The
NLP component 110 can receive or otherwise obtain the input audio signal. From the input audio signal, theNLP component 110 can identify at least one request or at least one trigger keyword corresponding to the request. The request can indicate intent or subject matter of the input audio signal. The trigger keyword can indicate a type of action likely to be taken. For example, theNLP component 110 can parse the input audio signal to identify at least one request to go to the beach for the weekend. The trigger keyword can include at least one word, phrase, root or partial word, or derivative indicating an action to be taken. For example, the trigger keyword “go” or “to go to” from the input audio signal can indicate a need for transport or a trip away from home. In this example, the input audio signal (or the identified request) does not directly express an intent for transport, however the trigger keyword indicates that transport is an ancillary action to at least one other action that is indicated by the request. - The prediction component 120 (or other mechanism of the data processing system 104) can generate, based on the request or the trigger keyword, at least one action data structure associated with the input audio signal. The action data structure can indicate information related to subject matter of the input audio signal. The action data structure can include one or more than one action, such as organic responses to the input audio signal. For example, the input audio signal “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend” can include at least one request indicating an interest for a beach weather forecast, surf report, or water temperature information, and at least one trigger keyword, e.g., “go” indicating travel to the beach, such as a need for items one may want to bring to the beach, or a need for transportation to the beach. The
prediction component 120 can generate or identify subject matter for at least one action data structure, an indication of a request for a beach weather forecast, as well as subject matter for a content item, such as an indication of a query for sponsored content related to spending a day at a beach. From the request or the trigger keyword the prediction component 120 (orother system 100 component such as theNLP component 110 or the direct action API 135) predicts, estimates, or otherwise determines subject matter for action data structures or for content items. From this subject matter, thedirect action API 135 can generate at least one action data structure and can communicate with at least one contentprovider computing device 108 to obtain at least onecontent item 110. Theprediction component 120 can access theparameters 146 orpolicies 147 in thedata repository 145 to determine or otherwise estimate requests for action data structures or content items. For example, theparameters 146 orpolicies 147 could indicate requests for a beach weekend weather forecast action or for content items related to beach visits, such as a content item for sunscreen. - The
content selector component 125 can obtain indications of any of the interest in or request for the action data structure or for the content item. For example, theprediction component 120 can directly or indirectly (e.g., via the data repository 145) provide an indication of the action data structure or content item to thecontent selector component 125. Thecontent selector component 125 can obtain this information from thedata repository 145, where it can be stored as part of thecontent data 148. The indication of the action data structure can inform thecontent selector component 125 of a need for area beach information, such as a weather forecast or products or services the end user may need for a trip to the beach. - From the information received by the
content selector component 125, e.g., an indication of a forthcoming trip to the beach, thecontent selector component 125 can identify at least one content item. The content item can be responsive or related to the subject matter of the input audio query. For example, the content item can include data message identifying as tore near the beach that has sunscreen, or offering a taxi ride to the beach. Thecontent selector component 125 can query thedata repository 145 to select or otherwise identify the content item, e.g., from thecontent data 148. Thecontent selector component 125 can also select the content item from the contentprovider computing device 108. For example, responsive to a query received from thedata processing system 104, the contentprovider computing device 108 can provide a content item to the data processing system 104 (or component thereof) for eventual output by theclient computing device 102 that originated the input audio signal, or for output to the same end user by a differentclient computing device 102. - The audio
signal generator component 130 can generate or otherwise obtain an output signal that includes the content item (as well as the action data structure) responsive to the input audio signal. For example, thedata processing system 104 can execute the audiosignal generator component 130 to generate or create an output signal corresponding to the action data structure or to the content item. Theinterface component 115 of thedata processing system 104 can provide or transmit one or more data packets that include the output signal via thecomputer network 106 to anyclient computing device 102. Theinterface 115 can be designed, configured, constructed, or operational to receive and transmit information using, for example, data packets. Theinterface 115 can receive and transmit information using one or more protocols, such as a network protocol. Theinterface 115 can include a hardware interface, software interface, wired interface, or wireless interface. Theinterface 115 can facilitate translating or formatting data from one format to another format. For example, theinterface 115 can include an application programming interface that includes definitions for communicating between various components, such as software components of thesystem 100. - The
data processing system 104 can provide the output signal including the action data structure from thedata repository 145 or from the audiosignal generator component 130 to theclient computing device 102. Thedata processing system 104 can provide the output signal including the content item from thedata repository 145 or from the audiosignal generator component 130 to the same or to a differentclient computing device 102. - The
data processing system 104 can also instruct, via data packet transmissions, the contentprovider computing device 108 or the serviceprovider computing device 160 to provide the output signal (e.g., corresponding to the action data structure or to the content item) to theclient computing device 102. The output signal can be obtained, generated, transformed to or transmitted as one or more data packets (or other communications protocol) from the data processing system 104 (or other computing device) to theclient computing device 102. - The
content selector component 125 can select the content item or the action data structure for the as part of a real-time content selection process. For example, the action data structure can be provided to theclient computing device 102 for transmission as audio output by an interface of theclient computing device 102 in a conversational manner in direct response to the input audio signal. The real-time content selection process to identify the action data structure and provide the content item to theclient computing device 102 can occur within one minute or less from the time of the input audio signal and be considered real-time. Thedata processing system 104 can also identify and provide the content item to at least one interface of theclient computing device 102 that originated the input audio signal, or to a differentclient computing device 102. - The action data structure (or the content item), For example, obtained or generated by the audio
signal generator component 130 transmitted via theinterface 115 and thecomputer network 106 to theclient computing device 102, can cause theclient computing device 102 to execute theaudio driver 153 to drive thespeaker 154 to generate an acoustic wave corresponding to the action data structure or to the content item. The acoustic wave can include words of or corresponding to the action data structure or content item. - The acoustic wave representing the action data structure can be output from the
client computing device 102 separately from the content item. For example, the acoustic wave can include the audio output of “Today it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach.” In this example, thedata processing system 104 obtains the input audio signal of, for example, “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend.” From this information, theNLP component 110 identifies at least one request or at least one trigger keyword, and theprediction component 120 uses the request(s) or trigger keyword(s) to identify a request for an action data structure or for a content item. The content selector component 125 (or other component) can identify, select, or generate a content item for, e.g., sunscreen available near the beach. The direct action API 135 (or other component) can identify, select, or generate an action data structure for, e.g., the weekend beach forecast. Thedata processing system 104 or component thereof such as the audiosignal generator component 130 can provide the action data structure for output by an interface of theclient computing device 102. For example, the acoustic wave corresponding to the action data structure can be output from theclient computing device 102. Thedata processing system 104 can provide the content item for output by a different interface of the sameclient computing device 102 or by an interface of a differentclient computing device 102. - The packet based data transmission of the action data structure by
data processing system 104 to theclient computing device 102 can include a direct or real-time response to the input audio signal of “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend” so that the packet based data transmissions via thecomputer network 106 that are part of a communication session between thedata processing system 104 and theclient computing device 102 with the flow and feel of a real-time person to person conversation. This packet based data transmission communication session can also include the contentprovider computing device 108 or the serviceprovider computing device 160. - The
content selector component 125 can select the content item or action data structure based on at least one request or at least one trigger keyword of the input audio signal. For example, the requests of the input audio signal “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend” can indicate subject matter of the beach, travel to the beach, or items to facilitate a trip to the beach. TheNLP component 110 or the prediction component 120 (or otherdata processing system 104 components executing as part of the direct action API 135) can identify the trigger keyword “go” “go to” or “to go to” and can determine a transportation request to the beach based at least in part on the trigger keyword. The NLP component 110 (orother system 100 component) can also determine a solicitation for content items related to beach activity, such as for sunscreen or beach umbrellas. Thus, thedata processing system 104 can infer actions from the input audio signal that are secondary requests (e.g., a request for sunscreen) that are not the primary request or subject of the input audio signal (information about the beach this weekend). - The action data structures and content items can correspond to subject matter of the input audio signal. The
direct action API 135 can execute programs or scripts, for example, from theNLP component 110, theprediction component 120, or thecontent selector component 125 to identify action data structures or content items for one or more of these actions. Thedirect action API 135 can execute a specified action to satisfy the end user's intention, as determined by thedata processing system 104. Depending on the action specified in its inputs, thedirect action API 135 can execute code or a dialog script that identifies the parameters required to fulfill a user request. Such code can lookup additional information, e.g., in thedata repository 145, such as the name of a home automation service, or it can provide audio output for rendering at theclient computing device 102 to ask the end user questions such as the intended destination of a requested taxi. Thedirect action API 135 can determine necessary parameters and can package the information into an action data structure, which can then be sent to another component such as thecontent selector component 125 or to the serviceprovider computing device 160 to be fulfilled. - The
direct action API 135 of thedata processing system 104 can generate, based on the request or the trigger keyword, the action data structures. The action data structures can be generated responsive to the subject matter of the input audio signal. The action data structures can be included in the messages that are transmitted to or received by the serviceprovider computing device 160. Based on the audio input signal parsed by theNLP component 110, thedirect action API 135 can determine to which, if any, of a plurality of serviceprovider computing devices 160 the message should be sent. For example, if an input audio signal includes “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend,” theNLP component 110 can parse the input audio signal to identify requests or trigger keywords such as the trigger keyword word “to go to” as an indication of a need for a taxi. Thedirect action API 135 can package the request into an action data structure for transmission as a message to a serviceprovider computing device 160 of a taxi service. The message can also be passed to thecontent selector component 125. The action data structure can include information for completing the request. In this example, the information can include a pick up location (e.g., home) and a destination location (e.g., a beach). Thedirect action API 135 can retrieve atemplate 149 from thedata repository 145 to determine which fields to include in the action data structure. Thedirect action API 135 can retrieve content from thedata repository 145 to obtain information for the fields of the data structure. Thedirect action API 135 can populate the fields from the template with that information to generate the data structure. Thedirect action API 135 can also populate the fields with data from the input audio signal. Thetemplates 149 can be standardized for categories of service providers or can be standardized for specific service providers. For example, ride sharing service providers can use the followingstandardized template 149 to create the data structure: {clientdeviceidentifier; authenticationcredentials; pickuplocation; destinationlocation; nopassengers; servicelevel}. - The
content selector component 125 can identify, select, or obtain multiple content items resulting from a multiple content selection processes. The content selection processes can be real-time, e.g., part of the same conversation, communication session, or series of communications sessions between thedata processing system 104 and theclient computing device 102 that involve common subject matter. The conversation can include asynchronous communications separated from one another by a period of hours or days, for example. The conversation or communication session can last for a time period from receipt of the first input audio signal until an estimated or known conclusion of a final action related to the first input audio signal, or receipt by thedata processing system 104 of an indication of a termination or expiration of the conversation. For example, thedata processing system 104 can determine that a conversation related to a weekend beach trip begins at the time or receipt of the input audio signal and expires or terminates at the end of the weekend, e.g., Sunday night or Monday morning. Thedata processing system 104 that provides action data structures or content items for rendering by one or more interfaces of theclient computing device 102 or of anotherclient computing device 102 during the active time period of the conversation (e.g., from receipt of the input audio signal until a determined expiration time) can be considered to be operating in real-time. In this example, the content selection processes and rendering of the content items and action data structures occurs in real time. - The
interface management component 140 can poll, determine, identify, or select interfaces for rendering of the action data structures and of the content items related to the input audio signal. For example, theinterface management component 140 can identify one or more candidate interfaces ofclient computing devices 102 associated with an end user that entered the input audio signal (e.g., “What is the weather at the beach today?”) into one of theclient computing devices 102 via an audio interface. The interfaces can include hardware such as sensor 151 (e.g., a microphone),speaker 154, or a screen size of a computing device, alone or combined with scripts or programs (e.g., the audio driver 153) as well as apps, computer programs, online documents (e.g., webpage) interfaces and combinations thereof. - The interfaces can include social media accounts, text message applications, or email accounts associated with an end user of the
client computing device 102 that originated the input audio signal. Interfaces can include the audio output of a smartphone, or an app based messaging device installed on the smartphone, or on a wearable computing device, among otherclient computing devices 102. The interfaces can also include display screen parameters (e.g., size, resolution), audio parameters, mobile device parameters, (e.g., processing power, battery life, existence of installed apps or programs, orsensor 151 orspeaker 154 capabilities), content slots on online documents for text, image, or video renderings of content items, chat applications, laptops parameters, smartwatch or other wearable device parameters (e.g., indications of their display or processing capabilities), or virtual reality headset parameters. - The
interface management component 140 can poll a plurality of interfaces to identify candidate interfaces. Candidate interfaces include interfaces having the capability to render a response to the input audio signal, (e.g., the action data structure as an audio output, or the content item that can be output in various formats including non-audio formats). Theinterface management component 140 can determine parameters or other capabilities of interfaces to determine that they are (or are not) candidate interfaces. For example, theinterface management component 140 can determine, based onparameters 146 of the content item or of a first client computing device 102 (e.g., a smartwatch wearable device), that the smartwatch includes an available visual interface of sufficient size or resolution to render the content item. Theinterface management component 140 can also determine that theclient computing device 102 that originated the input audio signal has aspeaker 154 hardware and installed program e.g., an audio driver or other script to render the action data structure. - The
interface management component 140 can determine utilization values for candidate interfaces. The utilization values can indicate that a candidate interface can (or cannot) render the action data structures or the content items provided in response to input audio signals. The utilization values can includeparameters 146 obtained from thedata repository 145 or other parameters obtained from theclient computing device 102, such as bandwidth or processing utilizations or requirements, processing power, power requirements, battery status, memory utilization or capabilities, or other interface parameters that indicate the available of an interface to render action data structures or content items. The battery status can indicate a type of power source (e.g., internal battery or external power source such as via an output), a charging status (e.g., currently charging or not), or an amount of remaining battery power. Theinterface management component 140 can select interfaces based on the battery status or charging status. - The
interface management component 140 can order the candidate interfaces in a hierarchy or ranking based on the utilization values. For example, different utilization values (e.g., processing requirements, display screen size, accessibility to the end user) can be given different weights. Theinterface management component 140 can rank one or more of the utilization values of the candidate interfaces based on their weights to determine an optimal corresponding candidate interface for rendering of the content item (or action data structure). Based on this hierarchy, theinterface management component 140 can select the highest ranked interface for rendering of the content item. - Based on utilization values for candidate interfaces, the
interface management component 140 can select at least one candidate interface as a selected interface for the content item. The selected interface for the content item can be the same interface from which the input audio signal was received (e.g., an audio interface of the client computing device 102) or a different interface (e.g., a text message based app of the sameclient computing device 102, or an email account accessible from the sameclient computing device 102. - The
interface management component 140 can select an interface for the content item that is an interface of a differentclient computing device 102 than the device that originated the input audio signal. For example, thedata processing system 104 can receive the input audio signal from a first client computing device 102 (e.g., a smartphone), and can select an interface such as a display of a smartwatch (or any other client computing device for rendering of the content item. The multipleclient computing devices 102 can all be associated with the same end user. Thedata processing system 104 can determine that multipleclient computing devices 102 are associated with the same end user based on information received with consent from the end user such as user access to a common social media or email account across multipleclient computing devices 102. - The
interface management component 140 can also determine that an interface is unavailable. For example, theinterface management component 140 can poll interfaces and determine that a battery status of aclient computing device 102 associated with the interface is low, or below a threshold level such as 10%. Or theinterface management component 140 can determine that theclient computing device 102 associated with the interface lacks sufficient display screen size or processing power to render the content item, or that the processor utilization rate is too high, as the client computing device is currently executing another application, For example, to stream content via thenetwork 106. In these and other examples theinterface management component 140 can determine that the interface is unavailable and can eliminate the interface as a candidate for rendering the content item or the action data structure. - Thus, the
interface management component 140 can determine that a candidate interface accessible by the firstclient computing device 102 is linked to an account of an end user, and that a second candidate interface accessible by a secondclient computing device 102 is also linked to the same account. For example, bothclient computing devices 102 may have access to the same social media account, e.g., via installation of an app or script at eachclient computing device 102. Theinterface management component 140 can also determine that multiple interfaces correspond to the same account, and can provide multiple, different content items to the multiple interfaces corresponding to the common account. For example, thedata processing system 104 can determine, with end user consent, that an end user has accessed an account from differentclient computing devices 102. These multiple interfaces can be separate instances of the same interface (e.g., the same app installed on different client computing devices 102) or different interfaces such as different apps for different social media accounts that are both linked to a common email address account, accessible from multipleclient computing devices 102. - The
interface management component 140 can also determine or estimate distances betweenclient computing devices 102 associated with candidate interfaces. For example, thedata processing system 104 can obtain, with user consent, an indication that the input audio signal originated from a smartphone or virtual realityheadset computing device 102, and that the end user is associated with an active smartwatchclient computing device 102. From this information, the interface management component can determine that the smartwatch is active, e.g., being worn by the end user when the end user enters the input audio signal into the smartphone, so that the twoclient computing devices 102 are within a threshold distance of one another. In another example, thedata processing system 104 can determine, with end user consent, the location of a smartphone that is the source of an input audio signal, and can also determine that a laptop account associated with the end user is currently active. For example, the laptop can be signed into a social media account indicating that the user is currently active on the laptop. In this example, thedata processing system 104 can determine that the end user is within a threshold distance of the smartphone and of the laptop, so that the laptop can be an appropriate choice for rendering of the content item via a candidate interface. - The
interface management component 140 can select the interface for the content item based on at least one utilization value indicating that the selected interface is the most efficient for the content item. For example, from among candidate interfaces, the interface to render the content item at the smartwatch uses the least bandwidth due as the content item is smaller and can be transmitted with fewer resources. Or theinterface management component 140 can determine that the candidate interface selected for rendering of the content item is currently charging (e.g., plugged in) so that rendering of the content item by the interface will not drain battery power of the correspondingclient computing device 102. In another example, theinterface management component 140 can select a candidate interface that is currently performing fewer processing operations than another, unselected interface of for example, a differentclient computing device 102 that is currently streaming video content from thenetwork 106 and therefore less available to render the content item without delay. - The interface management component 140 (or other
data processing system 104 component) can convert the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the candidate interface. For example, if the candidate interface is a display of a smartwatch, smartphone, or tablet computing device, theinterface management component 140 can size the content item for appropriate visual display given the dimensions of the display screen associated with the interface. Theinterface management component 140 can also convert the content item to a packet or other protocol based format, including proprietary or industry standard format for transmission to theclient computing device 102 associated with the selected interface. The interface selected by theinterface management component 140 for the content item can include an interface accessible from multipleclient computing devices 102 by the end user. For example, the interface can be or include a social media account that the end user can access via theclient computing device 102 that originated the input audio signal (e.g., a smartphone) as well as other client computing devices such as tabled or desktop computers or other mobile computing devices. - The
interface management component 140 can also select at least one candidate interface for the action data structure. This interface can be the same interface from which the input audio signal was obtained, e.g., a voice activated assistant service executed at aclient computing device 102. This can be the same interface or a different interface than theinterface management component 140 selects for the content item. The interface management component 140 (or otherdata processing system 104 components) can provide the action data structure to the sameclient computing device 102 that originated the input audio signal for rendering as audio output as part of the assistant service. Theinterface management component 140 can also transmit or otherwise provide the content item to the selected interface for the content item, in any converted modality appropriate for rendering by the selected interface. - Thus, the
interface management component 140 can provide the action data structure as audio output for rendering by an interface of theclient computing device 102 responsive to the input audio signal received by the sameclient computing device 102. Theinterface management component 140 can also provide the content item for rendering by a different interface of the sameclient computing device 102 or of a differentclient computing device 102 associated with the same end user. For example, the action data structure, e.g., “it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach on Saturday” can be provided for audio rendering by the client computing device as part of an assistant program interface executing in part at theclient computing device 102, and the content item e.g., a text, audio, or combination content item indicating that “sunscreen is available from the convenience store near the beach” can be provided for rendering by an interface of the same or adifferent computing device 102, such as an email or text message accessible by the same or a differentclient computing device 102 associated with the end user. - Separating the content item from the action data structure and sending the content item as, for example, a text message rather than an audio message can result in reduced processing power for the
client computing device 102 that accesses the content item since, for example, text message data transmissions are less computationally intensive than audio message data transmissions. This separation can also reduce power usage, memory storage, or transmission bandwidth used to render the content item. This results in increased processing, power, and bandwidth efficiencies of thesystem 100 and devices such as theclient computing devices 102 and thedata processing system 104. This increases the efficiency of the computing devices that process these transactions, and increases the speed with which the content items can be rendered. Thedata processing system 104 can process thousands, tens of thousands or more input audio signals simultaneously so the bandwidth, power, and processing savings can be significant and not merely incremental or incidental. - The
interface management component 140 can provide or deliver the content item to the same client computing device 102 (or a different device) as the action data structure subsequent to delivery of the action data structure to theclient computing device 102. For example, the content item can be provided for rendering via the selected interface upon conclusion of audio output rendering of the action data structure. Theinterface management component 140 can also provide the content item to the selected interface concurrent with the provision of the action data structure to theclient computing device 102. Theinterface management component 140 can provide the content item for delivery via the selected interface within a pre-determined time period from receipt of the input audio signal by theNLP component 110. The time period, for example, can be any time during an active length of the conversation of session. For example, if the input audio signal is “I would like to go to the beach this weekend” the pre-determined time period can be any time from receipt of the input audio signal through the end of the weekend, e.g., the active period of the conversation. The pre-determined time period can also be a time triggered from rendering of the action data structure as audio output by theclient computing device 102, such as within 5 minutes, one hour or one day of this rendering. - The
interface management component 140 can provide the action data structure to theclient computing device 102 with an indication of the existence of the content item. For example, thedata processing system 104 can provide the action data structure that renders at theclient computing device 102 to provide the audio output “it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach on Saturday, check your email for more information.” The phrase “check your email for more information” can indicate the existence of a content item, e.g., for sunscreen, provided by thedata processing system 104 to an interface (e.g., email). In this example, sponsored content can be provided as content items to the email (or other) interface and organic content such as the weather can be provided as the action data structure for audio output. - The
data processing system 104 can also provide the action data structure with a prompt that queries the user to determine user interest in obtaining the content item. For example, the action data structure can indicate “it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach on Saturday, would you like to hear about some services to assist with your trip?” Thedata processing system 104 can receive another audio input signal from theclient computing device 102 in response to the prompt “would you like to hear about some services to assist with your trip?” such as “sure”. TheNLP component 110 can parse this response, e.g., “sure” and interpret it as authorization for audio rendering of the content item by theclient computing device 102. In response, thedata processing system 104 can provide the content item for audio rendering by the sameclient computing device 102 from which the response “sure” originated. - The
data processing system 104 can delay transmission of the content item associated with the action data structure to optimize processing utilization. For example, thedata processing system 104 provide the action data structure for rendering as audio output by the client computing device in real-time responsive to receipt of the input audio signal, e.g., in a conversational manner, and can delay content item transmission until an off-peak or non-peak period of data center usage, which results in more efficient utilization of the data center by reducing peak bandwidth usage, heat output or cooling requirements. Thedata processing system 104 can also initiate a conversion or other activity associated with the content item, such as ordering a car service responsive to a response to the action data structure or to the content item, based on data center utilization rates or bandwidth metrics or requirements of thenetwork 106 or of a data center that includes thedata processing system 104. - Based on a response to a content item or to the action data structure for a subsequent action, such as a click on the content item rendered via the selected interface, the
data processing system 104 can identify a conversion, or initiate a conversion or action. Processors of thedata processing system 104 can invoke thedirect action API 135 to execute scripts that facilitate the conversion action, such as to order a car from a car share service to take the end user to or from the beach. Thedirect action API 135 can obtain content data 148 (orparameters 146 or policies 147) from thedata repository 145, as well as data received with end user consent from theclient computing device 102 to determine location, time, user accounts, logistical or other information in order to reserve a car from the car share service. Using thedirect action API 135, thedata processing system 104 can also communicate with the serviceprovider computing device 160 to complete the conversion by in this example making the car share pick up reservation. -
FIG. 1C depicts a flow diagram 200 for multi-modal transmission of packetized data in a voice activated computer network environment. Thedata processing system 104 can receive theinput audio signal 205, e.g., “OK, I would like to go to the beach this weekend.” In response, the data processing system generates at least oneaction data structure 211 and at least onecontent item 215. Theaction data structure 205 can include organic or non-sponsored content, such as a response for audio rendering stating “It will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach this weekend” or “high tide is at 3 pm.” Thedata processing system 104 can provide theaction data structure 211 to the sameclient computing device 102 that originated theinput audio signal 205, for rendering by a candidate interface of theclient computing device 102, e.g., as output in a real time or conversational manner as part of a digital or conversational assistant platform. - The
data processing system 104 can select thecandidate interface 220 as a selected interface for thecontent item 215, and can provide thecontent item 215 to the selectedinterface 220. Thecontent item 215 can also include a data structure, converted to the appropriate modality by thedata processing system 104 for rendering by the selectedinterface 220. Thecontent item 215 can include sponsored content, such as an offer to rent a beach chair for the day, or for sunscreen. The selectedinterface 220 can be part of or executed by the sameclient computing device 102 or by a different device accessible by the end user of theclient computing device 102. Transmission of theaction data structure 211 and thecontent item 215 can occur at the same time or subsequent to one another. Theaction data structure 211 can include an indicator that thecontent item 215 is being or will be transmitted separately via a different modality or format to the selectedinterface 220, alerting the end user to the existence of thecontent item 215. - The
action data structure 211 and thecontent item 215 can be provided separately for rendering to the end user. By separating the sponsored content (content item 215) from the organic response (action data structure 211) audio or other alerts indicating that thecontent item 215 is sponsored do not need to be provided with theaction data structure 211. This can reduce bandwidth requirements associated with transmission of theaction data structure 211 via thenetwork 106 and can simplify rendering of theaction data structure 211. For example, without audio disclaimer or warning messages. - The
data processing system 104 can receive aresponse audio signal 225. Theresponse audio signal 225 can include an audio signal such as, “great, please book me a hotel on the beach this weekend.” Receipt by thedata processing system 104 of theresponse audio signal 225 can cause the data processing system to invoke thedirect action API 135 to execute a conversion to, for example, book a hotel room on the beach. Thedirect action API 135 can also communicate with at least one serviceprovider computing device 160 to provide information to the serviceprovider computing device 160 so that the serviceprovider computing device 160 can complete or confirm the booking process. -
FIG. 2 is an example of an illustration of a block diagram of asystem 100 for serving digital components for a minimum number of exposures in accordance with a described implementation. - In a brief overview,
system 100 includesdocument 202,data processing system 104, andservice provider module 206. Generally,system 100 allows service providers to set a minimum number of exposures over an interval of time, and a per-user maximum aggregate bid value for meeting the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. -
Document 202 may include any machine-readable content, which may include text, graphics, images, videos, multimedia graphics, etc.Document 202 may be encoded in a markup language, e.g., Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), e.g., a web page rendered in JavaScript or in any other machine readable or executable format.Document 202 may include a hyperlink to another document. -
Document 202 may receivedevice identifier 203 whendocument 202 is rendered toclient computing device 102.Device identifier 203 may be stored byclient computing device 102.Device identifier 203 may be included in a user record, e.g., a user profile.Device identifier 203 may associate the information in the user record to a particular user orclient computing device 102. A user may opt in or out of allowingdata processing system 104 or other content source to identify and store information about the user and/or about devices operated by the user. For example, the user may opt in to receiving digital components fromdata processing system 104 that may be more relevant to her. In one implementation, the user may be represented as a randomized device identifier (e.g., a cookie, a device serial number, etc.) that contains no personally-identifiable information about the user. For example, information relating to the user's name, demographics, etc., may not be used by a digital component server unless the user opts in to providing such information. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a digital component server or other content source. - In some implementations,
device identifier 203 is associated with a particular instance of a client application (e.g., running on client computing device 102). In some implementations,device identifier 203 is associated with a user (e.g., when the user logs in with a username and password). Some information that may be associated with the user may include events, such as one or more queries, one or more clicks, browser history data (e.g., the URLs visited, the number of URLs viewed, URL visit durations, etc.), etc. Events may also include digital component metrics, such as impressions, click through rate, etc. for each user. For example,device identifier 203 may include a time stamp associated with a particular event. Events may also includeexposure data 208, e.g., how many times a user is exposed to a particular ad, a campaign, etc. In some implementations,exposure data 208 may include the number of exposures associated withdevice identifier 203, a time stamp of the exposures (when), and how the exposures occurred (e.g., placement of the digital component, interaction with the digital component, etc.). - A content network may select content to be provided with a webpage based on
device identifier 203 for auser visiting document 202. For example, a user may opt in to receiving relevant digital components from a digital component server. Rather than selecting a digital component to be provided ondocument 202 based on the content ofdocument 202 itself or on other factors,data processing system 104 may take intoaccount device identifier 203 provided as part of a content request. In one example, a user may visit a number of webpages devoted to reviews of golf clubs and later visit a webpage to check stock quotes. Based on the user's visits to the golf-related webpages, the user may be determined to be interested in receiving digital components for golf clubs. When the user later visits the webpage to check stock quotes, an online retailer of golf equipment may seek to include a digital component on the webpage for that particular user, even though the financial webpage is unrelated to golf. - If content is selected based in part on a device identifier for a user that opts in to receiving more relevant content, a content provider may specify that certain content is to be provided to a set of device identifiers. For example, a service provider may identify a set of device identifiers associated with visiting the service provider's website and making a purchase. Such users may later wish to know if the service provider is running a sale. In some cases, a digital component network may identify users on behalf of the service provider that may be interested in receiving digital components from the service provider. For example, service providers may specify a number of topic categories for their digital components and the digital component network may match users' interests to the categories, to provide relevant digital components to the users.
-
Device identifier 203 may be received bydata processing system 104.Data processing system 104 may retrieveexposure data 208. For example,exposure data 208 may include the number of exposures todevice identifier 203.Exposure data 208 may also include how recent the exposures were todevice identifier 203 or when the exposures occurred. -
Data processing system 104 may receive digital component metrics andselection criteria 206. For example,data processing system 104 may receive the total number of different viewers exposed to the digital component (at least once, twice, etc.) during an interval of time, which may be determined by the service provider, publisher, etc.Selection criteria 206 may include demographics, placement, geo-location, etc., which may be determined by the service provider, publisher, etc.Selection criteria 206 may also include budgetary criteria. For example, the service provider may provide a per-user maximumaggregate bid value 210 for meeting the minimum number of exposures. In some implementations, the minimum number of exposures may have to occur within an interval of time. In another implementation,data processing system 104 may storedevice identifier 203 andexposure data 208. - In some implementations,
data processing system 104stores selection criteria 206. In another implementation,data processing system 104 determines theprobability 212 thatdevice identifier 203 will receive the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time and within the maximumaggregate bid value 210, e.g.,exposure data 208. Given theprobability 212, digital component server may adjustbidding data 214 with the budgetary criteria (e.g., the per-user maximum aggregate bid value). -
FIG. 3 is anillustration 300 of a user interface that allows the service provider to determine selection criteria. In the example, the service provider may determine the followingsettings 310, a minimum number of exposures atinput field 302, a start date atinput field 304, an end date atinput field 306, a maximum bid per user, and a maximum bid for exposure, or a maximum CPM (cost per mille) atinput field 308. Other variations of the settings may be implemented. Once these settings are entered, the system may determine the estimated number of expected unique users at output field 320. - For example, the service provider may determine that a user needs to view their digital component message three times within a week for the user to be aware of the digital component message, thereby entering three at
input field 302, and a start date atinput field 304, and an end date atinput field 306. - At
input field 308, the service provider may determine a maximumaggregate bid value 210 of $12 per user as an appropriate maximum amount to pay for exposing the user to the digital component message for the minimum of three times within one week. The service provider may also enter a maximum bid per exposure or CPM. - At output field 320, the system may automatically estimate the number of expected unique users that the digital component will be exposed to. The service provider can then alter input fields 302-308 to change
output field 310. -
Data processing system 104 receivesselection criteria 206 that may includeexposure data 208 of a minimum of three exposures per user within one week.Data processing system 104 may also receive the budgetary criteria that include the maximum aggregate bid value per user of $12. - In the example,
data processing system 104 may determine the probability that a user is likely to meet the minimum number of three exposures within one week givenselection criteria 206.Data processing system 104 may providebidding data 214 for each exposure based on thedetermined probability 212 and the maximum aggregate bid value of $12 per user. If and when the auction is won, the digital component 216 may be provided, while updatingdevice identifier 203 and/ordata processing system 104. -
FIG. 4 is anillustration 400 of a system for updating the device identifier in accordance with a described implementation.Illustration 400 may includeclient computing device 102 includingdevice identifier 203,data processing system 104,count module 402 anddata repository 145. -
Client computing device 102 may receive a rendered web page along with a digital component fromdata processing system 104. The digital component may be selected by the service provider as a digital component having a goal for a minimum number of exposures within an interval of time. -
Count module 402 receives information fromdata processing system 104 that the digital component has been provided toclient computing device 102.Count module 402 may update the number of exposures.Count module 402 may store the number of exposures as exposure data indata repository 145. - In some implementations,
data repository 145 may receive exposure data in order to determine which digital component to generate and provide todata processing system 104.Data repository 145 may include digital components that are tagged with exposure data ordata repository 145 may tag the digital components with the exposure data.Data repository 145 may provide the digital components tagged with exposure data toclient computing device 102 or todata processing system 104 to be displayed on a web page. - In some implementations,
client computing device 102 provides exposure data todata processing system 104 after receiving a rendereddocument 202 fromdata processing system 104. In other implementations,Client computing device 102 may provide the exposure data todata repository 145. -
FIG. 5 is an example of a flow diagram of amethod 500 to provide a digital component with a minimum number of exposures.Example method 500 may be implemented by various combinations of systems.Example method 500 may be performed online or offline. - Example method may begin at
ACT 502, selection criteria to specify the device identifier that meets the selection criteria is received. For example, the selection criteria may define one or more characteristics of the users to which the digital component is directed. If a device identifier has one or more of the defined characteristics, then the device identifier meets the selection criteria. If the device identifier does not include one or more (or at least a threshold number) of the characteristics, then the digital component may not be provided to the device identifier. In some implementations, the selection criteria may include budgetary criteria, e.g., one or more bids. - At
ACT 504, a minimum number of exposures to the digital component and an interval of time for the minimum number of exposures to occur is received. In some implementations, the minimum number of exposures is stored in a memory. A maximum aggregate bid value to be paid for each device identifier that is exposed to the digital component for a minimum number of exposures may also be received. In some implementations, the minimum number of exposures and the interval of time includes a frequency, e.g., how many times the digital component is exposed within a set period of time. In some implementations, the interval of time may include a length of time the digital component is exposed, e.g., 1 week. In other implementations, the interval of time may include a time of day when the digital component is exposed. - At
ACT 506, a probability that the device identifier reaches the number of exposures within the interval of time and the maximum aggregate bid value is determined. Probability may be determined using a number of methods including, but not limited to, distributed gradient descent and logistic regression. - If there is sufficient historical data for a user, then the application of the desired interval of time and the desired selection criteria are applied to produce a prediction. In this implementation, statistical methods may not be needed. Either the prediction will indicate that the user will meet the minimum number of exposures in the interval of time or not.
- If there is not sufficient historical data for a user, then the system may determine by an estimation or a guess whether the user will meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. In an example, the system may receive the historical data that it does have for the user to compare the data to a population of similar users that have sufficient historical data, e.g., any correlated or detectable data may be used. The population of similar users may produce a probability of meeting the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time for the desired selection criteria. This probability is then applied to the newly observed user, e.g., if seventy percent of the similar population would meet the minimum number of exposures, then the 0.7 probability is applied to the newly observed user.
- At
ACT 508, a bid for each exposure for the device identifier based on the determined probability and the maximum aggregate bid value is selected. When selection criteria are met, then the probability is determined atACT 510, which may produce a weight used to adjust a bid. The higher the probability, then the higher the bid, with a maximum combination of minimum exposures not exceeding the maximum aggregate bid value. - In some implementations, the probability may be conditional and adjusted based on the number of exposures. For example, a user that is one exposure away from meeting the minimum number of exposures may receive a higher bid than a user that is three exposures away, provided all other criteria is equal. The system may also determine a different probability for each user. A weight may also be determined to select a bid.
- At
ACT 512, a bid is selected for each exposure for the device identifier based on the determined probability and the maximum aggregate bid value. The weight is the mechanism that can adjust a bid to favor impressions that are more likely to meet the goal minimum number of exposures in the interval of time. In some implementations, the probability may be used as the weight. In this implementation, however, campaign constraints may limit how low or high the weight can be set. - The weight used to adjust a bid may be determined by historical impression data, for each device identifier, while also applying the selection criteria and the interval of time. If there are a sufficient number of impressions to meet the minimum number of exposures, then the bidding weight may be applied. If there is not a sufficient number of impressions, then no bidding weight may be applied. The probability is used to change the bid when the user is close to meeting the minimum number of exposures. In other implementations, the probability may not be used when the user is far from meeting the minimum number of exposures.
- In another example, there may not be enough information to determine the probability, because the user is new or there is not enough historical impression data. In these cases, the probability may be determined based on whether similar device identifiers meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. Similar users may be selected based on regression analysis, where user characteristics, such as, but not limited to, browser, operating system, browser history, interests, etc., may determine whether the user will meet the minimum number of exposures. Then, a user model may be constructed along with the probability. The probability from the model may be used to set the bidding weight to bias exposures to users most likely to meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time.
- At
ACT 514, a digital component is served on selection of the bid. In some implementations, serving may include providing display data, which may be indicative of the digital component. The digital component server may provide the display data to the client device. The digital component server may be configured to cause the client to display the digital component. In some implementations, the display data may cause the digital component to be displayed. In other implementations, the display data may include the digital component itself. In yet another implementation, the display data may include a selection of a digital component present on the client device, e.g., the digital component server alerts the client device that there is a selected digital component. The display data may be provided to an interface, e.g., a graphical user interface, a command line interface, etc. AtACT 516, the count is updated representing the number of exposures of device identifier to the digital component, as shown inFIG. 4 . - In an alternative implementation, the total number of different users exposed to the digital component message during a given period and how many times they are exposed to the digital component message may be predicted for a content campaign, e.g., using gross rating points or target rating points, which equate to how many times the message aired times the number of users that were exposed to the digital component message. The bid may be adjusted so that the prediction aligns with the minimum number of exposures per user for the total number of users exposed.
-
FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of anexample method 600 to transmit digital components. Themethod 600 can include receiving an audio-based request (ACT 602). Themethod 600 can include receiving selection criteria (ACT 604). Themethod 600 can include identifying a plurality of digital components (ACT 606). Themethod 600 can include determining a count (ACT 608). Themethod 600 can include receiving a target number (ACT 610). Themethod 600 can include determining a probability (ACT 612). Themethod 600 can include selecting a candidate digital component (ACT 614) and transmitting the candidate digital component (ACT 616). - The
method 600 can include receiving an audio-based request (ACT 602). The data processing system can receive the request from a computing device. The audio-based request can include a device identifier that is associated with the computing device. The audio-based request can be detected at the computing device. For example, the audio-based request can be detected at a microphone positioned at or the computing device. In some implementations, the request can be a text-based, image-based, or video-based requests that can be input into the computing device with a physical or digital keyboard or a camera. The request can be included in an input audio signal. - A
NLP component 110, that is executed by thedata processing system 104, can receive the audio-based request. TheNLP component 110 can receive the request via an interface of thedata processing system 104. TheNLP component 110 can receive the request as a plurality of data packets that can include the audio-based input signal. The data packets can be received at the data processing system, via a network, as packet or other protocol based data transmissions. The request can be encoded as an input audio signal by the computing device that transmits the request to thedata processing system 104. For example, the computing device can include a microphone into which a user speaks the request. The computing device can convert the microphone's recording into an input audio signal that is transmitted to the data processing system. TheNLP component 110 can identify, in audio-based request, a request and a trigger keyword that can correspond to the request. A direct action application programming interface of thedata processing system 104, based on at least one of the request and the trigger keyword, can generate a first action data structure. For example, theNLP component 110 can parse the input audio signal to identify requests that relate to subject matter of the input audio signal, or to identify trigger keywords that can indicate, for example, actions associated with the requests. - The
method 600 can include receiving selection criteria (ACT 604). The selection criteria can include device identifier characteristics. The selection criteria can be associated with a digital component. The device identifier characteristics can be an indication of a device identifier. The device identifier characteristics can be characteristics of a computing device the serviceprovider computing device 160 or the contentprovider computing device 108 is interested having digital components transmitted. The device identifier characteristics can include display screen parameters (e.g., size, resolution), audio parameters, mobile device parameters, (e.g., processing power, battery life, existence of installed apps or programs, orsensor 151 orspeaker 154 capabilities), content slots on online documents for text, image, or video renderings of content items, chat applications, laptops parameters, smartwatch or other wearable device parameters (e.g., indications of their display or processing capabilities), or virtual reality headset parameters. - The
method 600 can include identifying a plurality of digital components (ACT 606). The plurality of digital components can be associated with the digital component with which the selection criteria are associated. The plurality of digital components can be digital components that are related to the digital component identified in the characteristics. For example, the plurality of digital components can be provided by the same serviceprovider computing device 160, the same contentprovider computing device 108, or can include the same or related subject matter. Thedata processing system 104 can identify the plurality of digital components through a lookup table. The related digital components can be stored in a relational database that enables the retrieval of related digital components. - The
method 600 can include determining a count (ACT 608). The count can represent a number of the plurality of digital components previously transmitted to the computing device. The data processing system can determine the number of times one of the plurality of digital components was transmitted to the computing device for display on the computing device. The count can represent a number of times the plurality of digital components were transmitted to the computing device within past time interval. For example, the number of times in the last month, week, day, or hour. - The
method 600 can include receiving a target number (ACT 610). The target number can indicate a target count for the number of times digital components from the plurality of digital components are to be transmitted to the computing device within a predetermined time interface. The time interval can be an hour, day, week, plurality of weeks, month, or plurality of months. - The
method 600 can include determining a probability (ACT 612). The probability can be the probability the count reaches the target number within a predetermined time interval. The probability can be based on the type or characteristic of the digital component. The data processing system can select an exposure model. The data processing system can use the selected exposure model to determine the probability the count reaches the target number. The data processing system can also identify an exposure interval that can be on the selection criteria. The exposure interval can indicate a target amount of time the digital component is displayed to on a computing device. For example, the display or rendering of a digital component can be terminate by a user prior to the digital component being displayed for the length of time indicated by the exposure interval. The second probability can indicate the probability the digital component will be displayed for the full exposure interval prior to the display of the digital component being termination by a user. - In some implementations, the
data processing system 104 can determine a second count that indicates the number to times the plurality of digital component were transmitted to a second computing device that is associated with the computing device that transmitted the request to the data processing system. The second computing device can be a computing device that is linked to the computing device that transmitted the request by a common login or by a grouping that is established by the user of the computing device. The data processing system can calculate a second probability that a combination of the count and the second count reaches the target number with the predetermined time interval. The second probability can be the probability that the display of the digital component on the combination of both the computing device and the second computing device reaches the target number. - The
method 600 can include selecting a candidate digital component (ACT 614). The data processing system can select the candidate digital component based on the probability and selection criteria. The candidate digital component can be selected based on the probability and the probability that the candidate digital component will be exposed for the predetermined exposure interval. The candidate digital component can be selected based on the probability and the probability that the candidate digital component (or related digital components) are displayed on a combination of the computing device and the second computing device the target number of times. The candidate digital component can be selected by the data processing system based on the first action data structure. In some implementations, the data processing system can determine not to select a digital component as a candidate digital component if the probability is below a predetermined threshold. For example, if the data processing system determines the probability of reaching the target number is low, the data processing system can select to not select and transmit a digital component to the computing device. The data processing system can determine not to transmit a selected digital component to the computing device because the transmission of the digital component would be a waste of computational resources and bandwidth. - The
method 600 can include transmitting the candidate digital component (ACT 616). The data processing system can transmit the candidate digital component to the computing device. The data processing system can select to transmit the digital component to a second computing device that is related to the computing device. The data processing system can include an interface management component that can poll a plurality of interfaces to identify a first candidate interface of the computing device and a second candidate interface of a second computing device. The interface management component can determine resource utilization values for each of the candidate interfaces. The resources utilization values can be based on at least one of a battery status, processor utilization, memory utilization, an interface parameter, and network bandwidth utilization. The interface management component can select to transmit the candidate digital component to the computing device based on the first resource utilization value and the second resource utilization value. For example, the data processing system can select to which candidate interface to transmit the digital component based on a comparison of the remaining battery life and interface types (e.g., screen or speaker interfaces) available at each of the first and second candidate interfaces. In some implementations, the data processing system can transmit the digital component to the second candidate interface in place of the first candidate interface. The data processing system can transmit the digital component to both the first and the second candidate interfaces. The candidate interfaces can be interfaces of a single computing device or of multiple, different computing devices. For example, the first candidate interface can be a screen of a first computing device and the second candidate interface can be a speaker of the first computing device. The second candidate interface can be a type of interface a first computing device does not have. For example, a first computing device may not have a screen and second candidate interface can be a screen interface of a second computing device related to the first computing device. In some implementations, the interface management component can determine a distance between each of the plurality of candidate interfaces and the computing device that transmitted the request to the data processing system. The data processing system can select the candidate digital component based on the distance between each of the plurality of candidate interfaces and the computing device. The interfaces can include a display screen, an audio interface, a vibration interface, an email interface, a push notification interface, a mobile computing device interface, a portable computing device application, a content slot on an online document, a chat application, mobile computing device application, a laptop, a watch, a virtual reality headset, and a speaker. -
FIG. 7 is a block diagram of anexample computer system 700. The computer system orcomputing device 700 can include or be used to implement thesystem 100, or its components such as thedata processing system 104. Thecomputing system 700 includes a bus 705 or other communication component for communicating information and a processor 710 or processing circuit coupled to the bus 705 for processing information. Thecomputing system 700 can also include one or more processors 710 or processing circuits coupled to the bus for processing information. Thecomputing system 700 also includes main memory 715, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to the bus 705 for storing information, and instructions to be executed by the processor 710. The main memory 715 can be or include thedata repository 145. The main memory 715 can also be used for storing position information, temporary variables, or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by the processor 710. Thecomputing system 700 may further include a read only memory (ROM) 720 or other static storage device coupled to the bus 705 for storing static information and instructions for the processor 710. Astorage device 725, such as a solid state device, magnetic disk or optical disk, can be coupled to the bus 705 to persistently store information and instructions. Thestorage device 725 can include or be part of thedata repository 145. - The
computing system 700 may be coupled via the bus 705 to adisplay 735, such as a liquid crystal display, or active matrix display, for displaying information to a user. Aninput device 730, such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, may be coupled to the bus 705 for communicating information and command selections to the processor 710. Theinput device 730 can include atouch screen display 735. Theinput device 730 can also include a cursor control, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor 710 and for controlling cursor movement on thedisplay 735. Thedisplay 735 can be part of thedata processing system 104, theclient computing device 102 or other component ofFIG. 1A andFIG. 1B , for example. - The processes, systems and methods described herein can be implemented by the
computing system 700 in response to the processor 710 executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 715. Such instructions can be read into main memory 715 from another computer-readable medium, such as thestorage device 725. Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 715 causes thecomputing system 700 to perform the illustrative processes described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory 715. Hard-wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions together with the systems and methods described herein. Systems and methods described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. - Although an example computing system has been described in
FIG. 7 , the subject matter including the operations described in this specification can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. - For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's location), or to control whether or how to receive content from a content server or other data processing system that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, postal code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content server.
- The subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, e.g., one or more circuits of computer program instructions, encoded on one or more computer storage media for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatuses. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. While a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices). The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by a data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
- The terms “data processing system” “computing device” “component” or “data processing apparatus” encompass various apparatuses, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or multiple ones, or combinations of the foregoing. The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment can realize various different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures. The
interface management component 140,direct action API 135,content selector component 125,prediction component 120 orNLP component 110 and otherdata processing system 104 components can include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, systems, computing devices, or processors. - A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, app, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can correspond to a file in a file system. A computer program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs (e.g., components of the data processing system 104) to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatuses can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- The subject matter described herein can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or a combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system such as
system 100 orsystem 700 can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network (e.g., the network 106). The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., data packets representing action data structures or content items) to a client device (e.g., to theclient computing device 102 for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device, or to the serviceprovider computing device 160 or the content provider computing device 108). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server (e.g., received by thedata processing system 104 from thecomputing device 102 or the contentprovider computing device 108 or the service provider computing device 160). - While operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, such operations are not required to be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and all illustrated operations are not required to be performed. Actions described herein can be performed in a different order.
- The separation of various system components does not require separation in all implementations, and the described program components can be included in a single hardware or software product. For example, the
NLP component 110, thecontent selector component 125, theinterface management component 140, or theprediction component 120 can be a single component, app, or program, or a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or part of one or more servers of thedata processing system 104. - Having now described some illustrative implementations, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example. In particular, although many of the examples presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, those acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to accomplish the same objectives. Acts, elements and features discussed in connection with one implementation are not intended to be excluded from a similar role in other implementations or implementations.
- The phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including” “comprising” “having” “containing” “involving” “characterized by” “characterized in that” and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter, equivalents thereof, and additional items, as well as alternate implementations consisting of the items listed thereafter exclusively. In one implementation, the systems and methods described herein consist of one, each combination of more than one, or all of the described elements, acts, or components.
- Any references to implementations or elements or acts of the systems and methods herein referred to in the singular may also embrace implementations including a plurality of these elements, and any references in plural to any implementation or element or act herein may also embrace implementations including only a single element. References in the singular or plural form are not intended to limit the presently disclosed systems or methods, their components, acts, or elements to single or plural configurations. References to any act or element being based on any information, act or element may include implementations where the act or element is based at least in part on any information, act, or element.
- Any implementation disclosed herein may be combined with any other implementation or embodiment, and references to “an implementation,” “some implementations,” “one implementation” or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation may be included in at least one implementation or embodiment. Such terms as used herein are not necessarily all referring to the same implementation. Any implementation may be combined with any other implementation, inclusively or exclusively, in any manner consistent with the aspects and implementations disclosed herein.
- References to “or” may be construed as inclusive so that any terms described using “or” may indicate any of a single, more than one, and all of the described terms. For example, a reference to “at least one of ‘A’ and ‘B’” can include only ‘A’, only ‘B’, as well as both ‘A’ and ‘B’. Such references used in conjunction with “comprising” or other open terminology can include additional items.
- Where technical features in the drawings, detailed description or any claim are followed by reference signs, the reference signs have been included to increase the intelligibility of the drawings, detailed description, and claims. Accordingly, neither the reference signs nor their absence have any limiting effect on the scope of any claim elements.
- The systems and methods described herein may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the characteristics thereof. The foregoing implementations are illustrative rather than limiting of the described systems and methods. Scope of the systems and methods described herein is thus indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are embraced therein.
