Definitions
- This specification relates to Internet search engines, and more particularly to ranking search results that are identified as being responsive to search queries.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources, e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content, that are relevant to a user's information needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Internet search engines generally return a set of search results, each identifying a respective resource, in response to a user submitted query.
- This specification describes how a system can adjust a score for a search result that identifies a resource and was obtained in response to a search query to reflect both how “fresh seeking” the query is and how “fresh” the resource is.
- the system boosts the score for a “fresh” search result if the query is “fresh seeking,” and may demote the score if the resource is not fresh.
- a query is generally considered fresh seeking when users tend to prefer younger resources to older resources provided in response to the query.
- a resource is generally considered fresh if it is young, i.e. created recently.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search result obtained in response to a query, wherein the search result identifies a resource and has an associated score S; determining that users prefer newer resources over older resources for the query; determining that the resource is a new resource; and associating a new score S′ with the resource in place of S, wherein S′>S, based on determining that users prefer newer resources over older resources for the query, and that the resource is a new resource.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- Determining that users prefer newer resources over older resources for the query includes determining that the query is of particular recent interest. Determining that the query is of particular recent interest comprises determining that one or more of the following criteria is satisfied: a number of occurrences of the query being received within a recent time period satisfies a first threshold; a number of occurrences of the query on blog web pages within a recent time period satisfies a second threshold; a number of occurrences of the query on news web pages within a recent time period satisfies a third threshold; a number of occurrences of the query on social network web pages within a recent time period satisfies a fourth threshold; a number of occurrences of the query requesting news search results within a recent time period satisfies a fifth threshold; a ratio of a number of occurrences of the query requesting news search results within a recent time period to
- the actions further include determining a query value Q for the query, the query value being based on a maximum of one or more freshness signals; determining a resource value D for the resource, the resource value being based on a function of an age of the resource F(age); and calculating S′ as a product of S and a boosting function, the boosting function being a function of the query value Q and the resource value D.
- the boosting function is a continuous function having a range of values that includes values less than 1, a value equal to 1, and values greater than 1, whereby the product of S and the boosting function can be less than S, equal to S, or greater than S.
- the boosting function has the form Q D .

- F(age) is a monotonically decreasing function of an age of the resource.
- F(age) is a reverse sigmoid function.
- D is based on F(age) adjusted by a quality of the resource.
- the quality of the resource is based on one or more of the following functions: a query-independent quality score G(provider) for a provider of the resource, a query-dependent quality score H(query, provider) for a provider of the resource, and a measure I(query, resource) of how well the query matches the resource.
- H(query, provider) is based on a probability that users that issue the query will select a resource from a provider that created the resource.

- Promoting search results for fresh resources in response to fresh-seeking queries allows users to find more relevant results for current events, makes finding fresh resources easier for resources that may be overshadowed by popular but older resources, and reduces the effort that users must exert to find the resources that they seek.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example search system.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of inputs and outputs of a freshness engine.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for adjusting search result scores for freshness.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example search system 130 .
- the search system 130 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a user device 110 can be coupled to the search system 130 through a data communication network 120 .
- the user device 110 transmits a query 105 over the network 120 to the search system 130 .
- the search system 130 responds to the query 105 by generating a search results page 135 , which is transmitted over the network 120 to the user device 110 in a form that can be presented on the user device 110 , e.g., as displayed in a web browser on the user device 110 .
- the search results page 135 can be a markup language document, e.g., HyperText Markup Language or eXtensible Markup Language document.
- the user device 110 renders the document, e.g., using a web browser, in order to present the search results page 135 on a display device.
- the user device 110 can be any appropriate type of computing device, e.g., a server, mobile phone, tablet computer, notebook computer, music player, e-book reader, laptop or desktop computer, PDA (personal digital assistant), smart phone, or other stationary or portable device, that includes one or more processors for executing program instructions and memory.
- the user device 110 can include computer readable media that store software applications, e.g., a browser or layout engine, an input device, e.g., a keyboard or mouse, a communication interface, and a display device.
- the network 120 can be, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or Wi-Fi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any appropriate combination of such networks.
- WLAN wireless local area network
- Wi-Fi Wireless Fidelity
- 4G Fourth Generation
- the search system 130 can be implemented as computer programs executing on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network, e.g., network 120 .
- the search system generally includes a search system front end 140 , a search engine 150 , and a freshness engine 160 .
- the search system front end 140 receives the query 105 from the user device 110 .
- the search system front end 140 routes the query 105 to the appropriate engines included in the search system 130 so that the search system 130 can generate the search results page 135 .
- routing occurs by referencing static routing tables. In other implementations, routing occurs based on the current network load of an engine, in order to accomplish load balancing.
- the search system front end 140 can provide the resulting search results page 135 to the user device 110 . In doing so, the search system front end 140 acts as a gateway, or interface, between the user device 110 and the search engine 150 .
- Two or more of a search system front end, a freshness engine and a search engine may be implemented on the same computing device, or on different computing devices.
- the search system 130 generates the search results page 135 based on the collective activity of the search system front end 140 , the freshness engine 160 , and the search engine 150
- a user of the user device 110 may refer to these engines collectively as a “search engine.”
- This specification refers to a specific engine, e.g. search engine 150 , and not the collection of engines, as the “search engine,” since the search engine 150 identifies search results in response to the user-submitted query 105 .
- the search system 130 can include multiple types of search engines, each search engine designed to obtain a search result for a particular type of resource, e.g., web pages, news articles, images, videos, blog postings, or other types of resources on the Internet.
- Each such search engine will generally include an indexing engine that indexes resources, and a ranking engine to rank the resources that have been identified. The indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques.
- the search engine 150 After receiving the query 105 , the search engine 150 obtains initial search results 115 that satisfy the search query.
- the search engine 150 can assign a search result score to each of the search results 115 and can rank the search results 115 by the assigned search result scores.
- the search system can generate, e.g. using search system front end 140 , a search results page for the initial search results, illustrated as search results page 135 a , that identifies search results obtained by the search engine 150 .
- each of the search results can include, but are not limited to, titles, text snippets, images, videos, links, reviews, or other information.
- the search result 170 includes a title 171 , a snippet 172 , and a display link 173 .
- Search results on search results page 135 a are ranked by search result scores, with the search results having a higher score being considered to be better search results for the query and thus being presented nearer to the top of the search results page 135 a .
- search result 170 is presented nearer to the top of search results page 135 a than search result 180 , reflecting that in the initial search results 115 , search result 170 has a higher score than search result 180 .
- the search system 130 can also use other presentation arrangements and ranking methods, e.g. where a lower score indicates a better search result.
- freshness engine 160 After obtaining initial search results 115 , the search system 130 can adjust the ranking of the search results using freshness engine 160 .
- freshness engine 160 considers how “fresh seeking” the query 105 is, and how “fresh” is the resource identified by each search result to adjust the search result scores of the initial search results 115 .
- a “fresh seeking” query is a query for which users generally prefer newer resources over older resources, and a “fresh” resource generally indicates a newer resource.
- the freshness engine 160 generates adjusted search results 125 by assigning new search result scores to the initial search results 115 .
- the new search result scores can be based on the search result scores initially assigned by the search engine 150 , or the new search result scores can be generated anew.
- the ranking of the adjusted search results 125 may, and typically will, differ from the ranking of the initial search results 115 .
- the ranking of the search results can be different from search results page 135 a generated with the initial search results 115 .
- freshness engine 160 can assign a highest search result score to search result 180 for the “New Music Video” of an example band after adjusting the search result scores for freshness.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of inputs and outputs of an example freshness engine 210 .
- the freshness engine 210 generally receives a query 205 , a search result 215 , and a search result score 225 .
- the freshness engine 210 then analyzes data from query logs database 220 and indexing statistics database 230 to compute an adjusted search result score 235 for the search result 215 .
- Query logs database 220 can include user selection data that characterizes visits to particular resources by users and durations of each of those visits.
- the selection data can identify clicks by users on search results included in search results pages, and, for each of the clicks, a measurement of the duration of time that elapsed between the time that the user clicked on the search result and the time that the user navigated back to the search results web page.
- the query logs database 220 can include data for each type of resource.
- a resource type is a classification of a resource based on the type of content included in the resource. Resource types can include, e.g., image resources, media resources, text resources, and so on.
- Different types of resources can be identified by different types of search engines, e.g. web search engine 240 for identifying web page search results, blog search engine 250 for identifying blog search results, news search engine 260 for identifying news articles, and video search engine 270 for identifying videos.
- the system can consider as a click any user action made with respect to a search result that initiates a request for the resource identified by the search result, e.g., a cursor click on a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of a resource in the search result in a graphical user interface of a web browser.
- a user action in order for a user action to be considered a click, it can also be required that the user's viewing of the resource be for a minimum threshold length of time.
- the threshold can optionally depend on the type of the resource, the length of the resource, measured in time for a media resource or words for a text resource, or both. For example, the threshold length can be longer for media, e.g., video, than for image resources.
- the action can also be a voice-based selection, or a selection by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, e.g., a touch-screen device, or any other appropriate selection mechanism.
- Indexing statistics database 230 can include statistics on occurrences of terms or phrases indexed or otherwise encountered in various types of Internet resources.
- the various types of search engines which each will generally include a different type of indexing engine, can contribute various types of statistics to indexing statistics database 230 .
- web search engine 240 can compute statistics on how often a particular term has been encountered during the past month when indexing web pages.
- the freshness engine 210 can consider both the how fresh-seeking the query 205 is and how fresh the resource identified by the search result 215 is.
- the freshness engine 210 can generally consider a particular query to be fresh-seeking if users prefer newer resources over older resources when obtained in response to the particular query.
- the freshness engine 210 can use a variety of statistical indicators, or “signals,” computed from query logs database 220 or indexing statistics database 230 or both to determine that users prefer newer resources over older resources for the query.
- the freshness engine 210 can compute a measure, a “query freshness value,” of how fresh-seeking the query is based on these signals.
- the freshness engine can compare the computed query freshness value to a threshold to determine whether or not the query should be considered a query of recent interest.
- the freshness engine can also compute the query freshness value as a measure of significance, e.g. a percentile value, of the signal within a recent time period, e.g. the past hour, day, week, month, year, etc., for use when computing the adjusted search result score.
- the time period considered “recent” for each signal need not be the same and may depend on the type of resource the signal is based upon.
- An example signal that indicates that a particular query is a fresh-seeking query is a high number of occurrences of the query being received within a recent time period.
- An atypically high number of occurrences of the query within a recent time period can be indicative of a spike in traffic for a query, which can indicate that the query is a query of recent interest.
- the freshness engine 210 can access data from the query logs database 220 and count occurrences of the query within a recent time period.
- Another example fresh-seeking query signal is a high number of occurrences of terms of the query on web pages that are frequency updated, e.g. blog web pages and social network web pages, and that are created within a recent time period. Because blog web pages and social network web pages are frequently updated, a high number of occurrences of terms of the query on blog web pages or social network web pages created within the recent time period can indicate a query of recent interest.
- the freshness engine 210 can access indexing statistics database 230 for statistics on terms and phrases indexed by blog search engine 250 during the recent time period.
- Another example fresh-seeking query signal is a high number of occurrences of terms of the query on news web pages created within a recent time period. Because news web pages typically discuss current events and topics of recent interest, a high number of occurrences of terms of the query on news web pages created within a recent time period can indicate a query of recent interest.
- the freshness engine 210 can access indexing statistics database 230 for statistics on terms and phrases indexed by news search engine 260 during the recent time period.
- Another example fresh-seeking query signal is a high number of occurrences of the query requesting news search results within a recent time period.
- the freshness engine 210 can access query logs database 220 to compute a number of queries directed to news search engine 260 during the recent time period.
- Another example fresh-seeking query signal is a high ratio of a number of occurrences of the query requesting news search results to a number of occurrences of the query requesting web search results within a recent time period. More users requesting news search results than general web search results for a particular query can indicate a query of recent interest.
- the freshness engine 210 can access query logs database 220 and compare a count of occurrences of the query requesting general web search results to a count of occurrences of the query requesting news search results, e.g. by dividing the count of occurrences of the query requesting general web search results by the count of occurrences of the query requesting news search results.
- Another example fresh-seeking query signal is a high number of user selections of news search results provided in response to the query within a recent time period.
- a high number of user selections of news search results for a query can indicate a query of recent interest.
- the freshness engine 210 can access query logs database 220 and count user selections of news search results provided in response to the query during the recent time period.
- Another example fresh-seeking query signal is a high ratio of a number of user selections of news search results provided for the query to a number of user selections of web search results provided for the query.
- the freshness engine 210 can for example access query logs database 220 to compare counts of user selections of news or web page search results provided for the query.
- the search system can also generate search results pages that include both general web search results and news search results for the same query. In some implementations, in such situations the freshness engine can compute a number of user selections of news search results over web search results provided for the same query.
- the freshness engine 210 can generally base the consideration of whether a particular resource is “fresh,” i.e. a new resource, based on an age associated with the resource. Based on the age of the document, the freshness engine 210 can compute a resource value D for a resource that will be used to adjust its search result score. If the query 205 is fresh-seeking, the freshness engine 210 can generally boost the search result score for newer resources, i.e. those resources having a high resource value D. In some implementations, the freshness engine 210 can also demote or suppress the search result score for older documents having a low resource value D. Thus, the system can compute a resource value D based on a monotonically decreasing function of the age of the document.
- the resource value D is based on a reverse sigmoid function.
- the reverse sigmoid function could map the age of a brand new document to a first value, e.g. 10, 100, or 1000, could map the age of a three-year-old document to a second, smaller value, e.g. ⁇ 10, ⁇ 100, or ⁇ 1000, and could have a steep drop off that coincides with a particular age, e.g. one month, one quarter, or one year.
- the freshness engine 210 can also adjust the resource value D by considering one or more quality signals for the resource.
- the freshness engine 210 can multiply, divide, or otherwise adjust the resource value D by the quality signals for the resource.
- the freshness engine 210 can for example compute quality signals for the resource by accessing data in query logs database 220 .
- the freshness engine can generally transform the raw quality values for a resource using any of a number of transformation functions, e.g. linear, sigmoidal, or some other squashing function, to achieve a desired output range.
- the system may use a linear transformation function to transform signal values that are already expressed as a percentile.
- a sigmoidal transformation function can be given by:
- An example quality signal for a resource is a query-independent quality score for a provider of the resource, for which the system can use a corresponding transformation function G(provider).
- the query-independent quality score for a provider is between 0 and 1
- the transformation function G(provider) is a monotonically increasing function that provides values between 0 and 2.
- What the freshness engine 210 considers to be a provider of a resource can depend on the type of resource being considered.
- the provider of a resource can be considered to be a user account that uploaded the resource, e.g. in the case of user-uploaded images and videos.
- the provider of a resource can be a web site that created the resource.
- Another example quality signal for a resource is a query-dependent quality score, or QtoP, for a provider of the resource, for which the system can use a corresponding transformation function H(query, provider).
- the query-dependent quality score QtoP is a measure of quality for that provider for the query.
- QtoP for a particular provider is based on a probability that users that issue the query will select any resource from the particular provider that created the resource. For example, if the resources are videos and the provider is a user account, QtoP can be calculated as a number of videos from a particular provider that were selected by users when provided in response to the query divided by a total number of videos selected when provided in response to the query.
- the QtoP score is a percentile in the range from 0 to 1
- the transformation function H(query, provider) is a monotonically increasing function that provides values between 0.5 and 2.
- Another example quality signal for a resource is a topicality score, for which the system can use a corresponding transformation function I(query, resource).
- the topicality score can be based on how well the query matches the resource or how relevant a resource is for the query.
- the topicality score need not be the same as the initial search result score 215 .
- the topicality score is a value between 0 and 100
- the transformation function I(query, resource) is a monotonically increasing function that provides values between 0 and 2.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for adjusting search result scores for freshness.
- the process 300 can be implemented by one or more computer programs installed on one or more computers.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a freshness engine, for example, the freshness engine 210 of FIG. 2 .
- the freshness engine receives a search result that identifies a resource ( 310 ).
- the search result can for example be received from one of multiple types of search engines as part of an overall search system.
- the freshness engine determines that users prefer newer resources over older resources for the query ( 320 ).
- the freshness engine can for example evaluate multiple fresh-seeking query signals as described above with reference to FIG. 2 . In some implementations, if any one of the fresh-seeking query signals exceeds a global or signal-specific threshold, the freshness engine determines that users prefer newer resources over older resources for the query.
- the freshness engine normalizes all of the fresh-seeking query signals and chooses the fresh-seeking query signal that has the maximum value. For example, the freshness engine can normalize the fresh-seeking query signals by computing percentile values for each of the fresh-seeking query signals, e.g. by mapping the signal values to a value between 0 and 1, or 0 and 100.
- the freshness engine determines that the resource is a new resource ( 330 ).
- the freshness engine can determine that a resource is new by defining a function based on an age of the resource F(age).
- the age input represents a number of days from 0 to 3000 days
- F(age) is a monotonically decreasing function, for example, a reverse sigmoid function, that provides values between ⁇ 3 and 3.
- F(age) is the age of the document, e.g. measured in days, weeks, months, etc.
- the freshness engine compares F(age) of the resource to a threshold, e.g. one week, one month, or one year. The freshness engine can then consider a resource that satisfies the threshold, e.g. a resource that is younger than the threshold, to be a new document and can consider a resource that does not satisfy the threshold not to be a new document.
- the freshness engine associates a new score with the resource ( 340 ).
- the new score can replace the initial score for the search result and can be used to rerank search results obtained in response to a search query.
- the freshness engine can compute the new search result score directly as a function of a query value, Q, that is based on a maximum of the fresh-seeking query signals and a resource value, D, that is based on F(age).
- the new score is computed as product of the initial search result score S and a boosting function that is function of Q and D. For some values of Q and D, the boosting function may result in a demotion of the original search result score.
- D can also depend on one or more quality signals for the provider of the resource.
- D is given by:
- the freshness engine can alternatively compute D using a different transformation function J(query, resource) that depends on a popularity M of a resource for the query.
- the transformation function J(query, resource) can be used to dampen the effect of freshness demotions, e.g. when F(age) is less than zero.
- the popularity M of a resource for a query is between 0 and 100
- the transformation function J(query, resource) is a monotonically decreasing function, e.g. a reverse sigmoid function, that provides values between 0.2 and 2.
- the system can adjust D by multiplying F(age) by J(query, resource) such that the dampening effect is larger for more popular documents.
- D can be given by:
