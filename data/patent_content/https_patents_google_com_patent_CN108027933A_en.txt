Embodiment
Now with detailed reference to embodiment of the disclosure, one or more example is shown in the drawings.Pass through explanation
The disclosure rather than the limitation disclosure provide each example.In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that
It is that in the case of without departing from the scope of the present disclosure or spirit, various modifications and variations can be carried out to the disclosure.For example, make
The feature that a part for one embodiment shows or describes can be used together with another embodiment to produce another reality
Apply example.It is, therefore, intended that these modifications and variations that disclosure covering comes within the scope of the appended claims and their.
The exemplary aspect of the disclosure is related to the capacity of definite position entities.The system and method for the disclosure can be based on from
The positional information that one or more user equipmenies of user-association receive carrys out the capacity of estimated location entity.For example, system and side
Method can analyze the position sent by one or more user equipmenies and report, to identify that user equipment is located at real-world locations reality
Body (for example, dining room, parking lot, space for activities or other points of interest).The system and method can determine to be located at the position entities
The number of the user equipment at place and the capacity for estimating the position entities.For example, capacity can be allowed or be generally held in position
Put the maximum number of the customer in entity.Capacity can be stored and be subsequent supplied to one or more user equipmenies, to allow
User understands the estimated capacity of position entities.In some implementations, which can determine to be currently located at position entities
User number, and can be by it compared with the capacity of estimation.The result of the comparison can be presented to user equipment
User and/or can be used for automatic trigger notice and/or action.
More specifically, one or more user equipmenies can be periodically to the one or more servers for realizing the disclosure
Home position report is provided.Each position report can provide the time associated with user equipment and position.E.g., including exist
Position in each position report can be geocoding (for example, longitude and latitude), IP address information, WiFi positional informations or
Identify specific location or the other information associated with specific location.
In addition, in certain embodiments, it is no except non-user selects to set and/or install one or more application, driving etc.
Then user can not harvest interests or be incorporated herein in described technology.In certain embodiments, some data can
Being processed in one or more ways before storage or use, to remove user information and/or geography information.
According to one aspect of the disclosure, system and method described herein can be estimated by analyzing multiple position reports
Count the capacity of position entities.For example, multiple position reports can be clustered into multiple fragments., can be with base in some example implementations
The report of multiple positions is clustered in position or time.If receive provided within the quite a long time it is identical big
Multiple positions report of body position, then can form fragment together by these report clusters, and can further analyze
The fragment is to identify associated position entities.By this way, the system and method can determine user equipment whether with position
Putting entity is associated (for example, user before and/or currently whether be located at position entities), and correspondingly determines at one or more
The number of the user equipment associated with position entities in a period.
It is based at least partially on the number of the user equipment associated with position entities, the system and method for the disclosure can be with
The capacity of estimated location entity.For example, it can be based at least partially in each period in one or more periods
The number of user equipment at position entities generates one or more parameters of bi-distribution.The system and method can be with
Carry out the capacity of estimated location by adjusting the parameter of bi-distribution with definite best fit.Addedly and/or alternatively, the system
With method can using horse Lovell can husband's model, maximal possibility estimation and/or other statistical methods come estimated capacity.
The generation that the system and method can also determine " to turn to " is to help the capacity of estimated location entity.Used for example, working as
It is nearby or positioned adjacent when but leaving without as customer that family reaches user's position entities for wanting to patronize, it may occur that turns
To.As one example, user can access her and intend a restaurant patronizing, but when she recognize the dining room full capacity and
She will be required to wait for have left during out of season service time.
The generation of steering can be in full capacity state with indicating positions entity.Therefore, which can be by user
Activity recognition is used as the signal of the current capacities state on restaurant for " steering " and by the use of the detection to this steering.Specifically
For, system and method described herein can determine associated with position entities user during the period turned to
The number of equipment, and the capacity that the user's number of devices carrys out estimated location entity can be based at least partially on.Therefore, one
, can be during the period turned to pair (for example, at position entities) associated with position entities in a little realizations
The number of user equipment applies specific examination.
According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, which can be based on associated with position entities
One or more features determine whether user intends to patronize position entities.For example, one or more features can pass through bag
Include for example following examples and carry out interest of the instruction user to position entities：User performs the example of map click on position entities
Number, user had previously registered the instance numbers of position entities, and/or user performs web search query for position entities
Instance number.Additionally and/or alternatively, one or more features can be for example, by including the society associated with position entities
Media are handed over to refer to that number carrys out the popularity of indicating positions entity.Instruction user is intended to patronize specific location entity but finally without so
The feature done may be used as the strong signal turned to.
Features described above is substituted or supplements, the system and method for the disclosure can be by analyzing the position sent by user equipment
Report to determine the generation turned to.Specifically, in some example implementations, multiple position reports can include containing first position
Reported with the first position of first time and contain the second place and the second place of the second time and reported.The system and method
It can be based at least partially on and be included in the first position in the report of first position to determine neighbour of the user equipment in position entities
In nearly scope.Then the system and method, which can be based at least partially on, can be differently configured from the second place of first position to determine
User equipment has been moved off the nearby sphere of position entities.
In addition, when system and method can be determined in (associated with first position) and the second time at the first time (with the
Two positions are associated) between time difference, and by the time difference compared with time threshold.For example, time threshold can be with table
Show the average shortest time that customer usually physically spends in position, in the position (for example, concert, competitive sports, drama table
Drill) typical time period of activity, or the other times associated with the generic customer of position entities.The system and method can
The generation turned to is determined to be based at least partially on the time difference less than time threshold.
In other example implementations, position and dive to alternative site which can be based on user equipment
The generation turned to is determined in interest.For example, the system and method can be based at least partially on first position to determine first
User equipment is in the nearby sphere of position entities.The system and method can determine one associated with alternative site entity
Or multiple features, wherein, the feature associated with alternative site entity indicates the interest levels associated with alternative site entity.
These features can include the instance number that such as user has performed web search query for alternative site entity.Then should
System and method can be based at least partially on the second place to determine the first user equipment not in the nearby sphere of position entities
It is interior.Therefore, the system and method can be based at least partially on the feature associated with alternative site entity (instruction user to for
For the interest of position entities) and be included in the report of the second place (instruction user has been moved off position entities for the second place
Near) come determine turn to generation.
In some implementations, when alternative site entity and home position entity have similar characteristics, can specifically indicate
Turn to.For example, if user's search after original breakfast dining room is arrived at substitutes breakfast dining room, if original in arrival with user
Search for outdoor sports equipment shop behind breakfast dining room to compare, this can be considered as more obviously turning to index.Therefore, in some realities
In existing, original correlation or replaceability degree between alternative site entity can influence the detection turned to.
Therefore, the generation of steering can help the system and method determine position entities be likely to be at full capacity it is specific when
Between.The data collected in this time can especially be analyzed (for example, instruction is now placed in the number of the user equipment at position entities
Purpose data) to assist in the capacity of position entities.
Represent to obtain on point of interest or position entities according to the capacity of the definite position entities of the exemplary aspect of the disclosure
Other useful data point.For example, understand specific location entity capacity can be used for coordinate doings, urban planning and
Issue government license.In addition, the system and method for the disclosure can help to reduce to large-scale, expensive and error-prone geodata
The demand in storehouse and dependence, and further reduce to the inefficient demand for collecting data manually.
In addition, in some implementations, system and method described herein can be estimated current at specific location entity
Attendance rate.This can by similar in a manner of capacity is determined from the position that user equipment receives and time data come real
It is existing, or can by it is another it is suitable in a manner of (for example, based on the security system at position entities, it permits a determination that mesh
Anteposition is in the number of the participant of position entities) determine.Present presence rate and estimation may be utilized in a number of different manners
Capacity.For example, can be by present presence rate compared with estimated capacity, and when present presence approaching, has reached
And/or when alreading exceed estimated capacity, alarm is provided to user equipment.This may improve the security at position entities,
Because it may allow to take steps to prevent overcrowding.Further, since the estimation to position place capacity may be supervised
Survey and simultaneously periodically reappraised, therefore the safety of the user at position entities can will not be because of the management of position entities
The temporary capacity failed to give notice reduces (for example, due to repair work) and is affected.
Additionally or alternatively, the present presence rate that can be shown in via user equipment to user at position entities is estimated with it
Count the comparative result between capacity.For example, if user provides instruction interested in specific location entity (for example, execution pair
The search of special entity), then it can indicate whether be left any space at position entities using result of the comparison.With this
Mode, user may be prevented from going to current attendance rate to be in estimated capacity or the position entities close to estimated capacity, and can
It can transfer to go to the different entities with free space.Similarly, certain types of position can be searched for using relatively screening
The result of entity (for example, restaurant in this area) so that the position entities of the only non-full capacity of present presence rate can be shown
Show to user.Again, because the capacity of estimation is monitored and is periodically reappraised, compare and be probably
Accurately, therefore user can usually receive accurate information on the space availability at specific location entity.
Additionally or alternatively, the comparative result between the present presence rate at position entities and its capacity estimated can be used
In when present presence rate is had fallen to below estimated capacity to user equipment (for example, passing through notice) indicate.This can pacify
Used in full ambient engine, to allow to relax some security restrictions implemented (for example, with prevent overcrowding related).It is similar
Ground, if user has been provided for instruction interested in the specific location entity at or near estimated capacity, user
Equipment can provide the notice that present presence rate of the instruction at position entities interested is no longer on full capacity.In this way, with
Then family can determine to go to the position entities.
Referring now to attached drawing, the example embodiment of the disclosure will be discussed in.Fig. 1 depicts showing according to the disclosure
