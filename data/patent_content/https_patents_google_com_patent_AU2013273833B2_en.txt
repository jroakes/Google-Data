Description
Regulation 3.2 AUSTRALIA Patents Act 1990 Complete Specification Standard Patent Divisional APPLICANT: Google Inc. Invention Title: AUTOMATED GENERATION OF SUGGESTIONS FOR PERSONALIZED REACTIONS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to me: AUTOMATED GENERATION OF SUGGESTIONS FOR PERSONALIZED REACTIONS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK BACKGROUND 5 [0001] The present disclosure relates to social networks and electronic communication. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a system and methods for generating suggestions for personalized reactions, replies or messages in social networks and professional systems. [0002] The popularity and use of social networks and other types of electronic 0 communication has grown dramatically in recent years. With the increased use and popularity of social networks, the value of these networks has increased exponentially. However, this also means that the number of messages and information each user must process has increased exponentially. It is often difficult for users to keep up with and reply to all the messages they are receiving. Therefore, it is important for user to keep to most critical 5 message based on their interests and more importantly, based on how other users reacted to that message. [0003] Many users use online social networking for both professional and personal uses. Each of these different types of use has its own unstated protocol for behavior. It is extremely important for the users to act in an adequate manner depending upon which social 20 network on which they are operating. For example, it may be very important to say "congratulations" to a friend when that friend announces that she/he has gotten a new job. This is a particular problem as many users subscribe to many social different social networks. With an ever increasing online connectivity and growing list of online contacts and given the amount of information users put online, it is possible for a person to miss such an update. 1 [00041 Existing techniques do not adequately address the amount of information produced in social networks, the increased number of contacts, and the number items that require reply or messages. For example, some calendar programs allow the user to manually set reminders for special events such as birthdays or anniversaries. However, all that is 5 produced is a reminder message about the event that the user input. There is no additional information or context. Furthermore, no message or reply is generated. Finally, such systems are not able to respond to dynamic events and can only handle events where the date and time are known beforehand. 0 SUMMARY [00051 The present disclosure overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art at least in part by providing a system and method for generating suggestions for personalized reactions or messages. The system according to the present disclosure includes a suggestion generation module. In one embodiment, the suggestion generation module 5 includes a plurality of collector modules, a credentials module, a suggestion analyzer module, a user interface module and a decision tree. The plurality of collector modules are coupled to respective systems to collect information accessible by the user and important to the user from other systems such as e-mail systems, SMS/MMS systems, micro blogging systems, social networks or other systems. The credentials module cooperates with the plurality of 20 collector modules to allow access to those other systems. The information from these collector modules is provided to the suggestion analyzer module. The suggestion analyzer module cooperates with the user interface module and the decision tree to generate suggested reactions or messages for the user to send. The suggested reactions or messages are presented by the user interface module to the user. The user interface module also displays 2 the original message, other information about the original message such as others' responses, and action buttons for sending, discarding or ignoring the suggested message. [00061 The present disclosure is particularly advantageous because it provides a system and interface that automatically generate suggestions for personalized reactions or 5 messages. There is no requirement for the user to set reminders or be proactive. The system automatically without user input analyzes information to which the user has access, and generates suggestions for personalized reactions to messages. The suggestion analyzer cooperates with the decision tree to learn the user's behavior and automatically adjust the suggested messages that are generated over time. 0 [00071 The present disclosure also describes a number of methods including a method for initializing a message suggestion system, a method for generating suggested messages or reactions, a method for sending suggested messages or reactions, and a method for updating a suggestion analyzer. 5 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [00081 The disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

However, the present invention applies to any type of computing device that can receive data 25 and commands, and any devices providing services. Moreover, the present invention is 4 described below primarily in the context of e-mail and use in social networks; however, those skilled the art will understand that the present invention applies to any type of communication and can be used for other applications beyond social networks such as but not limited to micro blogging, instant messaging, e-mail, etc. 5 [0018] Reference in the specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase "in one embodiment" in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. 0 [0019] Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent 5 sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, 20 characters, terms, numbers or the like. [0020] It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing 25 terms such as "processing" or "computing" or "calculating" or "determining" or "displaying" 5 or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other 5 such information storage, transmission or display devices. [00211 The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a 0 computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memories including USB keys with non-volatile memory or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer system bus. 5 [00221 The invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. [00231 Furthermore, the invention can take the form of a computer program product 20 accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. 6 [00241 A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary 5 storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution. [00251 Input/output or 1/0 devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening 1/0 controllers. 0 [00261 Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters. [00271 Finally, the algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related 5 to any particular computer or other apparatus.

The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. 20 It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. System Overview [00281 Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of a system 100 for generating suggestions 25 for personalized reactions or messages according to one embodiment of the present 7 disclosure. The illustrated system 100 for generating suggestions for personalized reactions or messages includes user devices 115a, 115b, 115n that are accessed by users 120a, 120b, 120n, a social network server 101 and a third party server 107. In the illustrated embodiment, these entities are communicatively coupled via a network 105. Although only three devices 5 115 are illustrated, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any numbers of user devices 115n are available to any number of users 120n. Moreover, those skilled in the art will recognize that while the present disclosure is described below primarily in the context of social networks 101 and e-mail 123, the present disclosure is applicable to any type of online communications. 0 [00291 The user devices 115a, 115b, 115n in Figure 1 are used by way of example. While Figure 1 illustrates three devices, the present disclosure applies to any system architecture having one or more user devices. Furthermore, while only one network 105 is coupled to the user devices, 115a, 115b, 115n, the social network server 101 and the third party server 107, in practice any number of networks 105 can be connected to the entities. 5 Furthermore, while only one third party server 107 is shown, the system 100 could include one or more third party servers 107. [00301 In one embodiment, the suggestion generation module 103a is operable on the social network server 101a, which is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 104. The social network server 101a also includes a social network software/application 109. 20 Although only one social network server 101a is shown, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that multiple servers may be present. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature, for example, Orkut. The common feature includes relationships/connections, e.g., friendship, family, work, an interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, such as 25 those included in the system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships 8 implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph. In some examples, the social graph 125 can reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related. Furthermore, it should be understood that social network server 101a and social network software/application 109 are representative of one social network and that 5 there are multiple social networks 101b .... 101n coupled to the network 105, each having its own server, application and social graph. For example, a first social network is more directed to business networking, a second more directed to or centered on academics, a third is more directed to local business, a fourth directed to dating and others of general interest or a specific focus. 0 [00311 In another embodiment, the suggestion generation module 103b is stored on a third party server 107, which is connected to the network 105 via signal line 106.

The other source collector module 210 collects information related to the user's interaction with that other 25 system. The other source collector module 210 stores the information collected in the storage 16 239. The other source collector module 210 also interacts with the credentials module 212 to retrieve the information necessary to access the other systems 107, 127 and 137. The other source collector module 210 is coupled by the bus 220 for communication with the pencils module 212, the storage 239, and the other systems via network 105. Those skilled in the art 5 will recognize that all of the above collector modules 202-210 allow the suggestion generation module 103 to access and retrieve any and all information to which the user has access. For example, the social network collector module 208, the suggestion generation module 103 can access the user's social graph, posts sent and received, and any other data public or private that is available to the user. 0 [00471 The credentials module 212 is software and routines for receiving, storing, and providing credentials related to a user's access of other systems. In some embodiments, the credentials module 212 stores credential information (login name, password, and other credentials) related to access of various different systems. In one embodiment, the credentials module 212 cooperates with the initialization module 222 to receive input from 5 the user including: 1) system information (e.g., Gmail Web address or social network web address); 2) login name; 3) passwords; and 4) other credential information required to access the account. In another embodiment, the credentials module 212 cooperates with one or more of the e-mail collector module 202, the SMS/MMS collector module 204, the micro-blogging collector module 206, the social network collector module 208 and the other source collector 20 module 210 to provide credential information that allows these other modules 202, 204, 206, 208 and 210 to access their respective systems. In another embodiment, the credentials module 212 receives, and encrypts the credential information before storing it in a predefined data structure in the storage 239. Only the credentials module 212 knows the structure in storage and encryption of the data and can access the data from the storage 239 while other 25 modules cannot. 17 [00481 The suggestion analyzer module 214 is software and routines for generating a personalized message or reaction for a user. The suggestion analyzer module 214 is coupled to receive, process and analyze information collected by the collector modules 202, 204, 206, 208 and 210. In one embodiment, the suggestion analyzer module 214 receives the 5 information directly from the collector modules 202, 204, 206, 208 and 210. In another embodiment, these collector modules 202, 204, 206, 208 and 210 store the collected information in storage 239, and the suggestion analyzer module 214 retrieves the information from storage 239. As shown in Figure 2, the suggestion analyzer module 214 outputs suggested messages and other information (as represented by the dash line) to the user 0 interface module 216 for presentation to the user. The operation of the suggestion analyzer module 214 will be described in more detail below with reference to Figures 4-8. The suggestion analyzer module 214 advantageously processes the information and determines which messages are most important to the user, which messages have the highest priority, and which messages are most worthy of reaction. In one embodiment, the suggestion analyzer 5 module 214 receives input from the decision tree 218 in making this determination. In this manner the suggestion analyzer module 214 is adaptive to the feedback from the user and over time can become automatic without need for the user to approve or reject suggested messages. Moreover, the suggestion analyzer module 214 is as able to adapt the content and tone of messages according to feedback from the user. The suggestion analyzer module 214 20 also generates a suggested reaction or message based on the content of the original message, reactions to the original message and other information from the other systems. In this context, the other systems can include one or more of an e-mail system, a SMS/MMS system, a micro-blogging system, a social network or other electronic communication systems. The suggestion analyzer module 214 is coupled by the bus 220 for communication with the 25 collector modules 202, 204, 206, 208 and 210, the user interface module 216, the decision 18 tree 218, and the storage 239. [00491 The user interface module 216 allows the suggestion generation module 103 to interact with the user. For example, the user interface module 216 generates and presents graphic user interfaces (GUI) that allow interaction with the user such as via user device 115. 5 The user interface module 216 is coupled by the bus 220 to the network 105 and to the user devices 1 15a-1 15n. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the user interface module 216 can also be coupled to any other input/output devices associated with any of the other components in Figure 1. The user interface module 216 generates and sends interfaces as will be described in more detail below with reference to Figure 8 for reviewing suggested 0 personalized reactions or messages, and sending suggested personalized messages. The user interface module 216 also receives input from the user related to the action to be taken with regard to a particular suggested personalized message or reaction. The user interface module 216 is also coupled to provide information related to the suggested personalized message or reactions such as the original message and other information about the original message. The 5 user interface module 216 is coupled by the bus 220 to the suggestion analyzer module 214, the decision tree 218, the initialization module 222 and the network 105. [00501 The decision tree 218 is a module or routines that implement a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graphical model for making decisions. In one embodiment, the decision tree 218 is an artificial intelligence-based decision tree. The decision tree 218 is 20 coupled to the user interface module 216 to receive information from the user regarding suggested messages and whether they are sent, modified and sent, ignored or discarded. A sent message can be sent exactly as suggested by the suggestion analyzer module 214 or modified and then sent. In the former case, the decision tree 218 receives positive feedback and adjusts the tree as appropriate. In the latter case, the decision tree 218 still receives 25 positive feedback, but not as strong since the user modified the message, and adjusts the tree 19 as appropriate. The content of future messages may also be changed based on the modifications made by the user to the suggested message. If the user input an ignore message response, the decision tree 218 is modified since the feedback indicated that the user does not care about this topic and messages of this type. The decision tree 218 is adjusted so 5 that these messages have a lower priority or are not even generated going forward. Finally, the user can discard or reject a message. In one embodiment, no feedback is provided for such responses and discarding messages has no affect on the decision tree 218. In another embodiment, the discard selection indicates that the message is inaccurate or that the user does not want reaction to the message, and it is considered negative feedback with the 0 decision tree 218 being adjusted to filter out these type of anomalies. [0051] The decision tree 218 also receives information about how that suggested message was generated and information associated with the suggested message. The decision tree 218 uses this information to adjust the algorithm, nodes, weights and outcomes. The decision tree 218 is coupled by bus 220 to send and receive information from the user 5 interface module 216 and the suggestion analyzer module 214. [0052] The initialization module 222 is software or routines for initializing the suggestion generation module 103. In particular, the initialization module 222 cooperates with the user interface module 216 to acquire information from the user about online communication systems that are utilized by the user. For example, if a particular user 20 commonly accesses e-mail and a particular social network, that information is identified and retrieved by the initialization module 222. The operation of the initialization module 222 will be described in more detail below with reference to Figure 4. The initialization module 222 collects information about the user's accounts with other online communication systems. The initialization module 222 sends such information to the credentials module 212 for storage 25 and future use. The initialization module 222 is coupled by the bus 220 to the user interface 20 module 216 and the credentials module 212. [00531 Referring now to Figure 3, a state diagram 300 illustrating an example social network and messaging paths utilized by the suggestion generation module 103 according to one embodiment is shown. In this example, the social graph of Alice 302 includes direct 5 relationships with Bob 304 and Charlie 306. Alice also has a direct relationship with David 308 who in turn has a direct relationship with Ed 310. Charlie 306 also has a direct relationship with Bob 304 and David 308. The state diagram 300 will be used to show some example cases in which the suggestion generation module 103 of the present disclosure is particularly advantageous. If Alice 302 is using the suggestion generation module 103 to act 0 on her behalf, the suggestion generation module 103 generates various personalized response messages or reactions under certain example conditions as follows. The suggestion generation module 103 processes and analyzes data from Alice's social graph as well as her e-mail account. In a first example, assume a friend, Bob 304, in the group or circle of Alice 302 posts a message at location which is either public or accessible to Alice 302 and at least a 5 certain predefined number of friends posts a reaction (for example, all the reactions might be congratulating Bob 304 or some of these might even carry a negative tone which can imply a controversial discussion). The suggestion generation module 103 informs Alice 302 to post an appropriate message to Bob 304 and also presents good suggestions based on the earlier messages to Bob 304. In a second example, a lot of (common) friends of Charlie 306 post 20 messages for Charlie 306 with similar implications (e.g., messages saying "Happy Birthday!"). The suggestion generation module 103 informs Alice 302 to make an adequate post and also presents good suggestions (based on the earlier messages sent to Charlie 306). In this manner, the suggestion generation module 103 automatically handles various important dates in Alice's social circle without Alice 302 having to maintain a record of the 25 date or pre-record any action or reminder. In a third example, a friend, David 308, sends 21 Alice 3028 public or private message of a particular but regularly encountered message type (e.g., "how are you doing?" a common way to greet someone in the United States). The suggestion generation module 103 suggest a good set of reactions to David 308, for example, based on the professional profile of David 308 from the social network 109 indicating that 5 David 308 has changed employers. The suggestion generation module 103 generates a reply message such as "Hey David, I am fine, You were in ABC corp. for 3 years and you recently moved to XYZ corp., how do you feel about the difference, enjoying your new workplace?)" The content of this suggestion are based on 1) prior conversations between Alice and David, 2) previous messages sent by Alice to other friends and 3) messages (sent by other 0 connections in Alice's friend circle to David) which are either publicly or privately accessible to Alice, or some combination of these. Thus, the suggestion generation module 103 generates messages that are personalized based upon both the sender and recipient using information that is accessible (public or private) to the sender. In other embodiments, the suggestion generation module 103 is also modified so that the reply messages are adapted to 5 cultures and customs of the recipient. As will described in more detail below with reference to Figure 8, instead of sending messages automatically, the suggestion generation module 103 shows messages to Alice 302 (for approval), and the approval interface can be a dedicated web UI or it could be as simple as "reply to this email and this reply will be sent." In other embodiment, the suggestion analyzer module 214 includes an option for posting certain 20 categories of messages to certain types of websites an automatic fashion without requiring user approval. For example, after the decision tree 218 has been trained for a particular user such that the inaccurate messages or reactions have largely been eliminated, this automatic sending feature may be employed. 22 Methods [00541 Referring now to Figures 4-7, the methods of the present disclosure will be described. [00551 Referring now to Figure 4, a method for initializing a suggestion generation 5 module 103 according to one embodiment will be described. The method begins by presenting 406 a user interface for inputting information about online communications that are employed by the user. In one embodiment, a user interface is presented that allows the user to input their credentials for accessing e-mail, a social network, SMS/MMS messaging systems, instant messaging systems, Web servers, micro blogging systems, profile systems, 0 or other third party systems. For example, the user interface may include a plurality of fields in which the user can input: 1) an address for accessing a system; 2) a login or user ID; 3) a password; and 4) any other credential information necessary to gain access to the system. The user then inputs the data source and credentials using the user interface (and the user device 115, for example) and that information is received 408 by the suggestion generation 5 module 103. Next the method stores 410 the credentials for later use by the suggestion generation module 103. In one embodiment, the information is stored by the initialization module 222 in the credential module 212. In another embodiment, the information is stored by the initialization module 222c in the data storage 239 in a unique data format and encrypted such that only the credentials module 212 can read and access the information. 20 The method continues by determining 412 whether the user has additional data sources that are to be used to produce personalized messages or reactions. If not, the method is complete and ends. However, if there are additional data sources that the user wants to utilize to generate personalized messages or reactions, the method returns to step 406 and repeats steps 406-412 for each additional data source. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the 25 present invention requires only a single source to generate personalized suggested messages 23 or reactions. For example, the suggestion generation module 103 may only include the e mail collector module 202 or only the social network cluster module 208 and use only one of these sources in generating the personalized reactions or messages. However, the present invention is also able to utilize a plurality of data sources in generating personalized reactions 5 or messages. Further, when multiple data sources are utilize, the personalized reactions and messages can be customized to be more accurate and appropriate for the context in which the user is root client were sending the message. In either case, each data source to be utilized must be initialized by performing step 405-410 for each data source. [00561 Referring now to Figure 5, a method 500 for processing collected information 0 to generate suggested messages or reactions according to one embodiment will be described. The method 500 begins collecting/retrieving data from various sources. In this embodiment, the method begins by retrieving 502 data from the social network 109. Then, the method retrieves 504 data from the e-mail server 129. Next, the method retrieves 506 data from the micro-blogging server 121. Then the method retrieves 508 data from the SMS/MMS server 5 129. Finally, the method retrieves 510 data from other data sources 107, 127, 131, 135 and 137. In one embodiment, this information is retrieved by the collectors 202-210 described above with reference to Figure 2. Those skilled in the art will recognize that steps 502-510 can be performed in any order. Furthermore, one or more of steps 502-510 are optional and the method of the present disclosure is operable so long as information is retrieved from one 20 of these data sources. [00571 The method continues by correlating 512 the data from different sources. For example, if a user receives an e-mail about a particular event, activity, interest, etc., from a particular individual, and that individual is also connected to the user in the user's social graph a correlation between the data from disparate resources is created. If there is only a 25 single source of data, this correlation step is not necessary and may be omitted. However, if 24 the data from multiple sources can be correlated and used to identify increased specificity about the topic or parties involved, the messages can be personalized to a greater extent. In other words, the date from different profiles is related or correlated based upon name and email. Next, the method weighs 514 the data from the different sources. In other words, 5 different events, activities and interests are rated with different weights based upon the user's interest in these topics and the number of other people who have reacted to the messages. For example, if the user frequently "ignores" messages containing the word "baseball" the system will learn over time to reduce the priority of those messages and will eventually stop showing those messages altogether (even if all other connections of user love sending messages 0 containing word "baseball." Similarly, if user regularly reacts to messages containing "football," the decision tree 218 will increase its priority over time. Also, if the user shows similar amount of interest in "cooking" as well as "football," the decision tree 218 will give a higher priority based on number of reactions received on the message, since the greater the number of reactions to the message, the more important it is for the user to react to it. Next, 5 the data from different sources is labeled or categorize 516 into different categories so that suggested the personalized reactions to messages can be presented to the user in groups or ordered according to the categories. For example, individuals may be categorized by based on categories such as personal, business, family, friends based on the information collected from the sources. In one embodiment, labels are created based upon phrase matching in the 20 original message and its reactions. If there is a phrase match, then the existing label is assigned, if not, a new label is created and assigned. Over time a library of words or labels are created. For example, phases like birthday, anniversary, congratulations, etc. are likely to appear in messages and will generate a set of labels. Next, based upon the weight and the label, the messages are ranked 518 in order from the most important or interesting to the least 25 important or least interesting. Finally the method completes by generating and presenting or 25 outputting 520 suggested personalized reactions or messages to the user. For example, this can be done using the user interface as shown in Figure 8 as will be described in more detail below. [00581 Referring now to Figure 6, a method 600 for presenting suggested 5 personalized messages or reactions according to one embodiment will be described. The method begins by presenting 602 suggestions for personalized messages to the user. [00591 Referring now also to Figure 8, a graphic representation of an example user interface 800 for presenting suggestions for personalized messages is shown. The user interface 800 includes a window having a number of components including a message box 0 802 for displaying an original message, a context box 804 for providing information about the original message, a suggested message box 806 including a suggested message or reaction, and a plurality buttons 808, 810 and 812 allowing the user to input an action to be taken on the suggested reaction or message. [00601 In one embodiment, the message box 802 includes a label specifying the 5 author of the message and a field 814 that includes the original text of the message. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the message could be a post on a social network, an e mail message or any other type of electronic communication. The field 814 is used to store and present the body or content of the electronic communication. In this example, the field 814 includes the message "Got a job in the Bay Area!!!" 20 [00611 In one embodiment, the context box 804 includes information related to the original message. For example, the context box 804 includes a sample response and information about related responses. In this example, the context box 804 includes an indication that 24 friends have commented and that the comments or messages have included "Congrats". In this embodiment, the context box 804 also includes a selectable button 816 25 that allows the context box 804 to be expanded to display additional responses to the original 26 message. If the button 816 is selected, the responses of other members in the group/connection/circle/recipients are displayed. It might be possible that another friend might have posted a similar message but have received only one reaction. In that case, the decision tree 218 will not give the latter message as high priority as the one which received 5 reaction from 24 users and might not even present the latter message to user. [00621 In one embodiment, the suggested message box 806 includes a label, a field 818 including a suggested message and a selectable button 820 for displaying additional suggested messages. Proximate the field 818, a label of "Suggested Response:" is positioned to indicate to the user that the content in field 818 is the suggested response. In this example, 0 the field 818 includes a reply message of "Congratulations and Best of Luck for the future!" In another embodiment, the field 818 is editable and the user can input their own message or revise the existing messages. In such a case, those edits will be sent to the decision tree 218 as feedback as will be described in more detail below. Below the suggested response field 818 a selectable button 820 is positioned. The button 820 is labeled "See more suggestions" 5 and when selected the suggested message box 806 is modified such that the field 818 displays another different suggested message. In one embodiment, as the user repeatedly selects the button 820, new suggested responses are displayed in the field 818 and the user interface 800 presents additional suggested responses in various orders such as random, ranked by relevance, ranked by importance, ranked by match to context, etc. In another embodiment, in 20 response to selection of the button 820, field 818 becomes a drop-down menu of suggested responses from which the user may select. In another embodiment, more suggestions will be populated over the period of time based on the feedback signals received from the user. [00631 In one embodiment, below the suggested message box 806 are the plurality buttons 808, 810 and 812. A first button 808 when selected by the user causes the message in 25 the field 818 of the suggested response box 806 to be sent to the author of the original 27 message and close the user interface 800. As used in this context, sent means to send a message or reply based upon the format of the message shown in the message box 802. A second button 810 discards the message in the field 818 of the suggested response box 806 and closes the user interface 800. In one embodiment, selection of the second button 810 5 does not return a feedback signal to the decision tree 218. A third button 812 discards the message in the field 818 of the selected response box 806, closes the user interface 800, and also updates the suggestion generation module 103 so that it does not present messages similar in type to the one in the suggested response box 806. As will be described in more detail below, selection of the first and third buttons 808 and 812 generates an update to the 0 suggestion generation module 103 such that it becomes more accurate at generating suggestions over time. [00641 Referring back to Figure 6, the method continues to receive 604 user input. For example, the user must select one of the buttons 808, 810 and 812 indicating how to handle the suggested personalized message or reaction. Next, the method determines 606 5 whether the suggested response was rejected. In other words, the method determines whether the user selected the third or "ignore such messages" button 812. If so, the method updates 608 the decision tree 218 and the suggestion analyzer module 214. For example, the method provides the user input as feedback to the decision tree 218 and the suggestion analyzer module 214 so that such messages may be ranked lower in the future. After step 608, the 20 method determines 610 whether the user is finished sending personalized suggested messages. If not, the method returns to step 602 to present the user interface 800. If not, the method is complete and ends. [00651 If in step 606, the method determined that the suggestion was not rejected, the method continues to determine 612 whether the user has modified the suggested personalized 25 message. In this case, the user has edited the suggested personalized response and then 28 selected the send response button 808. If so, the method modifies 614 the message. Next, the method updates 616 the decision tree 218 and the suggestion analyzer module 214 that the user has edited the suggested response and decided to send the edited response. This feedback can be used by the decision tree 218 and the suggestion analyzer module 218 to 5 improve the suggested responses provided later. And then the method continues to deliver the message 618 after which the method proceeds to step 610 as has been described above. [00661 If in step 612, the method determined that the suggestion was not modified, the method continues to determine 620 whether the user has approved the suggested personalized message. If not, the method proceeds to step 610 as has been described above. 0 It should be noted that in this case the user has selected the second or discard button 810. The message is not sent and also the decision tree 218 and suggestion analyzer module 214 are not updated. On the other hand, if the user has approved the suggested personalized message and select the send response button 808, the decision tree and suggestion analyzer module 214 are updated 622 after which the message is delivered 618. The method returns to 5 step 610 to determine whether there are any additional suggested messages to be sent if so the method returns to step 602. If not the method is complete and ends. [00671 Referring now to Figure 7, a method 700 for modifying the decision tree 218 of the suggestion generation module 103 according to one embodiment will be described. The method 700 begins by receiving 702 input from the user interface module 216. As has 20 been described above with reference to Figure 6, the selection of different buttons 808 and 812 will provide feedback to the decision tree 218 and the suggestion analyzer module 214. Next, the method 700 updates 704 the decision tree 218 based upon the rejection of any suggested personalized reaction or message. Then the method updates 706 the decision tree 218 based upon modifications to sent messages. Next, the method updates 708 the decision 25 tree 218 based upon unchanged suggested messages being sent. Then the method modifies 29 710 the suggestion analyzer module 214 based upon the updates to the decision tree 214. Finally, the method adjusts 712 the weights of the suggestion analyzer module 214 based upon user interaction, after which the method is complete and ends.
