- a portable device for capturing and acting on text contained in a rendered document (“the device”) is described; in some cases as part of a more extensive system for processing text captured with the portable device (“the system”).
- a portable device that has scanning capability indicates to a user that the user has scanned enough text or other information to uniquely identify a document.
- the portable device has an image capture device for acquiring images, a processor for processing the images, memory for storing data and/or logic (such as computer programs), an input/output communications interface for communicating with other devices, a power supply, an illumination source for illuminating the information being scanned, and a location module.
- the portable device instead of or in addition to having visual scanning capability, has audio text capture capability, which enables the device to capture an audio clip of the user reading aloud from a rendered document.
- the system typically subjects such audio clips to voice recognition techniques to derive textual content from the audio text capture operation.
- references to the portable text capture device herein are sometimes specific to visual scanning, those skilled in the art will appreciate that statements made containing such references may equally be applied to portable text capture device using other text capture techniques, such as audio text capture.
- the text or symbols scanned by the scanner are used and interpreted as control commands by the scanner's control logic or control software to cause the scanner to execute software programs or otherwise perform certain predetermined actions (such as erase data from memory, turn on/off, initiate and/or complete a financial transaction, etc.).
- the portable scanner indicates to a user that enough text has been scanned to identify the document so that an electronic copy may be located.
- the portable scanner may compare the amount of information scanned to a predetermined threshold level to determine whether enough information has been scanned. (This threshold method is particularly useful when the scanner is not in communication with a computer.)
- the remote computer may send a message to the scanner indicating that it has identified the document from which the text was scanned.
- the portable scanner indicates to the user that the document has been identified and the user may stop scanning.
- the indicator is visual (e.g., a Light Emitting Device (LED), display, etc.), auditory (e.g., speaker, beeper, etc.) or haptic (stimulating the sense of touch).
- the portable scanner has location and/or time determination capability and may store location and/or time information about where and/or when a scan occurred along with the scanned data.
- the time information may be a timestamp associated with a particular scanning event.
- the location-information may be a location-stamp associated with a particular scanning event.
- operation of a portable device such as the portable scanner is controlled by characteristics of the scan, such as speed, repetition, direction, etc.
- control programs or logic in the scanner may be responsive to special symbols. These special symbols may be associated with particular actions to be performed, or programs to be executed, by the portable device.
- the portable scanner has billing, subscription, and/or device identifier information stored in memory.
- Subscription information can be used to verify the users right to access an electronic copy of the identified document, such as a pre-paid account for example.
- Billing information may be used to pay for access to an electronic copy of the identified document.
- Device identifiers may be used as a security feature to assist in verifying a user's identity.
- the system uses a sample of text captured from a paper document, for example using a handheld scanner, to identify and locate an electronic counterpart of the document.
- the amount of text needed by the facility is very small in that a few words of text from a document can often function as an identifier for the paper document and as a link to its electronic counterpart.
- the system may use those few words to identify not only the document, but also a location within the document.
- the system implements these and many other examples of “paper/digital integration” without requiring changes to the current processes of writing, printing and publishing documents, giving such conventional rendered documents a whole new layer of digital functionality.
- a rendered document is a printed document or a document shown on a display or monitor. It is a document that is perceptible to a human, whether in permanent form or on a transitory display.
- Scanning or capturing is the process of systematic examination to obtain information from a rendered document.
- the process may involve optical capture using a scanner or camera (for example a camera in a cellphone), or it may involve reading aloud from the document into an audio capture device or typing it on a keypad or keyboard.
- a scanner or camera for example a camera in a cellphone
- This section describes some of the devices, processes and systems that constitute a system for paper/digital integration.
- the system builds a wide variety of services and applications on this underlying core that provides the basic functionality.
- FIG. 1 is a data flow diagram that illustrates the flow of information in one embodiment of the core system. Other embodiments may not use all of the stages or elements illustrated here, while some will use many more.
- Text from a rendered document is captured 100 , typically in optical form by an optical scanner or audio form by a voice recorder, and this image or sound data is then processed 102 , for example to remove artifacts of the capture process or to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
- a recognition process 104 such as OCR, speech recognition, or autocorrelation then converts the data into a signature, comprised in some embodiments of text, text offsets, or other symbols.
- the system performs an alternate form of extracting document signature from the rendered document.
- the signature represents a set of possible text transcriptions in some embodiments. This process may be influenced by feedback from other stages, for example, if the search process and context analysis 110 have identified some candidate documents from which the capture may originate, thus narrowing the possible interpretations of the original capture.
- a post-processing 106 stage may take the output of the recognition process and filter it or perform such other operations upon it as may be useful. Depending upon the embodiment implemented, it may be possible at this stage to deduce some direct actions 107 to be taken immediately without reference to the later stages, such as where a phrase or symbol has been captured which contains sufficient information in itself to convey the user's intent. In these cases no digital counterpart document need be referenced, or even known to the system.
- next stage will be to construct a query 108 or a set of queries for use in searching.
- Some aspects of the query construction may depend on the search process used and so cannot be performed until the next stage, but there will typically be some operations, such as the removal of obviously misrecognized or irrelevant characters, which can be performed in advance.
- the query or queries are then passed to the search and context analysis stage 110 .
- the system optionally attempts to identify the document from which the original data was captured.
- the system typically uses search indices and search engines 112 , knowledge about the user 114 and knowledge about the user's context or the context in which the capture occurred 116 .
- Search engine 112 may employ and/or index information specifically about rendered documents, about their digital counterpart documents, and about documents that have a web (internet) presence). It may write to, as well as read from, many of these sources and, as has been mentioned, it may feed information into other stages of the process, for example by giving the recognition system 104 information about the language, font, rendering and likely next words based on its knowledge of the candidate documents.
- the sources of the documents 124 may be directly accessible, for example from a local filing system or database or a web server, or they may need to be contacted via some access service 122 which might enforce authentication, security or payment or may provide other services such as conversion of the document into a desired format.
- markup The next stage of the process 130 , then, is to identify any markup relevant to the captured data.
- markup may be provided by the user, the originator, or publisher of the document, or some other, party, and may be directly accessible from some source 132 or may be generated by some service 134 .
- markup can be associated with, and apply to, a rendered document and/or the digital counterpart to a rendered document, or to groups of either or both of these documents.
- actions may be taken 140 .
- These may be default actions such as simply recording the information found, they may be dependent on the data or document, or they may be derived from the markup analysis. Sometimes the action will simply be to pass the data to another system.
- the various possible actions appropriate to a capture at a specific point in a rendered document will be presented to the user as a menu on an associated display, for example on a local display 332 , on a computer display 212 or a mobile phone or PDA display 216 . If the user doesn't respond to the menu, the default actions can be taken.
- FIG. 2 is a component diagram of components included in a typical implementation of the system in the context of a typical operating environment.
- the operating environment includes one or more optical scanning capture devices 202 or voice capture devices 204 .
- Each capture device is able to communicate with other parts of the system such as a computer 212 and a mobile station 216 (e.g., a mobile phone or PDA) using either a direct wired or wireless connection, or through the network 220 , with which it can communicate using a wired or wireless connection, the latter typically involving a wireless base station 214 .
- the capture device is integrated in the mobile station, and optionally shares some of the audio and/or optical components used in the device for voice communications and picture-taking.
- Computer 212 may include a memory containing computer executable instructions for processing an order from scanning devices 202 and 204 .
- an order can include an identifier (such as a serial number of the scanning device 2021204 or an identifier that partially or uniquely identifies the user of the scanner), scanning context information (e.g., time of scan, location of scan, etc.) and/or scanned information (such as a text string) that is used to uniquely identify the document being scanned.
- the operating environment may include more or less components.
- the network 220 may be a corporate intranet, the public Internet, a mobile phone network or some other network, or any interconnection of the above.
- the devices may all be operable in accordance with well-known commercial transaction and communication protocols (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP)).
- IP Internet Protocol
- the functions and capabilities of scanning device 202 , computer 212 , and mobile station 216 may be wholly or partially integrated into one device.
- scanning device, computer, and mobile station can refer to the same device depending upon whether the device incorporates functions or capabilities of the scanning device 202 , computer 212 and mobile station 216 .
- some or all of the functions of the search engines 232 , document sources 234 , user account services 236 , markup services 238 and other network services 239 may be implemented on any of the devices and/or other devices not shown.
- the capture device may capture text using an optical scanner that captures image data from the rendered document, or using an audio recording device that captures a user's spoken reading of the text, or other methods. Some embodiments of the capture device may also capture images, graphical symbols and icons, etc., including machine readable codes such as barcodes.
- the device may be exceedingly simple, consisting of little more than the transducer, some storage, and a data interface, relying on other functionality residing elsewhere in the system, or it may be a more full-featured device. For illustration, this section describes a device based around an optical scanner and with a reasonable number of features.
- Scanners are well known devices that capture and digitize images.
- portable optical scanners have been introduced in convenient form factors, such as a pen-shaped handheld device.
- the portable scanner is used to scan text, graphics, or symbols from rendered documents.
- the portable scanner has a scanning element that captures text, symbols, graphics, etc, from rendered documents.
- rendered documents include documents that have been displayed on a screen such as a CRT monitor or LCD display.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a scanner 302 .
- the scanner 302 comprises an optical scanning head 308 to scan information from rendered documents and convert it to machine-compatible data, and an optical path 306 , typically a lens, an aperture or an image conduit to convey the image from the rendered document to the scanning head.
- the scanning head 308 may incorporate a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD), a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device, or an optical sensor of another type.
- CCD Charge-Coupled Device
- CMOS Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
- a microphone 310 and associated circuitry convert the sound of the environment (including spoken words) into machine-compatible signals, and other input facilities exist in the form of buttons, scroll-wheels or other tactile sensors such as touch-pads 314 .
- Feedback to the user is possible through a visual display or indicator lights 332 , through a loudspeaker or other audio transducer 334 and through a vibrate module 336 .
- the scanner 302 comprises logic 326 to interact with the various other components, possibly processing the received signals into different formats and/or interpretations.
- Logic 326 may be operable to read and write data and program instructions stored in associated storage 330 such as RAM, ROM, flash, or other suitable memory. It may read a time signal from the clock unit 328 .
- the scanner 302 also includes an interface 316 to communicate scanned information and other signals to a network and/or an associated computing device.
- the scanner 302 may have an on-board power supply 332 .
- the scanner 302 may be powered from a tethered connection to another device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection.
- USB Universal Serial Bus
- a reader may scan some text from a newspaper article with scanner 302 .
- the text is scanned as a bit-mapped image via the scanning head 308 .
- Logic 326 causes the bit-mapped image to be stored in memory 330 with an associated time-stamp read from the clock unit 328 .
- Logic 326 may also perform optical character recognition (OCR) or other post-scan processing on the bit-mapped image to convert it to text.
- Logic 326 may optionally extract a signature from the image, for example by performing a convolution-like process to locate repeating occurrences of characters, symbols or objects, and determine the distance or number of other characters, symbols, or objects between these repeated elements.
- the reader may then upload the bit-mapped image (or text or other signature, if post-scan processing has been performed by logic 326 ) to an associated computer via interface 316 .
- a reader may capture some text from an article as an audio file by using microphone 310 as an acoustic capture port.
- Logic 326 causes audio file to be stored in memory 328 .
- Logic 326 may also perform voice recognition or other post-scan processing on the audio file to convert it to text.
- the reader may then upload the audio file (or text produced by post-scan processing performed by logic 326 ) to an associated computer via interface 316 .
- End-to-end feedback can be applied by performing an approximation of the recognition or interpretation, identifying a set of one or more candidate matching documents, and then using information from the possible matches in the candidate documents to further refine or restrict the recognition or interpretation.
- Candidate documents can be weighted according to their probable relevance (for example, based on then number of other users who have scanned in these documents, or their popularity on the Internet), and these weights can be applied in this iterative recognition process.
- the selective power of a search query based on a few words is greatly enhanced when the relative positions of these words are known, only a small amount of text need be captured for the system to identify the text's location in a corpus. Most commonly, the input text win be a contiguous sequence of words, such as a short phrase.
- the system can identify the location in that document and can take action based on this knowledge.
- the system may also employ other methods of discovering the document and location, such as by using watermarks or other special markings on the rendered document.
- search query In addition to the captured text, other factors (i.e., information about user identity, profile, and context) may form part of the search query, such as the time of the capture, the identity and geographical location of the user, knowledge of the user's habits and recent activities, etc.
- the document identity and other information related to previous captures, especially if they were quite recent, may form part of a search query.
- the identity of the user may be determined from a unique identifier associated with a capturing device, and/or biometric or other supplemental information (speech patterns, fingerprints, etc.).
- the search query can be constructed taking into account the types of errors likely to occur in the particular capture method used.
- One example of this is an indication of suspected errors in the recognition of specific characters; in this instance a search engine may treat these characters as wildcards, or assign them a lower priority.
- the capturing device may not be in communication with the search engine or corpus at the time of the data capture. For this reason, information helpful to the offline use of the device may be downloaded to the device in advance, or to some entity with which the device can communicate. In some cases, all or a substantial part of an index associated with a corpus may be downloaded. This topic is discussed further in Section 15.3.
- this pre-loaded information can improve the performance of the local device: reduce communication costs, and provide helpful and timely user feedback.
- the queries may be saved and transmitted to the rest of the system at such a time as communication is restored.
- Section 13.1 discusses the importance of the time of capture in relation to earlier captures. It is important to note that the time of capture will not always be the same as the time that the query is executed.
- multiple queries may be launched in response to a single capture; either in sequence or in parallel.
- queries may be sent in response to a single capture, for example as new words are added to the capture, or to query multiple search engines in parallel.
- the system sends queries to a special index for the current document, to a search engine on a local machine, to a search engine on the corporate network, and to remote search engines on the Internet.
- the results of particular searches may be given higher priority than those from others.
- the response to a given query may indicate that other pending queries are superfluous; these may be cancelled before completion.
- search engines may be enhanced or modified in a number of ways to make them more suitable for use with the described system.
- the search engine and/or other components of the system may create and maintain indices that have different or extra features.
- the system may modify an incoming paper-originated query or change the way the query is handled in the resulting search, thus distinguishing these paper-originated queries from those coming from queries typed into web browsers and other sources.
- the system may take different actions or offer different options when the results are returned by the searches originated from paper as compared to those from other sources.
- the same index can be searched using either paper-originated or traditional queries, but the index may be enhanced for use in the current system in a variety of ways.
- Extra fields can be added to such an index that will help in the case of a paper-based search.
- the first example is a field indicating that the document is known to exist or be distributed in paper form.
- the system may give such documents higher priority if the query comes from paper.
- statistical data concerning the popularity of paper documents (and, optionally, concerning sub-regions within these documents)—for example the amount of scanning activity, circulation numbers provided by the publisher or other sources, etc—is used to give such documents higher priority, to boost the priority of digital counterpart documents (for example, for browser-based queries or web searches), etc.
- Another important example may be recording information about the layout of a specific rendering of a document.
- the index may include information about where the line breaks and page breaks occur, which fonts were used, any unusual capitalization.
- the index may also include information about the proximity of other items on the page, such as images, text boxes, tables and advertisements.
- semantic information that can be deduced from the source markup but is not apparent in the paper document, such as the fact that a particular piece of text refers to an item offered for sale, or that a certain paragraph contains program code, may also be recorded in the index.
- a second factor that may modify the nature of the index is the knowledge of the type of capture likely to be used.
- a search initiated by an optical scan may benefit if the index takes into account characters that are easily confused in the OCR process, or includes some knowledge of the fonts used in the document.
- the query is from speech recognition, an index based on similar-sounding phonemes may be much more efficiently searched.
- An additional factor that may affect the use of the index in the described model is the importance of iterative feedback during the recognition process. If the search engine is able to provide feedback from the index as the text is being captured, it can greatly increase the accuracy of the capture.
- the system stores the appropriate offset or signature information in an index.
- Indices may be maintained on several machines on a corporate network. Partial indices may be downloaded to the capture device, or to a machine close to the capture device. Separate indices may be created for users or groups of users with particular interests, habits or permissions. An index may exist for each filesystem, each directory, even each file on a user's hard disk. Indexes are published and subscribed to by users and by systems. It will be important, then, to construct indices that can be distributed, updated, merged and separated efficiently.
- a search engine may take different actions when it recognizes that a search query originated from a paper document.
- the engine might handle the query in a way that is more tolerant to the types of errors likely to appear in certain capture methods, for example.
- some indicator included in the query for example a flag indicating the nature of the capture
- it may deduce this from the query itself for example, it may recognize errors or uncertainties typical of the OCR process.
- queries from a capture device can reach the engine by a different channel or port or type of connection than those from other sources, and can be distinguished in that way.
- queries from a capture device can reach the engine by a different channel or port or type of connection than those from other sources, and can be distinguished in that way.
- some embodiments of the system will route queries to the search engine by way of a dedicated gateway.
- the search engine knows that all queries passing through the dedicated gateway were originated from a paper document.
- Section 13 describes a variety of different factors which are external to the captured text itself, yet which can be a significant aid in identifying a document. These include such things as the history of recent scans, the longer-term reading habits of a particular user, the geographic location of a user and the user's recent use of particular electronic documents. Such factors are referred to herein as “context”.
- search engine may keep track of a user's scanning history, and may also cross-reference this scanning history to conventional keyboard-based queries. In such cases, the search engine maintains and uses more state information about each individual user than do most conventional search engines, and each interaction with a search-engine may be considered to extend over several searches and a longer period of time than is typical today.
- Some of the context may be transmitted to the search engine in the search query (Section 3.3), and may possibly be stored at the engine so as to play a part in future queries. Lastly, some of the context will best be handled elsewhere, and so becomes a filter or secondary search applied to the results from the search engine.
- the described system can emit and use not only information about documents as a whole, but also information about sub-regions of documents, even down to individual words.
- Many existing search engines concentrate simply on locating a document or file that is relevant to a particular query. Those that can work on a finer grain and identify a location within a document will provide a significant benefit for the described system.
- the search engine may use some of the further information it now maintains to affect the results returned.
- the system may also return certain documents to which the user has access only as a result of being in possession of the paper copy (Section 7.4).
- the search engine may also offer new actions or options appropriate to the described system, beyond simple retrieval of the text.
- the described system In addition to performing the capture-search-retrieve process, the described system also associates extra functionality with a document, and in particular with specific locations or segments of text within a document. This extra functionality is often, though not exclusively, associated with the rendered document by being associated with its electronic counterpart. As an example, hyperlinks in a web page could have the same functionality when a printout of that web page is scanned. In some cases, the functionality is not defined in the electronic document, but is stored or generated elsewhere.
- markup This layer of added functionality is referred to herein as “markup”.
- the markup may include human-readable content, but is often invisible to a user and/or intended for machine use. Examples include options to be displayed in a popup-menu on a nearby display when a user captures text from a particular area in a rendered document, or audio samples that illustrate the pronunciation of a particular phrase.
- Any document may have multiple overlays simultaneously, and these may be sourced from a variety of locations.
- Markup data may be created or supplied by the author of the document, or by the user, or by some other party.
- Markup data may be attached to the electronic document or embedded in it. It may be found in a conventional location (for example, in the same place as the document but with a different filename suffix). Markup data may be included in the search results of the query that located the original document, or may be found by a separate query to the same or another search engine. Markup data may be found using the original captured text and other capture information or contextual information, or it may be found using already deduced information about the document and location of the capture. Markup data may be found in a location specified in the document, even if the markup itself is not included in the document.
- markup may be largely static and specific to the document, similar to the way links on a traditional html web page are often embedded as static data within the html document, but markup may also be dynamically generated and/or, applied to a large number of documents.
- dynamic markup is information attached to a document that includes the up-to-date share price of companies mentioned in that document.
- An example of broadly applied markup is translation information that is automatically available on multiple documents or sections of documents in a particular language.
- Users may also install, or subscribe to particular sources of, markup data, thus personalizing the system's response to particular captures.
- Some elements in documents may have particular “markup” or functionality associated with them based on their own characteristics rather than their location in a particular document. Examples include special marks that are printed in the document purely for the purpose of being scanned, as well as logos and trademarks that can link the user to further information about the organization concerned. The same applies to “keywords” or “key phrases” in the text. Organizations might register particular phrases with which they are associated, or with which they would like to be associated, and attach certain markup to them that would be available wherever that phrase was scanned.
- any word, phrase, etc. may have associated markup.
- the system may add certain items to a pop-up menu (e.g., a link to an online bookstore) whenever the user captures the word “book,” or the title of a book, or a topic related to books.
- digital counterpart documents or indices are consulted to determine whether a capture occurred near the word “book,” or the title of a book, or a topic related to books—and the system behavior is modified in accordance with this proximity to keyword elements.
- markup enables data captured from non-commercial text or documents to trigger a commercial transaction.
- Annotations are another type of electronic information that may be associated with a document.
- a user can attach an audio file of his/her thoughts about a particular document for later retrieval as voice annotations.
- a multimedia annotation a user may attach photographs of places referred to in the document.
- the user generally supplies annotations for the document but the system can associate annotations from other sources (for example, other users in a work group may share annotations).
- markup data may often be supplied by third parties, such as by other readers of the document online discussions and reviews are a good example, as are community-managed information relating to particular works, volunteer-contributed translations and explanations.
- Another example of third-party markup is that provided by advertisers.
- markup By analyzing the data captured from documents by several or all users of the system, markup can be generated based on the activities and interests of a community.
- An example might be an online bookstore that creates markup or annotations that tell the user, in effect, “People who enjoyed this book also enjoyed . . . ”.
- the markup may be less anonymous, and may tell the user which of the people in his/her contact list have also read this document recently.
- Other examples of datastream analysis are included in Section 14.
- Markup will often be based on external events and data sources, such as input from a corporate database, information from the public Internet, or statistics gathered by the local operating system.
- Data sources may also be more local, and in particular may provide information about the user's context—his/her identity, location and activities.
- the system might communicate with the user's mobile phone and offer a markup layer that gives the user the option to send a document to somebody that the user has recently spoken to on the phone.
- the identity of the user will be known. Sometimes this will be an “anonymous identity”, where the user is identified only by the serial number of the capture device, for example. Typically, however, it is expected that the system will have a much more detailed knowledge of the user, which can be used for personalizing the system and to allow activities and transactions to be performed in the user's name.
- One of the simplest and yet most useful functions that the system can perform is to keep a record for a user of the text that s/he has captured and any further information related to that capture, including the details of any documents found, the location within that document and any actions taken as a result.
- This stored history is beneficial for both the user and the system.
- the user can be presented with a “Life Library”, a record of everything s/he has read and captured. This may be simply for personal interest, but may be used, for example, in a library by an academic who is gathering material for the bibliography of his next paper.
- the user may wish to make the library public, such as by publishing it on the web in a similar manner to a weblog, so that others may see what s/he is reading and finds of interest.
- the capture can be stored in the library and can be processed later, either automatically or in response to a user request.
- a user can also subscribe to new markup services and apply them to previously captured scans.
- a record of a user's past captures is also useful for the system. Many aspects of the system operation can be enhanced by knowing the user's reading habits and history. The simplest example is that any scan made by a user is more likely to come from a document that the user has scanned in the recent past, and in particular if the previous scan was within the last few minutes it is very likely to be from the same document. Similarly, it is more likely that a document is being read in start-to-finish order. Thus, for English documents, it is also more likely that later scans will occur farther down in the document. Such factors can help the system establish the location of the capture in cases of ambiguity, and can also reduce the amount of text that needs to be captured.
- this device may be used as a key that identifies the user and authorizes certain actions.
- the device may be embedded in a mobile phone or in some other way associated with a mobile phone account.
- a scanner may be associated with a mobile phone account by inserting a SIM card associated with the account into the scanner.
- the device may be embedded in a credit card or other payment card, or have the facility for such a card to be connected to it. The device may therefore be used as a payment token, and financial transactions may be initiated by the capture from the rendered document.
- the scanner may also be associated with a particular user or account through the process of scanning some token, symbol or text associated with that user or account.
- scanner may be used for biometric identification, for example by scanning the fingerprint of the user.
- the system may identify the user by matching the voice pattern of the user or by requiring the user to speak a certain password or phrase.
- a user scans a quote from a book and is offered the option to buy the book from an online retailer
- the user can select this option, and is then prompted to scan his/her fingerprint to confirm the transaction.
- the capture device When the capture device is used to identify and authenticate the user, and to initiate transactions on behalf of the user, it is important that communications between the device and other parts of the system are secure. It is also important to guard against such situations as another device impersonating a scanner, and so-called “man in the middle” attacks where communications between the device and other components are intercepted.
- An advantage of the described system is that there is no need to alter the traditional processes of creating, printing or publishing documents in order to gain many of the system's benefits. There are reasons, though, that the creators or publishers of a document—hereafter simply referred to as the “publishers”—may wish to create functionality to support the described system.
- the system allows for printed documents to have an associated electronic presence.
- Conventionally publishers often ship a CD-ROM with a book that contains further digital information, tutorial movies and other multimedia data, sample code or documents, or further reference materials.
- some publishers maintain web sites associated with particular publications which provide such materials, as well as information which may be updated after the time of publishing, such as errata, further comments, updated reference materials, bibliographies and further sources of relevant data, and translations into other languages. Online forums allow readers to contribute their comments about the publication.
- the described system allows such materials to be much more closely tied to the rendered document than ever before, and allows the discovery of and interaction with them to be much easier for the user.
- the system can automatically connect the user to digital materials associated with the document, and more particularly associated with that specific part of the document.
- the user can be connected to online communities that discuss that section of the text, or to annotations and commentaries by other readers. In the past, such information would typically need to be found by searching for a particular page number or chapter.
- Some publishers may have mailing lists to which readers can subscribe if they wish to be notified of new relevant matter or when a new edition of the book is published.
- the user can register an interest in particular documents or parts of documents more easily, in some cases even before the publisher has considered providing any such functionality.
- the reader's interest can be fed to the publisher, possibly affecting their decision about when and where to provide updates, further information, new editions or even completely new publications on topics that have proved to be of interest in existing books.
- Such symbols may be intended purely for the reader, or they may be recognized by the system when scanned and used to initiate some action. Sufficient data may be encoded in the symbol to identify more than just the symbol: it may also store information, for example about the document, edition, and location of the symbol, which could be recognized and read by the system.
- the printed document is a gateway to extra materials and functionality, access to such features can also be time-limited. After the expiry date, a user may be required to pay a fee or obtain a newer version of the document to access the features again.
- the paper document will, of course, still be usable, but will lose some of its enhanced electronic functionality. This may be desirable, for example, because there is profit for the publisher in receiving fees for access to electronic materials, or in requiring the user to purchase new editions from time to time, or because there are disadvantages associated with outdated versions of the printed document remaining in circulation. Coupons are an example of a type of commercial document that can have an expiration date.
- Section 10.5 discusses the use of the system's statistics to influence compensation of authors and pricing of advertisements.
- the system deduces the popularity of a publication from the activity in the electronic community associated with it as well as from the use of the paper document. These factors may help publishers to make decisions about what they will publish in future. If a chapter in an existing book, for example, turns out to be exceedingly popular, it may be worth expanding into a separate publication.
- An important aspect of the described system is the ability to provide to a user who has access to a rendered copy of a document access to an electronic version of that document.
- a document is freely available on a public network or a private network to which the user has access.
- the system uses the captured text to identify, locate and retrieve the document, in some cases displaying it on the user's screen or depositing it in their email inbox.
- a document will be available in electronic form, but for a variety of reasons may not be accessible to the user. There may not be sufficient connectivity to retrieve the document, the user may not be entitled to retrieve it, there may be a cost associated with gaining access to it, or the document may have been withdrawn and possibly replaced by a new version, to name just a few possibilities.
- the system typically provides feedback to the user about these situations.
- the degree or nature of the access granted to a particular user may be different if it is known that the user already has access to a printed copy of the document.
- Access to the document may be restricted to specific users, or to those meeting particular criteria, or may only be available in certain circumstances, for example when the user is connected to a secure network.
- Section 6 describes some of the ways in which the credentials of a user and scanner may be established.
- Documents that are not freely available to the general public may still be accessible on payment of a fee, often as compensation to the publisher or copyright-holder.
- the system may implement payment facilities directly or may make use of other payment methods associated with the user, including those described in Section 6.2.
- Electronic documents are often transient; the digital source version of a rendered document may be available now but inaccessible in future.
- the system may retrieve and store the existing version on behalf of the user, even if the user has not requested it, thus guaranteeing its availability should the user request it in future. This also makes it available for the system's use, for example for searching as part of the process of identifying future captures.
- a trusted “document escrow” service can retrieve the document on behalf of the user, such as upon payment of a modest fee, with the assurance that the copyright holder will be fully compensated in future if the user should ever request the document from the service.
- Variations on this theme can be implemented if the document is not available in electronic form at the time of capture.
- the user can authorize the service to submit a request for or make a payment for the document on his/her behalf if the electronic document should become available at a later date.
- payment may be waived, reduced or satisfied based on the user's existing association with another account or subscription. Subscribers to the printed version of a newspaper might automatically be entitled to retrieve the electronic version, for example.
- association may not be quite so direct: a user may be granted access based on an account established by their employer, or based on their scanning of a printed copy owned by a friend who is a subscriber.
- the described system could be coupled to a database which records the location of an original document, for example in an archiving warehouse, making it easy for somebody with access to a copy to locate the archived original paper document.
- OCR Optical Character Recognition
- a scanning device for use with the described system will often be small, portable, and low power.
- the scanning device may capture only a few words at a time, and in some implementations does not even capture a whole character at once, but rather a horizontal slice through the text, many such slices being stitched together to form a recognizable signal from which the text may be deduced.
- the scanning device may also have very limited processing power or storage so, while in some embodiments it may perform all of the OCR process itself, many embodiments win depend on a connection to a more powerful device, possibly at a later time, to convert the captured signals into text.
- it may have very limited facilities for user interaction, so may need to defer any requests for user input until later, or operate in a “best-guess” mode to a greater degree than is common now.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the OCR process can be informed by the contents of the document corpus as it progresses, potentially offering substantially greater recognition accuracy.
- Such a connection will also allow the device to inform the user when sufficient text has been captured to identify the digital source.
- the font may be downloaded to the device to help with the recognition.
- While component characters of a text fragment maybe the most recognized way to represent a fragment of text that may be used as a document signature, other representations of the text may work sufficiently well that the actual text of a text fragment need not be used when attempting to locate the text fragment in a digital document and/or database, or when disambiguating the representation of a text fragment into a readable form.
- Other representations of text fragments may provide benefits that actual text representations lack. For example, optical character recognition of text fragments is often prone to errors, unlike other representations of captured text fragments that may be used to search for and/or recreate a text fragment without resorting to optical character recognition for the entire fragment. Such methods may be more appropriate for some devices used with the current system.
- Such characterizations of text fragments may include, but are not limited to, word lengths, relative word lengths, character heights, character widths, character shapes, character frequencies, token frequencies, and the like.
- the offsets between matching text tokens i.e., the number of intervening tokens plus one are used to characterize fragments of text.
- Embodiments of the present invention are different; they employ a variety of methods that use the rendered text itself to assist in the recognition process. These embodiments use characters (or tokens) to “recognize each other.”
- One way to refer to such self-recognition is “template matching,” and is similar to “convolution.” To perform such self-recognition, the system slides a copy of the text horizontally over itself and notes matching regions of the text images.
- Prior template matching and convolution techniques encompass a variety of related techniques. These techniques to tokenize and/or recognize characters/tokens will be collectively referred to herein as “autocorrelation,” as the text is used to correlate with its own component parts when matching characters/tokens.
- the offset number is the distance (number of tokens) to the next occurrence of the same token. If the token is unique within the text string, the offset is zero (0).
- the sequence of token offsets thus generated is a signature that can be used to identify the scanned text.
- the token offsets determined for a string of scanned tokens are compared to an index that indexes a corpus of electronic documents based upon the token offsets of their contents (Section 4.1.2). In other embodiments, the token offsets determined for a string of scanned tokens are converted to text, and compared to a more conventional index that indexes a corpus of electronic documents based upon their contents
- a similar token-correlation process may be applied to speech fragments when the capture process consists of audio samples of spoken words.
- the shapes of characters in most commonly used fonts are related. For example, in most fonts, the letter “c” and the letter “e” are visually related—as are “t” and “f”, etc.
- the OCR process is enhanced by use of this relationship to construct templates for letters that have not been scanned yet. For example, where a reader scans a short string of text from a paper document in a previously unencountered font such that the system does not have a set of image templates with which to compare the scanned images the system can leverage the probable relationship between certain characters to construct the font template library even though it has not yet encountered all of the letters in the alphabet. The system can then use the constructed font template library to recognize subsequent scanned text and to further refine the constructed font library.
- images cannot be machine-transcribed into a form suitable for use in a search process, the images themselves can be saved for later use by the user, for possible manual transcription, or for processing at a later date when different resources may be available to the system.
- the user may be offered that document for purchase either in paper or electronic form.
- the user may also be offered related documents, such as those quoted or otherwise referred to in the paper document, or those on a similar subject, or those by the same author.
- the capture of text may be linked to other commercial activities in a variety of ways.
- the captured text may be in a catalog that is explicitly designed to sell items, in which case the text will be associated fairly directly with the purchase of an item (Section 18.2).
- the text may also be part of an advertisement, in which case a sale of the item being advertised may ensue.
- the user captures other text from which their potential interest in a commercial transaction may be deduced.
- a reader of a novel set in a particular country might be interested in a holiday there. Someone reading a review of a new car might be considering purchasing it.
- the user may capture a particular fragment of text knowing that some commercial opportunity will be presented to them as a result, or it may be a side-effect of their capture activities.
- the system allows for a new kind of advertising which is not necessarily explicitly in the rendered document, but is nonetheless based on what people are reading.
- advertisements In a traditional paper publication, advertisements generally consume a large amount of space relative to the text of a newspaper article, and a limited number of them can be placed around a particular article.
- advertising can be associated with individual words or phrases, and can selected according to the particular interest the user has shown by capturing that text and possibly taking into account their history of past scans.
- the system may gather a large amount of information about other aspects of a user's context for its own use (Section 13); estimates of the geographical location of the user are a good example. Such data can also be used to tailor the advertising presented to a user of the system.
- the system enables some new models of compensation for advertisers and marketers.
- the publisher of a printed document containing advertisements may receive some income from a purchase that originated from their document. This may be true whether or not the advertisement existed in the original printed form; it may have been added electronically either by the publisher, the advertiser or some third party, and the sources of such advertising may have been subscribed to by the user.
- Analysis of the statistics generated by the system can reveal the popularity of certain parts of a publication (Section 14.2).
- a newspaper for example, it might reveal the amount of time readers spend looking at a particular page or article, or the popularity of a particular columnist.
- An author whose work becomes a frequently read authority on a subject might be considered differently in future contracts from one whose books have sold the same number of copies but are rarely opened. (See also Section 7.6)
- Decisions about advertising in a document may also be based on statistics about the readership.
- the advertising space around the most popular columnists may be sold at a premium rate. Advertisers might even be charged or compensated some time after the document is published based on knowledge about how it was received.
- the “Life Library” or scan history described in Sections 6.1 and 16.1 can be an extremely valuable source of information about the interests and habits of a user. Subject to the appropriate consent and privacy issues, such data can inform offers of goods or services to the user. Even in an anonymous form, the statistics gathered can be exceedingly useful.
- Advertising and other opportunities for commercial transactions may not be presented to the user immediately at the time of text capture. For example, the opportunity to purchase a sequel to a novel may not be available at the time the user is reading the novel, but the system may present them with that opportunity when the sequel is published.
- a user may capture data that relates to a purchase or other commercial transaction, but may choose not to initiate and/or complete the transaction at the time the capture is made.
- data related to captures is stored in a user's Life Library, and these Life Library entries can remain “active” (i.e., capable of subsequent interactions similar to those available at the time the capture was made).
- a user may review a capture at some later time, and optionally complete a transaction based on that capture. Because the system can keep track of when and where the original capture occurred, all parties involved in the transaction can be properly compensated.
- the author who wrote the story—and the publisher who published the story—that appeared next to the advertisement from which the user captured data can be compensated when, six months later, the user visits their Life Library, selects that particular capture from the history, and chooses “Purchase this item at Amazon” from the pop-up menu (which can be similar or identical to the menu optionally presented at the time of the capture).
- OSs Modem Operating Systems
- other software packages have many characteristics that can be advantageously exploited for use with the described system, and may also be modified in various ways to provide an even better platform for its use.
- New and upcoming file systems and their associated databases often have the ability to store a variety of metadata associated with each file.
- this metadata has included such things as the ID of the user who created the file, the dates of creation, last modification, and last use.
- Newer file systems allow such extra information as keywords, image characteristics, document sources and user comments to be stored, and in some systems this metadata can be arbitrarily extended. File systems can therefore be used to store information that would be useful in implementing the current system. For example, the date when a given document was last printed can be stored by the file system, as can details about which text from it has been captured from paper using the described system, and when and by whom.
- capture devices such as pen scanners
- the same will be true for other aspects of the system's operation.
- the entire described system, or the core of it is provided by the OS.
- support for the system is provided by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be used by other software packages, including those directly implementing aspects of the system.
- APIs Application Programming Interfaces
- OSs include support for speech or handwriting recognition, though it is less common for OS to include support for OCR, since in the past the use of OCR has typically been limited to a small range of applications.
- recognition components become part of the OS, they can take better advantage of other facilities provided by the OS.
- Many systems include spelling dictionaries, grammar analysis tools, internationalization and localization-facilities, for example, all of which can be advantageously employed by the described system for its recognition process, especially since they may have been customized for the particular user to include words and phrases that he/she would commonly encounter.
- the operating system includes full-text indexing facilities, then these can also be used to inform the recognition process, as described in Section 9.3.
- an optical scan or other capture occurs and is presented to the OS, it may have a default action to be taken under those circumstances in the event that no other subsystem claims ownership of the capture.
- An example of a default action is presenting the user with a choice of alternatives, or submitting the captured text to the OS's built-in search facilities.
- OS has Default Action for Particular Documents or Document Types
- the OS may have a standard action that it will take when that particular document, or a document of that class, is scanned.
- Applications and other subsystems may register with the OS as potential handlers of particular types of capture; in a similar manner to the announcement by applications of their ability to handle certain file types.
- Markup data associated with a rendered document, or with a capture from a document can include instructions to the operating system to launch specific applications, pass applications arguments, parameters, or data, etc.
- certain items of text or other symbols may, when scanned, cause standard actions to occur, and the OS may provide a selection of these.
- An example might be that scanning the text “[print]” in any document would cause the OS to retrieve and print a copy of that document.
- the OS may also provide a way to register such actions and associate them with particular scans.
- a typical use of the system may be for the user to scan an area of a paper document, and for the system to open the electronic counterpart in a software package that is able to display or edit it, and cause that package to scroll to and highlight the scanned text (Section 12.2.1).
- the first part of this process, finding and opening the electronic document is typically provided by the OS and is standard across software packages.
- the availability of a standard API for this functionality could greatly enhance the operation of this aspect of the system.
- the system may wish to perform a variety of operations upon that text.
- the system may request the surrounding text, so that the user's capture of a few words could result in the system accessing the entire sentence or paragraph containing them.
- this functionality can be usefully provided by the OS rather than being implemented in every piece of software that handles text.
- the system uses the application pop-up menus traditionally associated with clicking the right mouse button on some text. The system inserts extra options into such menus, and causes them to be displayed as a result of activities such as scanning a paper document.
- the OS keeps a simple record of when any document was printed and by whom.
- the OS takes one or more further actions that would make it better suited for use with the system. Examples include:
- An OS often maintains certain categories of folders or files that have particular significance.
- a user's documents may, by convention or design, be found in a “My Documents” folder, for example.
- Standard file-opening dialogs may automatically include a list of recently opened documents.
- Categories may be enhanced or augmented in ways that take into account a user's interaction with paper versions of the stored files. Categories such as “My Printed Documents” or “My Recently-Read Documents” might usefully be identified and incorporated in its operations.
- markup Since important aspects of the system are typically provided using the “markup” concepts discussed in Section 5, it would clearly be advantageous to have support for such markup provided by the OS in a way that was accessible to multiple applications as well as to the OS itself. In addition, layers of markup may be provided by the OS, based on its own knowledge of documents under its control and the facilities it is able to provide.
- Digital Rights Management the ability to control the use of particular data according to the rights granted to a particular user, software entity or machine. It may inhibit unauthorized copying or distribution of a particular document, for example.
- the user interface of the system may be entirely on a PC, if the capture device is relatively dumb and is connected to it by a cable, or entirely on the device, if it is sophisticated and with significant processing power of its own. In some cases, some functionality resides in each component. Part, or indeed all, of the system's functionality may also be implemented on other devices such as mobile phones or PDAs.
- a handheld scanner may have a variety of ways of providing feedback to the user about particular conditions.
- the most obvious types are direct visual, where the scanner incorporates indicator lights or even a full display, and auditory, where the scanner can make beeps, clicks or other sounds.
- Important alternatives include tactile feedback, where the scanner can vibrate, buzz, or otherwise stimulate the user's sense of touch, and projected feedback, where it indicates a status by projecting onto the paper anything from a colored spot of light to a sophisticated display.
- Important immediate feedback that may be provided on the device includes:
- the device may provide a variety of ways for the user to provide input in addition to basic text capture. Even when the device is in close association with a host machine that has input options such as keyboards and mice, it can be disruptive for the user to switch back and forth between manipulating the scanner and using a mouse, for example.
- the handheld scanner may have buttons, scroll/jog-wheels, touch-sensitive surfaces, and/or accelerometers for detecting the movement of the device. Some of these allow a richer set of interactions while still holding the scanner.
- the system presents the user with a set of several possible matching documents.
- the user uses a scroll-wheel on the side of the scanner is to select one from the list, and clicks a button to confirm the selection.
- the user can indicate a large region of text by scanning the first few words in conventional left-to-right order, and the last few in reverse order, i.e. right to left.
- the user can also indicate the vertical extent of the text of interest by moving the scanner down the page over several lines.
- a backwards scan might indicate cancellation of the previous scan operation.
- network connectivity may depend on network connectivity, either between components of the system such as a scanner and a host laptop, or with the outside world in the form of a connection to corporate databases and Internet search. This connectivity may not be present all the time, however, and so there will be occasions when part or all of the system may be considered to be “offline”. It is desirable to allow the system to continue to function usefully in those circumstances.
- the device may be used to capture text when it is out of contact with other parts of the system.
- a very simple device may simply be able to store the image or audio data associated with the capture, ideally with a timestamp indicating when it was captured.
- the various captures may be uploaded to the rest of the system when the device is next in contact with it, and handled then.
- the device may also upload other data associated with the captures, for example voice annotations associated with optical scans, or location information.
- More sophisticated devices may be able to perform some or all of the system operations themselves despite being disconnected. Various techniques for improving their ability to do so are discussed in Section 15.3. Often it will be the case that some, but not all, of the desired actions can be performed while offline. For example, the text may be recognized, but identification of the source may depend on a connection to an Internet-based search engine. In some embodiments, the device therefore stores sufficient information about how far each operation has progressed for the rest of the system to proceed efficiently when connectivity is restored.
- the operation of the system will, in general, benefit from immediately available connectivity, but there are some situations in which performing several captures and then processing them as a batch can have advantages. For example, as discussed in Section 13 below, the identification of the source of a particular capture may be greatly enhanced by examining other captures made by the user at approximately the same time. In a fully connected system where live feedback is being provided to the user, the system is only able to use past captures when processing the current one. If the capture is one of a batch stored by the device when offline, however, the system will be able to take into account any data available from later captures as well as earlier ones when doing its analysis.
- a scanner will often communicate with some other device, such as a PC, PDA, phone or digital camera to perform many of the functions of the system, including more detailed interactions with the user.
- some other device such as a PC, PDA, phone or digital camera to perform many of the functions of the system, including more detailed interactions with the user.
- the host device When the host device receives a capture, it may initiate a variety of activities. An incomplete list of possible activities performed by the system after locating and electronic counterpart document associated with the capture and a location within that document follows.
- the scanner device projects a popup menu onto the paper document.
- a user may select from such menus using traditional methods such as a keyboard and mouse, or by using controls on the capture device (Section 12.1.2), gestures (Section 12.1.3), or by interacting with the computer display using the scanner (Section 12.2.4).
- the popup menus which can appear as a result of a capture include default items representing actions which occur if the user does not respond—for example, if the user ignores the menu and makes another capture.
- the system provides a real-time display of the documents or the locations found, for example in list, thumbnail-image or text-segment form, and for the number of elements in that display to reduce in number as capture continues.
- the system displays thumbnails of all candidate documents, where the size or position of the thumbnail is dependent on the probability of it being the correct match.
- this fact may be emphasized to the user, for example using audio feedback.
- the system may indicate this on the screen, for example by grouping documents containing a quoted reference around the original source document.
- Some optical scanners may be able to capture text displayed on a screen as well as on paper. Accordingly, the term rendered document is used herein to indicate that printing onto paper is not the only form of rendering, and that the capture of text or symbols for use by the system may be equally valuable when that text is displayed on an electronic display.
- the user of the described system may be required to interact with a computer screen for a variety of other reasons, such as to select from a list of options. It can be inconvenient for the user to put down the scanner and start using the mouse or keyboard.
- Other sections have described physical controls on the scanner (Section 12.1.2) or gestures (Section 12.1.3) as methods of input which do not require this change of tool, but using the scanner on the screen itself to scan some text or symbol is an important alternative provided by the system.
- the optics of the scanner allow it to be used in a similar manner to a light-pen, directly sensing its position on the screen without the need for actual scanning of text, possibly with the aid of special hardware or software on the computer.
- Another example of useful context is the user's geographical location.
- a user in Paris is much more likely to be reading Le Monde than the Seattle Times, for example.
- the timing, size and geographical distribution of printed versions of the documents can therefore be important, and can to some degree be deduced from the operation of the system.
- the time of day may also be relevant, for example in the case of a user who always reads one type of publication on the way to work, and a different one at lunchtime or on the train going home.
- the user's recent use of electronic documents can also be a helpful indicator.
- Section 14 covers the analysis of the data stream resulting from paper-based searches, but it should be noted here that statistics about the popularity of documents with other readers, about the timing of that popularity, and about the parts of documents most frequently scanned are all examples of further factors which can be beneficial in the search process.
- the system brings the possibility of Google-type page-ranking to the world of paper.
- This stream is a record of what users are reading and when, and is in many cases a record of what they find particularly valuable in the things they read. Such data has never really been available before for paper documents.
- Section 6.1 Some ways in which this data can be useful for the system, and for the user of the system, are described in Section 6.1. This section concentrates on its use for others. There are, of course, substantial privacy issues to be considered with any distribution of data about what people are reading, but such issues as preserving the anonymity of data are well known to those of skill in the art.
- the system can also deduce who is reading any given document. This allows the tracking of a document through an organization, to allow analysis, for example, of who is reading it and when, how widely it was distributed, how long that distribution took, and who has seen current versions while others are still working from out-of-date copies.
- the system can deduce the popularity of certain documents and of particular sub-regions of those documents. This forms a valuable input to the system itself (Section 42.2) and an important source of information for authors, publishers and advertisers (Section 7.6, Section 10.5). This data is also useful when integrated in search engines and search indices—for example, to assist in ranking search results for queries coming from rendered documents, and/or to assist in ranking conventional queries typed into a web browser.
- One example is connecting one user with others who have related interests. These may be people already known to the user.
- the system may ask a university professor, “Did you know that your colleague at XYZ University has also just read this paper?”
- the system may ask a user, “Do you want to be linked up with other people in your neighborhood who are also how reading Jane Eyre?”
- Such links may be the basis for the automatic formation of book clubs and similar social structures, either in the physical world or online.
- Section 10.6 has already mentioned the idea of offering products and services to an individual user based on their interactions with the system.
- Current online booksellers for example, often make recommendations to a user based on their previous interactions with the bookseller. Such recommendations become much more useful when they are based on interactions with the actual, books.
- the user will also not just be capturing some text, but will be causing some action to occur as a result. It might be emailing a reference to the document to an acquaintance, for example. Even in the absence of information about the identity of the user or the recipient of the email, the knowledge that somebody considered the document worth emailing is very useful.
- the aggregated statistics of that group can be used to deduce the importance of a particular document to that group.
- a capture device for use with the system needs little more than a way of capturing text from a rendered version of the document.
- this capture may be achieved through a variety of methods including taking a photograph of part of the document or typing some words into a mobile phone keypad.
- This capture may be achieved using a small hand-held optical scanner capable of recording a line or two of text at a time, or an audio capture device such as a voice-recorder into which the user is reading text from the document.
- the device used may be a combination of these—an optical scanner which could also record voice annotations, for example—and the capturing functionality may be built into some other device such as a mobile phone, PDA, digital camera or portable music player.
- the device implements the majority of the system itself. In some embodiments, however, it often communicates with a PC or other computing device and with the wider world using communications facilities.
- these communications facilities are in the form of a general-purpose data network such as Ethernet, 802.11 or UWB or a standard peripheral-connecting network such as USB, IEEE-1394 (Firewire), BluetoothTMor infra-red.
- a wired connection such as Firewire or USB
- the capture device may appear to a connected machine to be a conventional peripheral such as a USB storage device.
- the device may in some circumstances “dock” with another device, either to be used in conjunction with that device or for convenient storage.
- Sections 3.5 and 12.1.4 have raised the topic of disconnected operation.
- the device can still be useful, though the functionality available will sometimes be reduced.
- the device can record the raw image or audio data being captured and this can be processed later.
- it can be important to give feedback where possible about whether the data captured is likely to be sufficient for the task in hand, whether it can be recognized or is likely to be recognizable, and whether the source of the data can be identified or is likely to be identifiable later.
- the user will then know whether their capturing activity is worthwhile. Even when all of the above are unknown, the raw data can still be stored so that, at the very least, the user can refer to them later.
- the user may be presented with the image of a scan; for example, when the scan cannot be recognized by the OCR process.
- the SimpleScanner has a scanning head able to read pixels from the page as it is moved along the length of a line of text. It can detect its movement along the page and record the pixels with some information about the movement. It also has a clock, which allows each scan to be time-stamped. The clock is synchronized with a host device when the SimpleScanner has connectivity. The clock may not represent the actual time of day, but relative times may be determined from it so that the host can deduce the actual time of a scan, or at worst the elapsed time between scans.
- the SimpleScanner does not have sufficient processing power to perform any OCR itself, but it does have some basic knowledge about typical word-lengths, word-spacings, and their relationship to font size. It has some basic indicator lights which tell the user whether the scan is likely to be readable, whether the head is being moved too fast, too slowly or too inaccurately across the paper, and when it determines that sufficient words of a given size are likely to have been scanned for the document to be identified.
- the SimpleScanner has a USB connector and can be plugged into the USB port on a computer, where it will be recharged. To the computer it appears to be a USB storage device on which time-stamped data files have been recorded, and the rest of the system software takes over from this point.
- the SuperScanner also depends on connectivity for its full operation, but it has a significant amount of on-board storage and processing which can help it make better judgments about the data captured while offline.
- the captured pixels are stitched together and passed to an OCR engine that attempts to recognize the text.
- a number of fonts including those from the user's most-read publications, have been downloaded to it to help perform this task, as has a dictionary that is synchronized with the user's spelling-checker dictionary on their PC and so contains many of the words they frequently encounter.
- Also stored on the scanner is a list of words and phrases with the typical frequency of their use—this may be combined with the dictionary. The scanner can use the frequency statistics both to help with the recognition process and also to inform its judgment about when a sufficient quantity of text has been captured; more frequently used phrases are less likely to be useful as the basis for a search query.
- the full index for the articles in the recent issues of the newspapers and periodicals most commonly read by the user are stored on the device, as are the indices for the books the user has recently purchased from an online bookseller, or from which the user has scanned anything within the last few months.
- the titles of several thousand of the most popular publications which have data available for the system are stored so that, in the absence of other information the user can scan the title and have a good idea as to whether or not captures from a particular work are likely to be retrievable in electronic form later.
- the system informs user that the captured data has been of sufficient quality and of a sufficient nature to make it probable that the electronic copy can be retrieved when connectivity is restored. Often the system indicates to the user that the scan is known to have been successful and that the context has been recognized in one of the on-board indices, or that the publication concerned is known to be making its data available to the system, so the later retrieval ought to be successful.
- the SuperScanner docks in a cradle connected to a PC's Firewire or USB port, at which point, in addition to the upload of captured data, its various onboard indices and other databases are updated based on recent user activity and new publications. It also has the facility to connect to wireless public networks or to communicate via Bluetooth to a mobile phone and thence with the public network when such facilities are available.
- Some embodiments of the system use a scanner that scans in contact with the paper, and which, instead of lenses, uses an image conduit a bundle of optical fibers to transmit the image from the page to the optical sensor device.
- a scanner that scans in contact with the paper, and which, instead of lenses, uses an image conduit a bundle of optical fibers to transmit the image from the page to the optical sensor device.
- Such a device can be shaped to allow it to be held in a natural position; for example, in some embodiments, the part in contact with the page is wedge-shaped, allowing the user's hand to move more naturally over the page in a movement similar to the use of a highlighter pen.
- the conduit is either in direct contact with the paper or in close proximity to it, and may have a replaceable transparent tip that can protect the image conduit from possible damage.
- the scanner may be used to scan from a screen as well as from paper, and the material of the tip can be chosen to reduce the likelihood of damage to such displays.
- some embodiments of the device will provide feedback to the user during the scanning process which will indicate through the use of light, sound or tactile feedback when the user is scanning too fast, too slow, too unevenly or is drifting too high or low on the scanned line.
- the capture device may form an important part of identification and authorization for secure transactions, purchases, and a variety of other operations. It may therefore incorporate, in addition to the circuitry and software required for such a role, various hardware features that can make it more secure, such as a smartcard reader, RFID, or a keypad on which to type a PIN.
- the scanning head may also be able to read a fingerprint.
- the voice pattern of the user may be used.
- the device is able to form an association with other nearby devices to increase either its own or their functionality.
- it uses the display of a nearby PC or phone to give more detailed feedback about its operation, or uses their network connectivity.
- the device may, on the other hand, operate in its role as a security and identification device to authenticate operations performed by the other device. Or it may simply form an association in order to function as a peripheral to that device.
- An interesting aspect of such associations is that they may be initiated and authenticated using the capture facilities of the device. For example, a user wishing to identify themselves securely to a public computer terminal may use the scanning facilities of the device to scan a code or symbol displayed on a particular area of the terminals screen and so effect a key transfer. An analogous process may be performed using audio signals picked up by a voice-recording device.
- the functionality of the capture device is integrated into some other device that is already in use.
- the integrated devices may be able to share a power supply, data capture and storage capabilities, and network interfaces. Such integration may be done simply for convenience, to reduce cost, or to enable functionality that would not otherwise be available.
- Some examples of devices into which the capture functionality can be integrated include:
- the phone hardware is not modified to support the system, such as where the text capture can be adequately done through voice recognition, where they can either be processed by the phone itself, or handled by a system at the other end of a telephone call, or stored in the phone's memory for future processing.
- voice recognition can either be processed by the phone itself, or handled by a system at the other end of a telephone call, or stored in the phone's memory for future processing.
- Many modern phones have the ability to download software that could implement some parts of the system.
- voice capture is likely to be suboptimal in many situations, however, for example when there is substantial background noise, and accurate voice recognition is a difficult task at the best of times.
- the audio facilities may best be used to capture voice annotations.
- the camera built into many mobile phones is used to capture an image of the text.
- the phone display which would normally act as a viewfinder for the—camera, may overlay on the live camera image information about the quality of the image and its—suitability for OCR, which segments of text are being captured, and even a transcription of the text if the OCR can be performed on the phone.
- the phone is modified to add dedicated capture facilities, or to provide such functionality in a clip-on adaptor or a separate Bluetooth-connected peripheral in communication with the phone.
- the phone has connectivity with the wider world, which means that queries can be submitted to remote search engines or other parts of the system, and copies of documents may be retrieved for immediate storage or viewing.
- a phone typically has sufficient processing power for many of the functions of the system to be performed locally, and sufficient storage to capture a reasonable amount of data. The amount of storage can also often be expanded by the user. Phones have reasonably good displays and audio facilities to provide user feedback, and often a vibrate function for tactile feedback. They also have good power supplies.
- the Life Library (see also Section 6.1.1) is a digital archive of any important documents that the subscriber wishes to save and is a set of embodiments of services of this system. Important books, magazine articles, newspaper clippings, etc., can all be saved in digital form in the Life Library. Additionally, the subscriber's annotations, comments, and notes can be saved with the documents.
- the Life Library can be accessed via the Internet and World Wide Web.
- the system creates and manages the Life Library document archive for subscribers.
- the subscriber indicates which documents the subscriber wishes to have saved in his life library by scanning information from the document or by otherwise indicating to the system that the particular document is to be added to the subscriber's Life Library.
- the scanned information is typically text from the document but can also be a barcode or other code identifying the document.
- the system accepts the code and uses it to identify the source document. After the document is identified the system can store either a copy of the document in the user's Life Library or a link to a source where the document may be obtained.
- One embodiment of the Life Library system can check whether the subscriber is authorized to obtain the electronic copy. For example, if a reader scans text or an identifier from a copy of an article in the New York Times (NYT) so that the article will be added to the reader's Life Library, the Life Library system will verify with the NYT whether the reader is subscribed to the online version of the NYT: if so, the reader gets a copy of the article stored in his Life Library account; if not, information identifying the document and how to order it is stored in his Life Library account.
- NYT New York Times
- the system maintains a subscriber profile for each subscriber that includes access privilege information.
- Document access information can be compiled in several ways, two of which are: 1) the subscriber supplies the document access information to the Life Library system, along with his account names and passwords, etc., or 2) the Life Library service provider queries the publisher with the subscriber's information and the publisher responds by providing access to an electronic copy if the Life Library subscriber is authorized to access the material. If the Life Library subscriber is not authorized to have an electronic copy of the document, the publisher provides a price to the Life Library service provider, which then provides the customer with the option to purchase the electronic document.
- the Life Library service provider either pays the publisher directly and bills the Life Library customer later or the Life Library service provider immediately bills the customer's credit card for the purchase.
- the Life Library service provider would get a percentage of the purchase price or a small fixed fee for facilitating the transaction.
- the system can archive the document in the subscriber's personal library and/or any other library to which the subscriber has archival privileges. For example, as a user scans text from a printed document, the Life Library system can identify the rendered document and its electronic counterpart. After the source document is identified, the Life Library system might record information about the source document in the user's personal library and in a group library to which the subscriber has archival privileges.
- Group libraries are collaborative archives such as a document repository for a group working together on a project, a group of academic researchers, a group web log, etc.
- the life library can be organized in many ways: chronologically, by topic, by level of the subscriber's interest, by type of publication (newspaper, book, magazine, technical paper, etc.), where read, when read, by ISBN or by Dewey decimal, etc.
- the system can learn classifications based on how other subscribers have classified the same document. The system can suggest classifications to the user or automatically classify the document for the user.
- annotations may be inserted directly into the document or may be maintained in a separate file.
- the article is archived in his Life Library with the scanned text highlighted.
- the article is archived in his Life Library along with an associated annotation file (thus leaving the archived document unmodified).
- Embodiments of the system can keep a copy of the source document in each subscriber's library, a copy in a master library that many subscribers can access, or link to a copy held by the publisher.
- the Life Library stores only the user's modifications to the document (e.g., highlights, etc.) and a link to an online version of the document (stored elsewhere). The system or the subscriber merges the changes with the document when the subscriber subsequently retrieves the document.
- the source document and the annotation file are provided to the subscriber and the subscriber combines, them to create a modified document.
- the system combines the two files prior to presenting them to the subscriber.
- the annotation file is an overlay to the document file and can be overlaid on the document by software in the subscriber's computer.
- Subscribers to the Life Library service pay a monthly fee to have the system maintain the subscriber's archive. Alternatively, the subscriber pays a small amount (e.g., a micro-payment) for each document stored in the archive. Alternatively, the subscriber pays to access the subscriber's archive on a per-access fee. Alternatively, subscribers can compile libraries and allow others to access the materials/annotations on a revenue share model with the Life Library service provider and copyright holders. Alternatively, the Life Library service provider receives a payment from the publisher when the Life Library subscriber orders a document (a revenue share model with the publisher, where the Life. Library service provider gets a share of the publisher's revenue).
- a small amount e.g., a micro-payment
- subscribers can compile libraries and allow others to access the materials/annotations on a revenue share model with the Life Library service provider and copyright holders.
- the Life Library service provider receives a payment from the publisher when the Life Library subscriber orders a document (a revenue share model with the publisher,
- the Life Library service provider acts as an intermediary between the subscriber and the copyright holder (or copyright holder's agent, such as the Copyright Clearance Center, a.k.a. CCC) to facilitate billing and payment for copyrighted materials.
- the Life Library service provider uses the subscriber's billing information and other user account information to provide this intermediation service. Essentially, the Life Library service provider leverages the pre-existing relationship with the subscriber to enable purchase of copyrighted materials on behalf of the subscriber.
- the Life Library system can store excerpts from documents. For example, when a subscriber scans text from a paper document, the regions around the scanned text are excerpted and placed in the Life Library, rather than the entire document being archived in the life library. This is especially advantageous when the document is long because preserving the circumstances of the original scan prevents the subscriber from re-reading the document to find the interesting portions. Of course, a hyperlink to the entire electronic counterpart of the paper document can be included with the excerpt materials.
- the system also stores information about the document in the Life Library, such as author, publication title, publication date, publisher, copyright holder (or copyright holder's licensing agent), ISBN, links to public annotations of the document, readrank, etc.
- information about the document is a form of paper document metadata.
- Third parties may create public annotation files for access by persons other than themselves, such the general public. Linking to a third party's commentary on a document is advantageous because reading annotation files of other users enhances the subscriber's understanding of the document.
- the system archives materials by class. This feature allows a Life Library subscriber to quickly store electronic counterparts to an entire class of paper documents without access to each paper document. For example, when the subscriber scans some text from a copy of National Geographic magazine, the system provides the subscriber with the option to archive all back issues of the National Geographic. If the subscriber elects to archive all back issues, the Life Library service provider would then verify with the National Geographic Society whether the subscriber is authorized to do so. If not, the Life Library service provider can mediate the purchase of the right to archive the National Geographic magazine collection.
- a variation on, or enhancement of, the Life Library concept is the “Life Saver”, where the system uses the text captured by a user to deduce more about their other activities.
- the scanning of a menu from a particular restaurant, a program from a particular theater performance, a timetable at a particular railway station, or an article from a local newspaper allows the system to make deductions about the user's location and social activities, and could construct an automatic diary for them, for example as a website.
- the user would be able to edit and modify the diary, add additional materials such as photographs and, of course, look again at the items scanned.
- Portable scanners supported by the described system have many compelling uses in the academic setting. They can enhance student/teacher interaction and augment the learning experience. Among other uses, students can annotate study materials to suit their unique needs; teachers can monitor classroom performance; and teachers can automatically verify source materials cited in student assignments.
- a child's interaction with a paper document, such as a book, is monitored by a literacy acquisition system that employs a specific set of embodiments of this system.
- the child uses a portable scanner that communicates with other elements of the literacy acquisition system.
- the literacy acquisition system includes a computer having a display and speakers, and a database accessible by the computer.
- the scanner is coupled with the computer (hardwired, short range RF, etc.).
- the literacy acquisition system compares the scanned text with the resources in its database to identify the word.
- the database includes a dictionary, thesaurus, and/or multimedia files (e.g., sound, graphics, etc.).
- the system uses the computer speakers to pronounce the word and its definition to the child.
- the word and its definition are displayed by the literacy acquisition system on the computer's monitor.
- Multimedia files about the scanned word can also be played through the computer's monitor and speakers. For example, if a child reading “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” scanned the word “bear”, the system might pronounce the word “bear” and play a short video about bears on the computer's monitor. In this way, the child learns to pronounce the written word and is visually taught what the word means via the multimedia presentation.
- the literacy acquisition system provides immediate auditory and/or visual information to enhance the learning process.
- the child uses this supplementary information to quickly acquire a deeper understanding of the written material.
- the system can be used to teach beginning readers to read, to help children acquire a larger vocabulary, etc. This system provides the child with information about words with which the child is unfamiliar or about which the child wants more information.
- the system compiles personal dictionaries. If the reader sees a word that is new, interesting, or particularly useful or troublesome, the reader saves it (along with its definition) to a computer file. This computer file becomes the reader's personalized dictionary. This dictionary is generally smaller in size than a general dictionary so can be downloaded to a mobile station or associated device and thus be available even when the system isn't immediately accessible.
- the personal dictionary entries include audio files to assist with proper word pronunciation and information identifying the paper document from which the word was scanned.
- the system creates customized, spelling and vocabulary tests for students. For example, as a student reads an assignment, the student may scan unfamiliar words with the portable scanner. The system stores a list of all the words that the student has scanned. Later, the system administers a customized spelling/vocabulary test to the student on an associated monitor (or prints such a test on an associated printer).
- the arrangement of notes on a musical staff is similar to the arrangement of letters in a line of text.
- the same scanning device discussed for capturing text in this system can be used to capture music notation, and an analogous process of constructing a search against databases of known musical pieces would allow the piece from which the capture occurred to be identified which can then be retrieved, played, or be the basis for some further action.
- Teachers can use the system to detect plagiarism or to verify sources by scanning text from student papers and submitting the scanned text to the system. For example, a teacher who wishes to verify that a quote in a student paper came from the source that the student cited can scan a portion of the quote and compare the title of the document identified by the system with the title of the document cited by the student. Likewise, the system can use scans of text from assignments submitted as the student's original work to reveal if the text was instead copied.
- capturing text from an academic textbook links students or staff to more detailed explanations, further exercises, student and staff discussions about the material, related example past exam questions, further reading on the subject, recordings of the lectures on the subject, and so forth. (See also Section 7.1.)
- the system is used to teach foreign languages. Scanning a Spanish word, for example, might cause the word to be read aloud in Spanish along with its definition in English.
- the system provides immediate auditory and/or visual information to enhance the new language acquisition process.
- the reader uses this supplementary information to acquire quickly a deeper understanding of the material.
- the system can be used to teach beginning students to read foreign languages, to help students acquire a larger vocabulary, etc.
- the system provides information about foreign words with which the reader is unfamiliar or for which the reader wants more information.
- Reader interaction with a paper document, such as a newspaper or book, is monitored by a language skills system.
- the reader has a portable scanner that communicates with the language skills system.
- the language skills system includes a computer having a display and speakers, and a database accessible by the computer.
- the scanner communicates with the computer (hardwired, short range RF, etc.).
- the database includes a foreign language dictionary, thesaurus, and/or multimedia files (sound, graphics, etc.).
- the system compares the scanned text with the resources in its database to identify the scanned word. After the word has been identified, the system uses the computer speakers to pronounce the word and its definition to the reader.
- the word and its definition are both displayed on the computer's monitor.
- Multimedia files about grammar tips related to the scanned word can also be played through the computer's monitor and speakers. For example, if the words “to speak” are scanned, the system might pronounce the word “hablar,” play a short audio clip that demonstrates the proper Spanish pronunciation, and display a complete list of the various conjugations of “hablar”. In this way, the student learns to pronounce the written word, is visually taught the spelling of the word via the multimedia presentation, and learns how to conjugate the verb. The system can also present grammar tips about the proper usage of “hablar” along with common phrases.
- the user scans a word or short phrase from a rendered document in a language other than the user's native language (or some other language that the user knows reasonably well).
- the system maintains a prioritized list of the user's “preferred” languages. The system identifies the electronic counterpart of the rendered document, and determines the location of the scan within the document. The system also identifies a second electronic counterpart of the document that has been translated into one of the user's preferred languages, and determines the location in the translated document corresponding to the location of the scan in the original document. When the corresponding location is not known precisely, the system identifies a small region (e.g., a paragraph) that includes the corresponding location of the scanned location. The corresponding translated location is then presented to the user. This provides the user with a precise translation of the particular usage at the scanned location, including any slang or other idiomatic usage that is often difficult to accurately translate on a word-by-word basis.
- a user researching a particular topic may encounter all sorts of material, both in print and on screen, which they might wish to record as relevant to the topic in some personal archive.
- the system would enable this process to be automatic as a result of scanning a short phrase in any piece of material, and could also create a bibliography suitable for insertion into a publication on the subject.
- Conventional Internet search engines typically provide free search of electronic documents, and also make no charge to the content providers for including their content in the index.
- the system provides for charges to users and/or payments to search engines and/or content providers in connection with the operation and use of the system.
- subscribers to the system's services pay a fee for searches originating from scans of paper documents.
- a stockbroker may be reading a Wall Street Journal article about a new product offered by Company X.
- the stockbroker uses the system to search special or proprietary databases to obtain premium information about the company, such as analysts reports.
- the system can also make arrangements to have priority indexing of the documents most likely to be read in paper form, for example by making sure all of the newspapers published on a particular day are indexed and available by the time they hit the streets.
- Content providers may pay a fee to be associated with certain terms in search queries submitted from paper documents. For example, in one embodiment, the system chooses a most preferred content provider based on additional context about the provider (the context being, in this case, that the content provider has paid a fee to be moved up the results list). In essence, the search provider is adjusting paper document search results based on pre-existing financial arrangements with a content provider. See also the description of keywords and key phrases in Section 5.2.
- Such content may be protected by a firewall and thus not generally indexable by third parties.
- the content provider may nonetheless wish to provide an index to the protected content.
- the content provider can pay a service provider to provide the content provider's index to system subscribers.
- a law firm may index all of a client's documents. The documents are stored behind the law firm's firewall.
- the law firm wants its employees and the client to have access to the documents through the portable scanner so it provides the index (or a pointer to the index) to the service provider, which in turn searches the law firm's index when employees or clients of the law firm submit paper-scanned search terms via their portable scanners.
- the law firm can provide a list of employees and/or clients to the service provider's system to enable this function or the system can verify access rights by querying the law firm prior to searching the law firm's index.
- the index provided by the law firm is only of that client's documents, not an index of all documents at the law firm.
- the service provider can only grant the law firm's clients access to the documents that the law firm indexed for the client.
- the search function revenue can be generated from paid subscriptions from the scanner users, but can also be generated on a per-search charge.
- the content delivery revenue can be shared with the content provider or copyright holder (the service provider can take a percentage of the sale or a fixed fee, such as a micropayment, for each delivery), but also can be generated by a “referral” model in which the system gets a fee or percentage for every item that the subscriber orders from the online catalog and that the system has delivered or contributed to, regardless of whether the service provider intermediates the transaction.
- the system service provider receives revenue for all purchases that the subscriber made from the content provider, either for some-predetermined period of time or at any subsequent time when a purchase of an identified product is made.
- the subscriber scans information from the catalog that identifies the catalog. This information is text from the catalog, a bar code, or another identifier of the catalog. The subscriber scans information identifying the products that s/he wishes to purchase.
- the catalog mailing label may contain a customer identification number that identifies the customer to the catalog vendor. If so, the subscriber can also scan this customer identification number.
- the system acts as an intermediary between the subscriber and the vendor to facilitate the catalog purchase by providing the customer's selection and customer identification number to the vendor.
- a consumer scans paper coupons and Saves an electronic copy of the coupon in the scanner, or in a remote device such as a computer, for later retrieval and use.
- An advantage of electronic storage is that the consumer is freed from the burden of carrying paper coupons.
- a further advantage is that the electronic coupons may be retrieved from any location.
- the system can track coupon expiration dates, alert the consumer about coupons that will expire soon, and/or delete expired coupons from storage.
- An advantage for the issuer of the coupons is the possibility of receiving more feedback about who is using the coupons and when and where they are captured and used.
- the system may be used to auto-populate an electronic document that corresponds to a paper form.
- a user scans in some text or a barcode that uniquely identifies the paper form.
- the scanner communicates the identity of the form and information identifying the user to a nearby computer.
- the nearby computer has an Internet connection.
- the nearby computer can access a first database of forms and a second database having information about the user of the scanner (such as a service provider's subscriber information database).
- the nearby computer accesses an electronic version of the paper form from the first database and auto-populates the fields of the form from the user's information obtained from the second database.
- the nearby computer then emails the completed form to the intended recipient. Alternatively, the computer could print the completed form on a nearby printer.
- the system has a portable scanner that contains the user's information, such as in an identity module, SIM, or security card.
- the scanner provides information identifying the form to the nearby PC.
- the nearby PC accesses the electronic form and queries the scanner for any necessary information to fill out the form.
- the system can be used to automatically populate electronic address books or other contact lists from paper documents. For example, upon receiving a new acquaintance's business card, a user can capture an image of the card with his/her cellular phone. The system will locate an electronic copy of the card, which can be used to update the cellular phone's onboard address book with the new acquaintance's contact information. The electronic copy may contain more information about the new acquaintance than can be squeezed onto a business card. Further, the onboard address book may also store a link to the electronic copy such that any changes to the electronic copy will be automatically updated in the cell phone's address book.
- the business card optionally includes a symbol or text that indicates the existence of an electronic copy.
- the cellular phone can use OCR and knowledge of standard business card formats to fill out an entry in the address book for the new acquaintance. Symbols may also aid in the process of extracting information directly from the image. For example, a phone icon next to the phone number on the business card can be recognized to determine the location of the phone number.
- the system can enhance the proofreading and editing process.
- One way the system can enhance the editing process is by linking the editor's interactions with a paper document to its electronic counterpart.
- the system will make the appropriate annotations or edits to an electronic counterpart of the paper document. For example, if the editor scans a portion of text and makes the “new paragraph” control gesture with the scanner, a computer in communication with the scanner would insert a “new paragraph” break at the location of the scanned text in the electronic copy of the document.
- a user can make voice annotations to a document by scanning a portion of text from the document and then making a voice recording that is associated with the scanned text.
- the scanner has a microphone to record the user's verbal annotations. After the verbal annotations are recorded, the system identifies the document from which the text was scanned, locates the scanned text within the document, and attaches the voice annotation at that point. In some embodiments, the system converts the speech to text and attaches the annotation as a textual comment.
- the system keeps annotations separate from the document, with only a reference to the annotation kept with the document.
- the annotations then become an annotation markup layer to the document for a-specific subscriber or group of users.
- the system identifies the document, opens it using a software package, scrolls to the location of the scan and plays the voice annotation. The user can then interact with a document while referring to voice annotations, suggested changes or other comments recorded either by themselves or by somebody else.
- a markup layer associated with a paper document contains help menu information for the document. For example, when a user scans text from a certain portion of the document, the system checks the markup associated with the document and presents a help menu to the user. The help menu is presented on a display on the scanner or on an associated nearby display.
- the portable scanner is used to scan information from computer monitors and televisions.
- the portable optical scanner has an illumination sensor that is optimized to work with traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) display techniques such as rasterizing, screen blanking, etc.

- the kiosk is connected to a communication network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet.
- the session ID changes periodically but at least every time that the kiosk is used so that a new session ID is displayed to every user.
- the subscriber scans in the session ID displayed on the kiosk; by scanning the session ID, the user tells the system that he wishes to temporarily associate the kiosk with his scanner for the delivery of content resulting from scans of printed documents or from the kiosk screen itself.
- the scanner may communicate the Session ID and other information authenticating the scanner (such as a serial number, account number, or other identifying information) directly to the system.
- the scanner can communicate directly (where “directly” means without passing the message through the kiosk) with the system by sending the session initiation message through the user's cell phone (which is paired with the user's scanner via BluetoothTM).
- the scanner can establish a wireless link with the kiosk and use the kiosk's communication link by transferring the session initiation information to the kiosk (perhaps via short range RF such as BluetoothTM, etc.); in response, the kiosk sends the session initiation information to the system via its Internet connection.
- the system can prevent others from using a device that is already associated with a scanner during the period (or session) in which the device is associated with the scanner. This feature is useful to prevent others from using a public kiosk before another person's session has ended.
- the user scans a barcode on a monitor of a PC which s/he desires to use; in response, the system sends a session ID to the monitor that it displays; the user initiates the session by scanning the session ID from the monitor (or entering it via a keypad or touch screen or microphone on the portable scanner); and the system associates in its databases the session ID with the serial number (or other identifier that uniquely identifies the user's scanner) of his/her scanner so another scanner cannot scan the session ID and use the monitor during his/her session.
- the scanner is in communication (through wireless link such as BluetoothTM, a hardwired link such as a docking station, etc.) with a PC associated with the monitor or is in direct (i.e., w/o going through the PC) communication with the system via another means such as a cellular phone, etc.

- portable device 500 acquires data 630 such as a scanned image or text.
- Portable device 500 may have predetermined instructions about whether to include timestamps 610 or location-stamps 620 in data record 600 .
- portable device 500 determines whether a timestamp 610 is desired in data record 600 .

- the portable scanner 500 may indicate to a user that enough information has been scanned to identify a document.
- portable scanner 500 may have predetermined thresholds that indicate a particular scan uniquely identifies a document. When the threshold is met or exceeded, the portable scanner 500 indicates to the user via user interface 560 that enough information has been scanned to identify the document.
- predetermined thresholds may be determined based on heuristics (ie., rules of thumb), statistical analysis, or other suitable methods.
- One heuristic used by the system to determine the threshold is based on observations of the unique character of written expression. Most documents can be uniquely identified within a very large corpus—for example, one containing one million documents—with a scan of between four and ten words (in the English language, roughly 20-50 characters or symbols). This heuristic holds across all languages on which it has been tested. In the event that a scan in the range of 4-10 words results in duplicate documents, the user can be prompted to scan additional words to further narrow the results.
- Portable device 500 may indicate to the user that sufficient information has been scanned via the visual, audio, or tactile capability of user interface 560 .
- DSP 575 instructs user interface 560 to communicate to the user that enough information has been scanned to identify the document from which the information was scanned.
- Timestamps and location-stamps may also be used to identify documents. For example, an Associated Press article may appear in many newspapers but the correct newspaper could be determined by the location-stamp. If the location-stamp indicates that the scan was performed in Seattle, it is most likely that a Seattle newspaper is the source of the scanned AP article. Similarly, in some embodiments, the system uses timestamps to narrow the scope of candidate documents to those that were published prior to the timestamp.
- the portable scanner 500 indicates to a user that enough information has been scanned to identify location within a document or group of documents.
- portable scanner 500 may have thresholds that indicate a particular scan uniquely identifies a location within a document or group of documents. When the threshold is met or exceeded, the portable scanner 500 would indicate to the user via user interface 560 that enough information has been scanned to identify location within a document or group of documents.
- These thresholds may be determined based on heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb), statistical analysis, information about a specific document or group of documents (for example, an index), or other suitable methods.
- One approach to determining position used by the facility includes consulting an index representing the document or group of documents, and, if the capture is not unique within the index, using additional context information (for example, location of last capture, time elapsed since last capture, etc.) to qualify and refine the system's inference about the location of the current capture.
- additional context information for example, location of last capture, time elapsed since last capture, etc.
- the system's determination of location is probabilistic. Where a specific capture matches several locations in a document or group of documents, the system may attribute a higher probability to a location close to the user's most recent capture.
- a threshold may be associated with the indication that the capture location is known. This threshold may include the probability associated with potential matching locations. For example, in some embodiments, if one location has at least an 80% probability of being the user's location, the system selects that location.
- Portable device 500 may indicate to the user that location is known via the visual, audio, or tactile capability of user interface 560 .
- DSP 575 instructs user interface 560 to communicate to the user that enough information has been scanned to identify the location from which the information was scanned.
- portable scanner 500 is controlled by user input via the user interface 560 .
- user interface 560 includes a display on which menus may be shown to the user, the user can select menu choices to control the actions of portable scanner 500 .
- portable device 500 is controlled by gestures performed by the user. For example, scanning text in a forward direction may indicate that the user wishes to store the text in memory. Scanning the same text in the reverse direction may indicate that the user wishes to erase the text from memory. Rubbing back and forth over text in a document may indicate that the user wants to highlight that text in an electronic copy of the document.
- the system enables many gestures to be used to control the actions of the portable device 500 such as circular motions, shaking motions, etc. Possible actions include starting the scan process, signaling that the user is done scanning from a particular article or document (and therefore subsequent scanned data will be from a new article or document), etc.
- portable scanner 500 includes an acceleration sensor (not shown in FIG. 5 for clarity), such as an accelerometer, to sense changes in speed or direction, thereby determining control gestures.
- an acceleration sensor such as an accelerometer
- Portable scanner 500 may also be programmed to respond to control commands input to the DSP 575 via the image capture mechanism.
- the image capture mechanism includes light source 505 , lens 510 , CCD array 515 , and A/D converter 520 .
- These commands may be special symbols recognized by the scanner, biometric information (such as fingerprints), or patterns of scanning regular text (such as scanning the text in reverse to control data storage as discussed above).
- a document such as a catalog may include a menu of command symbols that have special significance to the portable device 500 .
- the user scans one of the special symbols.
- the DSP 575 accesses and executes a control program associated with the special control signal.
- one of the special symbols may initiate a purchasing program that can be used to order products from the catalog via the scanner.
- the user scans information about the products to be ordered and the portable scanner would communicate those products and other information necessary to complete the sale (such as billing and shipping information) to the catalog vendor via a connection between the Internet and the communication interface 550 .
- Portable device 500 may include memory 580 for storing information related to billing, subscription, and/or device identifiers.
- This memory 580 may be removable, such as in a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or smart card, or non-removable, such as a Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM).

- PROM Programmable Read Only Memory
- subscription information can be used to verify whether the user should be allowed access to the electronic copy. For example, a newspaper may charge an additional fee for access to its online version.
- the user's subscription information could include account numbers that indicate whether the user subscribes to the online version.
- billing information can be used to make purchases with the portable scanner 500 .
- the memory 580 contains credit card or other financial information of the user. For example, when the user scans text from a document and indicates (such as via the user interface 560 or the gestural controls disclosed above) that he wishes to purchase access to an electronic copy of the document, the billing information can be used to provide payment to the copyright holder or content provider.
- Portable device 500 may store device identifiers such as serial numbers in memory 580 . These device identifiers serve to uniquely identify the portable device 500 and are typically stored in PROM so that they cannot be erased. Additional security for transactions can be obtained by associating a portable device with only one user by correlating the device serial number to a user's account or subscription in a network database. In some embodiments, additional security is accomplished by storing the device identifier in the smart card (or storing a smart card identifier in the portable scanner 500 ) to lock the scanner to the smart card. In these embodiments, DSP 575 verifies that the correct smart card was inserted before the portable scanner 500 function.

- External triangulation occurs when networked receivers external to the portable device are used to estimate the location of the portable device based upon characteristics of a signal received from the portable device.
- the system uses received signal strength at more than one external receiver to estimate the distance of the portable device from the external receivers.
- Fixed transmitters often broadcast pilot signals that identify a particular transmitter so that mobile receivers may “lock on” to signals from a desired transmitter.
- the location of the portable device can be estimated based on which transmitter it “hears.” For example, if a portable-device is receiving signals from an IEEE 802.11 wireless access point, it can be assumed that the portable device is within 300 feet (currently the approximate outdoor range of IEEE 802. 11g transmitters) of the wireless access point.

- the portable data capture device includes a rolling element or ball similar to the ballpoint of an ink pen that is optically encoded. As the ball is moved along the paper surface, an optical sensor detects the motion of the optically encoded element.
- the portable capture device measures the flow of electrically charged ink over a ballpoint to record relative motion.
- the ink flowing to the ball is given an electric charge that is detected by these probes.
- Current-sensing probes embedded in the ballpoint housing detect the ink flow over the ball. If there are a plurality of probes, the direction of flow of the ink can be inferred—hence the motion of the ball—and thus the actual motion across a surface.
- This electrically charged ink technology can serve as a general purpose input recording device—wherein the user writes in conventional ink—while the motions are noted and recorded.
- a guard ring at or near the boundary where the ball emerges from its housing may be used to discharge the charged ink so that only the charged ink flowing out of the receiver is seen by the sensors.
- the user can enter data and commands into the portable data capture device by way of the optical sensing system.
- the portable device may be programmed to recognize certain graphical symbols as commands. For example, when the user scans a “$” symbol, the portable device recognizes it as a command to initiate a financial transaction, such as a purchase.
- the UI of the portable data capture device is also capable of presenting information to the user. This information usually concerns the operation status of the device.
- the UI output means for presenting information to the user can be sorted into three broad categories: auditory, tactile, and optical. Embodiments of the portable data capture device will have various combinations of UI output means from some or all of these categories.
- a portable capture device can transmit scan results to a host computer and communicate operational states or modes to a user by way of a display.
- the display can be onboard the portable capture device or can be associated with the host computer.
- the portable device uses a wired or wireless communications medium.
- a user can use a monitor associated with the host computer to view information. Examples of suitable wired connections include: RS-232; PS/2; serial; USB; ethernet; token ring; printer connections (e.g., IEEE 1284); firewire; RJ45 (telephone line); homeplug and fiber optics.
- wireless connections include: wireless ethernet (e.g., IEEE 802.11a,b,g); BluetoothTM; infra-red (IrDA, such as in a television remote control); and Ultra wideband.
- the portable device can use auditory (e.g., a piezoelectric speaker), haptic (including a cell phone's vibrate), or visual alerts to communicate with the user.
- the UI can indicate that an error has occurred and the user ought to rescan; that a communication link to another device is open and active; that the portable device is turned on; that a gesture has been detected; or which mode the scanner is currently in. For example, in some embodiments, a scanner simply vibrates if a scan needs to be repeated.
- the portable data capture device has the ability to provide audible alerts to the user. These audible alerts require an electro-acoustic transducer such as a speaker to convert electrical signals into sound.
- the portable capture device has a speaker or piezo-electric element to generate sound. These speakers can be used to read text to the user or alert the user to a change in the device's status. For example, in some embodiments, the device emits a beep during scanning to alert the user that the paper document has been identified and an electronic counterpart of the paper document has been located. As another example, as text is scanned from a paper document, the capture device applies a text-to-speech process to the scanned text and plays the resulting audio.
- the portable data capture device communicates with the user by vibration.
- the tactile UI is especially useful in environments where audible alerts cannot be heard due to ambient noise levels or places where audible alerts are socially unacceptable (e.g., in a movie theatre).
- the portable data capture device has a vibrating element to alert the user of a change in the device's status.
- this vibrating element is included in the phone's battery pack.
- the portable device vibrates if the scanning head moves off line, similar to the “rumble strips” that alert drivers that they are drifting outside their lane.
- the portable data capture device communicates with the user via the UI by visual means.
- the device projects menus or other information onto the paper being scanned. For example, when a capture device is working with a word processing program on a computer, the device may project a yellow light onto the paper to indicate that the system will highlight the scanned text in yellow in the open document in the word processing program.
- the portable data capture device can include a display.
- a nearby display can be associated with the portable data capture device such that information for the portable device is routed to, and shown on, the display. Using nearby displays such as computer monitors is particularly helpful when the portable device does not have a display or the information is not suitable for presenting on the portable device's small display.
- LED Light Emitting Diodes

- USB Universal Serial Bus
- USB Universal Serial Bus
- USB is a protocol used by the portable data capture device in some embodiments.
- USB in addition to providing a communication channel between a computer and the portable capture device, USB provides power to recharge the portable device's batteries.
- the USB interface allows the user to attach a USB memory device to the portable capture device.
- Fiber optic communication channels can also be used by some embodiments of the portable data capture device. Suitable fiber types for different embodiments are single mode and multimode. One advantage of a multimode fiber is that it permits the use of inexpensive LED light sources. Connector coupling and alignment is also less critical with multimode fibers.
- the portable device's communications interface is a wireless interface. Suitable wireless technologies are short-range RF (Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, etc.), cellular, or optical (infrared, etc.). In cases where the communications interface includes wireless capability, it typically also includes the necessary antennas or lenses for implementing the wireless capability.

- WLAN Wireless Local Area Network
- the portable device typically uses WLAN “hotspots” to communicate with remote computers.
- the portable data capture device uses the Bluetooth (BT) short range radio-frequency (RF) method to communicate and pair with nearby devices such as mobile phones or personal computers.
- BT Bluetooth
- RF radio-frequency
- the portable data capture device has a data capture subsystem.
- This data capture subsystem generally has the capability of capturing voice, optical, and/or magnetic strip data.
- the captured data is stored in memory for subsequent processing and transmission.
- the captured information can be compressed and/or automatically deleted to save memory space and communications channel bandwidth.
- One example of automatic deletion is deleting scanned images once they have been converted to text by the OCR process. Storing images that do not contain all of the captured information can conserve memory. Examples include compression formats such as GIF or JPG.
- Another approach is not storing unnecessary color information.
- a typical CCD image sensor may be able to capture 24 levels of color information (i.e., distinguish more than 16 million different colors) for each pixel.
- the portable capture device only needs to be able to distinguish between white, probably white, probably black and black (2 bits). This reduction, from 24 to 2 bits, results in storage space savings of roughly 92%.
- a voice capture subsystem is useful in many circumstances.
- a voice capture subsystem typically allows the user to read text from a rendered document.
- An onboard microphone captures the spoken words.
- a speech-to-text application converts the speech to text form. The text is then used, for example, to locate an electronic counterpart of the rendered document.
- the data capture is a mobile phone or the scannotator that is discussed below.
- the portable data capture device includes an optical data capture subsystem.
- the optical data capture system typically includes an image sensor and an optical path.
- the optical path passes through an aperture in the housing of the portable device.
- the optical elements comprise parts of the housing of the device.
- the optical path can include a lens or aperture for focusing light and/or a transparent cover to protect the optical path.
- an image conduit is part of the optical path that guides light from the rendered document to the image sensor.
- a portable scanner has its image sensor behind an aperture.
- the aperture has a transparent cover such that the image sensor and the device's internal optical path are protected from dirt and damage.
- the cover is plastic or glass.
- the portable scanner has a lens
- the portable scanner uses more than one focusing lens.
- the optical system can capture data as the user moves the portable capture device towards the rendered document. Capturing the data as the portable device approaches the rendered document may provide the portable device a wide field of view, and therefore provide additional information about the visual context of the capture.
- the scanner captures data from the document even before the scanner comes into contact with the surface of the document.
- capturing data as the scanner approaches the document enables the user to interact with the paper by touching or tapping at a location rather than rubbing along a line of text. The user experience is that he is pointing to (“touching”) text rather than scanning along a line of text.
- the optical capture subsystem can be implemented in various configurations, each having certain advantages for particular applications.
- the light-sensing element is a one-dimensional linear sensor array in some embodiments.
- a one-dimensional array consists of one row of sensors that capture optical information.
- One-dimensional arrays are well suited for some biometric applications, especially for fingerprint scanning.
- the sensors are either Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Any suitable light-sensing device could be substituted, however.
- a two-dimensional sensor array is similar to a one-dimensional array, but the rows of sensor elements have two-dimensional coplanar offsets from each other. Two-dimensional arrays have the advantage that they yield information about distance, angle of scan, and skew. In some embodiments, the two-dimensional array is constructed from at least two parallel rows or columns of sensor elements. However, many topology variations of two-dimensional sensor arrays are possible.
- a two-dimensional array of optical sensor elements can detect motion and de-skew at same time by correlation of character artifacts (tips, ascender/descender vertical elements), timing and location.
- Ascender/descenders are text characters that extend farther above/below the midline of a row of text than the average text character.
- An example of an ascender is the letter “t.”
- An example of a descender is the letter “p.”
- Processing logic can determine the image skew of optically captured data. For example, head angle is determined by correlating the strong vertical elements of printed text with the optically captured data. Depending upon the font, strong vertical elements are present in the characters “bdhiklmnpqrtu” from an alphabet consisting of “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.” Further, “y” is only ascender/descender without vertical strokes. There is also vertical information associated with the left and right edge of the remaining alphabet characters that can be used in the de-skewing process.
- the optical data capture subsystem has a lens to focus light onto the light-sensing elements.
- Lens systems can be a very useful addition to two-dimensional array light sensors.
- an image conduit forms part of the optical capture system.
- the fiber optic image conduit is in contact with the surface from which it is capturing information.
- the fiber optic image conduit is positioned above the scanned surface, which allows more ambient light into the scan area. In this configuration, the limited angle of acceptance of individual fibers insures that the image is still of good quality, even though the tip of the image conduit is slightly off the surface of the document.
- An image conduit with a transparent plastic separator or cap on the data capture end is one embodiment in which the fiber optic image conduit itself does not contact the scanned surface, allowing ambient light to illuminate the surface, and a better view of the scanned material for the user.
- the image conduit may be sculpted to enable data capture even when the image conduit is not held vertical to the rendered document.
- the image conduit is sculpted to have a wedge-shaped tip.
- the fiber optic image conduit is transparent or semi-transparent when viewed transverse to the optical path so the user can see the rendered document through the bundle.
- the image conduit can serve as viewfinder in addition to serving as a means to transport the scanned image to the optical sensor.
- groups of optical fibers may be used to transport an image. These might be single rows of fibers, as in a one-dimensional array; multiple rows of fibers; or groups or bundles of fibers with no strict arrangement.
- a flexible brush of many fibers can also be used.
- the relationship between the end of an individual fiber at which it captures some of the image and the other end where it couples to a sensor element may be determined empirically, either at the time of manufacture or during use.
- fiber optic image conduits can capture data via ambient light but in some embodiments, an optional element, such as a subset of the image conduit fibers, can carry light from a light source to the document's surface. These fibers essentially act as miniature flashlights to illuminate the surface of the rendered document. The remaining fibers capture the illuminated data and transport it back to the image sensor.
- the outer fibers of an image-conduit are used to transport light to the document, especially in embodiments where the fiber optic image conduit has been sculpted to be easily drug across the surface of a document.

- the portable capture device can also read from display devices directly, and can thus be used to point, highlight, excerpt, underline, copy, paste, erase, etc., directly on a display screen.
- This capability leads to a powerful document editing system wherein the user prints a document, works directly on the printed version with a portable scanner (and possibly also interacts with the dynamic display), then prints a (revised) newer version, etc. This method combines some of the best features of both the paper and digital world.
- Data capture. from screens can be accomplished by optically capturing the image shown on the display or by determining the location(s) on the display over which the portable device attempts to capture data.
- the location method retrieves the image from memory, usually video memory, associated with the display.
- the portable device reports its absolute location on the display to a computer associated with the display.

- OCR Optical Character Recognition
- the portable data capture device creates time and/or location stamps that are used to note the time and location that certain actions were performed. For example, when a user scans text from a document, the portable device creates a time stamp and/or location stamp that is associated with the scanned text. The portable device transmits this time/location stamp is along with the scanned text to a host computer or the service provider's network to establish a context for the scan. The portable device can use an internal clock for time data or network time if a time signal from the network is available. GPS and many other methods are available to determine the location of the portable device. In some embodiments, the portable device uses an internal clock and GPS technology for time/location data.
- EOTD Enhanced Observed Time Difference
- A-GPS Assisted GPS
- DGPS Differential GPS
- TDOA Time Difference of Arrival
- triangulation triangulation and monitoring of local transceiver pilot signals.
- EOTD, TDOA and Angle of Arrival are most suitable when the portable device transmits a signal to networked base stations such that logic in the network may correlate data about the signals received at each base station to estimate the position of the portable device.
- Triangulation may be either internal or external.
- the portable device performs internal triangulation when it receives signals from at least three external transmitters (such as IEEE 802.11 base stations) and calculates an approximate location based upon characteristics of the received signals.
- External triangulation occurs when networked receivers external to the portable device are used to estimate the location of the portable device based upon characteristics of a signal received from the portable device.
- external triangulation would use received signal strength at more than one external receiver to estimate the distance of the portable device from the external receivers.
- Fixed transmitters often broadcast pilot signals that identify a particular transmitter so that mobile receivers may “lock on” to signals from a desired transmitter.
- the location of the fixed transmitter and the approximate coverage area are known, so the location of the portable device can be estimated based on which transmitter it “hears.” For example, if a portable device is receiving signals from an IEEE 802.11 wireless access point, it can be assumed that the portable device is within 300 feet (currently the approximate outdoor range of IEEE 802.11g transmitters) of the wireless access point.
- Captured data can be put to various uses, in addition to the previously discussed document disambiguation and electronic counterpart location.
- the portable data capture device is controlled and programmed via scanned data.
- the user can scan in commands from plain text or from a printed menu of commands similar to a map key. For example, the user can scan a special icon that informs the portable scanner that the next captured data should be treated as a control command.
- the user next scans a command, such as “Call Fred,” that causes the portable device to execute an action that is pre-associated with the command, in this example placing a phone call to Fred.
- the portable device can be programmed to recognize that the word “purchase” when scanned by itself (not as part of a string) indicates that the user wishes to initiate a p-commerce purchasing transaction.
- the portable device recognizes control symbols drawn by the user.
- the user can create a command menu on any piece of paper simply by drawing the desired command icons or words.
- Control icons recognized by the system in some embodiments are a “$” (to initiate a p-commerce purchase); a “!” (to enter highlight mode); and a phone icon (to indicate that the following number is a telephone number that can be dialed of stored in the address book).
- the portable device's behavior when it scans a keyword is a subset of the behaviors available by use of captured control data.
- a handheld data capture device captures images of features (text, icons, etc.) in a rendered document.
- the images can be processed (e.g., by applying feature extraction techniques) onboard the handheld document imaging device or may be processed by a computer in communication with the handheld imaging device.
- the captured images correspond to a contiguous string of alphanumeric characters, e.g., a text fragment.
- the system uses the text fragment to identify the paper document and locate an electronic counterpart of the paper document. Typically, this requires a text fragment of at least a first predetermined length.
- the rendered document is disambiguated, it is possible to interact with an electronic counterpart of the paper document.
- Interactions range from having a copy of the electronic document delivered to the user to the delivery of additional subject matter related to the source document, to the delivery of document map (markup) information, to using the source document to navigate around the electronic counterpart document, to editing the electronic counterpart, to carrying out complex financial transactions.
- these interactions are accomplished using the handheld document imaging device as a command input device. It is desirable to have a handheld document imaging device whose user interface that provides a number of command inputs and is intuitive to use while maintaining a compact size.
- the handheld device is controlled by the users gestures. For example, scanning text in a forward direction may indicate that the user wishes to store the text in memory. Scanning the same text in the reverse direction may indicate that the user wishes to erase the text from memory. Rubbing back and forth over text in a document may indicate that the user wants to highlight that text in an electronic copy of the document.
- the system enables many gestures to be used to control the actions of the portable device such as circular motions, shaking motions, etc. Many behaviors can be associated with predetermined gestures, such as: starting the scan process; signaling that the user is done scanning from a particular article or document (and therefore subsequent scanned data will be from a new article or document); highlighting; deleting previous entries; etc.
- the inventors have further discovered that once a document is disambiguated (thus setting context for subsequent scans within the document), it is possible to identify locations within the document using shorter text fragments. These identified locations may then be used as anchor points for interacting with the document, such as, for example annotating the document, editing the document or extracting text and/or images from the document.
- the handheld document data capture device is configured to capture a series of frames of image data as the handheld document imaging device is moved across the face of the source document. In some embodiments, the handheld document data capture device is configured to capture a series of at least partially overlapping images when used within predefined velocity limits. The amount of overlap typically must be sufficient to allow relative X-Y motion between frames to be calculated.
- the handheld device is configured to extract features from the frames of captured image data.
- the handheld document imaging device may use an optical character recognition scheme to convert the captured images into text and then use a stitching algorithm to construct text strings from the captured image data or may use a character offset method on stitched together frames of image data to develop representations of text strings or may use differences in the pixilation of the sequential frames of image data to calculate relative position.
- the text strings may be either horizontal or vertical with respect to the page.
- the handheld document data capture device is operatively coupled to a database that associates a predetermined motion (gesture) of the handheld document imaging device relative to the source document with a command input.
- the handheld document data capture device may be preconfigured with a gesture/command input pairing library or may be trainable by the user. Additionally, gestures may be “overloaded” such that performing the same gesture may cause the execution of different command inputs depending upon the context of the gesture, e.g., time frame or location within the document.
- the user captures images of a section of the source document by moving a handheld document imaging device from left to right along a text line of the source document.
- the handheld document imaging device first determines if the source document has been disambiguated. If the source document has not been disambiguated it extracts document features from the captured frames of image data and communicates the extracted features to a computer which in turn uses the extracted features to disambiguate the source document. If the source document has-already been disambiguated, the handheld document imaging device extracts document features and uses the extracted features to establish a position within the document and select the corresponding region/text in the electronic document.
- a gesture may be overloaded with respect to location within a document
- moving the handheld document imaging device from left to right a second time over substantially the same region of the source document causes the text within the selected region to be underlined.
- moving the handheld document imaging device from left to right a third time over substantially the same region of the source document causes the text within the selected region to be bolded.
- moving the handheld document imaging device from right to left over substantially all of a previously selected region of the source document causes the preceding command input to be undone. For example, if, in accordance with the preceding description of an overloaded left to right linear gesture, the user had bolded a selected region moving the handheld document imaging device from right to left a single time over the selected region would cause the text within the selected region to be changed from bold to underlined. Moving the handheld document imaging device from right to left a single time over the selected region would cause the text within the selected region to revert to its initial formatting and repeating the right to left motion a third time would deselect the selected region entirely.
- moving the handheld document imaging device from right to left over a portion of the previously selected region of the source document causes the portion of the previously selected region/text to be deleted.
- the user may desire to interact with relatively large blocks of text, such as, for example, copying or deleting single or multiple paragraphs.
- the user may move the handheld document imaging device from left to right to establish a beginning location and from left to right to establish an ending location.
- the handheld document imaging device uses the text strings (or symbolic representation thereof) to establish the beginning and end of the selected region.
- Subsequent command inputs then function on the selected region. For example, in some embodiments, if the user moves the handheld document imaging device in an “X”-shaped pattern between the beginning and ending locations, the region of the source document between the beginning and ending locations is deleted.
- the selected region is deleted. If the user moves the handheld document imaging device downward within the selected region; the selected region may be highlighted. In some embodiments, if the user moves the handheld document imaging device in a circular manner the selected region is copied.
- the user uses a circular motion to select regions of the source document.
- the system typically substantially maintains formatting of the source document must be in the electronic document, or maps the layout of the paper document to the electronic counterpart using translation information in the markup document.
- the handheld document imaging device uses features extracted from the series of frames of image data to determine that the handheld document imaging device was moved in a circular pattern and uses the extracted features to determine the location of the selected region within the electronic document using a character mapping scheme.
- different command inputs are associated with a clockwise circular motion and a counterclockwise circular motion respectively.
- the portable scanner recognizes and acts on gesture-based controls. For example, in some embodiments, the portable scanner scans in text by passing an optical sensor over the text, which is then stored in memory in the scanner. By passing the optical sensor over the text in the reverse direction, the text is erased from memory. By scanning in a circle, a user can, in some embodiments, highlight the circled text in an electronic document in a word processing program on the scanner's host computer.
- the handheld document data capture device To detect and act on gesture-based commands, the handheld document data capture device must be able to detect and interpret motion. Various methods of detecting motion and mapping motions to gesture commands are discussed below. In some embodiments, the portable device calculates motion vectors between sequential image captures to identify gestures.
- the portable scanner starts a gesture interpretation application whenever motion is detected.
- One way to detect motion is to compare sequentially captured images, much like an optical mouse.
- a first image is analyzed for patterns.
- a processor uses software instructions to bring this image into memory and then find parts of this image that differ from a background (e.g., identifying black text on a white background).
- the processor records to memory where these patterns were located and what they were.
- the processor then loads a second image and attempts to detect these original patterns.
- the processor compares how the locations of these patterns may have changed from the first image.
- the difference is encoded as vectors. By repeating this process, a series of vectors may be formed. Similar to “connect the dots,” these line segments, or vectors, can trace out a motion sequence.
- the processor can, in some embodiments, find vectors between pixels (or some representative pixels) in a first and second image. To calculate the vectors between images, the processor compares the images first along the horizontal axis, then along the vertical axis to determine the device's movement path between during the period between the capture of the first and second images. The processor then moves all of the pixels in the first image one pixel to the right (with some pixels no longer being part of this image). The processor then recalculates these vectors. If these vectors are shorter, the processor continues moving pixels to the right until there is no horizontal distance between pixels. If these vectors are longer, this processor begins moving pixels to the left.
- the processor repeats the comparison along the vertical axis to determine the vertical component of the movement vector.
- the processor has calculated the vertical and horizontal components of the movement vector, the relative linear motion between the first image and the second image is known.
- the calculation of motion vectors is followed by an effort to determine which gesture was intended.
- the complexity of this step may depend on which gesture classifications exist. For example, if a scanner only recognizes one gesture, e.g., backwards, classification efforts may not need to consider any vertical components of motion. In some embodiments, such as embodiments in which the scanner only recognizes the backwards gesture, multiple vectors may be replaced by a single representative vector as described herein. For instance, if a user is attempting to scan perfectly horizontally, but instead oscillates vertically a little, the scanner may be able to determine that this user intended a horizontal line, and replace the myriad vectors with one horizontal one.
- An intuitive and elemental way to gesture with the handheld data capture device is to scan forwards and backwards along a line of text.
- the handheld data capture device recognizes forward and backward movement along a line of text by comparing the scanned text images to stored character templates. Using the English alphabet as an example, if the scanned character matches the template, the scanner is moving left to right (forward). If the scanned character is a mirror image of the template, the scanner is moving right to left (reverse). In some embodiments, backwards and forwards motion is determined by the previously discussed vector method.
- a circular gesture is identified by the previously discussed vector method.
- the portable device uses absolute position information to detect circular motion.
- One way to obtain absolute position information is, for example, from documents that have encoded grids printed on them. Each image taken by the device contains absolute position information that can used to determine the device's motion relative to the document surface.
- the processor When using the vector approach, the processor to add motion vectors together to determine if a vector ever crosses another vector, particularly the starting point of the first vector.
- circle-gesture detection techniques can be combined where vectors are used to determine if there might be a crossing, and then absolute position analysis is used to determine if such a crossing did in fact occur.
- FIG. 8 is a flow diagram showing steps typically performed by the system to detect that a user has made a circle gesture.
- steps 800 these steps begin when the system detects a new elemental gesture.
- step 810 the system detects if this gesture has intersected itself.
- FIG. 9 illustrates some examples of a user's attempts at performing a circle gesture.
- the first gesture 900 intersects at 910 . In this example, the beginning and the end of this motion actually cross over each other, and therefore may be detected as an intersection.
- the second gesture 920 shows a gesture that may be determined to be a circle.
- the beginning and end come nearest to each other at 930 . In some embodiments this distance may be within an allowable margin to be considered an intersection.
- the third gesture 940 illustrates a gesture that may not be considered a circle.
- the distance between the two nearest points 950 , 960 may be too far to be considered an intersection (though some embodiments may be programmed to accept even this). If this gesture has intersected itself, this process of detecting a circle continues in FIG. 8 at step 820 where the system considers the vertical component. If this gesture has not intersected itself, this iteration returns to await a new gesture.
- a vertical component may be considered to ensure that this gesture is not a rubbing gesture, which a user may not want to have interpreted as a circle.
- vertical component may be the difference between the highest and lowest points reached during the gesture.
- this stage may be determined by comparing this difference to a threshold. If the vertical component is not large enough to meet or exceed the threshold, this process determines that the gesture was not a circle. If this component has been met, the system continues in step 830 , where a horizontal component may be considered. The horizontal evaluation is performed similar to the vertical evaluation. If a gesture has met all three of these criteria (intersection, vertical and horizontal) the system classifies it as a circle in step 840 . If one of these criteria is not met, the process returns to step 800 to await a new gesture.
- Rubbing back and forth across a string of text is another intuitive and fundamental gesture that may be used to control a handheld image data capture device.
- a rubbing or back and forth gesture may be interpreted as a highlighting command. For example, a user may make a series of scans with a forward gesture and designate one scan target with a rubbing gesture. In response, the scanner can flag the text identified by the rubbing motion so that it is highlighted (e.g., this “rubbed” text is on a brightly colored field) on subsequent retrievals.
- text that was denoted with a forwards gesture may be underlined.
- FIG. 10 is a flow diagram showing steps typically performed by the system to detect a rubbing gesture.
- the rubbing gesture is a vertical up and down motion; in some cases, however, the user rubs horizontally back and forth across a string of text.
- a new elemental gesture is started at step 1000 .
- the system detects a direction, as is described elsewhere.
- the system detects a direction change.
- the system evaluates the direction change to see if it is the reverse of the previous direction of movement. In some embodiments, reverse is defined as a new vector that points between 170 and 190 degrees from the endpoint of the previous vector (where 180 is exactly the opposite direction).
- step 1000 the system continues instep 1000 to await a new gesture. If this new direction is reverse, then the system continues in step 1040 to detect another direction change. From step 1040 , the system continues in step 1050 where it is determined whether this new direction is the reverse of the second. If the third direction of motion is the reverse of the second direction, the system continues in step 1060 to perform predetermined behavior associated with the rubbing gesture.
- a forward scan causes a scanner to store the scanned information in memory. If this scan, or a section of it, is subsequently scanned with a backwards gesture, this portion scanned in the backwards direction is removed from memory.
- FIG. 11 shows a scanner 1100 moving in the backwards (right to left) direction 1110 across document 1120 .
- the text captured and stored in memory by an earlier forward scan is shown in box 1130 .
- Box 1140 shows the text that was scanned in the backwards direction, with the rightmost character being the “first” character captured by the backwards scan. As the text is in box 1140 is captured by the backwards scan, each character is compared to the previously scanned string.
- the scanner 1100 compares the first (rightmost) character of the backwards scan with the last (rightmost) character of the forward scan and continues in a similar manner until the characters from the backwards scan stop matching the scanned string.
- the scanner stops comparing the two strings when it encounters a character in the backwards scan that does not match the character at the corresponding position in the forward scan. After the comparison stops, the scanner deletes the matching characters from memory.
- the scanner By observing the direction in which the scanning sensor stitches together the image of each character, the scanner detects palindromes and avoids interpreting them as an erasure gesture.
- the system detects palindromes by observing the direction in which the scan occurs.
- a palindrome scanned in the forward direction (left-to-right) will have characters images that are constructed by stitching together sequential left-to-right images.
- Right-to-left (backward) scans will capture a character image starting at the right side of the character and moving left. For the English language, this right-to-left movement results in an image that is a mirror image of the initial left-right scan.
- Palindrome characters will not be mirror images and thus can be distinguished from a reverse scan.
- gesture commands can be used with documents rendered on a computer display.
- a user may gesture a caret (“ ⁇ ”) scan on a computer monitor to identify a location at which to insert text.
- the scanner is in communication with the computer, which recognizes the caret gesture as a command to insert text at the indicated location.
- the computer inserts the text from the last forward scan.
- a scanner may be used to interact with a computer in a fashion similar to a mouse, joystick, or other pointing device.
- a scanner may function as a joystick by being held vertically pointing down. When a user moves this joystick in a given direction either by tilting or moving, these movements are reflected as changes in the scanner images. For example, if the scanner is tilted forwards, an image sensor may record a series of images going the opposite direction, each with more skew. By mapping how parts of these images move or skew, the scanner can determine how it is being moved. These motions may then be communicated to a computer. As a further example, a user can scroll through a document on a computer monitor by using the handheld scanner as a computer pointing accessory.
- the handheld data capture device can control other electronic devices, can use other electronic devices to enhance its own user-interface (e.g., by using a computer display), and can enhance the user-interface of other electronic devices by, for example, enabling scanned data entry.
- the portable device After establishing a context (if necessary) by scanning a title or other identifier from a rendered document, the portable device is used to indicate the desired operations by scanning. For example, a user can program his video recorder (VCR) by scanning in a code that identifies a document as a television guide, followed by a scan of a VCR+ code.
- VCR video recorder
- the VCR+ code is communicated to the VCR by IR communications, causing the VCR to perform the predetermined action associated with the code.
- the scanner's proximity to devices can be used to define programming behavior as well.
- the scanning of a package of frozen food in the proximity of a microwave might set the appropriate cooking time.

- content retrieval provides the content to the associated device.
- the system may associate storage devices with the user's scanner for the purpose of storing electronic content (audio, video, digital documents, etc.) delivered by the system in response to a scan of a printed document. For instance, by scanning an identifier that uniquely identifies a device having storage capability (such as a computer with a hard drive, writable. DVD, CD-ROM, etc.), the system may modify its databases so that future deliveries of content in response to scans of printed documents (originating from the portable scanner) will be delivered to the corresponding storage device and archived for later retrieval.
- a device having storage capability such as a computer with a hard drive, writable. DVD, CD-ROM, etc.
- the system determines the user's location and which nearby devices may be associated with the user's portable electronic device.

- the user accesses the service provider's website and manually enter identifiers of the devices and data repositories (e.g., the home computer) that are to receive responses to his scanned queries.
- the system uses the various scanning methods discussed throughout this document to automatically identify the recipient devices.
- a public kiosk displays a dynamic session ID.
- the kiosk is connected to a communication network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet.
- the connection may be via cable modem, telephone system (PSTN, ADSL, DSL, cellular etc), wireless local area network (WLAN, IEEE802.11, etc.) or any other suitable access method.
- the session ID changes periodically but at least every time that the kiosk is used so that a new session ID is displayed to every new user.
- the user scans in the session ID displayed by the kiosk; by scanning the session ID, the user informs the system that he wishes to temporarily associate the kiosk with his scanner for the delivery of content resulting from scans of printed documents.
- the scanner may communicate the session ID and other information authenticating the scanner (such as a serial number, account number, or other identifying information) directly to the system (perhaps via a wireless communication such as a cellular Short Message Service (SMS) message) or by using the kiosk's links to the communication network.
- the scanner may apply the kiosk's communication link by transferring the session initiation information to the kiosk (perhaps via short range RF such as BlueToothTM, etc.).

- the scanner may communicate directly (where “directly” means without passing the message through the kiosk) with the service provider's system by communicating the session initiation message through the user's cellphone (which may be paired with the user's scanner via Bluetooth) or other wireless communication device.
- the system prevents others from using a device associated with a scanner during the period (session) in which the device is associated with the scanner. This feature is especially useful to prevent others from using a public kiosk before a previous session has ended.
- the user may initiate the session by scanning the session ID from the kiosk display (or entering it via a keypad or touchscreen on the portable scanner); and the system associates in its databases the session ID with the serial number (or other identifier that uniquely identifies the user and/or the user's scanner) of his scanner so another scanner cannot scan the session ID and use the kiosk during his session.
- the scanner may be in communication (through wireless link such as BluetoothTM, a hardwired link such as a docking station, etc.) with a computer associated with the display or may be in direct (i.e., without going through the computer) communication with the service provider's system via another means such as cellular, etc.
- the portable scanners functions vary depending upon the associated devices. For example, if a portable scanner is associated with a nearby computer that has optical character recognition (OCR) capability, the scanner may communicate scanned image data to the computer, whereas if the associated computer did not have OCR capability, the portable scanner may apply an on-board OCR function to convert the scanned images to text before communicating the text to the service provider.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the scanner obtains the communication session identifier from the computer by wireless communications (e.g., a BluetoothTM link) rather than scanning.
- wireless communications e.g., a BluetoothTM link
- the computer may use the Bluetooth connection to communicate the communication session identifier to the scanner, rather than displaying it on the computer display for the user to scan with the portable scanner.
- the system enhances the user interface for portable electronic devices by associating other devices that have better video or audio capability than the portable electronic device. For example, a subscriber waiting for a flight in an airport may browse a television guide and notice a show that he wishes to watch. Using the web browser on his computer to browse to the service provider's website, the subscriber may get a communication session identifier communicated to his laptop computer. Scanning the communication session identifier and information identifying the show from the television guide, the subscriber identifies the laptop computer as the location where he wishes to have the video content (the television show) delivered.
- the system may check whether the subscriber has the proper permissions to access the content (e.g., does he have a ‘cable television’ service contract; if broadband Internet access is necessary to deliver the video, does he have a broadband service contract with an Internet Service Provider, etc.) prior to sending it to the laptop computer.
- the subscriber has the proper permissions to access the content (e.g., does he have a ‘cable television’ service contract; if broadband Internet access is necessary to deliver the video, does he have a broadband service contract with an Internet Service Provider, etc.) prior to sending it to the laptop computer.
- the handheld document data capture device controls the operation of a personal computer (PC).
- the handheld device submits data and instructions to the PC that cause the PC to launch software applications and/or take other actions.
- a user can control the operation of the computer by scanning a paper copy of the Power PointTM slides. The user scans information from a slide to make the computer advance to the slide.
- the handheld device can also be used to control word processing software, web browsers, and other software applications from a rendered document.
- the user can edit electronic documents, make purchases over the Internet, and send messages by controlling the personal computer with the handheld device.
- the handheld data capture device serves as a data entry device for a host computer.
- the handheld device and the host computer in combination with word processing software, comprise a powerful document editing system.
- the document editing system mirrors and/or interprets the users motions on a printed surface as editing commands for the document in the computer's word processing application.
- the user causes the word processing software to perform various functions such as bookmark, highlight/underline/bold/italicize text, cut, copy, paste, search, save, and print.
- the color of the highlight indicator on the handheld device indicates the color of highlights that will appear in digital copy.
- colored lights can be reflected onto the paper to indicate to the user the color of the highlights that will appear in the digital copy, the state of the capture device, etc.
- the portable data capture device can control video recording devices. For example, by capturing data from a television guide, the portable device can transmit commands to program a video recording device to record predetermined television programs. In some embodiments, the portable device transmits the commands to the video recording device by infrared (IR) communications.
- IR infrared
- the user-interface of the handheld data capture device can inform the user about the current status of the device.
- the device can alert the user by visual, auditory or tactile indicators. Some of the more useful user-interface status indicators are discussed below but this is by no means a comprehensive list of the possibilities.
- the portable capture device indicates to a user that enough information has been captured to identify a document.
- a handheld scanner may store predetermined thresholds that indicate a particular scan uniquely identifies a document. When the threshold is met or exceeded, the portable scanner indicates to the user via the user interface that enough information has been scanned to identify the document.
- These predetermined thresholds may be determined based on heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb), statistical analysis, or other suitable methods.
- the handheld data capture device may indicate to the user that sufficient information has been scanned via the visual, audio, or tactile capability of the user interface.
- the device's processor Upon determining that the scanned information has met or exceeded the predetermined threshold, the device's processor will instruct the user interface to communicate to the user that enough information has been scanned to identify the document from which the information was scanned.
- the sufficient scan indicator indicates various levels of confidence in the “sufficiency” of the scan. For example, a red right might indicate that not enough text has been captured, a yellow light might indicate a fifty percent probability that enough text has been captured, and a green light indicates a near certainty that enough text has been captured.
- the system uses a heuristic for determining the sufficiency threshold that is based on observations of the unique character of written expression. Most documents can be uniquely identified with a scan of fewer than 10 words (roughly 20-50 characters or symbols). This heuristic holds across all languages on which it has been tested. In the event that a scan in the range of 4-10 words results in duplicate documents, the user can be prompted to scan additional words to further narrow the results.
- a sufficiency threshold is a parameterized rule of thumb based on observation of previous scans.
- the scanner may be programmed such that eight words are unique (where a “word” is a series of characters between spaces).
- the scanner may be programmed with a sufficiency threshold that requires that the captured text have at least six words that are all longer than three characters each.
- Another approach is to determine that a scan is unique after a scan of a certain physical distance (e.g., a scan of four inches of text would be more than half of a line of text on a standard width page).
- scan sufficiency can be determined by sending the scanned text to a search engine and receiving a search result. When the search engine returns a unique match, the scan is sufficient.
- a scan may be determined to be unique is if some embedded data is found, such as a two dimensional barcode, that is designed to convey uniquely identifying information.
- the threshold method enables the handheld data capture device to indicate to the user in real time whether the captured text is unique or not.
- uniqueness is determined by one or null hits—i.e., no other indexed document has content matching the search query.
- the length of the scanned words will affect the number of words required to sufficiently identify the document or region. Long words generally have more disambiguation value than short words. Thus, the word “amalgamation” has more disambiguation value than the word “the.” Word length can be determined, even prior to OCR, by observing whether there are any whitespaces in a character string. A large number of characters without intervening whitespaces indicates a big word, which is likely to have high disambiguation value. A large number of whitespaces separated by a few characters means short words which have less disambiguation value.
- the handheld data capture device alert the user when the user encounters control data embedded in a document.
- the portable device can alert the user when it encounters a known keyword.
- the handheld device can alert the user to active regions defined within the document by the markup layer.
- the device can alert the user when it encounters control data embedded in ink that has non-visible properties (e.g., UV/IR ink) or two-dimensional bar codes.
- the portable device indicates to the user that device does or does not recognize its current context (e.g., whether the device knows the identity of the document that the user is currently working with, region within a known document, etc.).
- Context “lock” is particularly useful for p-commerce applications.
- the context indicator can inform the user that the system knows from which catalog she is scanning item. Thus, ensuring that the correct items will be purchased from the correct vendor.
- the context indicator displays the name or other identifying information of the rendered document.
- the portable device alerts the user to whether it is operating in online or offline mode.
- the device When the device is online, it has an active connection to a host computer or the service provider's network.
- the device When the device is offline, it is not presently in communication with other system devices.
- the device indicates to the user that it is capturing data and otherwise functioning correctly.
- the device alerts the user to errors. For example, the device may beep to alert the user that the paper document has been identified but the user does not have permission to access the electronic counterpart of the paper document. As further examples, the device can alert the user that the last scan must be repeated; that access has been denied to a host computer or service provider network, that a document delivery did not occur (e.g., the user's life library archive did not receive/accept a document), the portable device is out of memory, battery power is running low, etc.,
- the portable device shows the user what color the highlight function will produce.
- the host computer shows the color of the current highlighting mode on its display (e.g., yellow means that word processing software is highlighting in yellow).
- the portable data capture device has security and privacy processes that unauthorized persons cannot use the device, that data transmissions are private, and that the user's identity can be verified for commercial transactions.
- the portable device uses encryption processes to ensure privacy and security of user data. Data stored in the device's memory can be encrypted as well as data transmitted to other devices. Additionally, the user can set the device profile to limit the amount and kind of information shared with other devices. In some embodiments, the system allows the user to designate that all search results are returned to the portable device and are not stored in the system or service provider network.
- the scanner is paired to a host machine such as a computer, PDA, or mobile phone.
- the system can lock the portable data capture device so that it works only with a particular host machine by programming the host machine's identifier (e.g., serial number, etc.) into a predetermined location in the portable device's memory.
- the portable device checks the predetermined memory location to see which machine is its assigned host. If anyone tries to use the scanner with another device the system (or the scanner itself) requires user to verify/authenticate his identity before the new communication pairing will operate.
- the handheld data capture device and its associated system use biometrics for security and privacy. For example, a user can verify his identity by scanning his fingerprint with the portable device. As another example, in some embodiments, the device uses biometric information to encrypt data for privacy, such as using fingerprint scans for elliptic curve encryption. In some embodiments, the handheld device uses the same optical path for scanning text and biometrics.
- the handheld document data capture device exhibits different behaviors depending upon whether the device is online or offline.
- a device is offline when it is not in communication with other devices such as host computers, communication networks, or data capture service provider networks.
- a data capture service provider network also referred to as a scanner service provider network, is a service provider that supports applications of the handheld document data capture device, such as a life library archive provider.
- the portable device continues to function even when it is offline.
- the user can still scan data from rendered documents, make voice annotations, search for documents, and initiate p-commerce transactions. Some of these functions (such as transactions, annotations, and searches) will not be completed until network connectivity is restored.
- One form of offline behavior occurs when a document is not currently available in electronic form.
- a search based on data captured from the document will return no matches.
- the system can save the search query and periodically resubmit it until the document becomes available at some point in the future.
- the system can also notify the user that an electronic counterpart is not currently available.
- the portable data capture device keep the captured raw data (image or voice) in memory for later retrieval. This capability allows the system to recover the “as captured” data for further processing. For example, when a user scans text with a portable scanner, the scanned image is saved to memory and an OCR process is performed on the scanned image. If the image cannot be recognized by the OCR process, then raw image data can be sent to the host computer or service provider for further processing. In some embodiments, the scanned image data is kept in memory until it is overwritten by new data.
- the device may save raw images and processed images (e.g., OCR'd text) until its memory fills up, at which point some embodiments of the device will only save the processed images and overwrite the raw images, which typically use much more memory space than the processed images.
- processed images e.g., OCR'd text
- the portable device can access locally cached data when in offline mode. Also, in some embodiments, of the portable data capture device detects when the connection to the host computer and/or network are available and automatically change behavior accordingly. For example, a portable device with this online/offline detection can automatically begin caching captured data when the connection is lost.
- the system can reduce latency and conserve network bandwidth.
- Locally cached search indexes, keyword libraries, markup information, and font libraries enhance the user experience and network operation.
- Local caching of font libraries enables the portable device to perform template-based OCR, even when it is in offline mode.
- the document data capture device will locally cache the results of recent scans to reduce network traffic because as much as 50% of network traffic will be repeat hits on same material, especially recently published materials.
- a user's life library can also be cached in a host computer associated with the portable device. Tokens representing documents in the user's life library can be locally cached in the portable device. Locally caching the user's life library allows the user to access his life library even in offline mode.
- the system caches on the portable device representations of how much text is required for a scan to sufficiently identify a paper document or locate an electronic counterpart.
- This local cache can also include a list of commonplace expressions and cliches that have less disambiguation value than average text does.
- the minimum disambiguation threshold increases and additional text is required to sufficiently identify a document.
- common phrases increase the amount of text that must be scanned to identify a document. By locally caching these common phrases, the portable device enhances its ability to indicate to the user that enough text has been captured to identify the document.
- the scanner can indicate that it knows context even when it is in offline mode.
- the portable device when the portable device encounters a font that is not locally cached, it downloads the appropriate font library from their host computer or service provider.
- the markup document associated with that document can be downloading into scanner. Local caching of the markup document enables local determination of scanner behavior for that document.
- the system pre-caches indexes or other data about documents that the user is likely to encounter. For example, in some embodiments, the system pushes the index and markup document for the local newspaper down onto a user's portable scanner every morning in anticipation of the user scanning data from the newspaper.
- the handheld document data capture device locally caches font libraries and font templates.
- the font templates can be downloaded to the device after the font is recognized. It is not necessary to wait until the handheld device has captured one example of every character in the alphabet. After the system recognizes the font of some captured characters, the font library can be downloaded into data capture devices having local cache capability. The system can reduce OCR latency by locally caching the font templates in the portable data capture device.
- the system caches search indexes on the portable data capture device.
- the system can pre-cache indexes that the user is likely to need. For example, the system may pre-cache a portable device every day with the latest index to the local newspaper.
- Keywords can be locally cached on suitable embodiments of the portable data capture device. Locally caching keywords enables the portable device to locally determine its behavior in response to capture of a keyword. Local determination of behavior is especially useful when the portable device is not connected to a host machine or service providers network.
- the portable data capture device downloads markup data for a document. This capability enables the portable device to locally determine at least some of its behavior in response to data capture from the document.
- the portable scanner recognizes keywords in captured data and supports keyword applications. Actions taken in response to the keywords are predetermined by the system and the markup document associated with the rendered document from which the keywords are captured. Generally, global keyword definitions are held at the system level and local keyword definitions are in the markup document. Unless otherwise specified in the markup document, the local definitions override the global definitions.
- Keywords can be special symbols recognized by the scanner (such as the apple icon that is used as the trademark symbol of Apple ComputersTM) or regular text.
- a document such as a catalog may include a menu of command symbols that have special significance to the portable, device.
- To execute a control program associated with a keyword the user would scan one of the special symbols.
- the device's processor would access and execute the control program associated with the keyword.
- one of the special symbols may initiate a purchasing program that can be used to order products from the catalog via the scanner.
- the user would scan information about the products to be ordered and the portable scanner would communicate those products and other information necessary to complete the sale (such as billing and shipping information) to the catalog vendor via a connection between the Internet and the communication interface.
- the handheld document data captures device supports search applications.
- the input for search queries is captured from rendered documents, especially by optical scanning from a paper document.
- the system tags search queries originating from the portable data capture device to indicate that the search terms are from a paper document.
- the system can use data captured from rendered document to identify the rendered document and locate an electronic counterpart of the rendered document.
- the system identifies and locates the document by searching an index of a corpus of documents.
- the system performs the search by submitting a search query to a search engine or search application software.
- Search queries may be constructed in the portable data capture device or in the network.
- the search query message will include the portable device identifier.
- Context about a search can enhance the accuracy of search results.
- the handheld document data capture device submits search queries that include context information.
- Context can be derived from the user's history, from the aggregate historical behavior of a population of users, from properties of the document, or from circumstances of the search.
- search queries include time stamps that indicate when the search string was captured from a rendered document.
- search queries include location stamps that indicate in what geographic location the search string was captured from a rendered document.
- the user's history is useful context for identifying and locating documents. For example, if the user has a pattern of scanning text from the Seattle Times newspaper every morning and the Economist magazine in the afternoons, it is more likely that a search query submitted in the morning is from the Seattle Times than the Economist. In some embodiments, the system will rank search query results based on user history.
- the aggregated behavior of all uses of portable document data capture devices also provides useful context for disambiguation. Users are more likely than not to scan similar information from similar documents. For example, where the user population recently has been submitting many search queries captured from the latest Harry Potter novel and none from Sean Hannity's latest book. Thus, if a search query returns several matches, it is more likely that the source document is the latest Harry Potter novel than a Sean Hannity book. Therefore, in some embodiments, the system ranks search query results based on aggregated user population behavior.
- the portable device captures sequential text from a paper document and constructs a search query based on that text.
- the search query is then submitted to a search engine or other search software.
- the search engine performs a search of its data indexes to identify the paper document or find an electronic counterpart of the paper document.
- the portable capture device conserves communication bandwidth by only submitting enough information to identify an electronic counterpart, even though more information was captured from the paper document. It is an advantage in wireless systems to send only the necessary information, because wireless bandwidth is limited.
- the system enables the user to modify or enhance the search query by entering more text from the device's keypad.
- the handheld device and system support partial word disambiguation.
- search engines use partial words to select from among a plurality of search results. For example, the search engines use the whole words to search the search index and the partial words at the ends of the search string to choose from among the results.
- search queries to these engines preferably include partial word information.
- the portable data capture device is capable of capturing multiple lines of text during one operation.
- Mobile phones using the built-in camera to photograph a portion of a page, a pen-based scanner with an optical head that captures two lines of text, etc. are examples of scenarios in which an optical scanner can capture more than one line of text.
- FIG. 15 shows a portable scanner 1510 that captures text from two lines of document 1520 .
- Box 1500 shows the captured text.
- each line can be submitted in the search query in a “line1 text” AND “line2 text” format.
- the search query can be constructed as “line1 text” WITHIN X WORDS “line2 text,” where X is generally less than the approximate column width.
- the disambiguation search query could be constructed as be “study of law committed to” AND “and public service the.”
- the system uses timestamps and location-stamps to identify documents. For example, an Associated Press article may appear in many newspapers but the correct newspaper could be determined by the location-stamp. If the location-stamp indicates that the scan was performed in Seattle, it is most likely that a Seattle newspaper is the source of the scanned AP article. Similarly, timestamps could be used to narrow the scope of candidate documents to those that were published prior to the timestamp.
- the handheld device can construct search queries that include time and/or location stamps.
- the system indexes and searches documents by word length.
- word lengths In the simplest case, three word lengths are used: long, short, and uncertain.
- the sequential pattern of long and short words forms a unique identifier for each document of sufficient length.
- the document can be located by submitting a search query based on word length rather than a traditional search query that is based on text.
- a low resolution mobile phone camera is used to take a picture of a rendered document but it cannot resolve the image to the character level.
- the document can still be identified by searching for a matching sequential pattern of long and short words.
- documents can be indexed and searched by convolution-based queries that indicate the repetition frequency of characters as discussed elsewhere in this document.
- Search queries originating from scanned text can include information about the text such as font type, size, and color. These text properties can be used to disambiguate the document from which the text was captured. Traditional search queries throw this information away, however.
- the search query can include the document's identifier.
- the search engine can use the document identifier to restrict the search results to the intended document.
- Traditional search queries do not include document identifiers.
- searches can occur in parallel on the local device and the network. When one search returns a result, the other can be terminated.
- messages between the portable document data capture device scanner and the scanning service provider network include unique transaction codes.
- the transaction codes allow the system to identify each transaction.
- the transaction codes are created from a hash of the scanner ID, scanned info, doc info, & time/location info.
- the handheld document data capture device has unique identifier such as an electronic serial number (ESN) or Network address so that the scanning service provider can identify the device.
- the handheld device includes subscriber identity modules (SIM) that have encrypted billing and account information.
- SIM subscriber identity modules
- removable identity modules allow another user to borrow a data capture device and temporarily associate it with their account by inserting their identity module.
- Each of the scanning service provider's subscribers has a subscriber account that is stored in a database in the service provider's network.
- the subscriber account data records can include billing/subscription information, the subscriber's name and address, information about electronic documents to which the subscriber is permitted access, information about subscriptions to paper documents, user history information, identifiers (ESN, etc.) of the subscriber's portable data capture devices, security/encryption keys, and location of the user's life library and/or personal webpage (blog).
- ESN identifiers
- the user could capture data from a document with his handheld device and enter a “blog this document” command through the UI.
- the system disambiguates the document and publishes a link to the document on the user's blog page that is pre-specified in the user's account.
- the network performs remote activation and programming, such as over-the-air activation (OAA) and programming (OAP), of the subscriber's handheld document data capture devices.
- OOA over-the-air activation
- OAP programming
- a data capture device powers up, it will register with the service provider's network. Once it has registered, the service provider can download activation data into the device.
- Activation data can include a network address or other unique identifier that the service provider can use to route messages to the device.
- the service provider can use remote programming to update the device with any necessary updates (e.g., locally cached markup data).
- the service provider can verify that the device belongs to a subscriber by checking the device's identifier against the subscriber account.
- the system moves indexes and other data to network elements near (either physically or in a connection-speed sense) the handheld device to reduce latency and to conserve network resources. Moving frequently accessed data close to the handheld device will reduce the number of network entities that must handle the information on its way to the handheld device.
- the network and the handheld document data capture device iterate the disambiguation process.
- the user submits a search query constructed with data captured from a paper document.
- the service provider submits the search query to a search engine but cannot disambiguate the document
- the network prompts the user to capture additional information from the rendered document.
- the user submits the additional information and the service provider uses the new information in conjunction with the previously submitted information to disambiguate the rendered document.
- the service provider and user iterate through this process as many times as necessary to disambiguate the document.
- the service provider typically retains the previously submitted information and aggregates it with the newly submitted information to disambiguate the document.
- the handheld document data capture device includes memory for storing information related to billing, subscription, and/or device identifiers.
- This memory may be removable, such as in a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or smart card, or non-removable, such as a Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM).
- SIM Subscriber Identity Module
- PROM Programmable Read Only Memory
- the SIM memory is associated with the user's mobile phone services account.
- subscription information can be used to verify whether the user should be allowed access to the electronic copy. For example, a newspaper may charge an additional fee for access to its online version.
- the user's account with the service provider can include subscription information for paper documents, such as newspapers, that indicate whether the user subscribes to the online version of the paper document.
- the system uses billing information in the user's subscriber account to make purchases with the portable scanner.
- the memory contains encrypted credit card or other financial information of the user. For example, when the user scans text from a document and indicates (perhaps via the user interface or the gestural controls disclosed above) that he wishes to purchase access to an electronic copy of the document, the billing information can be used to provide payment to the copyright holder or content provider.
- the handheld device includes device identifiers such as serial numbers in memory. These device identifiers serve to uniquely identify the portable device and would typically be stored in PROM so that they cannot be erased. Additional security for transactions can be obtained by associating a portable device with only one user, such as by correlating the device serial number to a user's account or subscription in a network database.
- the system stores the device identifier in the smart card (or storing a smart card identifier in the portable scanner) to lock the scanner to the smart card.
- the device's processor verifies that the correct smart card was inserted before the portable scanner 200 is permitted to function. Smart cards with internal processors could also verify that they are inserted in the portable device to which they have been locked prior to allowing access to any information in the smart card.
- the handheld document data capture device includes annotation applications.
- the annotation software enables the device to attach voice or text annotations to locations, marks, or text in a document.
- the annotations can be associated with a text string or an absolute location within the document. If the annotations are associated with a text string, they system can notify the subscriber if he edits or deletes the text to which the annotation is attached. Prior to proceeding with the edit or deletion, the system would seek confirmation from the user that he wishes to proceed.
- Text annotations can be entered by scanning text from a rendered document, through the portable device's keypad, or by conversion of voice data to text.
- the handheld document data capture device includes a microphone for capturing voice.
- the captured speech can be annotated to a document as an audio file at a location specified by the user, as discussed in further detail in the scannotator section below.
- the handheld document data capture device has onboard OCR capability.
- the system performs OCR on the host computer or service provider.
- OCR can be accomplished by many suitable methods, including template matching, convolution, and word-length OCR.
- the portable data capture device converts trademark symbols to a code or plain text.
- the portable device has a database of trademark symbols that it can recognize. When it scans a trademark it recognizes, the portable device can substitute a code for the trademark image. The then portable device sends the code to the service provider network.
- the service provider takes predetermined actions associated with the trademark code. For example, a user might scan an image of the MitsubishiTM “three diamond” trademark.
- the portable scanner compares the image to its on-board library of trademark symbols and identifies the three diamond symbol as the Mitsubishi trademark.
- the library has a unique code associated with each trademark that uniquely identifies the trademark to the system service provider. Rather than transmit the entire image file to the service provider, the portable scanner substitutes the code and transmit the code.
- Substituting a code for an image reduces the size of the message to the network, an important advantage for wireless communications.
- the system sends an alphanumeric code over some communication channels (such as a cellular SMS channel) that do not permit image files.
- some communication channels such as a cellular SMS channel
- the trademark images could be converted to ASCII text, also.
- the MitsubishiTM three-diamond logo could be converted to the text string “Mitsubishi trademark.”
- the optical scanning subsystem distinguishes word length to a reasonable approximation, even if it cannot determine what the individual letters are. Fortunately, word length patterns also can be used to identify documents. By sorting the words in an image of a document into categories, the portable scanner can construct a code that can be used to identify the document. In the simplest case, the words would be sorted into three categories: long, short, and unknown. Short words have less than some predetermined number of characters and long words have more characters than the predetermined numbers. In other words, short word ⁇ X ⁇ long word, where X is a predetermined number of characters that distinguishes a short word from a long word. Searching a special index in which documents are indexed by word length will identify the rendered document. After an electronic counterpart is located, the electronic counterpart can be used to perform OCR on the scanned string by finding matching contiguous strings of long/short/unknown words in the electronic counterpart and converting the word length pattern into the individual characters of the words.
- Template-matching OCR is compares captured images to stored character images. When a match is found, the character has been identified. Template-matching OCR is sensitive to variations in font style, size, italics, etc. Essentially, anything that might make the captured character look different than the stored template must be accounted for in a template-matching system. Template matching is very useful for recognizing images of trademarks and graphical icons.
- FIG. 16 shows one embodiment of convolution to determine character offsets.
- this embodiment may be envisioned as sliding an image of text across itself.
- OCR can be performed by statistical analysis or by identifying the source document via a search of a convolution-enhanced index.
- This embodiment begins 1610 after a sensor image has captured an image.
- a processor in this scanner may create a queue of pixels to compare with this original image.
- This queue may be vertical slices of a copy of this original image.
- Another approach may be to use address pointers to keep track of which vertical slices are to be compared, and then create temporary copies of these slices in the processor.
- the following step 1620 compares one length. Length refers to a horizontal width of a vertical slice.
- This may be one pixel, or multiple pixels. It may be heuristically determined based on whitespace.
- This slice may be the entire image. This slice is compared to slices from an original image. This may be done by comparing this slice sequentially to slices from an original. In some embodiments, this comparison slice is sequentially compared to a corresponding slice one step over. A step may be the same distance as a horizontal width. A step may be a pixel or multiple pixels. In the following stage of this process 1630 , this processor records to memory where this image matches itself. This data may contain which vertical slices match other vertical slices of this original image. A matching section may or may not be a character (e.g., it might be two characters that only appear in order). The next step 1640 is to determine if this comparison is complete. Comparison does not necessarily refer to one slice, but to this larger process. One way to determine if the convolution process is complete is if there are no more slices to compare.
- FIG. 17 is an illustration of one way to conceptualize the convolution process. This shows a step-by-step breakdown of using a single slice to find character offsets. The exemplary steps are numbered, such as the 1 1700 shown. Lines 1710 are used to separate the steps. An image of the word determinative is being compared. On the left is a slice 1720 and on the right is a copy 1730 in memory. When an overlap is found, it is designated with a triangle 1740 .
- FIG. 18 is another illustration. Here, the slice copy 1820 is shown above the copy in memory 1830 so that it may be clearer why a match is found 1840 .
- FIG. 19 is a flow diagram showing steps typically performed by the system to perform the convolution process on an image.
- One approach is to subdivide this image into sections that have a discrete number of characters.
- this process is iteratively completed as matches are found, or may be started after all matches have been found.
- this image is one segment, i.e., an image of a discrete number of characters (this image may be cropped to the section enclosed in whitespace).
- step 1920 if there are more matching subsections to process, then the system continues in step 1930 , else the system terminates in step 1970 .
- these sections are recorded.
- One-dimensional location measurements may be sent to memory.
- step 1940 the system determines if any of these matching segments overlap with any segment. This overlap occurs where one segment entirely encompasses another, or where only a section of each overlaps.
- step 1950 the system subdivides these segments. This subdivision step occurs where a first segment has multiple characters and a second segment has smaller number of these characters.
- a first matched segment may contain “ing” and a second segment may contain “in.” This process may then subdivide these into segments containing “in” (i.e., what was matched) and “g” (I.e., what was left). If all segments begin with a discrete number of characters, removing a discrete number of characters will also leave a discrete number of characters.
- the system stores each of these segments as the largest segment that is either completely overlapped or entirely free of overlap. This process may be similar to when locations are stored 1930 . In some embodiments, the same system of correlating matching segments is used. After this process, an original image will have a number of matching segments identified.
- the system treats space between these segments (or between these segments and at least one edge of this image) as new segments that do not match any other segment.
- each character has its own segment.
- the system uses character analysis techniques, such as blob analysis or connectedness analysis, to further subdivide segments. These segments may then be used to determine the text on which they are based.
- the system represents these segments as offsets, and uses these offsets to look up which text would produce these offsets.
- the storage that contains this information is populated with data that can account for segments containing multiple characters.
- a computer running web browser software such as MicrosoftTM Internet Explorer can access the internal web page included in some embodiments of the portable data capture device. So that the computer can access the portable device's internal webpage, the portable device is linked to the computer by a communication channel such as a USB cable.
- a mobile phone embodiment of a portable document data capture device includes the capabilities of a phone and a scanner.
- the mobile phone can acquire image data with a dedicated scanning subsystem or with an integrated camera.
- Voice annotations can be acquired with the mobile phone's microphone.
- the user can input search query text on the phone's keypad, via the phone's scanner, or via the microphone.
- the mobile phone when the paper document is imaged with the phone's camera and shown on the phone's display, the mobile phone may have software that will show the markup layer overlaid on the paper document image.
- the image is enhanced by the markup document data.
- the mobile phone projects a beam onto the surface to be scanned that will highlight the approximate scan area.
- the mobile phone displays the region to be scanned on the phone's display.
- the display may be enhanced in various ways to show the user what subset of the image will be scanned or OCR'd. For instance, the display could draw a box around the area in which text will be captured.
- the phone can show boundaries of scan region on display—superimposed over image of document from camera or from doc source—e.g., as red lines on display screen—or shaded background—etc.
- the system disambiguates a paper document in the mobile phone context by:
- At least a portion of the data for the menu (e.g., “markup data”) and the index of document have been downloaded to, and reside on, the mobile phone.
- the menu/markup information is presented to the user on the mobile phone's display.
- the menu can be presented to the user audibly.
- the mobile phone data capture device uses the phone's audio facilities to disambiguate documents.
- a user can use a wireless handset or landline phone to dial into a server that accepts voice scans, dtmf tones, etc., and obtain some of benefits of a paper-to-digital-document system using the audio channel of existing telephony.
- the user reads some representative portion of a document—e.g., document identifier, title, etc.
- the system provides feedback about ambiguity—optionally on screen—in some embodiments, the user receives an acknowledgment that a matching digital document is or is not found.
- the user can take optional actions to resolve ambiguity, such as scanning additional items of interest.
- the user can read aloud to set context and present disambiguation data to the system. For example, the user could set context by saying “NY Times, yesterday“followed by the disambiguation data” . . . said we need this war to achieve peace . . . . ”
- the system would then search yesterday's edition of the New York Times for text matching the disambiguation data.
- Simple scanning may not require the entire resolution of the phone's camera in every embodiment. Using only a selected portion of the camera sensor area has the advantage of higher data rates and lower power consumption.
- a fiber optic image conduit is part of the scanning subsystem.
- the scanning subsystem can be optically coupled with the existing camera images sensor.
- a portion of the camera image sensor is reserved for exclusive use of the scanning subsystem.
- the mobile phone subscriber's account with the cellular service provider can be used for account/billing information for p-commerce purchase transactions.
- phone call activity and history can be used to establish context, to prioritize inputs, and to augment a search query.
- other uses of the phone network can be used to set context, such as: use of the phone network for web/WAP/email/IM activity and history thereof; the phone's geographical location and history thereof.
- the phone's text messaging dictionary can be used to enhance the OCR process.
- the T9 predictive text software for text messaging that is on many mobile phones can also be used to enhance the OCR and disambiguation processes.
- the T9 predictive text software can be used to correct OCR errors.
- the text input and SMS messaging history can be used as vocabulary for OCR.
- the mobile phone recognizes an icon as an instruction to dial the number printed next to the icon.
- the mobile phone recognizes phone numbers and takes predetermined actions upon scanning a phone number. Some of the possible predetermined actions are placing a phone call, storing the phone number in the phone's address book.
- the phone uses the phone's geographic location as context to assist in recognizing phone numbers. For example, a phone number under the North American system consists of ten digits. Phones can use their location context when they scan a number to determine whether the number is a phone number. When the phone is in North America, an 11 digit number is not automatically stored as a phone number. When the phone is in Europe, the same 11 digit number might be automatically stored as a phone number.
- Mobile phones can initiate commercial transactions by capturing information from rendered documents. For example, a user captures an image of a few lines of text from a document with his mobile phone camera; the phone recognizes a keyword in the captured data; and the keyword triggers a software application in the phone that causes the phone to deliver a sales offer for a product associated with the keyword. The user can indicate (perhaps with the phone keypad) whether he wants to consummate the transaction. If yes, the purchase cost is billed to the user's mobile phone account.
- Mobile phones can be used to authenticate and complete transactions based on rendered documents. For example, a subscriber can fill out and submit a web page purchasing form. In response, the web merchant sends a code back to the subscriber's computer, which displays it on the computer monitor. The subscriber then photographs the computer monitor with his mobile phone and transmits the image to the merchant across cellular network. When the merchant receives the mobile phone message, the merchant can verify that the mobile phone account matches the information submitted on the web page, thus authenticating the user, and completing the transaction.
- the subscriber can call a dial-up number that connects the subscriber to a server on which p-commerce transactions can be completed by DTMF or voice input.
- the mobile phone is an intermediate platform (host device) for scanning.
- a BlueToothTM scanner is connected to the mobile phone.
- the phone can store document indexes, markup documents, and user account data specific to user/scanner being used in conjunction with phone.
- the cellular phone system opens a data channel with any voice call.
- the caller takes a picture of a document with his cellphone (or otherwise captures enough data to identify the document, e.g., scan a string of text from doc), the captured data is punctured into the voice channel, software in recipient phone recovers the string and uses it to locate an electronic copy of the document from which the string was scanned by the caller.
- a mobile phone when a mobile phone captures a phone number and name, it is preprogrammed to store both in the phone's address book. When just a phone number is captured, the phone is preprogrammed to automatically dial the number.
- Search queries can be efficiently transmitted to the service provider or network by use of the cellular network's Short Message Service (SMS) text-messaging system for mobile phones.
- SMS Short Message Service
- Images and audio files can be sent by the cellular network's Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) that enables mobile phones to send and receive multimedia messages.
- MMS Multimedia Messaging Service
- An interesting aspect of the mobile phone embodiment resides in the observation that only a small fragment of data is required to identify location—especially if that fragment is further *qualified by context*. This short fragment approach then leads to a surprising ability to sending document scan data over limited bandwidth channels formerly incapable of transmitting a document image.
- a portable data capture device is an optical mouse with scanner capability.
- the optical mouse uses the same optical path for scanning and motion-sensing.
- the optical mouse has a viewfinder for observing the text that is being scanned.
- the viewfinder allows the user to see where the scanner is targeted.
- Some technologies that can be used to implement the viewfinder are: a clear plastic window that shows the document beneath the mouse; a series of mirrors similar to a periscope; a display that shows the real-time output of the scanner, or a fiber optic image conduit.
- FIG. 20 shows scanner/mouse 2100 with a viewing window 2104 to reveal the surface below the mouse.
- the scanner/mouse 2100 has a housing 2102 in which there is a viewing window 2104 .

- the memory 2340 can store data and instructions.
- the display 2350 can show the scanned data and/or device status (e.g., whether the device is currently in scanner mode or mouse mode, etc.) to the user.
- FIG. 24 shows a side view of a mouse/scanner 2400 that uses a series of mirrors 2410 to reflect an image up to the viewfinder of what is under the scanner head.
- a light source 2420 illuminates a portion of a rendered document 2430 that is being scanned by the user. At least some of the light from the light source 2420 reflects from the document 2430 and travels along the optical path 2440 to the viewfinder window 2450 which is visible by the user.
- a straight opening through the mouse would not require mirrors 2410 .
- the viewfinder windows 2450 might be placed on either side of the scanner head/light source 2420 (see FIG. 26 ).
- FIG. 25 shows an example of a mouse/scanner 2500 that uses an image conduit 2510 operatively connected with a light sensitive semiconductor chip (CMOS, CCD, etc.) 2520 .
- CMOS light sensitive semiconductor chip
- the output of the CCD 2520 could be directly applied to a display 2530 and to the processor 2540 (alternatively, it could be processed before being routed to the display 2530 ).
- the processor 2540 is operatively connected with CCD 2520 , display 2530 , memory 2550 and the I/O subsystem 2560 .
- FIG. 26 shows a top view of a mouse/scanner 2600 with a viewfinder that is essentially a window 2610 on either side of the scanning mechanism 2620 so that the user can see the text that the going to pass under the scanning head.
- the processor 2630 is operatively connected with the scanning mechanism 2620 , memory 2640 , I/O subsystem 2650 , and power supply 2660 .
- the power supply 2660 is typically included in scanners that communicate wirelessly, but is optional for a wired mouse.
- a scanning accessory with an adapter port is another example of a portable data capture device.
- the scanning accessory can be plugged into the appropriate connector on another device, such as a mobile phone or PDA, thereby upgrading the device with scanning capability.
- the accessory merely has an optical capture subsystem and an adapter (drawing power via the adapter).
- the accessory includes control logic, memory, and power supply.
- the system targets audio annotations to selected positions in an electronic counterpart of a rendered document (“the system”).
- the system In order to target a spoken annotation to a selected point in a paper document, the user uses a hand-held optical scanner to scan a portion of text at the selected point. The user then speaks the annotation, which is captured by a microphone in the optical scanner and stored in association with the scanned portion of text.
- the scanner may connect to, or otherwise communicate with, a computer system or similar device via a wired or wireless connection of various types.
- the stored association can be used, for example, to play back the annotation while displaying the selected point in an electronic version of the document, to display a textual version of the annotation obtained via voice recognition in connection with the selected point in an electronic version of the document, to automatically revise an electronic version of the document at the selected point in accordance with the annotation, to embed the annotation as an audio file in the electronic document at the selected point, to insert a pointer (e.g., hyperlink, etc.) to an associated audio file containing the audio annotation, etc.
- the scanned text may be used to identify and/or locate the document from among a larger universe of electronic documents. Alternatively, other approaches may be used to identify the document.
- the scanner includes controls, such as controls that navigate between annotations.
- the navigation controls can navigate between annotations in the document displayed on the computer system.
- the navigation controls can navigate between annotations stored in the scanner, to review, revise, or delete such annotations in the scanner's memory.
- the system enables a user to conveniently and accurately annotate an electronic document using a rendered copy of the electronic document.
- FIG. 27 is a perspective drawing showing a view of a sample handheld document data capture device. While reading a paper document, a user may notice typing or spelling errors, factual inaccuracies, or other issues in the document which would require editing of, or other interaction with, the electronic original.
- the user presses the SCAN button 2701 on the annotating device and uses an optical sensor 2711 to scan a few words of the document to capture the context.
- a visual indicator 2721 indicates whether the scanned text was recognized, and/or whether the scanned text is adequate or is likely to be adequate to identify the electronic document corresponding to the rendered document, and/or a single location in this document.
- the user then presses the REC button 2702 to record a voice annotation using a built-in microphone. Pressing a button 2703 allows the user to review the annotation using a built-in speaker 2731 , while pressing REC button 2702 again allows it to be overwritten.
- the user plugs a USB connector 2741 of the annotating device into the USB port on a computer (which may also recharge the internal battery of the annotating device) either directly, or via an extension cable if the USB port is inconveniently located.
- Simply plugging it in may cause an appropriate software package for editing documents to launch, load the appropriate document, and place the editing cursor at the point of the first annotation, possibly even selecting the words that were scanned.
- the user can then press the PLAY button 103 to listen to the recorded annotation, and make any necessary edits to the text in the normal way.
- the user can press the NEXT button 2705 to skip to the next annotation, and then press PLAY again, and so forth.
- the REC button 2702 can be used to add additional annotations at the same location, for example if an assistant has a question about the original annotation or the suitability of their edited version.
- the SCAN button 2701 may, when connected to the PC, be used as the ‘DONE’ button to indicate that the annotation has been noted and is no longer needed. In some embodiments, the same button triggers scanning when the device is in contact with paper and triggers audio recording when it is not. In some embodiments, the device may have a sensor or button (not shown for clarity) near the optical sensor 2711 to detect when the optical sensor 2711 is in contact with paper.
- the annotating device has a clip on the back, allowing it to be clipped to the annotated documents, in order to function as a set of audio Post-It® notes.
- FIG. 28 shows a block diagram of one embodiment of the annotator device 2800 . It incorporates an optical scanning head 2816 for capturing images of text from the paper document, and a microphone 2802 for capturing the voice annotations associated with the text. The data captured from these input devices is possibly processed by the central controller device 2810 , and is stored in the memory 2814 .
- One or more buttons 2812 are provided for the user to control the process, and some visual indicators 2804 shown here as LEDs, give feedback to the user.
- the visual indicator could be any suitable user interface, such as, for example, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).
- LCD Liquid Crystal Display
- the device also includes a loudspeaker 2806 which allows voice annotations to be played back and other audio feedback to be given to the user.
- a loudspeaker 2806 which allows voice annotations to be played back and other audio feedback to be given to the user.
- An interface 2808 is included which allows data to be transmitted to a PC or other processing device, shown here as USB but may be firewire, BluetoothTM, 802.11, infrared, ethernet or other wired or wireless communication technology. Wire-based communication-technologies, such as USB, may also provide power to the device for immediate operation or for charging internal power sources such as batteries.
- FIG. 29 shows the device 2800 connected to a processing device such as a PC 2900 through a communication port 2902 , typically a USB port.
- a monitoring system 2904 is responsible for detecting when the device is connected, communicating with it, and coordinating the resulting operations. Typically this will involve retrieving the captured images from the device to a subsystem 2906 for analysis and conversion to symbolic or text form, passing the resulting text to a search subsystem 2908 which locates the appropriate documents, and handing the details of those documents being passed to the application 2910 which enables the user to view, edit or otherwise interact with them.
- the monitoring system 2904 may also control that application, for example causing it to scroll a document to the location of an earlier scan.
- the captured audio annotations may be passed to the PC's audio system 2912 for playback to the user.
- the audio system 2912 may have Digital-to-Analog and/or Analog-to-Digital conversion capability in order to convert analog audio to digital form and vice-versa.
- the analysis of images and recognition of any incorporated text, shown here 2906 on the PC may be completed, or partially completed, on the device 2800 before or during its connection to the PC 2900 , so that, for example, it is text or some other derivative data which is passed to the PC 2900 instead of, or as well as, the images themselves.
- the audio annotations may be played back to the user through the audio facilities 2906 embedded in the device, and the user interface to the process may be partly or entirely operated through the buttons on the device 2800 .
- the scanning head 2816 of the device is able to capture images from a display device, such as a computer display, as well as from paper.
- the text to be annotated may be identified by capturing and recognizing speech fragments read aloud by the user into the microphone 2802 of the device, instead of scanning and interpreting the image of the words on the paper.
- the microphone 2802 is used for the capture of both text and annotations, allowing the scanning head 2816 to be omitted, and the image-processing and OCR stages described above to be replaced by audio-processing and speech recognition stages.
- the user reads aloud into the microphone the text at the desired location for the annotation and the annotation.
- the user can manipulate the user interface (buttons, displays, keypads, microphone, etc., for presenting information to the user and receiving input from the user) of the device to indicate which audio is marking the location and which is the annotation.
- the PC 2900 can later convert the appropriate audio into text and use this text to identify the electronic document associated with the rendered document. After the electronic document has been identified via the text string that marks the annotation location, the PC 2900 can cause the annotation to be inserted into the electronic document at the proper insertion point.
- FIG. 30 is a block diagram showing some of the components typically incorporated in at least some of the computer systems: and other devices on which the system executes.

- While computer systems configured as described above are typically used to support the operation of the system, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the system may be implemented using devices of various types and configurations, and having various components.
- FIG. 31 is a flow diagram showing a typical process used by the system in order to annotate an electronic document.
- the system scans a portion of a rendered document, such as a small, contiguous sequence of words.
- the system inputs an audio annotation relating to the scanned portion of the rendered document.
- the system continues in step 3101 to construct another annotation, else the system continues in step 3104 .
- the system uploads the document portions scanned in step 3101 and their audio annotations inputted in step 3102 to a computer system.
- the system identifies a digital document corresponding to the rendered document. In some embodiments, the system identifies the digital document corresponding to the rendered document by comparing the text in one or more of the document portions scanned from the rendered document to the contents of a universe of electronic documents.
- step 3106 the system modifies the digital document identified in step 3105 in accordance with the uploaded annotations.
- step 3106 involves attaching each annotation as an audio clip to a point in the digital document proximate to the corresponding scanned portion.
- step 3106 involves attaching a voice-recognized textual version of the annotations to the digital document at such points.
- step 3106 involves automatically performing edits to the scanned portions of the identified digital document based upon voice-recognized contents of the annotations. Where voice recognition is used, it may be performed either before or after the annotations are uploaded. After step 3106 , these steps conclude.
- step 3106 may not appear in every embodiment and may differ in other embodiments from what is described above.
- uploading and storing the annotations for future use may be sufficient, and they may be stored separately from the digital original.
- it may not be possible to modify the original for example because the annotator does not have sufficient privileges (e.g., the original was created by somebody else) or is on a non-writable medium such as a CD.
- steps shown in FIG. 31 may be altered in a variety of ways. For example, the order of the steps may be rearranged; substeps may be performed in parallel; shown steps may be omitted, or other steps may be included; etc.
