Can determine search result document tabulation (piece 1220) based on search inquiry.For example, server 220 can be carried out the document that search determines to include the search terms of search inquiry.Server 220 can be given document with score value, based on their score value document is sorted, and forms the search result document tabulation based on ordering document.
Can determine that any document among the search result document tabulation is whether at user's remove (piece 1230) among the tabulation.In one embodiment, server 220 can be discerned the user who submits search inquiry to based on for example IP address or the log-on message that is associated with the user.Then, server 220 can be determined and discern the tabulation that removes that the user is associated.Server 220 can be with the document identification information (for example address) that is associated with each document among the search result document tabulation, and compares in the document identification information that removes among the tabulation.
If do not have search result document to list in to remove (piece 1230-is not) among the tabulation, the search result document tabulation can be presented to user's (piece 1240) so.For example, server 220 can send to client 210 to show with the search result document tabulation among web browser window.
Remove (piece 1230-is) on the tabulation if there are one or more search result documents to list in, can revise search result list (piece 1250) based on removing tabulation so.For example, but server 220 filter search results lists of documents, thus these one or more search result documents that remove on the tabulation are removed.
Then, the correction tabulation of search result document can be presented to user's (piece 1260).For example, server 220 can send to client 210 to show with the correction tabulation of search result document among web browser window.Server 220 can provide the correction tabulation about the information of the one or more search result documents that removed and search result document.For example, the information about one or more search result documents of having removed can be presented among the web browser window in a different manner, the user just can know that particular document has removed among the search result document tabulation like this.
In another embodiment, can be by present and intercept the original list of search result document such as the auxiliary tools bar relevant with client 210.Can determine whether that any document among the search result document tabulation is at user's remove (piece 1230) on the tabulation.In this embodiment, tool bar can be discerned the tabulation that removes of subscriber's local storage, and the document identification information (for example address) that will be associated with each document in the search result document tabulation is compared with the document identification information among removing tabulation.
Do not remove (piece 1230-is not) on the tabulation if there is search result document to list in, so, the search result document tabulation can be presented to user's (piece 1240).For example, tool bar can be presented at the search result document tabulation among the web browser window.
Remove (piece 1230-is) among the tabulation if one or more search result documents are listed in, can revise search result list (piece 1250) based on removing tabulation so.For example, but tool bar filter search results lists of documents, thus one or more search result documents that will remove on the tabulation remove.
Then, the correction tabulation of search result document can be presented to user's (piece 1260).For example, tool bar can present the correction tabulation of search result document among web browser window.Tool bar may provide the correction tabulation about the information of the one or more search result documents that removed and search result document.For example, the information about one or more search result documents of having removed can be presented among the web browser window in a different manner, the user just can know that particular document has removed among the search result document tabulation like this.
In addition, search engine (for example Google search engine) is optionally collected and is followed the trail of from the user and removes data, the search that the user carried out of serve as reasons all or subclass (for example on the geographic position) and use these to remove data and come to document scores.For example, if for a large amount of user of given last set inquiry a certain Search Results is removed, search engine just can use this information to adjust score value to the document (that group searching is inquired about and/or other) so.In other words, search engine or other search for application can use as the scoring signal removing data.
Example
Figure 13-the 17th, the exemplary plot of the search that can carry out by the user.Suppose that the user offers search engine interface with search inquiry " buffy ".Search engine can be carried out the search result document that search is determined and search terms " buffy " is complementary.Supposing has a search result document (www.upn.com/shows/buffy) the removing on the tabulation of user, and therefore it is removed among search result list.
As shown in figure 13, the correction of Search Results tabulation does not comprise search result document www.upn.com/shows/buffy.The correction tabulation of Search Results will provide information: all search are removed search result document www.upn.com/shows/buffy among search result list.In this case, being defaulted as is that all search are removed search result document www.upn.com/shows/buffy.If the option that customer requirements is different, the user can select " more multiselect item " link, as shown in figure 13.
As shown in figure 14, can present to user's additional options so that search result document www.upn.com/shows/buffy is removed.As shown in figure 14, can present to the user about which content being removed and it being removed option how long.Can comprise following option about the option which content is removed: the document is removed, all documents on (www.upn.com) on this website are removed or the document and any relevant documentation are removed.Can comprise following option about it being removed option how long: only to this search, only document/website/relevant documentation is removed to this session or to all search/sessions.
Suppose that the user selects only this session to be removed all documents on this website (www.upn.com).If desired, can further revise search result list removes with the additional search results document that will be associated with website www.upn.com.As shown in figure 15, the correction of Search Results tabulation does not comprise any search result document that is associated with website www.upn.com.The correction tabulation of Search Results provides information: the search result document that will be associated with website www.upn.com to this search sessions removes among search result list.
The correction tabulation of supposing Search Results comprises three search result documents that are associated with website www.upn.com.As shown in figure 16, the information that three search result documents have removed can be presented to the user from the modification tabulation of Search Results.The search of reforming can also be presented to the user will remove the option that the result includes.If the user selects this option, the search result document that has removed can be added back to its appropriate location (for example, based on its score value) among search result list so.
In some cases, user's quality of determining in fact to impair the Search Results of presenting to the user that particular document is removed.In this case, be that the relevant information of high-quality search result document can be presented to the user with being confirmed as, even the document is included in removing among the tabulation of user.Based on one or more qualitative factors, such as the quantity of the score value of document (for example information retrieval score and/or based on the score value of link), freshness, backward chaining (backlink), and/or the signal of other quality, document can be defined as high-quality.
As shown in figure 17, the user before had been defined as document www.upn.com/shows/buffy removing from all search.Suppose the search based on search terms " buffy " is defined as high-quality search result document with document www.upn.com/shows/buffy.As shown in figure 17, can will present to the user about the information of search result document www.upn.com/shows/buffy.For example, can by some way information be presented to the user is removed by the user so that the user knows search result document, for example it is rendered as highlighted text, the small font text, text in page bottom, the text of partially transparent, color (for example light gray) text different with the color of search result list, the plain text of not optional (for example can not click), be integrated in the tabulation that is separated with search result list among the web browser window (for example, in penalty bench (penalty box)), put (mouseover) pop-up window by mouse, and/or with other and other mode of search result list phase region.
With document from removing among the search result list or document storage may being presented to the user to the option among the search result list.With shown in Figure 13 similar, if the option that user's selection removes document can be presented to the user with the correction tabulation of Search Results so.With shown in Figure 7 similar,, the tabulation of Search Results can be presented to the user so if the user selects to store the option of document.
Improve Search Results
Figure 18 is the process flow diagram that is used to improve the example process of Search Results.In one embodiment, one or more softwares in the available server 220 and/or the nextport hardware component NextPort process of carrying out Figure 18.In another embodiment, can be by being separated with server 220 or comprising that other device of server 220 or one or more softwares and/or the nextport hardware component NextPort among one group of device carry out this process.
Can collect to begin to handle (piece 1810) to the list information that removes that is associated with one group of user.If remove list storage among client 210 rather than server 220, can send to server 220 with removing tabulation so.If remove list storage among server 220, can will compile so from the information that removes tabulation.
In one embodiment, can compile the list information that removes that is associated with one group of user.For example, the list information that removes that only is associated with validated user can be compiled to reduce the junk information effect.Can whether have effective log-on message, user whether to prop up based on interactive action, the user of time quantum, user and the search engine of user effort on the access search engine to pay earnest money or certain advnace money on a contract, user whether set up reputation or known in some way (for example, cross by others'evaluation), whether the user have relation (for example with search engine, as advertiser's payment relation) and/or other validated user can be different from disabled user's information, validated user is different from disabled user (for example, junk information fabricator).
In another embodiment, can compile having discerned the list information that removes that user group is associated with some.Having discerned user's group can comprise: the user in the specific geographical area (for example, the user (for example, the friend in an on-line communities such as Orkut, the contact person in an address book, the user who is associated with particular station, the user that discerned by a specific user) that the user in the U.S.), definite relation is arranged.
Can give search result document (piece 1820) with score value based on removing list information.In one embodiment, the score value of giving document to small part can be independent of any search inquiry (for example, precalculated), and at least one other parts of score value can depend on the particular search query that relates to.
The score value of giving document can be based on the function of the one or more features that are associated with document.Figure 19 is depicted as an embodiment of definite score value.As shown in figure 19, the score value of document can be based on information retrieval (IR) score value, based on the score value of link and/remove the tabulation score value.
Can determine the IR score value of document based on the matching degree of the search terms and the document content of search inquiry.Known have multiple technologies can be used for determining the IR score value for document.For example, can determine the IR score value based on the number of times that search terms occurs in document.Perhaps or in addition, the position (for example, title, content etc.) that can occur in document based on search terms or the characteristics (for example, font, size, color etc.) of search terms are determined the IR score value.Perhaps or in addition, when presenting multiple search terms, the weight of a search terms can be different with other search terms.Perhaps or in addition, when presenting multiple search terms, the degree of approximation of search terms may influence the IR score value.Those skilled in the art also understands other technology of determining the IR score value for document.
Can fetch to document based on the chain that is associated with document and determine based on the score value that links.Existing few techniques can be determined the score value based on link of document.A kind of this class technology is in the patent No.: 6,285,999, and title is described in the United States Patent (USP) of " METHOD FOR NODE RANKING IN A LINKEDDATABASE ", and its content is incorporated herein by reference.Those skilled in the art understands other and is used to the definite technology based on the score value that links of document.
Can list information determines document removes the tabulation score value based on removing of being associated with document.For example, information about the quantity of the different user that removes each document, and/or about removing each document, and the information of the quantity of the different user that the document that also specific user is removed (wherein the specific user can comprise the user that search inquiry is provided) removes can be used to determine to remove the score value of tabulation.In one embodiment, remove list information and can be used for this group or other group user (comprising this group or different) and determine score value with one group of user is associated with this group.For example, when be associated with validated user remove list information and compiled the time, remove list information and can be used to all users are determined score value to all documents.Perhaps, when be associated with user's---i.e. contact person among address book---remove list information and compiled the time, remove list information and can be used to one or more these users are determined score value.
Can with the IR score value, based on the link score value, remove the tabulation score value make up total score value of giving document with generation in some way.The score value of being given can be used for document is carried out rank (piece 1830).For example, can come based on the score value that search result document has been given it is determined and sort (for example, rank).Because the user thinks that unwanted document has removed among Search Results, remove list information has improved Search Results as a factor quality so in determining to give the score value of document, use.This can be used to improve user's search experience.
