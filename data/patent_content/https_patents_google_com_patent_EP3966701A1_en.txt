Definitions
- Various techniques have been proposed for determining relevant content items for a user, and presenting those relevant content items as suggestions to the user.
- One example is item-based collaborative filtering, in which a given content item can be presented to a user as a suggestion.
- the given content item can be presented as a suggestion based on the user having interacted with a particular content item, and based on having determined that a threshold percentage of other users who interacted with the particular content item also interacted with the given content item.
- item-based collaborative filtering techniques and/or other techniques can have one or more drawbacks. For example, such techniques can ignore an underlying intent or purpose of a user in interacting with a particular content item. This can lead to waste of computer and/or network resources in presenting a given content item that, while having a determined association with the particular content item, is inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the user in interacting with the particular content item. In other words, while such techniques can present a given content item that has content similarity with the particular content item, the given content item can be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the user in interacting with the particular content item.
- Implementations disclosed herein are directed to determining, based on a user- assembled collection of electronic content items, at least one actual purpose (also referred to herein as“intent”) for the assembled collection. Those implementations are further directed to selecting an additional electronic content item based on the at least one actual purpose being assigned to the additional electronic content item in an electronic database. Those
- implementations are yet further directed to, responsive to the selecting, causing a suggestion for the additional electronic content item to be rendered at a client device associated with a user account that is assigned to the user-assembled collection.
- Electronic content items can include, for example, images, webpages, selected subset(s) of webpages (e.g ., snippet(s) of text, image(s)), portable document format (PDF) documents, word processing documents, videos, audio files, and/or other discrete electronic content items.
- PDF portable document format
- an electronic content item of the collection can be added to the collection responsive to one or more user interface inputs that explicitly request the electronic content item be added to the collection. For example, when viewing an electronic content item a user can long-press, right-click, or select a toolbar button to be presented with a menu that includes an option to add the electronic content item to a collection.
- the menu (or other interface) enables the user to select, from a plurality of available collections, a particular collection to which to add the electronic content item (or to define a new collection, and optionally a name for the new collection).
- user interface input(s) can request an electronic content item be added to a collection, without specifying the particular collection to which to add the electronic content item.
- a plurality of electronic content items can be automatically added to a particular collection, without user interface input(s) explicitly specifying the particular collection (e.g., rather, just specifying a request to add to any collection).
- a plurality of electronic content items can be automatically added to a particular collection based on requests for those electronic content items being received in close temporal proximity to one another (e.g, within five minutes or other threshold) and/or based on the electronic content item(s) sharing one or more corresponding purpose(s).
- corresponding candidate purpose(s) (and optionally corresponding measures) for each of the electronic content items of the collection are considered.
- the first electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, and C, with corresponding probability measures of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.1.
- the second electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, D, and E with corresponding probability measures of 0.3, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.2.
- the third electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, and F with corresponding probability measures of 0.33, 0.33, and 0.33.
- the fourth electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A and C, with corresponding probability measures of 0.5 and 0.5.
- candidate purpose A can be determined to be an actual purpose for the collection. This can be based on, for example, candidate purpose A being a
- corresponding purpose for each of the electronic content items of the collection and/or based on its corresponding probability measure for each of the electronic content items. For example, based on each of the corresponding probability measures for candidate purpose A satisfying a threshold and/or based on an average or other combination of the corresponding probability measures satisfying a threshold. Contrast this with an alternate example with the same first, second, and third electronic content items, but with a different fourth electronic content item.
- the different fourth electronic content item in the collection in the alternate example can have candidate purposes of B and C (instead of A and C), with corresponding probability measures of 0.5 and 0.5.
- candidate purpose B can instead be determined to be an actual purpose for the collection.
- different actual purposes are determined for the collection in the alternate examples - as a result of the different fourth electronic content item in the two examples.
- an additional electronic content item in response to determining candidate purpose A is an actual purpose for the collection, can be selected.
- the additional electronic content item can be selected, from a corpus of additional electronic content items, based on the candidate purpose A being assigned to the additional electronic content item (optionally with a threshold probability measure or other measure) in an electronic database.
- various additional electronic content items can be filtered from the selection based on those lacking any assignment to candidate purpose A and/or lacking at least a threshold measure for an assignment to candidate purpose A. This can make the selecting more resource efficient through reduction of the quantity of additional content items considered.
- One or more other factors can also be considered in selecting the additional electronic content item, such as overall popularity of the additional electronic content item, a collaborative filtering relationship of the additional electronic content item to electronic content item(s) of the collection, and/or other factor(s).
- a suggestion for the additional electronic content item can be caused to be rendered at a client device associated with a user account assigned to the collection.
- the suggestion can include all or portions of (e.g ., a snippet of) the additional content item.
- the suggestion is selectable to cause the additional electronic content item to be rendered (in its entirety) at the client device and/or to cause the additional electronic content item to be added to the collection.
- the suggestion can be presented with a descriptor that indicates the suggestion is being rendered based on relation of the suggestion to the determined actual purpose.
- the descriptor can be“Being shown since this and your collection both relate to purpose A”.
- the descriptor, or a related descriptor element can be selectable to enable the user to confirm the determined purpose of the collection and/or to define an alternate candidate purpose.
- a related descriptor element can be provided that includes a“confirmation” element that, when selected, confirms the determined purpose of the collection and/or can include an“adjust” element that, when selected, presents the user with one or more of the other considered candidate purposes.
- the descriptor can provide a corresponding user with insight as to why the suggestion was selected and/or as to the inferred actual purpose for the collection. Further, the descriptor or associated element can be selected to alter the inferred actual purpose when it is inconsistent with the user’s intent. Yet further, the descriptor or associated element can additionally or alternatively be selected to confirm the actual purpose, which can result in an increase in a quantity of additional suggestions relevant to the actual purpose that are provided, and/or can result in explicitly automatically modifying a title or metadata of the collection to reflect the actual purpose (obviating user input to do so).
- the additional electronic content item can be selected in lieu of an alternate additional electronic content item that might have a strong correlation, via collaborative filtering and/or other prior techniques, to electronic content item(s) of the collection. This can be due to the candidate purpose A not being assigned to the alternate additional content item, or not being assigned to the alternate additional content item with at least a threshold measure.
- the alternate additional electronic content item can be actively filtered out from the selection based on lacking any defined assignment to candidate purpose A.
- the alternate candidate electronic content item may be one that is frequently interacted with following interaction with one or more of the electronic content items of the collection, it can be prevented from being presented, according to implementations disclosed herein, based on it lacking assignment to an actual purpose of the collection.
- suggestions for electronic content item(s) that are not related to the actual purpose are prevented from being wastefully generated (e.g, at a server), transmitted (e.g, from a server to the client device), rendered (e.g, at the client device), and/or interacted with (e.g, at the client device). This directly leads to conserving server-side resources, client-side resources, and/or network resources.
- generating suggestions for additional electronic content items can reduce a quantity of user interface inputs required by a corresponding user to interact with additional content that conforms to the purpose of the collection.
- a suggestion for an additional content item can be generated and proactively presented or“pushed” to the user proactively, e.g, as a notification“card” or“tile”, and quickly interacted with by a user to quickly view the additional content item and/or quickly add the additional content item to the collection. This can be more user input efficient than, for example, the user instead issuing multiple searches and/or browsing to identify the additional content item.
- a determined purpose of a collection can be utilized in other technique(s) in addition to or instead of using the determined purpose in generating suggestions that are “pushed” proactively for presentation at a client device.
- determined purpose(s) for collect! on(s) of a user account can be persisted in memory (e.g, at one or more client devices associated with the user account and/or in the cloud) for future use.
- the future use can include, for example, use in ranking search results responsive to user submitted search queries (e.g ., to bias toward search result(s) assigned the purpose(s)), use in ranking autocomplete suggestions for partial user queries (e.g., to bias toward autocomplete suggestions assigned to the purpose(s)), and/or other user(s). This can result in relevant search result(s) and/or autocomplete suggestion(s) being presented more prominently, leading to quicker user selection and decreasing a duration of user interaction to identify the search result(s) and/or autocomplete suggestion(s).
- purpose(s) determined based on user-assembled collection(s) can be more indicative of the user’s interest than purpose(s) determined based on electronic content item(s) that are merely viewed or otherwise interacted with by the user in isolation, without assigning those electronic content item(s) to a collection.
- an electronic content item has multiple candidate purposes and is interacted with without being assigned as part of a collection, the actual purpose of the user for interacting with the electronic content item may not be resolvable.
- implementations disclosed herein leverage user- assembled collections to determine purpose(s) that are highly likely to be relevant to a user, enabling tailoring of further provided content to those purpose(s) and improving the user experience.
- a“candidate purpose” or“candidate intent” of an electronic content item defines one or more global actions to which the electronic content item can relate.
- candidate purposes can include“resetting a tripped circuit breaker”,“installing a new circuit breaker”, and“installing a new electrical panel”.
- candidate purposes can include“wedding planning”,“prom planning”,“attending a charitable event”, and“attending the Kentucky Derby”.
- candidate purpose(s) of an electronic content item can be determined based at least in part on entities, terms, and/or other content included in the electronic content item
- the candidate purpose(s) are not themselves descriptors of the content included in the electronic content item and are not descriptors of classification(s) of the content included in the electronic content item. Rather, each candidate purpose defines higher-level (global) action(s) for which the electronic content item can be used in
- one or more candidate purposes of a content item can be mutually exclusive, relative to other candidate purposes (e.g ., a subset or all other) of the content item.
- one or more candidate purposes of a content item are not directly mentioned in content (e.g., text) of the content item.
- candidate purpose(s) for a content item can be accessed that has defined assignments of content items (and/or original sources of the content items) to corresponding purpose.
- candidate purpose(s) can be assigned, in the electronic database, to a given content item based at least in part on (or exclusively on) analysis of incoming links to the given content item (and/or similar content items), other content item(s) interacted with in close temporal proximity to interactions with the given content item (and/or similar content items), and/or based on defined relationship(s) between content of the content item (e.g, classification(s) of the content) and the candidate purpose(s).
- a candidate purpose of“wedding planning” can be assigned to a webpage related to centerpieces despite that webpage not including the term“wedding”,“wedding planning”, or any other content explicitly identifying“wedding planning”.
- the candidate purpose can be assigned to the webpage based on anchor text of incoming link(s) including“wedding”, “wedding planning” and/or other terms.
- the candidate purpose of“wedding planning” can be assigned to the webpage additionally or alternatively based on historical interactions of a plurality of users indicating a large quantify of occurrences of those users visiting“wedding planning” content before and/or after visiting the webpage, and optionally within a threshold duration of visiting the webpage.
- the candidate purpose of“wedding planning” can be assigned to the webpage based on users previously assigning the webpage to collections that are manually labeled, by the users, with an actual purpose of“wedding planning”.
- a probability measure and/or other measure assigned to a candidate purpose, for a content item can be based on a determined relevance of that candidate purpose, for the content item, relative to other candidate purposes. For example, assume a content item is associated with a candidate purpose of“wedding planning” based on anchor text of N incoming links referencing“wedding planning” and is associated with a candidate purpose of“prom planning” based on anchor text of M links referencing“prom planning” - where A and M are both integers, and N is greater thanM In such an example, the probability measure for “wedding planning” can be greater based at least in part on“wedding planning” being referenced in anchor text of a greater quantity of incoming links than is“prom planning”.
- probability measures for candidate purposes, for a content item are the same for each of a plurality of users, despite those users arriving at the content item in different manners and/or interacting with the content item in different manners.
- the probability measures can be dynamically adapted to a user in dependence on precursor action(s) in navigating to the content item and/or in dependence on interaction with the content item. For example, assume user A navigated to the content item responsive to a search that included the term“wedding” but did not include“prom” and user B navigated to the content item responsive to a search that included the term“prom” but did not include
- the measure for a“wedding planning” candidate purpose for the content item can be promoted for user A (based on inclusion of“wedding” in the search), while the measure for a“prom planning” candidate purpose for the content item can instead be promoted for user B (based on inclusion of“prom” in the search).
- the measure for a“wedding planning” candidate purpose for the content item can be promoted for user A based on inclusion of the term“wedding” in the subject of the email that included the link to the content item.
- multiple potential actual purposes can be determined for a collection, where the potential actual purposes are still a subset of all candidate purposes for the electronic content items of the collection.
- the first electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, and C, with corresponding probability measures of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.1.
- the second electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, D, and E with corresponding probability measures of 0.3, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.2.
- the third electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, and F with corresponding probability measures of 0.33, 0.33, and 0.33.
- candidate purpose A and candidate purpose B can both be determined to be potential actual purposes for the collection. This can be based on, for example, candidate purposes A and B both being a corresponding purpose for each of the electronic content items of the collection and/or based on their corresponding probability measure for each of the electronic content items. Further, in such an example, content items can be selected based on candidate purpose A and/or candidate purpose B being assigned to those content items, and suggestions presented based on such content item(s).
- some implementations seek to resolve a single actual purpose from the two or more potential purposes. In some implementations, this includes explicitly prompting the user to choose one or more of the potential purposes as actual purpose(s). In some other implementations, this includes selecting, for each of the potential purposes, a content item that is assigned to that potential purpose without being assigned to any other of the potential purposes. Further, a corresponding suggestion can be caused to be rendered for each of the content items.
- An affirmative user interface input e.g ., a selection to view and/or a selection to add to the collection directed to a given suggestion can be used to determine its assigned potential purpose is an actual purpose for the collection.
- a negative user interface input e.g., swiping away or otherwise dismissing directed to a given suggestion can be used to determine its assigned potential purpose is not an actual purpose.
- suggestions can be provided that are tailored to actual purpose(s) that are confirmed for the collection. Presenting the user with multiple suggestions, each tailored to a different potential purpose for the collection, and determining actual purpose(s) for the collection based on user interaction(s) with the suggestions, enables the user to quickly interact with at least one suggestion that is relevant to his/her purpose, while also obtaining feedback (from the user’s interaction) that enables resolution of a correct actual purpose. This can be more resource efficient and require less user inputs than, for example, separately explicitly prompting the user to choose one or more of the potential purposes as actual purpose(s).
- Various implementations can include a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing instructions executable by a processor to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described herein.
- Yet other various implementations can include a system including memory and one or more hardware processors operable to execute instructions, stored in the memory, to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described herein.

- Adding the image to a collection can include storing, in collections database 122, at least an association of a URL (or other identifier of the image) to the collection.
- all or portions of the image can additionally or alternatively be stored, in collections database 122, in association with the collection.
- a user can add an image, captured by one of the vision sensor(s) 111, to a collection.
- the image can be added by drag-and-drop (dropping into an area associated with the collection), long-pressing, right-clicking, or otherwise interacting with the image.
- a user can add a snippet of text from a webpage to a collection by copying the text and pasting it into the collection.
- a plurality of electronic content items can be automatically added to a particular collection, without user interface input(s) explicitly specifying the particular collection (e.g ., rather, just specifying a request to add to any collection).
- a plurality of electronic content items can be automatically added to a particular collection based on requests for those electronic content items being received in close temporal proximity to one another (e.g., within five minutes or other threshold) and/or based on the electronic content item(s) sharing one or more corresponding candidate purpose(s).
- Candidate purposes engine 124 can access collections database 122 to determine, for each of a plurality of collections, candidate purpose(s) for each electronic content item of the collection. In determining candidate purpose(s) for an electronic content item, the candidate purposes engine 124 can utilize candidate purposes database 126 and/or other resource.
- the candidate purposes database 126 can store associations of publicly accessible documents to corresponding candidate purposes, optionally with corresponding probability measures (or other measures) for the corresponding candidate purposes.
- the candidate purposes engine 128 can utilize the candidate purposes database 126 to determine candidate purpose(s) that are assigned to that publicly accessible document - and assign such candidate purpose(s) as the candidate purposes for the electronic content item.
- the candidate purposes database 126 can additionally or alternatively store associations of object classification(s), term(s), and/or other content to corresponding purpose(s), optionally with corresponding probability measures (or other measures) for the corresponding candidate purposes. For example, a“dress” object
- the candidate purpose(s) engine 124 can process an electronic content item can be processed to determine object classification(s) and/or term(s) included in the electronic content item. Further, the candidate purpose(s) engine 124 can access candidate purposes database 126 to determine candidate purpose(s) assigned to those object classification(s) and/or term(s) - and assign such candidate purpose(s) as the candidate purposes for the electronic content item. For instance, if the electronic content item is an image, the candidate purposes engine 124 can process the image, using one or more machine learning models, to determine classification(s) of object(s) included in the image. Further, the candidate purposes engine 124 can access candidate purposes database 126 to determine candidate purpose(s) assigned to the classification(s) (and optionally corresponding measure(s)), and assign such candidate purpose(s) (and optionally corresponding measure(s)) to the image.
- the collection purpose(s) engine 128 determines actual purpose(s) for collections. In determining an actual purpose for a user-assembled collection of electronic content items, the collection purpose(s) engine 128 can consider the corresponding candidate purpose(s) (and optionally corresponding measures) for each of the electronic content items of the collection, as determined by candidate purposes engine 124. For example, assume a collection that consists of three separate electronic content items. The first electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, and C, with corresponding probability measures of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.1. The second electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A, B, D, and E with corresponding probability measures of 0.3, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.2.
- the third electronic content item of the collection can have candidate purposes of A and C, with corresponding probability measures of 0.5 and 0.5.
- collection purpose(s) engine 128 can determine candidate purpose A to be an actual purpose for the collection. This can be based on, for example, candidate purpose A being a corresponding purpose for each of the electronic content items of the collection and/or based on its corresponding probability measure for each of the electronic content items.
- the additional content engine 132 selects, for a given user account, additional content item(s) based on actual purpose(s) determined (by collection purpose(s) engine 128) for collection(s) of the user account. For example, the additional content engine 132 can select, form a corpus 134 of available electronic content items, an additional electronic content item based on a determined actual purpose of a collection being assigned to the additional electronic content item (optionally with a threshold probability measure or other measure) in an electronic database (e.g ., candidate purposes database 126).
- the additional electronic content item can be, for example, a webpage, an audio file, an image, a video, and/or other content item.
- the corpus 134 can include, for example, various publicly accessible documents.
- additional content engine 132 filters various additional electronic content items from the selection based on those lacking any assignment to determined actual purpose(s) of collection(s) of the user account, and/or lacking at least a threshold measure for an assignment to the actual purpose(s).
- Additional content engine 132 can optionally utilize one or more other factors in selecting additional electronic content items, such as overall popularity of the additional electronic content items, a collaborative filtering relationship of the additional electronic content items to electronic content item(s) of the collection(s), and/or other factor(s).
- the suggestion engine 136 generates suggestions based on additional content items selected by the additional content engine 132. Further, the suggestion engine 136 can transmit the suggestions to the client device 110 to cause them to be rendered via one or more of the application(s) 114 of the client device 110. In some implementations or situations, the suggestion engine 136 pushes the suggestion proactively to the client device 110. This pushing can optionally be responsive to an access, via the client device 110, of a corresponding collection and/or responsive to other parameter-free inputs at the client device 110.
- a suggestion generated by the suggestion engine 136 can include all or portions of ( e.g ., a snippet of) the additional content item.
- a suggestion generated by the suggestion engine 136 can include selectable element(s).
- the suggestion can include a selectable element that, when selected, causes the additional electronic content item to be rendered (in its entirety) at the client device 110.
- the suggestion can additionally or alternatively include a selectable element that, when selected, causes the additional electronic content item to be added to the collection with which the suggestion is associated (i.e., the collection with the determined actual purpose based on which the suggestion was generated).
- the suggestion engine 136 includes, as part of the suggestion, a descriptor that indicates the suggestion is being rendered based on relation of the suggestion to a corresponding determined actual purpose of a collection.
- the descriptor, or a related descriptor element can be selectable to enable the user to confirm the determined actual purpose of the collection and/or to define an alternate actual purpose.
- the collection purpose(s) engine 128 determines multiple potential actual purposes for a collection.
- the determined potential actual purposes can optionally still be a subset of all candidate purposes for the electronic content items of the collection.
- additional content engine 132 selects, for each of the potential purposes, a content item that is assigned to that potential purpose without being assigned to any other of the potential purposes (or being assigned with a measure that fails to satisfy a threshold).
- the suggestion engine 128 generates a corresponding suggestion for each of the content items, and causes all of the suggestions to be rendered at the client device 110 (optionally simultaneously).
- suggestion engine 136 and/or other engine can monitor user interface input(s) directed to the presented suggestions, and use the user interface input(s) to resolve a single actual purpose for the collection.
- This resolved single actual purpose can be conveyed to collections engine 120 to enable explicitly assigning ( e.g ., in a title and/or in other metadata) that actual purpose to the collection in the collections database 122.
- the resolved single actual purpose can be conveyed to the collection purpose(s) engine 128 and/or additional content engine 132 so that actual purpose is thereafter utilized for the collection in determining additional electronic content items.
- an affirmative user interface input directed to a given suggestion can be used to determine its corresponding potential actual purpose is an actual purpose for the collection and/or a negative user interface input directed to a given suggestion can be used to determine its corresponding potential actual purpose is not an actual purpose.
- Additional system(s) 140 are also illustrated in FIG. 1 A in communication with at least collection purposes engine 128.
- the additional system(s) 140 can include, for example, a search system, an autocomplete suggestion system, and/or other systems. In some
- the collection purpose(s) engine 128 can provide the additional system(s) 140 with determined actual purpose(s) for a user account.
- the additional system(s) 140 can then utilize the actual purpose(s) in tailoring information provided to client device(s) associated with the user account (e.g., responsive to requests from those client device(s)).
- FIG. IB an example process flow is illustrated that demonstrates some implementations of how various components of FIG. 1A can interact.
- client device 110 interacts with collections engine 120 to add electronic content items for collection 201, to a collection of the collections database 122.
- the collection can be associated, in the collections database 122, with a user account of the client device 110, and can be access- restricted to that user account.
- the candidate purposes engine 124 can access collections database 122 to determine, for the collection, candidate purpose(s) for each electronic content item of the collection 203. In determining the candidate purpose(s) for the electronic content items of the collection, the candidate purposes engine 124 can utilize candidate purposes database 126 and/or other resource(s).
- the collection purpose(s) engine 128 analyzes the candidate purposes for the collection 203, to determine one or more actual purposes for the collection 205. For example, the collection purpose(s) engine 128 can determine a single actual purpose, or multiple potential actual purposes. The actual purpose(s) for the collection 205 can be provided to additional content engine 132 and/or to additional system(s) 140.
- the additional content engine 132 selects, from corpus and based on the actual purpose(s) for the collection 205, one or more additional content items 207. For example, the additional content engine 132 can select an additional content item based on at least one of the actual purpose(s) being assigned to the additional content item.
- the additional content item(s) 207 are provided to the suggestion engine 136, which generates suggestion(s) 209 based on the additional content item(s) 207.
- the suggestion(s) 209 are transmitted to the client device 110 for graphical and/or audible rendering by the client device 110.
- user interaction(s) with the suggestion(s) 209 can be transmitted to the collections engine 120.
- the user interaction(s) can include user interface input(s) to add the additional content item of a suggestion to the collection, which can be transmitted to the collections engine 120 to add the additional content item to the collection in the collections database 122.
- the suggestion(s) can include a first suggestion tailored to a first potential actual purpose and a second suggestion tailored to a second potential actual purpose
- the interaction(s) can be user interface input(s) that affirm the first suggestion and/or dismiss the second suggestion.
- Such interaction(s) can be conveyed to the collection purpose(s) engine 128 to enable the collection purpose(s) engine 128 to correspondingly adjust the potential actual purposes for the collection.
