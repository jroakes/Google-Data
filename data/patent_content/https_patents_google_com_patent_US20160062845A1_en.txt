- the image metadata system 202 can be configured to determine that respective digital image files correspond to one another by detecting particular coincident components of image metadata between the digital image files (or particular combinations of coincident image metadata components). For example, the image metadata system 202 can recognize that images corresponding to respective digital image files were taken at approximately the same time and place by comparing the data provided in the Date/Time Stamp data fields and the Geo Location data fields. In some examples, the image metadata system 202 can reference a threshold amount of time to determine whether the corresponding images are deemed to have been taken at approximately the same time.
- the image metadata system 202 can determine that images taken within the threshold amount of time (e.g., X minutes, where X can be any positive number) of each other are close enough in time that the images might be related to one another. For example, a difference between a first time/date stamp associated with a first image and a second time/date stamp associated with a second image can be determined. If the difference is less than or equal to the threshold amount of time, the first and second images can be deemed to have been taken at approximately the same time. If the difference is greater than the threshold amount of time, the first and second images can be deemed to have not been taken at approximately the same time. Similarly, in some examples, the image metadata system 202 can reference a threshold distance to determine whether the corresponding images are deemed to have been taken at approximately the same location.
- the threshold amount of time e.g., X minutes, where X can be any positive number
- the image metadata system 202 can determine that the first and second digital image files 206 a , 206 b are related to one another by comparing data provided in the Date/Time Stamp data fields 214 a , 214 b and the Tags data fields 220 a , 220 b . More specifically, the image metadata system 202 can recognize that the corresponding images of the first and second digital image files 206 a , 206 b were taken at approximately the same time and include one or more identical entities tagged therein. Based on this recognition, the image metadata system 202 can infer that the images were taken at the same location.
- the Geo Location data field 218 a of the first image metadata 208 a can be determined to be a null data field.
- the Geo Location data field 218 a can be absent of data or include data that is incomplete, corrupted or non-compliant. Consequently, the image metadata system 202 can populate or replace the null Geo Location data field 218 a of the first image metadata 208 a with information from the Geo Location data field 218 b of the second image metadata 208 b.
- the image metadata system 202 can be configured to infer that digital image files with the same Device ID identified in metadata are deemed to have the same owner.
- the image metadata system 202 can also be configured to infer that the corresponding images of digital image files with similar titles are deemed to have been taken on the same date (for example, a title of a first image file can be provided as “Timmy's Birthday Party 08′—Timmy and Grandma” and a second image file can be entitled “Timmy's Birthday Party 08′—Timmy and Dad”).
- Other suitable metadata data fields and/or combinations of such data fields can also be used to determine whether digital image files correspond to one another.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 500 for cross-referencing image metadata.
- the process 500 can be provided in one or more computer programs executed using one or more computing devices (e.g., the server device 112 of FIG. 1 ).
- Counters n and x are each set equal to 1 ( 502 ).
- Image metadata for image n is accessed ( 504 ). It is determined whether one or more data fields of the image metadata for image n include a null data field ( 506 ). If it is determined that one or more data fields of the image metadata for image n do not include a null data field, it is determined whether n is equal to n TOTAL ( 508 ).
- n TOTAL can be the total number of image files in a set of image files being processed using the process 500 . If n is equal to n TOTAL , the process 500 ends. If n is not equal to n TOTAL , the counter n is incremented ( 510 ) and the process loops back.
- image metadata for image n+x is accessed ( 512 ). It is determined whether image n and image n+x correspond to one another (514). In some examples, metadata of the images can be compared and, if there is sufficient overlap in the metadata, the images can be determined to correspond to one another. If image n and image n+x correspond to one another, one or more null data fields of image n are cross-referenced with metadata from corresponding image data fields of image n+x ( 516 ), and it is determined whether n is equal to n TOTAL ( 508 ).
- n+x is equal to n TOTAL ( 518 ). If image n and image n+x do not correspond to one another, it is determined whether n+x is equal to n TOTAL ( 518 ). If n+x is equal to n TOTAL , the process 500 ends. If n+x is not equal to n TOTAL , the counter x is incremented ( 520 ) and the process 500 loops back to access image metadata for image n+x ( 512 ).

Description
- This specification generally relates to populating image metadata by cross-referencing other images.
- People take photographs (photos) to document events and to keep memories. People often share the photos with friends and family. In recent years, digital photography has become more mainstream. Using digital photography, a photographer can capture a photograph and store the photograph as a digital image having a digital image file.

- The present disclosure is directed to systems and techniques for populating image metadata of one digital image file by cross-referencing the digital image file with other digital image files. In some examples, image metadata associated with a first image is accessed. The image metadata can include information appended to a digital image file that describes one or more aspects of the digital image. In some examples, the first image metadata can be organized in a plurality of data fields. In some implementations, it can be determined that at least one image data field included in the first image metadata is a null data field. In response, image metadata corresponding to a second image can be accessed. For example, it can be determined that the second image is corresponds to the first image. Null data fields of the first image metadata can be populated and/or replaced with data from the second image metadata.
- Image metadata provides information that supplements the primary content of digital image files. For example, image metadata can include information describing how large the image is, the color depth and resolution of the image, where the image was taken (e.g., geo-location data), the owner of the image, and/or the device that generated the image. Other types of image metadata can include, for example, titles or keywords describing the image and/or tags of people or items depicted in the digital image. This information can be used to organize and search large libraries of digital images. In some instances, however, a data field of the image metadata can be considered a null data field. As used herein, a null data field can include a data field in which data is incomplete, corrupted, non-compliant, or non-existent. For example, information in a data field can be left incomplete when the device generating the image is not equipped to provide the information for the particular data field. As another example, data can be stripped from a data field or corrupted during file uploads and/or transfers. In some examples, non-compliant data can include data that does not comply with a format expected for the particular data field.

FIG. 1 depicts anexample system 100 that can be used in implementations of the present disclosure. Theexample system 100 includes a plurality of client computing devices 102-110, each of the computing devices being associated with one of users 120 a-120 e. Thesystem 100 also includes anetwork 114, and acomputing system 112. The computing devices 102-110 and thecomputing system 112 can communicate with each other through thenetwork 114. Thecomputing system 112 can include one or more computing devices 116 (e.g., one or more servers) and one or more computer-readable storage devices 118 (e.g., one or more databases). - Each of computing devices 102-110 can represent various forms of processing devices. Example processing devices can include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a network appliance, a camera, a smart phone, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any these data processing devices or other data processing devices. The computing devices 102-110 and 116 can be provided access to and/or receive application software executed and/or stored on any of the other computing systems 102-110 and 116. The
computing device 116 can represent various forms of servers including, but not limited to a web server, an application server, a proxy server, a network server, or a server farm. In some examples, thecomputing device 116 performs functions of a social network server. - In some implementations, the computing devices can communicate wirelessly through a communication interface (not shown), which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. The communication interface can provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) voice calls, Short Message Service (SMS), Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS), or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messaging, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), CDMA2000, or General Packet Radio System (GPRS), among others. For example, the communication may occur through a radio-frequency transceiver (not shown). In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver.
- In some implementations, the
system 100 can be a distributed client/server system that spans one or more networks such as thenetwork 114. Thenetwork 114 can be a large computer network, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a cellular network, or a combination thereof connecting any number of mobile clients, fixed clients, and servers. In some implementations, each client (e.g., computing devices 102-110) can communicate with servers (e.g., computing device 116) via a virtual private network (VPN), Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel, or other secure network connection. In some implementations, thenetwork 114 can further include a corporate network (e.g., intranet) and one or more wireless access points. -
FIG. 2 depicts anexample environment 200 for image cross-referencing. Theexample environment 200 includes animage metadata system 202. Theimage metadata system 202 can be implemented, for example, using one or more computing systems (e.g., thecomputing system 112 ofFIG. 1 ). By way of a non-limiting example, auser 201 takes a first photo with afirst device 204 a (e.g., a hand-held digital camera) and a second photo with asecond device 204 b (e.g., a smart phone). Theuser 201 uploads both a firstdigital image file 206 a corresponding to the first photo and a seconddigital image file 206 b corresponding to the second photo to the computing system 112 (e.g., by communicating with thecomputing system 112 through thenetwork 114 ofFIG. 1 ). For example, as shown, the firstdigital image file 206 a can be transferred from thedigital camera 204 a to asuitable computing device 205. Thecomputing device 205 can be used to upload the firstdigital image file 206 a to thecomputing system 112. In this example, the second digital image can be uploaded to thecomputing system 112 directly from thesmart phone 204 b over a network. - The first and second digital image files 206 a and 206 b can include
respective image metadata image metadata system 202 can access thefirst image metadata 208 a and recognize that a data field of the image metadata is a null data field. For instance, thefirst image metadata 208 a might not include location information (e.g., geo-location data indicating where the image was generated). Consequently, a location data field of thefirst image metadata 208 a can be determined to be a null data field. Theimage metadata system 202 can accesses thesecond image metadata 208 b and complete thefirst metadata 208 a by cross-referencing with thesecond metadata 208 b. - While the non-limiting example described above accurately describes one or more aspects of the present disclosure, it should be noted that other implementations are also envisioned. For example, the image files 206 a, 206 b can both come from the same user (e.g., the user 201), or can come from respective users (e.g., the
user 201 and another user). Thedevices image metadata system 202 can be implemented on an individual computing device. For example, a user can upload digital image files to a personal computer implementing theimage metadata system 202. - In some implementations, the
image metadata system 202 can be provided in the context of a social networking service. For example, users can upload digital image files to a webpage (e.g., a profile page) hosted by the social networking service. A computing system associated with the social networking service (e.g., a social networking server) can access the uploaded digital image files to determine whether any data fields in the appended metadata files are empty. For example, the social networking server can check the webpage for recently uploaded image files randomly or at predetermined time intervals. Upon recognition of metadata null data field, the social networking server can initiate a search for other related image files with metadata for cross-referencing. In some implementations, the search can be exhaustive. For example, the social networking server can access image files included in the social networking corpus to identify appropriate image files for cross-referencing. In some implementations, the search can be limited. For example, the social networking server can adhere to a prescribed search radius by only accessing image files of users that are linked to the user's profile page (e.g., profile pages assigned to members of the social network that are socially related to the user). Other suitable search routines and methods can also be used. Generally, members of the social networking service can be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information relating to the user's social graph and/or metadata appended to uploaded personal photos). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. -
FIG. 3 depicts an example architecture of the firstdigital image file 206 a ofFIG. 2 . As shown, the firstdigital image file 206 a can include first image data 210 and thefirst image metadata 208 a. Thefirst image data 210 a can include information for rendering the captured image (i.e., the content of the image). For example, thefirst image data 210 a can include data (e.g., pixel and/or vector data) for providing a numeric representation of the image. This data can be organized, stored, or compressed according to an appropriate 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional graphic file format (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, RAW, and GIF). - The
first image metadata 208 a includes information that describes one or more aspects of thefirst image file 206 a. For instance, in this example, the first image metadata includes data fields 212 a-2XXa. As shown, data fields 212 a-2XXa include fields for a Title, Date/Time Stamp, Access Constraints, Geo Location (e.g., Geo-Code), Tags, Owner, and Device Identification (ID), respectively. TheTitle data field 212 a can include a user-provided title for the image or appropriate keywords for identifying the corresponding image. The Date/Time Stamp data field 214 a can include information describing when the corresponding image was generated. The Access Constraints data field 216 a can include information relating to privacy restrictions and/or viewing rights pertaining to the corresponding image. The Geo Location data field 218 a can include information describing where the corresponding image was generated. TheTags data field 220 a can include information identifying particular entities or objects (e.g., an identifiable building, statue, or monument) that are visible in the corresponding photo. The Owner data field 222 a can include information identifying the owner or creator of the digital image file. The Device ID data field 2XXa can include information identifying the device used to generate the digital image file. Other suitable data fields, for example, Ratings, Copyright Descriptions, Notes, and/or Image Orientation data fields can also be included. - In some implementations, data fields 212 a-2XXa can be provided according to one or more metadata standards, for example, Dublin Core, Exif, XMP, Picture Licensing Universal System (PLUS), IPTC Core & Extension, and/or IPTC-IIM. In some implementations, the first image metadata can include data fields from a plurality of metadata schemas. For example, the Geo Location data field 218 a can be provided as part of the Exif schema, and the
Title data field 212 a can be provided as part of the XMP schema. -
FIG. 4 illustrates a cross-referencing operation between the first and second digital image files 206 a, 206 b ofFIG. 2 . The cross-referencing operation can be executed by an appropriate system (e.g., image metadata system 202). In some implementations, the cross-referencing operation can include determining that the first and second digital image files 206 a, 206 b correspond to one another, and cross-referencing null data fields from one of the first andsecond image metadata second image metadata second image metadata second image metadata second image metadata second image metadata - In some implementations, the
image metadata system 202 can be configured to determine that respective digital image files correspond to one another by detecting particular coincident components of image metadata between the digital image files (or particular combinations of coincident image metadata components). For example, theimage metadata system 202 can recognize that images corresponding to respective digital image files were taken at approximately the same time and place by comparing the data provided in the Date/Time Stamp data fields and the Geo Location data fields. In some examples, theimage metadata system 202 can reference a threshold amount of time to determine whether the corresponding images are deemed to have been taken at approximately the same time. For example, theimage metadata system 202 can determine that images taken within the threshold amount of time (e.g., X minutes, where X can be any positive number) of each other are close enough in time that the images might be related to one another. For example, a difference between a first time/date stamp associated with a first image and a second time/date stamp associated with a second image can be determined. If the difference is less than or equal to the threshold amount of time, the first and second images can be deemed to have been taken at approximately the same time. If the difference is greater than the threshold amount of time, the first and second images can be deemed to have not been taken at approximately the same time. Similarly, in some examples, theimage metadata system 202 can reference a threshold distance to determine whether the corresponding images are deemed to have been taken at approximately the same location. - In the example illustrated by
FIG. 4 , theimage metadata system 202 can determine that the first and second digital image files 206 a, 206 b are related to one another by comparing data provided in the Date/Time Stamp data fields 214 a, 214 b and the Tags data fields 220 a, 220 b. More specifically, theimage metadata system 202 can recognize that the corresponding images of the first and second digital image files 206 a, 206 b were taken at approximately the same time and include one or more identical entities tagged therein. Based on this recognition, theimage metadata system 202 can infer that the images were taken at the same location. In the depicted example, the Geo Location data field 218 a of thefirst image metadata 208 a can be determined to be a null data field. In some examples, the Geo Location data field 218 a can be absent of data or include data that is incomplete, corrupted or non-compliant. Consequently, theimage metadata system 202 can populate or replace the null Geo Location data field 218 a of thefirst image metadata 208 a with information from the GeoLocation data field 218 b of thesecond image metadata 208 b. - While the above non-limiting example describes one or more aspects of the present disclosure, further implementations are also envisioned. For example, other types of data fields can be compared to determine whether respective digital image files correspond to one another. For example, the
image metadata system 202 can be configured to infer that digital image files with the same Device ID identified in metadata are deemed to have the same owner. Theimage metadata system 202 can also be configured to infer that the corresponding images of digital image files with similar titles are deemed to have been taken on the same date (for example, a title of a first image file can be provided as “Timmy's Birthday Party 08′—Timmy and Grandma” and a second image file can be entitled “Timmy's Birthday Party 08′—Timmy and Dad”). Other suitable metadata data fields and/or combinations of such data fields can also be used to determine whether digital image files correspond to one another. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating anexample process 500 for cross-referencing image metadata. Theprocess 500 can be provided in one or more computer programs executed using one or more computing devices (e.g., theserver device 112 ofFIG. 1 ). Counters n and x are each set equal to 1 (502). Image metadata for image n is accessed (504). It is determined whether one or more data fields of the image metadata for image n include a null data field (506). If it is determined that one or more data fields of the image metadata for image n do not include a null data field, it is determined whether n is equal to nTOTAL (508). nTOTAL can be the total number of image files in a set of image files being processed using theprocess 500. If n is equal to nTOTAL, theprocess 500 ends. If n is not equal to nTOTAL, the counter n is incremented (510) and the process loops back. - If it is determined that one or more data fields of the image metadata for image n include a null data field, image metadata for image n+x is accessed (512). It is determined whether image n and image n+x correspond to one another (514). In some examples, metadata of the images can be compared and, if there is sufficient overlap in the metadata, the images can be determined to correspond to one another. If image n and image n+x correspond to one another, one or more null data fields of image n are cross-referenced with metadata from corresponding image data fields of image n+x (516), and it is determined whether n is equal to nTOTAL (508). If image n and image n+x do not correspond to one another, it is determined whether n+x is equal to nTOTAL (518). If n+x is equal to nTOTAL, the
process 500 ends. If n+x is not equal to nTOTAL, the counter x is incremented (520) and theprocess 500 loops back to access image metadata for image n+x (512). - Implementations of the present disclosure and all of the functional operations provided herein can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
