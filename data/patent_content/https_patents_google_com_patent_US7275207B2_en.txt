Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of information processing by digital computers, and more particularly to a method and system in an electronic multi-dimensional spreadsheet, for displaying and/or hiding elements of a range of cells, like rows, or columns, or sheets, according to display attributes of cells within the elements.
- spreadsheets With the advent of microcomputers, a solution was forthcoming in the form of “electronic spreadsheets.” Better known simply as “spreadsheets,” these software programs provide a computerized replacement for the traditional financial modeling tools: the accountant's columnar pad, pencil, and calculator. In some regards, spreadsheet programs are to those tools what word processors are to typewriters. Spreadsheets offer dramatic improvements in ease of creating, editing, and using financial models.
- a typical spreadsheet program configures the memory of a computer to resemble the column/row or grid format of an accountant's columnar pad, thus providing a visible calculator for a user. Because this “pad” exists dynamically in the computer's memory, however, it differs from paper pads in several important ways. Locations in the electronic spreadsheet, for example, must be communicated to the computer in a format which it can understand. A common scheme for accomplishing this is to assign a number to each row in a spreadsheet, and a letter to each column. To reference a location at column A and row 1 (i.e., the upper-left hand corner), for example, the user types in “A 1 ”. In this manner, the spreadsheet defines an addressable storage location or “cell” at each intersection of a row with a column.
- Electronic spreadsheets offer many advantages over their paper counterparts. For one, electronic spreadsheets are much larger (i.e., hold more information) than their paper counterparts; electronic spreadsheets having thousands or even millions of cells are not uncommon.
- Spreadsheet programs also allow users to perform “what-if” scenarios. After a set of computational relationships has been entered into a worksheet, thanks to imbedded formulas and/or built-in functions for instance, the spread of information can be recalculated using different sets of assumptions, with the results of each recalculation appearing almost instantaneously. Performing this operation manually, with paper and pencil, would require recalculating every relationship in the model with each change made.
- electronic spreadsheet systems were invented to solve “what-if” problems, that is, changing an input and seeing what happens to, an output.
- a typical, common, and valuable example of data organized into columns and rows is a table or a range of cells. Ranges of cells therefore are quite useful objects.
- a range of cells or a table can be defined and processed as a whole entity. For example it can be copied from one place to another within a single spreadsheet file or from one spreadsheet file to another spreadsheet file.
- the embodiment of the invention offers a user-friendly solution to the same requirements, while getting rid of the limitations previously identified.
- the present invention is based on a new feature, referred to as the Synthetic Focus Manager (SFM for short) which allows to easily define and control the display or hiding to the spreadsheet user, of elements (rows/columns/sheets) of a range of cells or table.
- SFM Synthetic Focus Manager
- the present invention offers the possibility to copy and paste the visible part of a range of cells managed by the SFM.
- this operation cannot be done because any hidden row or column within a given range of cells is still treated like a visible element by the copy-and-paste method.
- the “Copy visible part” function only a Copy/Paste by Value is performed.
- the SFM is aware of the display focus level that is currently selected. Therefore, the SFM can determine the elements that the spreadsheet user wishes to copy-and-paste onto a given destination range of cells. Specific attention is given to the way the paste operation is performed to keep as much information as possible, including formula defined relationships, while avoiding building a range of cells with unresolved references.
- the present invention is directed to a method, system and program for displaying and/or hiding, in an electronic multi-dimensional spreadsheet on a user interface, elements of a range of cells, a range of cells comprising one or a plurality of contiguous elements aligned along a given spreadsheet dimension, an element of a range of cells comprising one or a plurality of cells along one or a plurality of spreadsheet dimensions.
- an electronic multidimensional spreadsheet comprising a plurality of cells identified by a cell address along each dimension, a method for displaying and/or hiding on a user interface, elements of a range of cells, the range of cells comprising one or a plurality of contiguous elements aligned along a given spreadsheet dimension, an element comprising one or a plurality of cells
- the method comprises:(A) detecting a command for hiding at least one element in a selected range of cells, the command comprising means for identifying the selected range of cells and means for identifying a display focus level selected among a plurality of ordered display focus levels defined for the selected range of cells; (B) identifying the selected range of cells comprising the element; (C) identifying the selected display focus level; (D) identifying a table associated with the selected range of cells, the table associating each defined display focus level with at least one cell attribute; and (E) selectively displaying the element on the user interface based on the relationship of the selected display focus level with the display focus level associated
- the (E) comprises: (E1) selecting a predefined cell in the element; (E2) identifying the cell attributes assigned to the selected predefined cell; (E3) identifying the display focus level associated with the identified cell attribute; (E4) associating the identified display focus level with the element; and (E5) comparing the display focus level associated with the element with the selected display focus level.
- (E) further comprises either hiding the element on the user interface, if the associated display focus level is lower than the selected display focus level, or, displaying the element on the user interface, if the associated display focus level is at least equal to the selected display focus level.
- a computer program product for use with a computer system capable of displaying an electronic multidimensional spreadsheet with a user interface
- the computer program product comprising a computer useable medium having embodied therein program code comprising: (A) program code for detecting a command for hiding at least one element in a selected range of cells, the command comprising means for identifying the selected range of cells and means for identifying a display focus level selected among a plurality of ordered display focus levels defined for the selected range of cells; (B) program code for identifying the selected range of cells comprising the element; (C) program code for identifying the selected display focus level; (D) program code for identifying a table associated with the selected range of cells, the table associating each defined display focus level with at least one cell attribute; and (E) program code for selectively displaying the element on the user interface based on the relationship of the selected display focus level with the display focus level associated with the element.
- an apparatus for use with a computer system capable of displaying an electronic multidimensional spreadsheet on a user interface comprises: (A) program logic for detecting a command for hiding at least one element in a selected range of cells, the command comprising means for identifying the selected range of cells and means for identifying a display focus level selected among a plurality of ordered display focus levels defined for the selected range of cells; (B) program logic for identifying the selected range of cells comprising the element; (C) program logic for identifying the selected display focus level; (D) program logic for identifying a table associated with the selected range of cells, the table associating each defined display focus level with at least one cell attribute; and (E) program logic for selectively displaying the element on the user interface based on the relationship of the selected display focus level with the display focus level associated with the element.

- the disclosures of each are hereby incorporated by reference.
- the spreadsheet notebook or workbook of the present invention includes a notebook workspace 200 for receiving, processing, and presenting information, including alphanumeric as well as graphic information.
- notebook workspace 200 includes a menu bar 210 , a toolbar 220 , a current cell indicator 230 , an input line 231 , a status line 240 , and a notebook window 250 .
- the menu bar 210 displays and invokes, in response to user inputs, a main level of user commands. Menu 210 also invokes additional pull down menus, as is known in windowing applications.
- Input line 231 accepts user commands and information for the entry and editing of cell contents, which may include data, formulas, macros, and the like.
- Indicator 230 displays an address for the current cursor (i.e., active cell) position, or the address or name of a selected named range (i.e. active selection).
- system 100 displays information about the current state of the workbook; for example, a “READY” indicator means that the system is ready for the user to select another task to be performed.
- the toolbar 220 shown in further detail in FIG. 2B , comprises a row or palette of tools which provide a quick way for the user to choose commonly-used menu commands or properties.
- toolbar 220 includes file manipulation buttons 221 , printing buttons 222 , an undo button 223 , cut, copy, and paste buttons 224 , information pop-up window buttons tool 225 , a named range selection button 226 , a style copy button 227 , a column re-sizing button 228 , and a sum button 229 .
- the functions of these buttons are suggested by their names. For instance, buttons 224 cut, copy and paste data and objects to and from Windows' clipboard. The same actions are also available as corresponding commands in the Edit menu (available from menu bar 210 ).
- the notebook which provides an interface for entering and displaying information of interest, includes a plurality of spreadsheet pages.
- Each page may include conventional windowing features and operations, such as moving, re-sizing, and deleting.
- the notebook includes 256 spreadsheet pages, all of which are saved as a single disk file on the mass storage 107 .
- Workspace 200 may display one or more notebooks, each sized and positioned (e.g., tiled, overlapping, and the like) according to user-specified constraints.
- Each spreadsheet page of a notebook includes a 2-D spread.
- Page A from the notebook 200 for example, includes a grid in row and column format, such as row 3 and column F.
- a box or cell e.g., cell C4
- Each cell is addressable, with a selector being provided for indicating a currently active one (i.e., the cell that is currently selected).
- each page identifier is in the form of a tab member (e.g., members 261 a , 262 a , 263 a ) situated along a top edge of the notebook.
- Each tab member may include representative indicia, such as textual or graphic labels, including user selected titles representing the contents of a corresponding page.
- the tab members 260 are set to their respective default names. For example, the first three tab members (members 261 a , 262 a , 263 a ) are respectively set to A, B, and C.
- Tab members are typically given descriptive names provided by the user, however. As shown in FIG. 2D , for example, the first three tab members have now been set to “Contents” (tab member 261 b ), “Summary” (tab member 262 b ), and “Jan” (tab member 263 b ). In a similar manner, the remaining tabs are set to subsequent months of the year. In this manner, the user associates the page identifiers with familiar tabs from an ordinary paper notebook. Thus, the user already knows how to select a page or spread of interest: simply select the tab corresponding to the page (as one would do when selecting a page from a paper notebook).
- the user-customizable page identifiers serve aid in the entry of spreadsheet named range addresses. For example, when entering a formula referring to a named range of cells on another page, the user may simply use the descriptive page name in the named range address, thus making it easier for the user to understand the relationship of the cell(s) or information being referenced.
- a typical, common, and valuable example of data organized into columns and rows is a table or a range of cells. Ranges of cells therefore are quite useful objects.
- a range of cells or a table can be defined and processed as a whole entity. For example it can be copied from one place to another within a single spreadsheet file or from one spreadsheet file to another spreadsheet file.
- the spreadsheet user can decide for each subset of rows or columns participating to a given relationship, to hide or display the “subordinate” rows or columns.
- the hide/display operation can be done for each defined relationship, or for all subsets at a given level.
- This operation is time consuming for large tables.
- the Outline function allows to nest different levels of relationship.
- the definition and manipulation of the different levels of relationship is relatively complex.
- it is quite complex to change the Outline level of a given row because this operation requires the suppression and the recreation of the Outline structure.
- FIG. 19A shows the first few lines of the Sales Journal.
- the Sales Journal comprises 8 fields, “Date” 1901 , “Item” 1902 , “Unit Price” 1903 , “Number” 1904 , “Total” 1905 , “Region” 1906 , “Town” 1907 and “Type” 1908 .
- Each sale is recorded on a line of the journal such as 1909 .
- a summary 1910 of the sales performed during the week is included in the journal, as illustrated in FIG. 19B .
- This summary comprises several lines with the sales by town 1911 and by region 1912 , and a total 1913 .
- a summary 1914 of the sales performed during the month is included in the journal, as illustrated in FIG. 19C .
- the summary comprises several lines with the sales by town 1915 and by region 1916 , and a total 1917 .
- FIGS. 19D and 19E show a piece of the journal table with an Outline defined and expanded.
- FIG. 19E shows the same piece of the journal table with the same Outline defined and, this time, collapsed.
- the Outline levels are displayed, using indented dots.
- FIG. 19F shows the result of a descending sort operation on column G 1907 , using the LOTUS 123 spreadsheet software.
- the resulting table, sorted according to expectations comprises an Outline, defined on the same rows as before the sort operation, and which has lost all meaning.
- a different example can be considered using the MicroSoft Excel software.
- the descending sort operation excludes the Outline details rows from the sort. The sort is only executed on the higher Outline level rows.
- the descending sort operation on column G 1907 and performed with MicroSoft Excel software, results in the table as illustrated on FIG. 19G . This behavior protects the Outline setting when a real details-summary relationship exists.
- the third and fourth limitations of the Outline function both come from the fact that a complete sheet structure is defined when the Outline function is used. Therefore, making changes to the Outline definition will, most of the time, result in changing the structure of the Outline, which will, in turn, often require the reset and rebuilding of the Outline structure. Making such changes to the structure often requires the definition of further details-summary relationships with the danger of creating artificial relationships only for display purposes. This is the case when the user wants to change the Outline level of one or several rows. In our example, and now referring to FIG.
- the French sales manager may even be interested in having several hierarchies, hence the need to easily change the hierarchy structure.
- Each regional sales manager may be interested in a display hierarchy showing yearly total sales, and then yearly total sales by region, and then monthly total sales by region, and then monthly sales by town only in his own region. This shows again the need for different display hierarchies because different users may have different display needs.
- the fifth limitation of the Outline function is that the Outline structure is related to the sheet rather than to a given table. This has two consequences:
- FIGS. 19A , 19 B and 19 C Further limits of the Outline function come from the manual operations required to define the Outline structure, while tables often comprise structural information. This is illustrated on FIGS. 19A , 19 B and 19 C, where sales records such as 1909 are recorded on a white background while summary records such as 1911 , 1912 , 1913 , 1915 , 1916 or 1917 are entered on a grey background.
- This implicit structural information can be used to automate the building of a display hierarchy. Rather than attributes information, contents information can also be used to automate the building of a display hierarchy. This limitation will be referred to as the sixth limitation.
- the selective focus placed on a given table to display only the most useful information can also be used to exchange information with other people that either do not need the whole information or are not allowed to access the whole information (e.g. for confidentiality reasons).
- the need to copy only the displayed information appears. More specifically, the hidden information must not be copied like it currently is in most spreadsheet software applications. All formulas that can be resolved with the information actually copied must be kept, unlike the “copy visible” function of the MicroSoft Excel spreadsheet software. This last identified limitation of the Outline function will be referred to as the seventh limitation.
- the embodiment of the invention offers a user-friendly solution to these requirements, while getting rid of the limitations previously identified.
- the solution is based on a new feature called Synthetic Focus Manager (SFM for short).
- SFM Synthetic Focus Manager
- This features is defined for displaying or hiding elements (rows/columns/sheets) of a range of cells (or table) on a user interface window.
- the invention is based on the following principles:
- the proposed solution offers the possibility to copy and paste the visible part of a range of cells managed by the SFM.
- this operation cannot be done because any hidden row or column within a given range of cells, is treated as a visible element by the copy-and-paste method.
- the conventional “Copy visible part” function only a Copy/Paste by value is performed.
- the SFM is aware of the currently selected display focus level and thus, can determine the elements that the spreadsheet user wishes to copy-and-paste onto a given destination range of cells. Specific attention is given to the way the paste operation is performed to keep as much information as possible, including formula defined relationships, while avoiding to build a range of cells with unresolved references. This new capability eliminates the seventh limitation identified in the previous paragraphs.
- the embodiment of the present invention relies on different types of objects for managing the display of elements of a range of cells like rows, columns and sheets. These objects are recorded in different repositories, so that they can be accessed and updated by the different methods which are part of the embodiment of the present invention.
- Such repositories are referred to as tables:
- the FMT, HLRange, VLRange, HRange and VRange tables are saved as part of the spreadsheet disk file on the mass storage 107 , so that they can themselves be considered as ranges of cells.
- the FMT Table 1301 corresponds to a logical simple structure comprising several records 1302 , each of them corresponding to a focus managed range of cells, according to the present invention.
- Each record includes fourteen fields:
- the HLRange Table 1320 corresponds to a logical simple structure comprising several records 1321 , each of them corresponding to a horizontal level defined for a focus managed range of cells, according to the present invention.
- Each record includes two fields:
- the VLRange Table 1330 corresponds to a logical simple structure comprising several records 1331 , each of them corresponding to a vertical level defined for a focus managed range of cells, according to the present invention.
- Each record includes two fields:
- the HRange Table 1340 corresponds to a logical simple structure comprising several records 1341 , each of them corresponding to a horizontal level setting defined for a focus managed range of cells, according to the present invention.
- An horizontal level setting establishes an association between an horizontal element (a row identified by its header) and an horizontal level (identified by its name).
- Each record includes two fields:
- the VRange Table 1350 corresponds to a logical simple structure comprising several records 1351 , each of them corresponding to a vertical level setting defined for a focus managed range of cells, according to the present invention.
- a vertical level setting establishes an association between a vertical element (a column identified by its header) and a vertical level (identified by its name).
- Each record includes two fields:
- the embodiment of the present invention provides a more powerful, user-friendly and interactive approach for hiding and/or displaying elements of a range of cells, comprising for instance one or a plurality of rows, or columns, or sheets, when this range of cells is managed by a synthetic focus manager.
- the present invention is used according to a scenario comprising a plurality of operations
- the first operation occurs when the spreadsheet user decides, based on some criteria not detailed here, to use the Synthetic Focus Manager to control how to hide or display the elements of a range of cells, like rows, columns and sheets.
- this operation comprises the following three steps:
- the second operation occurs when the spreadsheet user decides, based on his or her own criteria not detailed here:
- the spreadsheet user invokes thanks to conventional means available in spreadsheet environment, such as (but not limited to) dedicated push-buttons, keyboard entry short cuts, menu or sub-menu entries, an original specific command called “FocusLevelMgr” which manages through a dedicated user interface the definition of the focus levels associated with the currently managed FMROC.
- conventional means available in spreadsheet environment such as (but not limited to) dedicated push-buttons, keyboard entry short cuts, menu or sub-menu entries, an original specific command called “FocusLevelMgr” which manages through a dedicated user interface the definition of the focus levels associated with the currently managed FMROC.
- the user can visualise different pieces of information corresponding to the focus levels of the currently managed FMROC.
- the third operation occurs when the spreadsheet user decides, based on his or her own criteria not detailed here, to change the focus level associated with one element of the currently managed FMROC, either a row or a column.
- this operation comprises the following steps:
- the fourth operation occurs when the spreadsheet user decides, based on his or her own criteria not detailed here, to copy onto the clipboard the elements of the currently managed FMROC, which are displayed according to the focus level settings associated with this FMROC.
- this operation comprises the following steps:
- the spreadsheet user invokes thanks to conventional means available in spreadsheet environment, such as (but not limited to) dedicated push-buttons, keyboard entry short cuts, menu or sub-menu entries, an original specific command called “FocusCopyMgr” which manages the copy onto the clipboard of the visible elements of the currently managed FMROC.
- conventional means available in spreadsheet environment such as (but not limited to) dedicated push-buttons, keyboard entry short cuts, menu or sub-menu entries, an original specific command called “FocusCopyMgr” which manages the copy onto the clipboard of the visible elements of the currently managed FMROC.
- the horizontal row elements (respectively vertical column elements) which will be copied onto the clipboard are the ones which horizontal (respectively vertical) focus level setting is found greater than or equal to the horizontal (respectively vertical) display focus level.
- This situation is common for instance when an element of a given focus level priority level corresponds to the sum or the average of elements of a lower focus level priority. To get rid of this unresolved reference situation, the Focus Copy Manager command operates according to the following steps:
- the method for managing FMROC used in the embodiment of the present invention is summarized in flowchart 300 of FIG. 3 .

Abstract
Description
-
- When different important pieces of information spread within a given large table cannot be visualized at the same time, the user may waste a lot of time switching between different views. The user is often obliged to take notes before swapping between these views.
- When key information is spread over a large table comprising a lot of intermediate information, the user may waste a lot of time scanning the data to identify the relevant information.
- When the user needs to summarize or synthesize key information in a smaller table, he may waste a lot of time performing manual copy-paste operation to obtain the expected synthesis.
-
- A first tool that can be used for visualizing a large table, is the zoom function. The zoom function is similar to an optical zoom in the sense that it applies a user-controlled scaling factor to the display device. By adjusting the zooming ratio, more elements of information (i.e. more rows or columns) can be displayed. Unfortunately, this is achieved by reducing the size (width and height) of the displayed elements. This operation can be done until the elements become unreadable on the display device. It is like attempting to display the whole map of the city of New York while wishing to read the name of each street or avenue. Moreover, within a huge amount of data, the user must sort which data deserve the attention and must be discarded to understand/address a given topic.
- A second tool that can be used for visualizing a whole table is the Outline function. The Outline function is based on dominant-subordinate relationships (or summary-detail relationships) between either rows or columns. The spreadsheet user first specifies relationships between either rows and columns, to associate a set of contiguous “subordinate” (or “detail”) rows (respectively columns) with a contiguous “dominant” (or “summary”) row (respectively column). Although this kind of relationship may be easily defined in some conventional situations (for instance twelve monthly records associated with a yearly record), there are many cases where relationships can not be established between contiguous rows. The condition imposing that the “dominant” or (summary) row or column is contiguous to its related “subordinate” (or detail) rows or columns constitutes an important constraint with severe consequences on the structure of the table. Once the above relationships are established between different subsets of rows and/or columns, the electronic spreadsheet user can:
- either collapse a subset of “subordinate” (or detail) rows or columns, so that only the associated “dominant” (or summary) row or column is displayed, or
- expand a “dominant” (or summary) row or column, so that the associated hidden set of “subordinate” (or detail) rows or columns is displayed again.
- With the Outline function, the spreadsheet user can decide for each subset of rows or columns participating to a given relationship, to hide or display the “subordinate” rows or columns. When multiple relationships of that kind are defined, the hide/display operation can be done for each defined relationship, or for all subsets at a given level. However, this operation is time consuming for large tables. The Outline function allows to nest different levels of relationship. However, the definition and manipulation of different levels of relationship is relatively complex. Furthermore, once an Outline structure has been defined, it is quite complex to change the Outline level of a given row because this operation requires the suppression and the recreation of the Outline structure. Another strong limitation of the Outline function comes from the fact that it does not relate to a given table (or range of cells), but to a worksheet within the spreadsheet. The Outline function does not address the case where multiple tables, not necessarily of the same nature, belong to the same worksheet.
-
- Each object defined and manipulated by the SFM, is associated with a given range of cells, so that two or more different ranges of cells (or tables), even if they belong to the same worksheet, can be managed independently.
- The SFM defines, under the control of the spreadsheet user, for each managed range of cells, a set of focus levels arranged as a list of ordered levels, so that a “display hierarchy” can be defined and customized by the spreadsheet user.
- The SFM associates with each element (row/column/sheet) of a managed range of cells, a defined focus level. This association can be explicit (“position based levels” in the description of the embodiment) or can be implicit, depending either on cell attributes (“attribute based levels” in the description of the embodiment), or on cell content (“content based levels” in the description of the embodiment).
- In the first case, each element of a managed range of cells, points to a given focus level.
- In the second case, a focus level is associated either with a set of display attributes (e.g. font type, or font color, or background color, or border line, etc.), or with a cell content criteria (e.g. a numerical value being larger than a predefined threshold). Then each element (row/column/sheet) of a managed range of cells is associated either with the focus level matching the display attribute of the heading cell of the element or with the focus level matching the content criteria of the cell within the element with a predefined relative offset.
- The SFM defines a current display focus level.
- The SFM, upon a user action, hides all the range of cells elements (rows/columns/sheets) having a focus level lower than the current display focus level.
- All the above functions are accessible through a set of dedicated user interfaces that can be easily launched through conventional means like pushbuttons, keyboard short keys, menu or sub-menu entries.

-
- A first tool that can be used for visualizing a large table, is the zoom function. The zoom function is similar to an optical zoom in the sense that it applies a user-controlled scaling factor to the display device. By adjusting the zooming ratio, more elements of information (i.e. more rows or columns) can be displayed.

It is like attempting to display the whole map of the city of New York while wishing to read the name of each street or avenue. Moreover, within a huge amount of data, the user must sort which data deserve the attention and must be discarded to understand/address a given topic.
- A second tool that can be used for visualizing a whole table is the Outline function. The Outline function is based on dominant-subordinate relationships (or summary-detail relationships) between either rows or columns. The spreadsheet user first specifies relationships between either rows and columns, to associate a set of contiguous “subordinate” (or “detail”) rows (respectively columns) with a contiguous “dominant” (or “summary”) row (respectively column). Although this kind of relationship may be easily defined in some conventional situations (for instance twelve monthly records associated with a yearly record), there are many cases where relationships can not be established between contiguous rows. The condition imposing that the “dominant” or (summary) row or column is contiguous to its related “subordinate” (or detail) rows or columns constitutes an important constraint with severe consequences on the structure of the table.
-
- The first limitation is the necessity to build a table with a structure defining contiguous “detail” and “summary” rows.
- The second limitation comes from the fact that key functions are disabled in the sections of the spreadsheet where Outlines are defined.
Once the above relationships are established between different subsets of rows and/or columns, the electronic spreadsheet user has the possibility: - either to collapse a subset of “subordinate” (or detail) rows or columns, so that only the associated “dominant” (or summary) row or column is displayed, or
- to expand a “dominant” (or summary) row or column, so that the associated hidden set of “subordinate” (or detail) rows or columns is displayed again.
-
- The third limitation comes from the complexity to change the Outline level of a given row.
- The fourth limitation comes from the fact it is impossible to change the order of the hierarchy of the different Outline levels. Changing this hierarchy, implies the suppression and recreation of the Outline structure according to a different hierarchy scheme.
- Another strong limitation comes from the fact that the Outline function does not relate to a given table (or range of cells), but to a worksheet within the spreadsheet. The Outline function does not address the case where multiple tables, not necessarily of the same nature, belong to the same worksheet.
- The fifth limitation comes from the fact that the Outline function is related to a sheet and not to a specific table. It is impossible, on a given sheet, to have two different tables with overlapping lines and/or columns.
-
- first yearly total sales, and then
- monthly total sales, and then
- monthly sales by region, or
- first yearly total sales, and then
- yearly total sales by region, and then
- yearly total sales by town, and then
- monthly total sales by town.
-
- the first one is that two different tables, partially sharing the same row and/or columns, cannot have different Outline structures;
- the second one is that a table, when copied from one sheet to another, will not keep its Outline structure.
-
- Every object defined and manipulated by the SFM is associated with a given range of cells, so that two or more different ranges of cells (or tables)—even belonging to the same worksheet—can be managed independently. This approach eliminates the fifth limitation identified in the previous paragraphs.
- The SFM defines, under the control of the spreadsheet user, for each managed range of cells, a set of focus levels. These focus levels are arranged as a list of ordered levels, so that a “display hierarchy” can be defined and customized by the spreadsheet user. The capability to define and change the display hierarchy eliminates the fourth limitation identified in the previous paragraph.
- The SFM associates a defined focus level with each element (row/column/sheet) of a managed range of cells. This association can be
- explicit (referred to as “position based levels” type in the rest of the document) or
- implicit, depending either on cell attributes (referred to as “attribute based levels” type in the rest of the document), or on cell content (referred to as “content based levels” type in the rest of the document).
- The capability to associate focus levels with elements eliminates the first and third limitation identified in the previous paragraphs. The second limitation also disappears with this approach since a focus level is now assigned to a specific element (row/column/sheet). The capability to use implicit focus level assignment eliminates the sixth limitation of the Outline function.
- In the first case, each element of a managed range of cells points to a given focus level.
- In the second case, a focus level is associated either with a set of display attributes (e.g. font type, or font color, or background color, or border line, etc.), or with a cell content criteria (e.g. a numerical value being larger than a predefined threshold). Then each element (row/column/sheet) of a managed range of cells is associated either with the focus level matching the display attribute of the heading cell of the element or with the focus level matching the content criteria of the cell within the element with a predefined relative, offset.
- The SFM defines a current display focus level.
- The SFM, upon a user trigger, hides all elements (rows/columns/sheets) of the range of cells when the associated focus level is less than the current display focus level.
- All the above facilities are accessible through a set of dedicated user interfaces that can be easily launched through conventional means like pushbuttons, keyboard short keys, menu or sub-menu entries.

D. Scenario
- The “VHeader” 1352 field is used to point the vertical header of a focus managed range of cells belonging to the vertical level setting described by the
-
- First the spreadsheet user selects the relevant range of cells by using conventional means such as (but not limited to) the
pointing device 105 or thekeyboard 104. Without loosing any generality nor departing from the spirit of the present invention, it is assumed that the selected range of cells corresponds to a two dimensional (2D) structure comprised within a unique sheet.
- First the spreadsheet user selects the relevant range of cells by using conventional means such as (but not limited to) the
-
- Second the spreadsheet user invokes an original specific command called “SyntheticFocusMgr” thanks to conventional means available in spreadsheet environment, such as but not limited to the
pointing device 105 or thekeyboard 104. Then different cases are considered, depending on the relative position of the currently selected range of cells with respect to the various ranges of cells which have already been managed by the Synthetic Focus Manager, and which will be referred to as “Focus Managed Ranges of Cells” or FMROC for short.- b.1 If the currently selected range of cells is disjoint from any existing FMROC, then it becomes candidate for being a new FMROC. In this case an additional test is performed to check whether or not the currently selected range of cells comprises at least two rows and two columns.
- If it is not the case, then a warning message is displayed on the
display device 106 to the spreadsheet user through conventional means such as pop-up windows, status bar messages, or any other similar conventional means which can be used instead without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Once the spreadsheet user has acknowledged this warning message, the SyntheticFocusMgr command completes without turning the selected range of cells into a FMROC. - If the selected range of cells comprises at least two rows and two columns, then it can become a new FMROC so that a specific user interface is displayed on the
display device 106 to further prompt the spreadsheet user. This can be illustrated with the user interface described with theFIG. 14 , showing the Focus Manager RangeCreator Dialog Box 1401, as displayed on thedisplay device 106. Within this Focus Manger RangeCreator Dialog Box 1401, the spreadsheet user can click with thepointing device 105 on different push-buttons. - If the spreadsheet user clicks on the “NO” push-
button 1403 or on the closing-window push-button 1402, then the SyntheticFocusMgr command completes without turning the selected range of cells into a FMROC. - If the spreadsheet user clicks on one of the three push-buttons “Yes, with position based levels” 1404, or “Yes, with attribute based levels” 1405, or “Yes, with content based levels” 1406, then the currently selected range of cells becomes a new FMROC, with a Focus Type taking respectively the values
ADDRESS , orATTRIBUTE , orCONTENT. - If Focus Type takes the value
ADDRESS , then it means that the display of each FMROC element (row or column) will be based on a set of focus levels associated with each individual element. - If Focus Type takes the value
ATTRIBUTE , then it means that the display of each FMROC element (row or column) will be based on a set of focus levels associated with the attributes (such as colour, font, size, etc.) of the element header cell (left most cell of a row, or top cell of a column). - If Focus Type takes the value
CONTENT , then it means that the display of each FMROC element (row or column) will be based on a set of focus levels associated with the value taken by the element cell belonging to a “Horizontal Criteria” column (if the element is a row) or belonging to a “Vertical Criteria” row (if the element is a column).- Then the Focus Manager Range
Creator Dialog Box 1401 is closed on thedisplay device 106, and a new test is performed to check whether the new FMROC is a named range of cells or not.
- Then the Focus Manager Range
- If it is not the case, then the spreadsheet user is prompted to specify a valid name for the currently selected range of cells just turned as a new FMROC. This can be done by displaying on the display device 106 a pop-up entry field window, or any other similar conventional means which can be used instead without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
- Once the new FMROC is named, or if it was named before invocation of the SyntheticFocusMgr command, then the currently selected range of cells is recorded within Synthetic Focus Manager internal working tables as a new FMROC with default characteristics.
- Then a test is performed to determine whether the new FMROC has a Focus Type equal to
CONTENT or not.
- Then a test is performed to determine whether the new FMROC has a Focus Type equal to
- If it is the case, then the spreadsheet user is prompted to specify the “Horizontal Criteria” column and the “Vertical Criteria” row.
- This can be illustrated with the user interface described with the
FIG. 15 , showing the Focus CriteriaManager Dialog Box 1501, as displayed on thedisplay device 106. When this Focus CriteriaManager Dialog Box 1501 is displayed on thedisplay device 106, the spreadsheet user must first select with thepointing device 105 the cell located at the intersection of the “Horizontal Criteria” column and of the “Vertical Criteria” row of his/her choice, and then must click with thepointing device 105 on the “OK” push-button 1503 or on the closing-window push-button 1502 to close the Focus CriteriaManager Dialog Box 1501, so that the “Horizontal Criteria” column and the “Vertical Criteria” row get recorded in the Synthetic Focus Manager internal working tables. Once this is done, or if the Focus Type value was equal toADDRESS or toATTRIBUTE , then the main user interface of the Synthetic Focus Manager is displayed on thedisplay device 106. This can be illustrated with the user interface described with theFIG. 16 , showing the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601, as displayed on thedisplay device 106, which displays the default characteristics assigned to any new FMROC. Then the third step of this first operation starts as the spreadsheet user can manage the elements of the new FMROC to be either displayed or hidden.
- This can be illustrated with the user interface described with the
- b.2 If the currently selected range of cells partially overlaps with an already existing FMROC, then a warning message is displayed on the
display device 106 to the spreadsheet user through conventional means such as pop-up windows, status bar messages, or any other similar conventional means which can be used instead without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Indeed in an embodiment of the present invention, it is not possible to define two different FMROC which partially overlap, so that the spreadsheet user must be warned about this situation. Once the spreadsheet user has acknowledged this warning message, the SyntheticFocusMgr command completes without turning the selected range of cells into a FMROC. - b.3 If the currently selected range of cells is fully included within an already existing FMROC, then the Synthetic Focus Manager understands that the spreadsheet user wishes to take advantage of the present invention for this existing FMROC. Then the Synthetic Focus Manager internal working tables are visited to retrieve the characteristics of the identified FMROC, which are then displayed on the
display device 106 within the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601. Then the third step of this first operation starts as the spreadsheet user can manage the elements of the FMROC to display or hide.
- Second the spreadsheet user invokes an original specific command called “SyntheticFocusMgr” thanks to conventional means available in spreadsheet environment, such as but not limited to the
-
- Within the Focus
Manager Dialog Box 1601, the user can visualise different pieces of information related to the currently managed FMROC.- First the name of the range of cells corresponding to the currently managed FMROC is specified in the
label box 1603. - Second the address of the range of cells corresponding to the currently managed FMROC is specified in the
label box 1604. - Third the list of horizontal focus levels is displayed in the
list box 1615, starting at the top with the default highest priority horizontal focus level “always” (associated with the rows which must be always displayed), and ending at the bottom with the default lowest priority horizontal focus level “Show All” (associated with the rows which are only displayed when the whole FMROC is displayed). Any other user defined horizontal focus level will appear between the “always” and “Show All” focus levels according to its relative priority. Within thelist box 1615, the current horizontal display level is identified as being the selected entry in the list, as shown onFIG. 16 by the “country”focus level 1614. When a new FMROC is created, the default horizontal focus level list is constituted by the default “always” and “Show All” focus levels, and the default horizontal display level corresponds to the “always” horizontal focus level. - Fourth the list of vertical focus levels is displayed in the
list box 1605, starting at the top with the default highest priority vertical focus level “always” (associated with the columns which must be always displayed), and ending at the bottom with the default lowest priority vertical focus level “Show All” (associated with the columns which are only displayed when the whole FMROC is displayed). Any other user defined vertical focus level will appear between the “always” and “Show All” focus levels according to its relative priority. Within thelist box 1605, the current vertical display level is identified as being the selected entry in the list, as shown onFIG. 16 by the “month”focus level 1606. When a new FMROC is created, the default vertical focus level list is constituted by the default “always” and “Show All” focus levels, and the default vertical display level corresponds to the “always” vertical focus level. - Fifth the Focus Type associated with the currently managed FMROC is identified by the title of the Focus
Manager Dialog Box 1601, which is displayed at the top of thisdialog box 1601. If the Focus Type takes respectively the valuesADDRESS , orATTRIBUTE , orCONTENT , then the title of the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601 is respectively “Focus Management based onPOSITION ”, or “Focus Management based onATTRIBUTE ”, or “Focus Management based onCONTENT”.
- First the name of the range of cells corresponding to the currently managed FMROC is specified in the
- Once the spreadsheet user has examined the different characteristics of the currently managed FMROC displayed within the Focus
Manager Dialog Box 1601, he/she can take several different actions according to his/her specific needs.- First the spreadsheet user can change the current horizontal display level by selecting with the
pointing device 105 an horizontal focus level different from the one previously selected as the horizontal display level. If it turns out that the number of defined horizontal focus levels is large enough not to entirely fit within thelist box 1615, then conventional means such as but not limited to a scrolling bar can be used to navigate within the full set of horizontal focus levels appearing in thelist box 1615. - Second the spreadsheet user can change the current vertical display level by selecting with the pointing device 105 a vertical focus level different from the one previously selected as the vertical display level. If it turns out that the number of defined vertical focus levels is large enough not to entirely fit within the
list box 1605, then conventional means such as but not limited to a scrolling bar can be used to navigate within the full set of vertical focus levels appearing in thelist box 1605. - Third the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Apply” push-button 1613. The resulting effect will be either to hide or to display the elements of the currently managed FMROC according to the horizontal and vertical display levels. For instance, if these levels take the respective values “country” and “month”, as illustrated by thefields list boxes FIG. 16 , then the rows which are associated with a lower priority horizontal focus level (“Show All”) will be hidden while the other rows associated with an higher or equal priority horizontal focus level (“always”, “continent”, “country”) will be displayed, and the columns which are associated with a lower priority vertical focus level (“Show All”) will be hidden while the other rows associated with an higher or equal priority vertical focus level (“always”, “quarter”, “month”) will be displayed. This management of the FMROC elements, both rows and columns, which are either displayed or hidden, relies on the associated horizontal and vertical focus levels, and on their relative position with respect to the horizontal and vertical display levels, whether this horizontal and vertical focus level association is based onADDRESS, ATTRIBUTE orCONTENT , as recorded by the Focus Type parameter. - Fourth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Reset Criteria” push-button 1611, if the currently managed FMROC has a Focus Type parameter taking the valueCONTENT (for the other valuesATTRIBUTE andCONTENT , the “Reset Criteria” push-button 1611 is disabled, so that clicking on it has no effect). The resulting effect is to display on thedisplay device 106 the Focus CriteriaManager Dialog Box 1501, which allows the spreadsheet user, as already described, to redefine the “Horizontal Criteria” column and of the “Vertical Criteria” row. When done, the Focus CriteriaManager Dialog Box 1501 is closed and control is given back to the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601 for processing any other spreadsheet user action. - Fifth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Update Levels” push-button 1610. The resulting effect is to issue an original specific command called “FocusLevelMgr” in order to launch the second operation of the present scenario for updating the currently defined focus levels associated with the currently managed FMROC, as further described hereafter. - Sixth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Update Settings” push-button 1607. The resulting effect is to issue an original specific command called “FocusSettingMgr” in order to launch the third operation of the present scenario for updating the currently defined associations between FMROC elements and FMROC focus levels, as further described hereafter. - Seventh the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Copy Visible Part on Clipboard” push-button 1612. The resulting effect is to issue an original specific command called “FocusCopyMgr” in order to launch the fourth operation of the present scenario for copying onto the clipboard the elements of the currently managed FMROC which would be displayed on thedisplay device 106 after a click on the “Apply” push-button 1613 with thepointing device 105, as further described hereafter. - Eighth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Disable Focus” push-button 1609. The resulting effect is to turn the currently managed FMROC as a ‘standard’ range of cells, by flushing out of the Synthetic Focus Manager internal working tables all the information related to this range of cells. As a consequence, the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601 is closed on thedisplay device 106, and the SyntheticFocusMgr command completes. - Ninth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Quit” push-button 1608 or on the closing-window push-button 1602 in order to complete the execution of the SyntheticFocusMgr command by closing the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601.
2. Second Operation: Update of the Existing Focus Levels
- First the spreadsheet user can change the current horizontal display level by selecting with the
- Within the Focus
-
- either to introduce a new focus level, or
- to delete an existing focus level, or
- to rename an existing focus level, or
- to update the relative priorities of existing focus levels.
In an embodiment of the present invention, this operation comprises the following steps:
-
- First the
label box 1713 specifies whether the information displayed in thelist box 1712 corresponds either to horizontal focus levels (thelabel box 1713 displaying “Horizontal Focus Levels:”) or to vertical focus levels (thelabel box 1713 displaying “Vertical Focus Levels:”). - Second the
list box 1712 displays the set of horizontal or vertical focus levels (according to the content of the label box 1713), with - the highest priority focus level at the top of the list,
- the lowest priority focus level at the bottom of the list, and
- all the intermediary focus levels, if any, in the middle with the same order as their relative priority.
- Within the
list box 1712, one of the focus levels is set as the currently working focus level, and is recognized with a dark background colour, as shown by the entry “region” 1711 onFIG. 17 . - Third the
label box 1704 specifies whether the currently working focus level is referenced or not within the focus level setting of a FMROC element. If it is the case, then thelabel box 1704 displays “Level is referenced”; otherwise thelabel box 1704 displays “Level is referenced”. - Once the spreadsheet user has examined the different pieces of information displayed within the Focus Level
Manager Dialog Box 1701, he/she can take several different actions according to his/her specific needs. - First the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Horiz./Vert.” push-button 1715. The resulting effect is to swap between the set of horizontal focus levels and the set of vertical focus levels, so that thelabel box 1713 alternatively displays “Horizontal Focus Levels:” and “Vertical Focus Levels:” and so that thelist box 1712 alternatively comprises the set of horizontal focus levels and the set of vertical focus levels. - Second the spreadsheet user can change the currently working focus level by selecting with the pointing device 105 a focus level different from the one previously selected as the currently working focus level. If it turns out that the number of defined focus levels is large enough not to entirely fit within the
list box 1712, then conventional means such as but not limited to a scrolling bar can be used to navigate within the full set of focus levels appearing in thelist box 1712. - If the currently working focus level is the focus level of highest priority (“always”), then the push-buttons “Upgrade” 1714, “Downgrade” 1708, “Delete” 1710, “Rename” 1709, and “Create New” 1707 are disabled so that clicking on them with the
pointing device 105 has no effect. - If the currently working focus level is the focus level of lowest priority (“Show All”), then the push-buttons “Upgrade” 1714, “Downgrade” 1708, “Delete” 1710, and “Rename” 1709 are disabled so that clicking on them with the
pointing device 105 has no effect. - If the currently working focus level is the focus level of the highest priority below the priority of the “always” focus level (as it is the case with the focus level “continent on
FIG. 17 ), then the push-button “Upgrade” 1714 is disabled so that clicking on it with thepointing device 105 has no effect. - If the currently working focus level is the focus level of the lowest priority above the priority of the “Show All” focus level (as it is the case with the focus level “country” on
FIG. 17 ), then the push-button “Downgrade” 1708 is disabled so that clicking on it with thepointing device 105 has no effect. - If the
text box 1705 is left empty or comprises a character string equal to the name of an existing focus level, then the “Rename” push-button 1709 is disabled so that clicking on it with thepointing device 105 has no effect. - If the
text box 1706 is left empty or comprises a character string equal to the name of an existing focus level, then the “Create New” push-button 1707 is disabled so that clicking on it with thepointing device 105 has no effect. - Third the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Upgrade” push-button 1714, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to move up by one priority position the currently working focus level. In the case described by theFIG. 17 , the “region” focus level would be moved between, “continent” and “always”. - Fourth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Downgrade” push-button 1708, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to move down by one priority position the currently working focus level. In the case described by theFIG. 17 , the “region” focus level would be moved between “country” and “Show All”. - Fifth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Rename” push-button 1709, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to rename the currently working focus level with the name entered in thetext box 1705. In the case described by theFIG. 17 , the “region” focus level would be renamed as “othername”. - Sixth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Create New” push-button 1707, if enabled. The resulting effect will be create a new focus level with a priority just above the priority of the currently working focus level, and with the name entered in thetext box 1706. In the case described by theFIG. 17 , the “newname” focus level would be created between the “region” and the “continent” focus levels. - Seventh the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Delete” push-button 1710, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to remove the currently working focus level from the list of focus levels. In the case described by theFIG. 17 , the “region”,focus level would be deleted, so that the resulting list of focus levels only comprises four focus levels “always”, “continent”, “country”, and “Show All”. - Eighth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Done/Quit” push-button 1703 or on the closing-window push-button 1702 in order to complete the execution of the FocusLevelMgr command by closing the Focus LevelManager Dialog Box 1701.
3. Third Operation: Update of the Focus Level Settings
- First the
-
- The spreadsheet user invokes thanks to conventional means available in spreadsheet environment, such as (but not limited to) dedicated push-buttons, keyboard entry short cuts, menu or sub-menu entries, an original specific command called “FocusSettingMgr” which manages through a dedicated user interface the definition of the focus levels associated with the elements of the currently managed FMROC.
- This can be illustrated with the user interface described with the
FIG. 18 , showing the Focus SettingManager Dialog Box 1901, as displayed on thedisplay device 106. Within the Focus SettingManager Dialog Box 1901, the user can visualise different pieces of information which correspond to the horizontal and vertical focus level settings of each element of the currently managed FMROC.- First the “Offset”
label box 1816 specifies the relative offset within the currently managed FMROC of a row element. For instance the top row of the currently managed FMROC is identified by an “Offset”label box 1816 taking a value equal to 0 (zero). If the value taken by the “Offset”label box 1816 is equal to 0 (zero), then the push-button “Up” 1811 is disabled. If the value taken by the “Offset”label box 1816 is equal to the number of rows of the currently managed FMROC, decremented by 1 (one), then the push-button “Down” 1810 is disabled. - Second the “Contend”
label box 1815 specifies the value taken by the header cell of the row element which offset within the currently managed FMROC is specified by the “Offset”label box 1816. - Third the
list box 1814 shows the different horizontal focus levels defined for the currently managed FMROC. - Fourth the horizontal focus level currently associated with the row element which offset within the currently managed FMROC is identified by the “Offset”
label box 1816, is specified as being the selected entry in thelist box 1814, and is identified by a dark background colour, as it is the case for instance in theFIG. 18 for the “country”horizontal focus level 1813. Thus with the example shown onFIG. 18 , the horizontal focus level setting of the row with offset 4 (1816), which header's value is “Italy” (1815), is equal to “country” (1813). - Fifth the “Offset”
label box 1803 specifies the relative offset within the currently managed FMROC of a column element. For instance the leftmost column of the currently managed FMROC is identified by an “Offset”label box 1803 taking a value equal to 0 (zero). - If the value taken by the “Offset”
label box 1803 is equal to 0 (zero), then the push-button “Leff” 1809 is disabled. - If the value taken by the “Offset”
label box 1803 is equal to the number of columns of the currently managed FMROC, decremented by 1 (one), then the push-button “Right” 1807 is disabled. - Sixth the “Content”
label box 1804 specifies the value taken by the header cell of the column element which offset within the currently managed FMROC is specified by the “Offset”label box 1803. - Seventh the
list box 1805 shows the different vertical focus levels defined for the currently managed FMROC. - Eighth the vertical focus level currently associated with the column element which offset within the currently managed FMROC is identified by the “Offset”
label box 1803, is specified as being the selected entry in thelist box 1805, and is identified by a dark background colour, as it is the case for instance in theFIG. 18 for the “month”vertical focus level 1806. Thus with the example shown onFIG. 18 , the vertical focus level setting of the column with offset 2 (1803), which header's value is “feb.” (1804), is equal to “month” (1806).
- First the “Offset”
-
- First the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Up” push-button 1811, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to decrement by 1 (one) the “Offset”label box 1816, so that - the row element under study is replaced by the preceding one,
- the information displayed in the “Content”
label box 1815 is updated accordingly, and - the horizontal focus level setting identified within the
list box 1814 as being the selecteditem 1813 with dark background colour is also updated accordingly. - Second the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Down” push-button 1810, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to increment by 1 (one) the “Offset”label box 1816, so that - the row element under study is replaced by the following one,
- the information displayed in the “Content”
label box 1815 is updated accordingly, and - the horizontal focus level setting identified within the
list box 1814 as being the selecteditem 1813 with dark background colour is also updated accordingly. - Third the spreadsheet user can change the horizontal focus level setting by selecting with the
pointing device 105 in thelist box 1814 an horizontal focus level different from the one previously selected as the horizontal focus level setting. If it turns out that the number of defined horizontal focus levels is large enough not to entirely fit within thelist box 1814, then conventional means such as but not limited to a scrolling bar can be used to navigate within the full set of horizontal focus levels appearing in thelist box 1814. - Fourth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Left” push-button 1809, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to decrement by 1 (one) the “Offset”label box 1803, so that - the column element under study is replaced by the preceding one (on the left),
- the information displayed in the “Content”
label box 1804 is updated accordingly, and - the vertical focus level setting identified within the
list box 1805 as being the selecteditem 1806 with dark background colour is also updated accordingly. - Fifth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Right” push-button 1807, if enabled. The resulting effect will be to increment by 1 (one) the “Offset”label box 1803, so that - the column element under study is replaced by the following one (on the right),
- the information displayed in the “Content”
label box 1804 is updated accordingly, and - the vertical focus level setting identified within the
list box 1805 as being the selecteditem 1806 with dark background colour is also updated accordingly. - Sixth the spreadsheet user can change the vertical focus level setting by selecting with the
pointing device 105 in the list box 1805 a vertical focus level different from the one previously selected as the vertical focus level setting. If it turns out that the number of defined vertical focus levels is large enough not to entirely fit within thelist box 1805, then conventional means such as but not limited to a scrolling bar can be used to navigate within the full set of vertical focus levels appearing in thelist box 1805. - Seventh the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Focus Level Definition Manager push-button 1812. The resulting effect will be to issue the FocusLevelMgr command, so that the second operation of the present scenario be launched by displaying the Focus LevelManager Dialog Box 1701 to update the definition of horizontal and vertical focus levels associated with the currently managed FMROC. - Eighth the spreadsheet user can click with the
pointing device 105 on the “Done/Quit” push-button 1808 or on the closing-window push-button 1802 in order to complete the execution of the FocusSettingMgr command by closing the Focus SettingManager Dialog Box 1801.
4. Fourth Operation: Copy to Clipboard the Visible Part of a Range of Cells
- First the spreadsheet user can click with the
-
- First the currently managed FMROC is entirely copied by value on a temporary working sheet. This results in a temporary range of cells named
SOURCERANGE which comprises as many rows and as many columns as the currently managed FMROC, and which does not comprises any reference to any cell (because the copy operation has been performed by value). - Second the focus level definitions associated with the currently managed FMROC are applied to the
SOURCERANGE range of cells on the temporary working sheet, so that the horizontal and vertical elements of theSOURCERANGE range of cells are accordingly either displayed or hidden. - Third the hidden elements (rows and columns) of the
SOURCERANGE range of cells, if any, are deleted from the temporary working sheet. - Fourth the resulting updated range of cells
SOURCERANGE is copied onto the clipboard, completing the execution of the FocusCopyMgr command.
E. Methods
E1. Synthetic Focus Manager Method
- First the currently managed FMROC is entirely copied by value on a temporary working sheet. This results in a temporary range of cells named
-
- At
step 301, the method is in its default state, waiting for an event to initiate the process. - At
step 302, the SyntheticFocusMgr command is detected, as a result of a user action. This action can be for instance: - a specific combination of key on the
keyboard 104, or - the click of the
pointing device 105 on a specific button, or - any other similar means not further specified here.
- At
step 303, some local variables are initialized: - the local variable CurrSelect is set to the currently selected range of cells,
- the local variable FocusRangeNumber is set to the number of already existing FMROC (the number of
records 1302 within the FMT table 1301), - The local variable CopyMode is set to the default value FALSE, and then the FMT table is recalculated to get rid of any remaining formula not yet refreshed.
- At
step 304, thefirst record 1302 of the FMT table 1301 is memorized under the local variable FMTRecord. - At
step 305, the variable TempRange is set as the range of cells which name is the one found in the field “Range” 1303 of therecord FMTRecord 1302. - At
step 306, a comparison is performed between the range of cells CurrSelect and the range of cells TempRange. - If the range of cells CurrSelect is included or equal to the range of cells TempRange, then control is given to step 307.
- If the range of cells CurrSelect is overlapping partially but not entirely the range of cells TempRange, then control is given to step 312.
- If the ranges of cells CurrSelect and TempRange are disjoint, then control is given to step 313.
- At
step 307, the local variable HOffset is initialized with the relative horizontal offset of the CurrSelect range of cells within the TempRange range of cells, and the local variable VOffset is initialized with the relative vertical offset of the CurrSelect range of cells within the TempRange range of cells. - At
step 308, the command FocusHouseKeeping is issued so that the corresponding Focus House Keeping method be launched. When this FocusHouseKeeping command returns control to the SyntheticFocusMgr command, control is given to step 309. - At
step 309, the command BuildLevelList is issued to launch the corresponding method building the focus level lists. When this BuildLevelList command returns control to the SyntheticFocusMgr command, control is given to step 310. - At
step 310, the command FocusMgrDBShow is issued to launch the corresponding method displaying the FocusManager Dialog Box 1601. When this FocusMgrDBShow command returns control to the SyntheticFocusMgr command, control is given to step 311. - At
step 311, the range of cells CurrSelect is selected and then control is given to theinitial step 301 for handling any future SyntheticFocusMgr command. - At
step 312, a warning message notification is issued to inform the user that the current selection is partially overlapping an existing FMROC, so that none existing FMROC could be identified and so that none new FMROC could be created. This can typically be done by displaying on the display device 106 a warning message in a pop-up window, or in a status bar area, but any other similar means could be used instead, without departing from the spirit of the invention. Once the user has acknowledged this notification message through conventional means such as clicking with thepointing device 105 on an “OK” push-button present within a warning message pop-up window, or any other similar means without departing from the spirit of the invention, control is given to step 311. - At
step 313, a test is perform to check whether the local variable FMTRecord corresponds to thelast record 1302 of the FMT table 1301 or not. If it is the case, then control is given to step 315; otherwise control is given to step 314. - At
step 314, the local variable FMTRecord is updated to point to therecord 1302 following in the FMT table 1301 the previous record recorded in the local variable FMTRecord. Then control is given to thestep 305. - At
step 315, a test is performed to check whether or not the range of cells CurrSelect comprises at least two rows and at least two columns. If it is the case, then control is given to step 317; otherwise control is given to step 316. - At
step 316, a warning message notification is issued to inform the user that the current selection does not comprise enough elements to be turned into a FMROC. This can typically be done by displaying on the display device 106 a warning message in a pop-up window, or in a status bar area, but any other similar means could be used instead, without departing from the spirit of the invention. Once the user has acknowledged this notification message through conventional means such as clicking with thepointing device 105 on an “OK” push-button present within a warning message pop-up window, or any other similar means without departing from the spirit of the invention, control is given to step 311. - At
step 317, the Focus Manager RangeCreator Dialog Box 1401 is displayed on thedisplay device 106. - At
step 318, the method is in a wait state, waiting for a user action on the Focus Manager RangeCreator Dialog Box 1401. Such user action typically results of a click with thepointing device 105, but can take other similar forms such as, but not limited to a specific combination of key on thekeyboard 104, or any other similar means not further specified here. - At
step 319, an event is detected, as a result of a user action. - If the user action is a click on the “NO” push-
button 1403, then control is given to step 320. - If the user action is a click on the “Yes, with position based levels” push-
button 1404, then control is given to step 321. - If the user action is a click on the “Yes, with attribute based levels” push-
button 1405, then control is given to step 322. - If the user action is a click on the “Yes, with content based levels” push-
button 1406, then control is given to step 323. - At
step 320, the Focus Manager RangeCreator Dialog Box 1401 is closed on thedisplay device 106, and then control is given to step 311. - At
step 321, the local variable FocusType is initialized with the valueADDRESS , and then control is given to step 324. - At
step 322, the local variable FocusType is initialized with the valueATTRIBUTE , and then control is given to step 324. - At
step 323, the local variable FocusType is initialized with the valueCONTENT , and then control is given to step 324. - At
step 324, the Focus Manager RangeCreator Dialog Box 1401 is closed on thedisplay device 106. - At
step 325, the command CreateFMR is issued to launch the corresponding method for creating a new FMROC. When this CreateFMR command returns control to the SyntheticFocusMgr command, control is given to step 311.
E2. Create FMROC Method
- At
-
- At
step 401, a test is performed to check whether the range of cells CurrSelect is already named or not. If it is the case, then control is given to step 407; otherwise control is given to step 402. - At
step 402, the user is prompted to specify a valid name for the range of cells CurrSelect. This can typically be done by displaying on the display device 106 a prompting message in a pop-up window comprising a text entry field, but any other similar means can be used instead, without departing from the spirit of the invention. Once the user has specified a name for the range of cells CurrSelect through conventional means such as typing with the keyboard 104 a name in the text entry field of a pop-up window, or any other similar means without departing from the spirit of the invention, control is given to step 403. - At
step 403, the method detects that the user has specified a range name for the CurrSelect range of cells. - At step 404, a test is performed to check whether the user specified range name for the CurrSelect range of cells is valid or not. The validity criteria are the ones conventionally used in electronic spreadsheet environments. If the specified name is found as valid, then control is given to step 406; otherwise control is given to step 405.
- At
step 405, a warning message notification is issued to inform the user that the specified range name is invalid. This can typically be done by displaying on the display device 106 a warning message in a pop-up window, or in a status bar area, but any other similar means could be used instead, without departing from the spirit of the invention. Once the user has acknowledged this notification message through conventional means such as clicking with thepointing device 105 on an “OK” push-button present within a warning message pop-up window, or any other similar means without departing from the spirit of the invention, control is given to step 402. - At
step 406, the range of cells identified by the local variable CurrSelect is named with the name provided by the user atstep 403. - At
step 407, the method allocates internal resources (names and memory) for building the focus manager internal working tables and records that will be used to manage the FMROC. This includes for instance the memory space needed to build and name thetables HLRange 1320,VLRange 1330,HRange 1340,VRange 1350, and the memory space needed to build anew record 1302 within the FMT table 1301. If this resource allocation fails due for instance to a shortage of memory, then control is given to step 408; otherwise control is given to step 409. - At
step 408, a warning message notification is issued to inform the user that the FMROC creation operation has failed due to lack of required system resources. This can typically be done by displaying on the display device 106 a warning message in a pop-up window, or in a status bar area, but any other similar means could be used instead, without departing from the spirit of the invention. This step completes the execution of the CreateFMR command as control is returned back to the calling method having issued the CreateFMR command. - At
step 409, the addresses of the default headers of the FMROC being created are determined. They are recorded in three local variables: the local variable TopLeft comprises the address of the cell located within the range of cells CurrSelect at the intersection of the top row and of the left most column; the local variable TopRight comprises the address of the cell located within the range of cells CurrSelect at the intersection of the top row and of the right most column; and the local variable BottomLeft comprises the address of the cell located within the range of cells CurrSelect at the intersection of the bottom row and of the left most column. - At
step 410, anew record 1302 is created in the FMT table 1301. - At
step 411, thenew record 1302 is named as FMTRecord. - At
step 412, some local variables are initialized, as well as the fields in the new record FMTRecord 1302: - The local variable FocusRange is initialized with the name of the range of cells CurrSelect, and then the “Range”
field 1303 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable FocusRange. - The local variable HDisplay is initialized with the default value “always”, and then the “HDisplay”
field 1304 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable HDisplay. - The local variable VDisplay is initialized with the default value “always”, and then the “VDisplay”
field 1305 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable VDisplay. - The local variable HNbr is initialized with the default content “@rows(@@(HLRange))”, that is the number of rows in the HLRange table 1320, and then the “HNbr”
field 1306 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable HNbr. - The local variable VNbr is initialized with the default content “@rows(@@(VLRange))”, that is the number of rows in the VLRange table 1330, and then the “VNbr”
field 1307 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable VNbr. - The local variable HLRange is initialized with the name allocated at
step 407 for the HLRange table 1320, and then the “HLRange”field 1308 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable HLRange. - The local variable VLRange is initialized with the name allocated at
step 407 for the VLRange table 1330, and then the “VLRange”field 1309 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable VLRange. - The local variable HLevelNbr is initialized with the default content “@rows(@@(HRange))”, that is the number of rows in the HRange table 1340, and then the “HLNbr”
field 1310 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable HLevelNbr. - The local variable VLevelNbr is initialized with the default content “@rows(@@(VRange))”, that is the number of rows in the VRange table 1350, and then the “VLNbr”
field 1311 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable VLevelNbr. - The local variable HRange is initialized with the name allocated at
step 407 for the HRange table 1340, and then the “HRange”field 1312 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable HRange. - The local variable VRange is initialized with the name allocated at
step 407 for the VRange table 1350, and then the “VRange”field 1313 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable VRange. - The “FocusType”
field 1314 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable FocusType. - The local variable HCriteriaAddress is initialized with the default value “N/A”; and then the “HCriteria”
field 1315 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable HCriteriaAddress. - The local variable VCriteriaAddress is initialized with the default value “N/A”; and then the “VCriteria”
field 1316 of theFMTRecord 1302 is filled with the value of the local variable VCriteriaAddress. - At
step 413, a test is performed to determine the value of the local variable FocusType. If found equal toCONTENT , then control is given to step 414; otherwise control is given to step 415. - At
step 414, the command GetCriteria is issued to launch the corresponding method for retrieving the “Horizontal Criteria” column and “Vertical Criteria” row. When this GetCriteria command returns control to the CreateFMR command, control is given to step 415. - At
step 415, the new four focus manager internal workingtables HLRange 1320,VLRange 1330,HRange 1340, andVRange 1350 are created as being conventional ranges of cells in an hidden sheet of the active spreadsheet file, so that they get recorded when the active spreadsheet will be filed on thesystem mass storage 107. These four working ranges of cells comprise each two rows and two columns. - At
step 416, the four ranges of cells created at the previous steps are named with the names allocated atstep 407, and recorded in the local variables HLRange, VLRange, HRange and VRange. - At
step 417, the four ranges of cells created atstep 415 are initialized as follows: - The top left cell of the HLRange working range of
cells 1320 is filled with the focus level “always”. - The bottom left cell of the HLRange working range of

E7. Focus Copy Manager Method
- At
-
- At
step 901, the range of cells FocusRange is copy-pasted on a working sheet using conventional copy-paste tools available in spreadsheet environments. - At
step 902, the range of cells resulting from the copy-paste operation performed atstep 901 is named as the range of cellsSOURCERANGE. - At
step 903, the local variable CopyMode is set equal toTRUE. - At
step 904, the command ApplyFocus is issued to launch the corresponding method for applying the defined focus levels on the range of cellsSOURCERANGE . When this ApplyFocus command returns control to the FocusCopyMgr command, control is given to step 905. - At
step 905, the local variable CopyMode is set equal toFALSE. - At
step 906, the local variable WorkRow is set equal to the top row of the range of cellsSOURCERANGE. - At
step 907, the local variable WorkCell is set equal to the left most cell of the row WorkRow. - At
step 908, the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is parsed in the left-to-right direction to identify any reference to a range of cells. Such a reference can either be the address of a range of cells, or the name of a named range of cells. Such a referenced range of cells can either comprise a single individual cell, or a collection of individual cells. - If the right end of the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is reached without identify any reference to a range of cells not yet identified, then control is given to step 909.
- If a reference to a range of cells not yet identified is found while parsing the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell, then control is given to step 913.
- At
-
- At
step 909, a test is performed to check whether or not the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is the last cell (the right most cell) of the row WorkRow. If it is the case, then control is given to step 911; otherwise control is given to step 910. - At
step 910, the cell located immediately on the right of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell becomes the new cell represented by the local variable WorkCell. Then control is given to step 908. - At
step 911, a test is performed to check whether or not the row represented by the local variable WorkRow is the bottom row of the range of cellsSOURCERANGE . If it is the case, then control is given to step 918; otherwise control is given to step 912. - At

- At
step 916, the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is updated by replacing by its value the function which one of the arguments is equal to FoundAdd. As an example: - if the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is equal to “@
DSUM (SALES; “COMM”; BROKER =Smith”)*CURRENCY ”, and - if FoundAdd is equal to the range of cells named
SALES , then the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell becomes “12300*CURRENCY ” if the value of the function @DSUM (SALES; “COMM”; BROKER =“Smith”) is equal to 12300. Then control is given to step 908 for continuing the parsing of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell at the position occupied by the previous parsing operation ofstep 908. - At
step 917, the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is updated by replacing by its value the operand FoundAdd. As an example: - if the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell is equal to @
DSUM (SALES; “COMM”; BROKER =“Smith”)*CURRENCY ” and - if FoundAdd is equal to the cell named
CURRENCY, then the content of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell becomes “@DSUM (SALES; “COMM”; BROKER =“Smith”)*1.106” if the value of the cell namedCURRENCY is equal to 1.106. Then control is given to step 908 for continuing the parsing of the cell represented by the local variable WorkCell at the position occupied by the previous parsing operation ofstep 908. - At
step 918, the local variable CurrDir is set equal to “Row” - At
step 919, the local variable WorkCell is set equal to the top left header cell of the range of cellsSOURCERANGE. - At
step 920, a test is performed to check whether or not the cell WorkCell is hidden. If it is the case, then control is given to step 922; otherwise control is given to step 921. - At
step 921, the local variable WorkCell becomes the cell following, along the direction CurrDir, the previous position of the cell WorkCell. Then control is given to step 925. - At
step 922, the local variable WCAddress is set equal to the address of the cell WorkCell. - At
step 923, the cell WorkCell is deleted along the direction CurrDir. - At
step 924, the local variable WorkCell is set equal to the cell which address is equal to the local variable WCAddress. - At
step 925, a test is performed to check whether or not the cell WorkCell belongs to the range of cellsSOURCERANGE . If it is the case, then control is given to step 920; otherwise control is given to step 926. - At
step 926, a test is performed to check whether or not the local variable CurrDir is equal to “Row”. If it is the case, then control is given to step 927 otherwise control is given to step 928. - At
step 927, the local variable CurrDir is set equal to “Column”. Then control is given to step 907. - At

step 1232, an event is detected, as a result of a user action. - If the user action is a selection with the
pointing device 105 within thelist box 1805 of a vertical level, then control is given to step 1244. - If the user action is a selection with the
pointing device 105 within thelist box 1814 of an horizontal level, then control is given to step 1241. - If the user action is a click on the “Right” push-
button 1807, then control is given to step 1240. - If the user action is a click on the “Left” push-
button 1809, then control is given to step 1239. - If the user action is a click on the “Down” push-
button 1810, then control is given to step 1238. - If the user action is a click on the “Up” push-
button 1811, then control is given to step 1237. - If the user action is a click on the “Focus Level Definition Manager” push-
button 1812, then control is given to step 1234. - If the user action is a click on the “Done/Quit” push-
button 1808, or on the closing-window push-button 1802, then control is given to step 1233. - At
step 1233, the Focus SettingManager Dialog Box 1801 is closed on thedisplay device 106. This completes the execution of the FocusSettingMgr command as control is returned back to the calling method having issued the FocusSettingMgr command. - At
step 1234, the Focus LevelManager Dialog Box 1701 is displayed on thedisplay device 106. - At
step 1235, the command RefreshFocusLevelList is issued to launch the corresponding method for refreshing the focus level lists of the currently managed FMROC. When this RefreshFocusLevelList command returns control to the FocusSettingMgr command, control is given to step 1236. - At
step 1236, the command FocusLevelMgr is issued to launch the corresponding method for managing the focus levels of the currently managed FMROC. When this FocusLevelMgr command returns control to the FocusSettingMgr command, control is given to step 1231. - At
step 1237, the local variable HOffset is decremented by 1 (one). Then control is given to step 1202. - At
step 1238, the local variable HOffset is incremented by 1 (one). Then control is given to step 1202. - At
step 1239, the local variable VOffset is decremented by 1 (one). Then control is given to step 1202. - At

step 1232. - The local variable Criteria is set equal to the local variable HCriteria.
- The local variable HVLRange is set equal to the local variable HLRange.
- The local variable HVRange is set equal to the local variable HRange.
- The local variable CriteriaOffset is set equal to the local variable HCriteria Offset.
- At

step 1244, the content of the cell represented by he local variable VLevelCell is set equal to the vertical level selected within thelist box 1805. - At
step 1245, some local variables are initialized: - The local variable OldLevel is initialized with the content of the cell VLevelCell.
- The local variable NewLevel is initialized as being the content of the cell VLevelCell. It is therefore the vertical level which has been selected at the
step 1232. - The local variable Criteria is set equal to the local variable VCriteria.
- The local variable HVLRange is set equal to the local variable VLRange.
- The local variable HVRange is set equal to the local variable VRange.
