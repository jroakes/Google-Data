USING BOUNDARIES ASSOCIATED WITH A MAP VIEW
FOR BUSINESS LOCATION SEARCHING
BACKGROUND
Field of the Invention Implementations described herein relate generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to using boundaries associated with a given map view for retrieving the location of businesses located within the boundaries of the map view.
Description of Related Art The World Wide Web ("web") contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested. Generally, search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
The goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) to the user based on the search query. Typically, the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages (e.g., using an index). Web pages that contain the user's search terms are considered "hits" and are returned to the user as links.
Local search engines are search engines that attempt to return relevant web pages and/or business listings within a certain distance of a specific geographic location. For a local search, a user may enter a search query and may specify a geographic location around which the search query is to be performed. The local search engine may return relevant results, such as relevant web pages pertaining to the geographic area or listings of businesses that are located within a certain distance of a center of the specified geographic location. For example, if one searches for restaurants in the San Franciso Bay area using an existing graphical map search interface (e.g., a local search using Google Maps ) only the most relevant restaurants within a certain distance of the very center point of the map will be provided to the searching user. The searching user, however, may find it more desirable to locate the most relevant restaurants over the entire area of the map displayed to the user, and not just those within a certain distance of the center point of the map.
SUMMARY
According to one aspect, a computer-implemented method may include providing a first map to a user, the first map including a geographic region having first boundaries. The method may further include receiving an indication of a boundary reselection from the user and providing a second map to the user, the second map including a geographic region having second boundaries, where the second boundaries are different than the first boundaries.
The method may also include identifying a geographic search area based on the second boundaries, searching location information to identify entities located within the identified geographic search area, and providing the identified entities, and associated geographic location information, to the user.
According to another aspect, a method may include aggregating entity location information from a group of documents distributed among a group of locations in a network and searching the entity location information to

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
Consistent with aspects of the invention, entities (e.g., businesses) that are the most relevant to a given search query and that are located within an entire area of a map view presented to the user, and not just those within a certain distance from the center point of the map view, may be provided to a searching user. A broad area defined by the outer boundaries of a map view, the extent of which may be changed by the user, may, thus, be used to search a corpus of location listings (e.g., business location listings, residential location listings, government office location listings, etc.) that may have been aggregated from multiple documents hosted at multiple distributed locations in a network.
A "document," as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web site, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, a digital map, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.). A
"link," as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document.
OVERVIEW
FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary overview of an implementation of the invention in which different zoom level views of a map document may be used to define a geographic region that may further be used to identify businesses that are located within the boundaries of the geographic region. As shown in FIG. 1, a server (not shown) may provide a map document 100 to a user at a client (not shown) in response to a geographic location provided by the user. Map document 100 may include a zoom level view 110 of the geographic location provided by the user. The user may additionally provide a search query related to a type of business that the user desires to locate within a geographic region bounded by zoom level view 110 of the map document. The user may "move"
north, south, east or west with respect to zoom level view 110 of the map document, or may change the scale of zoom level view 110 by "zooming in" or "zooming out" of the zoom level view 110. With each view change by the user, the server may provide an updated zoom level view 110 of the map document that corresponds to the change in scale, or to the direction the user has moved with respect to the previous view. As shown in FIG. 1, zoom level view 110 may have boundaries that encompass a specific geographic region at a specific scale.
Once the user has obtained the desired geographic region, at the desired scale, of the map document, the user may initiate a search of businesses located within the desired geographic region. The server may search a database of businesses, along with associated business location information and business contact information, that has been produced by fetching and aggregating multiple documents hosted at multiple distributed locations in a network. Business location information derived from the aggregated documents may be indexed, and this index may be searched to retrieve businesses that are located within the boundaries of the entirety of zoom level map view 110 selected by the user. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, a latitude (lat) and longitude (Ion) may be determined to be associated with each of the boundaries (e.g., each corner when the map is rectangular) of zoom level map view 110. The index may be searched to retrieve businesses that have corresponding latitude and longitude location information located within the entirety of the geographic region bounded by zoom level map view 110.
EXEMPLARY NETWORK CONFIGURATION
FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network 200 in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented. Network 200 may include multiple clients 210 connected to one or more servers 220-230 via a network 240. Two clients 210 and two servers 220-230 have been illustrated as connected to network 240 for simplicity. In practice, there may be more or fewer clients and servers. Also, in some instances, a client may perform some functions of a server and a server may perform some functions of a client.
According to a further aspect, a computer-implemented method may include defining a first geographic region associated with a digital map based on first user input. The method may further include searching business location information to identify businesses located within the entirety of the first geographic region.

Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
EXEMPLARY PROCESS FOR INDEXING
BUSINESS LOCATION INFORMATION
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for fetching, aggregating and indexing business location information extracted from multiple documents that may be hosted at distributed locations in a network. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the process exemplified by FIG. 4 can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 330, ROM 340, or storage device 350 of server 220.
The exemplary process may begin with fetching and aggregating documents whose content includes business location information (block 400). The business location information may, for example, include a name, an address and contact information associated with one or more specific businesses. The business location information may also include a latitude and longitude associated with the address of the business. The documents that are fetched and aggregated may include authoritative documents the content of which are considered highly accurate or trustworthy. For example, documents associated with the "yellow pages" may be fetched and aggregated to extract address information associated with businesses. The address information may, in turn, be translated to geographic latitude and longitude information.
The business location information for each business contained in the aggregated documents may be indexed (block 410). Existing techniques may be used to index the business location information so that the business location information can be efficiently searched.
Input device 360 may include a conventional mechanism that permits an operator to input information to the client/server entity, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc.
Output device 370 may include a conventional mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc. Communication interface 380 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables the client/server entity to communicate with other devices and/or systems. For example, communication interface 380 may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such as network 240.
The client/server entity, consistent with the principles of the invention, may perform certain operations or processes, as will be described in detail below. The client/server entity may perform these operations in response to processor 320 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 330. A
computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave.
The software instructions may be read into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 350, or from another device via communication interface 380. The software instructions contained in memory 330 may cause processor 320 to perform operations or processes that will be described later.
Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
EXEMPLARY PROCESS FOR INDEXING
BUSINESS LOCATION INFORMATION
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for fetching, aggregating and indexing business location information extracted from multiple documents that may be hosted at distributed locations in a network. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the process exemplified by FIG. 4 can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 330, ROM 340, or storage device 350 of server 220.
The exemplary process may begin with fetching and aggregating documents whose content includes business location information (block 400). The business location information may, for example, include a name, an address and contact information associated with one or more specific businesses. The business location information may also include a latitude and longitude associated with the address of the business. The documents that are fetched and aggregated may include authoritative documents the content of which are considered highly accurate or trustworthy. For example, documents associated with the "yellow pages" may be fetched and aggregated to extract address information associated with businesses. The address information may, in turn, be translated to geographic latitude and longitude information.
The business location information for each business contained in the aggregated documents may be indexed (block 410). Existing techniques may be used to index the business location information so that the business location information can be efficiently searched.
-5-A prominence score associated with each indexed business may be determined (optional block 420). The prominence score may be used in ranking businesses returned as results of a search. In one implementation, the scoring techniques described in co-pending U.S. Application No. 11/138,670, entitled "Scoring Local Search Results Based on Location Prominence," may be used to score each indexed business.
EXEMPLARY ZOOM LEVEL MAP VIEW
BUSINESS LOCATION IDENTIFICATION PROCESS
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for identifying the location of one or more businesses within the visible boundaries of a displayed map according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the process exemplified by FIG. 5 can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 330, ROM 340, or storage device 350 of server 220.
The exemplary process may begin with providing a map document to a user that includes a selected geographic location (block 500). For example, a user may provide a geographic location, such as, for example, Washington, D.C., to server 220. As shown in FIG. 6, the user may enter a city (e.g., Washington, D.C.) in a location search field 610 of a map document 600. In response, as further shown in FIG. 6, server 220 may update map document 600 to include a zoom level map view 640 of the geographic location selected by the user. Map view 640 may include a default scale that, for example, displays the entirety of a region that encompasses the user provided geographic location (e.g., the areas of Virginia and Maryland that surround Washington, D.C.).
A determination may be made whether the user has re-selected the map boundaries (block 510). The user may re-select the map boundaries by "moving" east, north, south or west of zoom level map view 640, or by "zooming in" or "zooming out" of zoom level map view 640. For example, the user may "zoom in" on the zoom level map view 640 (e.g., by "clicking" on a "zoom in" icon) to produce, as shown in FIG. 7, a small scale zoom level map view 700 of a portion of Washington, D.C. The user may select zoom control 710 (e.g., by "clicking" on a portion of the zoom control icon) to "zoom in" or "zoom out" of map view 700. The user may "move" east, north, south, or west of the zoom level map view 700 by selecting view displacement control 720. If the user has re-selected the map boundaries, then the exemplary process may return to block 500 with the provision of an updated map document to the user that includes the new zoom level map view with re-selected map boundaries.
A search query may be received from the user (block 520). The search query may specify the type of business that the user desires to display within zoom level map view 700. For example, as shown in FIG. 6, the user may enter a business type (e.g., pizza, coffee, groceries, etc.) in search field 620 of a map document 600 and may then select a search button 630.
The boundaries of the zoom level map view may be identified as the geographic search area (block 530).
For example, the area defined by the latitude and longitude (lat, Ion) corresponding to each corner of zoom level map view 700 may be used as the geographic search area. As a specific example, the upper corner of a zoom level map view may be at latitude 37.557800 and longitude -122.276031 and the lower corner of the zoom level map view may be at latitude 38.557800 and longitude -123.276031. In this specific example, the zoom level map view may include a rectangle of height equal to latitude 1 and a width equal to longitude 1.

FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for identifying the location of one or more businesses within the visible boundaries of a displayed map according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the process exemplified by FIG. 5 can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 330, ROM 340, or storage device 350 of server 220.
The exemplary process may begin with providing a map document to a user that includes a selected geographic location (block 500). For example, a user may provide a geographic location, such as, for example, Washington, D.C., to server 220. As shown in FIG. 6, the user may enter a city (e.g., Washington, D.C.) in a location search field 610 of a map document 600. In response, as further shown in FIG. 6, server 220 may update map document 600 to include a zoom level map view 640 of the geographic location selected by the user. Map view 640 may include a default scale that, for example, displays the entirety of a region that encompasses the user provided geographic location (e.g., the areas of Virginia and Maryland that surround Washington, D.C.).

The user may re-select the map boundaries by "moving" east, north, south or west of zoom level map view 640, or by "zooming in" or "zooming out" of zoom level map view 640. For example, the user may "zoom in" on the zoom level map view 640 (e.g., by "clicking" on a "zoom in" icon) to produce, as shown in FIG. 7, a small scale zoom level map view 700 of a portion of Washington, D.C. The user may select zoom control 710 (e.g., by "clicking" on a portion of the zoom control icon) to "zoom in" or "zoom out" of map view 700. The user may "move" east, north, south, or west of the zoom level map view 700 by selecting view displacement control 720. If the user has re-selected the map boundaries, then the exemplary process may return to block 500 with the provision of an updated map document to the user that includes the new zoom level map view with re-selected map boundaries.
A search query may be received from the user (block 520). The search query may specify the type of business that the user desires to display within zoom level map view 700. For example, as shown in FIG. 6, the user may enter a business type (e.g., pizza, coffee, groceries, etc.) in search field 620 of a map document 600 and may then select a search button 630.
The boundaries of the zoom level map view may be identified as the geographic search area (block 530).
For example, the area defined by the latitude and longitude (lat, Ion) corresponding to each corner of zoom level map view 700 may be used as the geographic search area. As a specific example, the upper corner of a zoom level map view may be at latitude 37.557800 and longitude -122.276031 and the lower corner of the zoom level map view may be at latitude 38.557800 and longitude -123.276031. In this specific example, the zoom level map view may include a rectangle of height equal to latitude 1 and a width equal to longitude 1.
-6-The indexed business location information (e.g., indexed in block 410 above) may be searched to identify businesses located within the entire geographic search area that are relevant to the search query (block 540). For example, the latitude and longitude coordinates associated with each indexed business that is determined to be relevant to the search query may be compared with the latitudes and longitudes associated with the geographic search area. As a result of this comparison, businesses that lie within the geographic search area may be identified.
The identified businesses may then be ranked (block 550). The identified business may be ranked using various scoring techniques. For example, in one implementation, the prominence score optionally determined for each business in block 420 above may be used to rank the identified businesses. Other techniques, however, may be used for ranking the identified businesses, such as, for example, ranking the identified businesses based on their proximity to one or more geographic locations (e.g., a business closer to a specific geographic location may be ranked higher than a business that is farther from the specific geographic location). The ranked identified businesses may be provided to the user (block 560). As shown in FIG. 7, a ranked list of businesses 740 may be provided to the user, with each business in the list including a map identifier 730, which visually indicates the location of a business on zoom level map view 700.
CONCLUSION
Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention enable the searching of a corpus of location listings, that may have been aggregated from multiple documents hosted at multiple distributed locations in a network, using a graphical interface that provides a map view to a user.
Using the graphical interface, a user may search the corpus of location listings to identify entities, such as businesses, that are the most relevant to a given search query and that are located within an entire area of a map view presented to the user. The user may "zoom in," "zoom out," or traverse north, south, east or west with respect to a given map view to change the outer boundaries of the map view, thus, altering the extent of the geographic region over which entities are searched.
