Definitions
- This specification relates to generating a related group of search result documents from an initial group of search result documents.
- Internet search engines provide information about Internet accessible search result documents (e.g., Web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content) that are responsive to a user's search query by returning a set of search results for the query.
- a search result includes, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and a snippet of information for resources responsive to a query.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- Users are presented with many search results and view a subset of search result documents corresponding to the search results over time. Users may also browse various documents available on the Internet.
- This specification describes technologies relating to generating a related group of search result documents from an initial group of search result documents.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for identifying one or more second documents related to one or more first documents that include the actions of determining a respective strength of relationship score between each candidate document in a group of one or more candidate documents and each first document by aggregating user selection data for users.
- the first documents and the candidate documents are in a corpus of web documents, and the user selection data indicates, for each user, whether the user viewed the candidate document during a window of time after the first document is presented to the user on a search results web page in response to a query.
- the method further includes calculating an aggregate strength of relationship score for each candidate document from the respective strength of relationship scores for the candidate document and selecting the second documents from the candidate documents according to the aggregate strength of relationship scores for the candidate documents.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the operations of the methods.
- the user selection data can further indicate whether each user viewed the candidate document for a threshold period of time.
- Aggregating user selection data can further comprise scaling the user selection data for one of the users by a scoring factor when the user views the candidate document during the window of time after the first document is selected by the user from the search results web page.
- Determining a respective strength of relationship score between each candidate document and each first document can further comprise using a popularity of the candidate document to normalize the respective strength of relationship score.
- the one or more second documents can be associated with a natural language, and determining a respective strength of relationship score between each candidate document and each first document can further include scaling the strength of relationship score by a percentage of users who viewed the candidate document and are associated with the natural language.
- the embodiments can further include identifying one or more documents responsive to a query as the first documents, and generating an augmented set of documents responsive to the query by including one or more of the second documents in the first documents.
- the embodiments can further include receiving the query and presenting the augmented set of documents in response to the query.
- the embodiments can further include selecting the one or more first documents from documents a first user has viewed for a second period of time and presenting the one or more second documents as suggested documents.
- Presenting the one or more second documents as suggested documents can include presenting the one or more second documents in a toolbar.
- the embodiments can further include receiving input from a second user indicating that one or more of the first documents are preferred documents and calculating a respective document weight for each preferred document. Calculating the aggregate strength of relationship score for each candidate document can include weighting the strength of relationship scores for the candidate document and each preferred document by the respective document weight for the preferred document. The embodiments can further include receiving input from the second user indicating that one or more of the first documents are disliked documents and calculating a respective document weight for each disliked document. Calculating the aggregate strength of relationship score for each candidate document can include weighting the strength of relationship scores for the candidate document and each disliked document by the respective document weight for the disliked document. The embodiments can further include presenting one or more of the second documents as suggested documents.
- the embodiments can further include selecting the one or more first documents based on one or more first queries issued during a session, where each of the first documents is responsive to one of the first queries, identifying one or more second queries corresponding to the one or more second documents from data associating queries and documents, and presenting the one or more second queries as suggested queries.
- a related set of “better” documents can be generated from an initial set of documents.
- the initial documents can be documents that a user has viewed during a search session, documents that a user has browsed (i.e., viewed), or documents that a user has bookmarked.
- the related set of documents can be used to generate suggested documents for a user.
- the related set of documents can be used to return more relevant search results in response to users, for example, through session-based ranking, where search results are ranked in the overall context of a session of user search queries, or by augmenting a set of search results responsive to a search query with other related documents.
- the related set of documents can be used to generate suggested queries.

- FIG. 1 shows a visual display of search results and documents
- search results and documents can be presented to the user in various ways, including through aural and haptic presentation.
- the user issues a query 110 for “San Francisco” through the search engine user interface 102 .
- a search engine generates relevant search results 112 and 114 and presents them to the user.
- the user clicks e.g., selects with a mouse or through interaction with another input device such as, for example, a keyboard, a microphone, a camera, or a tactile input device
- a search result for “Cheap San Francisco Hotels” 112 e.g., selects with a mouse or through interaction with another input device such as, for example, a keyboard, a microphone, a camera, or a tactile input device

- the user interface changes to 106 where the user issues a new query 118 for “San Francisco Vacation.”
- the search engine generates relevant search results 120 and 122 and presents them to the user.
- FIG. 2A is a graph that models relationships between documents based on the user's interactions with the documents as described in FIG. 1 .
- the source nodes on the left hand side of the graph include four nodes, each corresponding to a document presented as a search result in FIG. 1 .
- Node 202 corresponds to the “Cheap San Francisco Hotels” document presented as search result 112 in FIG. 1
- node 204 corresponds to the “Child Friendly SF Vacation” document presented as search result 114 in FIG. 1
- node 206 corresponds to the “Visitors' Guide to Alcatraz” search result document presented as search result 120 in FIG.
- node 208 corresponds to the “Delicious Eats by the Bay” search result document presented as search result 122 in FIG. 1 .
- the sink nodes on the right hand side of the graph include two nodes, one for each document that the user viewed (e.g., node 210 for “Cheap San Francisco Hotels” and node 212 for “Delicious Eats by the Bay”).
- the directed edges from the source nodes to the sink nodes represent a relationship between the documents corresponding to the nodes.
- FIG. 2A there is a directed edge from a source node to a sink node when a search result for the document corresponding to the source node (“source search result”) was presented in a set of search results and the user viewed the document corresponding to the sink node (“sink document”) within a given time period after the source search result was presented to the user.
- source search result a search result for the document corresponding to the source node
- sink document sink node
- the user viewed two documents, “Cheap San Francisco Hotels” 116 in user interface 104 and “Delicious Eats By the Bay” 124 in user interface 108 .
- the graph 200 includes directed edges from the “Child Friendly SF Vacation” node 204 to both the “Cheap San Francisco Hotels” node 210 and the “Delicious Eats by the Bay” node 212 .
- the graph 200 includes only one directed edge from the Visitors Guide to Alcatraz node 206 , and the edge goes to the Delicious Eats by the Bay node 212 .
- a given search result is considered to have been presented to a user only if the user clicks on the given search result or a search result below the given search result in the order of search results.
- Visitors Guide to Alcatraz 120 would be considered to have been presented to the user, because the user clicked on Delicious Eats by the Bay 122 which is below the Visitors Guide to Alcatraz 120 .
- Delicious Eats by the Bay 122 would also be considered to have been presented to the user because the user clicked on Delicious Eats by the Bay 122 .
- Child Friendly SF Vacation 114 would not be considered to have been presented to the user, because the user did not click on it or any search results below it.
- source nodes are related to sink nodes only when a user clicks on the search result document corresponding to the source node before viewing the search result document corresponding to the sink node. For example, in FIG. 1 , the user never selected search results “Child Friendly SF Vacation” 114 or “Visitors' Guide to Alcatraz” 120 . Therefore, in these implementations, the graph 200 would not include any edges from either the Child Friendly SF Vacation node 204 or the Visitors' Guide to Alcatraz node 206 .
- source nodes are related to sink nodes only when the time during which the user viewed the sink document satisfies a threshold. For example, a sink document could have to be viewed for a minimum amount of time. The minimum amount of time can be determined, for example, empirically.
- source nodes are related to sink nodes only when the time between when the user was presented with and/or clicked the source node and viewed the sink document satisfies a threshold. For example, the sink document could have to be viewed within a given time period (e.g., two hours) of visiting the source document.
- the edges are weighted, for example, by the time the user spent viewing the sink document, or by whether the user viewed the sink document after clicking on the source document or merely being presented with the source document. For example, longer viewing times can be given a higher weight, and edges from source nodes whose source results were clicked on rather than just presented can be given a higher weight.
- the system maintains additional state data to avoid double counting documents, for example, in the situation where a user is presented with a search result for document A, views document B, is presented with a search result for document A, and then views document C. Document C would be counted only one time for document A, even though it was viewed after document A was presented two times.
- FIG. 2B is a graph that models relationships between documents generated from aggregate data from multiple users' interactions with the documents.
- the graph includes source nodes for documents A 252 , B 254 , C 256 , and D 258 and sink nodes for documents X 260 , Y 262 , and Z 264 .
- the directed edges from source nodes to sink nodes represent a relationship derived from aggregated user selection data (e.g., an aggregation of the edges described above with reference to FIG. 2A ).
- the edges are weighted according to a score for each source document and each sink document.
- the scores represent the conditional probability that the sink document will be viewed given that the source document has been presented to the user in a results list, e.g.
- the scores can be calculated in various ways, for example, by dividing the number of users who viewed the sink document after being presented with the source document by the number of users who viewed the source document, or summing the weights assigned to individual user selection (e.g., as described above with reference to FIG. 2A ), and then dividing by the total number of times the source document was presented.
- the aggregated edge values can optionally be smoothed using standard statistical methods such as Laplace smoothing or Dirichlet smoothing. Other techniques for calculating the individual scores are also possible. For example, any score that indicates a strength of relationship, or similarity in preference, between documents can be used.
- the weighted edges shown in FIG. 2B can be used, for example, by a set improver engine, to identify a set of related documents that are related to a set of initial documents.
- the set improver engine selects a group of documents, such as documents A, B, C, and D, and calculates the aggregate strength of relationships for each of the documents connected to other documents (e.g., documents X, Y, and Z), and then selects related documents based on the aggregate strength of relationship scores.
- the aggregate strength of relationship score represents the conditional probability that a sink document will be viewed by a user given that the set of source documents were presented to the user.
- the set improver engine can sum, average, or otherwise combine the strength of relationship scores between individual documents to calculate the aggregate strength of relationship scores.
- the group score (0.28) for document X is calculated by summing the scores from document A to document X (0.15), document B to document X (0.05) and document D to document X (0.08).
- the group scores for document Y (0.40) and document Z (0.10) can be similarly calculated.
- the set improver engine selects the related documents based on the scores, for example, by selecting a fixed number of documents with the highest scores, or by selecting all documents whose score exceeds a threshold. For example, if the threshold is 0.15, then documents X and Y will be selected as related documents for the group of documents A, B, C, and D, but document Z will not.
- the fixed number and the threshold can be determined, for example, empirically.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example search system 314 for providing search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 314 is an example of an information retrieval system that can be used to generate the search results shown in FIG. 1 , as well as to collect user selection data that the optional set improver engine 360 can use to generate related groups of documents from an initial group of documents.
- a user 302 interacts with the search system 314 through a client device 304 .
- the client device 304 can be a computer (e.g., a personal computer, a mobile phone, etc.) coupled to the search system 314 through a wired or wireless local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- the search system 314 and the client device 304 are one machine.
- a user can install a desktop search application on the client device 304 .
- the client device 304 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 306 and a processor 308 .
- RAM random access memory
- a user 302 submits a query 310 to a search engine 330 within a search system 314 .
- the query 310 is transmitted through a network to the search system 314 .
- the search system 314 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 314 includes an index database 322 and a search engine 330 .
- the search system 314 responds to the query 310 by generating search results 328 , which are transmitted through the network to the client device 304 in a form that can be presented to the user 302 (e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 304 ).
- the search engine 330 When the query 310 is received by the search engine 330 , the search engine 330 identifies documents that match the query 310 .
- the search engine 330 will generally include an indexing engine 320 that indexes web documents (e.g., web pages, images, multimedia content, or news articles on the Internet) found in a corpus (e.g., a collection or repository of content), an index database 322 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 352 (or other software) to rank the documents that match the query 310 .
- the indexing and ranking of the documents can be performed, for example, using conventional techniques.
- the search engine 330 transmits the search results 328 through the network to the client device 304 for presentation to the user 302 .
- the search system further includes a set improver engine 360 which generates related sets of search result documents from initial sets of documents.
- the search engine uses the sets generated by the set improver engine 360 to rank documents responsive to the user's query or to identify documents and queries to present to the user.
- the set improver engine 360 is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example of building a model database 402 for use by the set improver engine.
- the model database 402 is one or more databases that aggregate information indicative of user behavior for pairs of documents.
- information in the model database 402 is used as input to a process that generates a set of related documents from a set of initial documents.
- a document is referenced by a universal resource locator (URL) in the model database 402 ; however, other types of document references are possible.
- a document can be a web page on the World Wide Web referenced by a URL, or can be referenced by a globally unique user id (GUID) determined by an information retrieval system or the set improver engine.
- GUID globally unique user id
- a user submits a query 404 such as, for instance, “pizza” to an information retrieval system, such as a search system 314 , through a graphical user interface 406 , or other user interface, as provided on a personal computer, a mobile telephone, or other device.
- the user interface can be, for example, the user interface 102 shown in FIG. 1 , or another user interface.
- a query includes one or more terms.
- a query can include the terms “bus,” “river” and “hotel.”
- terms can include special characters, numbers, mathematical expressions, Boolean expressions, slang terms, names, titles, images, sounds, videos, other suitable query terms, and combinations of these.
- query terms can be in more than one language.
- the search system 314 In response to the user selecting the search button 408 or issuing a search command, the search system 314 returns a ranking or result list 410 which is an ordered list of search results for documents that are responsive to the query 404 .
- the result list 410 includes two search results, URL A 410 a and URL B 410 b .
- the result list 410 can contain the text of the URL itself, a short description of the information found within each document, a snapshot of the portion of the document which contains the query, other suitable information, or a combination of these.
- a user then continues to issue search queries or view documents, and, at a later period in time the user views the document corresponding to URL D 412 in user interface 414 .
- the model database 402 is built as users interact with search engines and view documents.
- the search system 314 or another system, tracks which search results are presented to a user and which documents a user views within a period of time after being presented with the search result.
- the period of time can be a fixed period of time, for example, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 10 hours, or 24 hours from when the search result is presented.
- the period of time is a fixed window of time (e.g., a 24 hour window that resets every 24 hours, regardless of when the search result is presented).
- the period of time is a user session.
- a user session is a period during which a user submits queries.
- a user session can be measured in a number of ways including, for example, by a specified period of time (for example, thirty minutes), by a specified number of queries (for example, fifteen queries), until a specified period of inactivity (for example, ten minutes without submitting a query), while a user is logged-in to a system, or while a user submits queries that relate to similar topics.
- the system also tracks whether the second document was viewed after being presented in response to a query that overlaps with the query the first document was presented in response to, and only relates the two documents in the model when the queries overlap.
- Overlapping queries are queries that have one or more words in common.
- the system tracks that the user is presented with search results for URL A 410 a and URL B 410 b , and then later views URL D 412 .
- the system also uses a timer to measure how long the user views the document.
- the search system or another system creates records (e.g., 416 a and 416 b ) in the model database 402 for each search result that is presented to a user, and each document a user views within a time period after being presented with the search result.
- Each record is at least a combination of the URL presented to the user (e.g., 410 a and 410 b ), a document later viewed by the user (e.g., 412 ), and aggregate user data (e.g., 418 a and 418 b ) for all users who view the document after the URL is presented to the user.
- the aggregate user data is a representation of user behavior and can be, for example, the individual strength of relationship scores described above with reference to FIG. 2B .
- the search system or another system only includes entries for a pair of documents when a user clicks on the first document and then later views the second document (and not when the first document is merely presented as a search result).
- the search system or another system maintains multiple models, for example, one storing data for documents that were presented, and one storing data for documents that were clicked on.
- model data is specific to a geographic location (e.g., a city, metropolitan region, state, country, or continent), specific to a language preference of users (e.g., as specified by the users in a profile or as determined from user search behavior, for example, the language of the queries issued by the user), or specific to a locale (e.g., specific to a geographic location or a set of geographic locations, and optionally a language preference).
- a geographic location e.g., a city, metropolitan region, state, country, or continent
- a language preference of users e.g., as specified by the users in a profile or as determined from user search behavior, for example, the language of the queries issued by the user
- a locale e.g., specific to a geographic location or a set of geographic locations, and optionally a language preference.
- the model can alternatively, or additionally, track what documents a user views after a user views a given document, independent of what, if any, search results are presented.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example set improver engine 502 (e.g., the set improver engine 360 ).
- the set improver engine receives a set of first documents 504 and selects a set of documents 506 related to the first documents 504 from a set of candidate documents 508 .
- the set of candidate documents 508 can be, for example, all documents included in the model 402 described in FIG. 4 , or a subset of the documents.
- the candidate documents and the first documents are in the same corpus of web documents.
- the set improver engine 502 includes a strength of relationship score generator 510 and a selection engine 512 .
- the boxes shown in FIG. 5 logically represent executing software components or modules. These components can be combined or subdivided in ways other than those shown in FIG. 5 and can be distributed on two or more computing devices.
- the relationship score generator 510 generates relationship scores for candidate documents based on a strength of relationship between each candidate document and the first documents.
- the selection engine 512 selects candidate documents based on the scores, for example, by selecting a top number of highest scoring candidate documents or selecting all candidate documents whose score exceeds a threshold, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 2B .
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example strength of relationship score generator 510 that generates a strength of relationship score for an individual document (e.g., candidate A 602 ) in a set of candidate documents 508 based on a strength of relationship to documents in a first set of documents 504 .
- the strength of relationship score generator 510 includes an individual document score generator 604 and a score aggregator 606 .
- the boxes shown in FIG. 6 logically represent executing software components or modules. These components can be combined or subdivided in ways other than those shown in FIG. 6 and can be distributed on two or more computing devices.
- the individual document score generator 604 generates a strength of relationship score between the candidate document 602 and each document in the first set of documents 504 from the model data 402 . For example, in FIG. 4 , the individual document score generator 604 generates five individual scores for candidate A 602 , one corresponding to each document in the first set of documents (Doc A, Doc B, Doc C, Doc D and Doc E). In some implementations, the individual document score generator 604 retrieves the entry corresponding to the first document and the candidate document from the model 402 and uses the aggregate data stored in the model as the strength of relationship score for the candidate document and the first document. In other implementations, the individual document score generator modifies the aggregate data stored in the model, for example, by scaling it before using the data as the individual document score.
- the individual document score generator combines aggregate data stored in multiple models. For example, if the model data 402 includes data from two models, one with entries corresponding to documents that were presented and documents that were viewed, and one corresponding to documents that were selected and documents that were viewed, the individual document score generator 604 can generate the score for the candidate document and the first document by combining the data stored in both models (e.g., adding or averaging the data). In some implementations, the individual score generator scales the data in one or more of the models relative to the data in the other models by a scoring factor. For example, the individual score generator can use a scoring factor (e.g., 10 ) to increase the weight given to data from the model where the first document was selected, rather than merely presented.
- a scoring factor e.g. 10
- the individual document score generator 604 assigns the documents a default score (e.g., 0). Other techniques of generating the score are also possible. For example, in some implementations, the individual document score generator 604 generates scores for multiple documents from the first set of documents and the candidate document. For example, the individual document score generator can generate a score for the candidate document given that both Document A and Document B were presented.
- the score aggregator 606 then aggregates the individual scores for the candidate document and each document in the set of first documents 504 resulting in an aggregate score 608 for the candidate document 602 .
- i) is used as the individual score for a candidate document g and a document i in the first set of documents.
- other individual scores are used instead of the conditional probability, for example, the joint probability P(g, i), or the scores described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- S(g) is the aggregate score for candidate document g over all documents i in the set of first documents.
- w i is the weight corresponding to document i.
- the weights can be positive or negative.
- a positive weight for a document i indicates that the document is representative of the documents the user is interested in (for example, because a user for whom the related set of documents is being generated has indicated that the user found that document relevant).
- a negative weight for a document i indicates that the document is not representative of the documents the user is interested in (for example, because a user for whom the related set of documents is being generated has indicated (implicitly or explicitly) that the user did not find the document relevant).
- the score aggregator normalizes the score for a candidate document by an overall popularity of the document, e.g., how often a population of users views the document compared to how often the population views other documents. For example, the score aggregator can divide by the score by the overall popularity of the candidate document (optionally weighted by the weights of the first documents), e.g.:
- P(g) is the overall popularity of the candidate document g.
- P(g) can be derived from user selection data, for example, by dividing the number of times that users viewed the document g by the number of times users viewed any document.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example technique 700 for generating a set of related documents from a set of initial documents.
- the example technique 700 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 700 .
- the system can be, for example, the set improver engine 502 .
- the system determines a respective strength of relationship score between candidate documents and first documents (step 702 ).
- the system determines each strength of relationship score from aggregate user selection data for a population of users.
- the user selection data indicates, for each user, whether the user viewed the candidate document during a window of time after the first document was presented to the user on a search results web page in response to a query.
- the user selection data is the data stored in the model 402 illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- the system determines the strength of relationship scores, for example as described above with reference to FIG. 6 .
- the first documents can be identified in various ways, for example, from a user search history, from a user's browsing history, or from a user's bookmarked web pages.
- the system identifies related documents that are tailored to a particular natural language, geographic location, or locale. For example, in some implementations, the system maintains separate models for different languages, locations, and locales, and uses the appropriate data to generate the related documents. In other implementations, the system does not maintain separate models but instead tracks what fraction of users viewing a candidate document are associated with the language, location, or locale, and then scales the model data according to the fractions. For example, if 90% of the time, people who view a candidate document are associated with the language French, and 5% of the time, people who view the candidate document are associated with the language English, then if the system is considering the candidate document for a user associated with the language English, then the scores for the candidate document would be scaled by 0.05.
- the system calculates an aggregate strength of relationship score for each candidate document (step 704 ).
- the system calculates the aggregate strength of relationship score from the individual strength of relationship scores for the candidate document, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 6 .
- the system identifies a set of one or more second documents from the set of candidate documents according to the aggregate strength of relationship scores (step 706 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the identified set of second documents can be used in various applications, some exemplary examples of which are described below.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example technique 800 for augmenting a set of search results responsive to a query with documents related to the query.
- the example technique 800 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 800 .
- the system can be, for example, a search system such as the search system 314 .
- the system selects a first set of one or more documents responsive to a search query (step 802 ).
- the query can be received from a user, or can be identified by the system, for example, by parsing past records of what queries users have submitted.
- the system identifies the set of documents responsive to the query, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the first set of documents is all documents responsive to the query.
- the first set of documents is a subset of the documents responsive to the query, for example, a top number of documents according to the rank assigned by the search system. The number can be determined, for example, empirically.
- the system obtains a second set of documents related to the first set of documents (step 804 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 7 .
- the system weights the individual scores for candidate documents and each first document by a weight that is inversely proportional to the rank of the first document in the first set of documents (e.g., the first document has the highest weight, the last document has the lowest weight).
- the system generates an augmented set of documents from the documents responsive to the query and the second set of documents (step 806 ).
- the system generates the augmented set of documents by inserting one or more of the documents from the second set of documents into the set of documents responsive to the query.
- the set of documents responsive to the query is ordered according to an order, and the system determines locations in the order at which to insert each of the second set of documents.
- the system can determine the locations in various ways, for example, by randomly selecting locations, or selecting locations based on the aggregated strength of relationship score for the document (e.g., by selecting higher locations when the aggregated strength of relationship score is higher).
- the system uses a framework that tests different locations for the second set of documents over time.
- the system generates the augmented set of documents in response to receiving the search query from the user, and then presents the augmented set of documents in response to the query, for example, by transmitting the search results to a user computer for presentation to the user, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system generates the augmented set of documents in advance and stores them as responsive documents to the query. When a user later submits the query, the system presents the augmented set of documents as the search result for the query.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example technique 900 for session based ranking of search results.
- the example technique 900 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 900 .
- the system can be, for example, a search system such as the search system 314 .
- the system receives a query (step 902 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 8 .
- the system selects a first set of documents from documents responsive to queries issued during a session (step 904 ). For example, during a user search session the system can track what queries a user submits (and optionally, what documents are responsive to those queries). The system then selects a number of the queries and a number of documents responsive to each query. The system can use various techniques to select the documents. In some implementations, the system selects all documents presented in response to a given number of past queries. The number of queries can be fixed (e.g., the past five queries) or can be all queries occurring within a set time window from when the query is issued (e.g., all queries issued in the last fifteen minutes).
- the system selects all documents responsive to the query received in step 902 (or alternatively, the last query issued before that) and all documents that a user selected after they were presented in response to a given number of past queries (e.g., the past five queries). In some implementations, the system only includes documents presented in response to queries that have some query overlap with the query.
- the system obtains a second set of documents related to the first set of documents (step 906 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 7 .
- the system assigns higher weights to individual scores for the candidate documents and documents in the first set of documents that are responsive to the query received in step 902 .
- the system ranks a set of documents responsive to the query using the second set of documents (step 908 ).
- the set of documents responsive to the query can be generated, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system ranks the set of documents responsive to the query by increasing the ranking of documents that are also in the second set of documents. For example, if each document responsive to the query has a score corresponding to its rank, the system can modify the score of the documents included in the second set of documents (e.g., by multiplying the score by a scaling factor or adding a constant to the score). The factor and/or constant can be determined, for example, empirically.
- the system can then rank the documents according to the modified scores.
- FIG. 10 illustrates an example technique 1000 for identifying a set of documents related to documents in a user's history (e.g., a user's search history, a history of what documents a user has viewed, or a set of documents bookmarked by a user), and then recommending the set of related documents.
- a user's history e.g., a user's search history, a history of what documents a user has viewed, or a set of documents bookmarked by a user
- the example technique 1000 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 1000 .
- the system can be, for example, a search system such as the search system 314 , or a toolbar running in a user's web browser.
- the system selects a first set of documents from a user's history (step 1002 ).
- the history is a search history that is maintained, for example, by the search system 314 .
- the search history tracks which queries a user submits and which documents a user views during a search session.
- the search history can correspond to a current user session or a given period of time (e.g., the last fifteen minutes, the last week, or the last few months).
- the system can select the first set of documents in various ways.
- the system selects documents that a user has viewed in the current session as the first set of documents (e.g., all of the documents viewed during the session, a number of the documents the user has viewed recently, such as the last five documents the user viewed, or all documents the user viewed in response to the last query the user submitted).
- the system selects documents that are responsive to one or more queries the user submitted during the current session.
- Other techniques for selecting the first set of documents are also possible, for example, in some implementations, the system selects the first set of documents from a set of bookmarked documents that the user has saved for future reference, or from a set of documents.
- the system obtains a second set of documents related to the first set of documents (step 1004 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 7 .
- the system weights the individual scores for the candidate documents and documents in the first set of documents according to when the documents in the first set of documents were viewed (e.g., by using weights that are determined according to a function of the time since the document was viewed, for example, a linear function whose result is higher when the period of time is shorter).
- the system weights the individual scores for the candidate documents and documents in the first set of documents based on the length of time that the documents in the first set of documents were viewed (e.g., weights the scores by weights determined according to a function of the time the documents were viewed, such as a linear function whose output is higher when the period of time is longer).
- the system presents the second set of documents to the user as suggested documents (step 1006 ).
- the system presents the first set of documents by presenting them in (or transmitting them to the user's computer for presentation in), for example, a search engine interface or a toolbar window.
- the system presents an “I'm Feeling Lucky” button to the user. When the user clicks on the button, the system causes the user's web browser to load the first document in the set of second documents.
- FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate example user interfaces for presenting recommended documents to users.

- the user interface 1150 includes the user's bookmarked pages 1152 , and also includes recommended documents 1154 generated from the bookmarked web pages.
- FIG. 12 illustrates an example technique 1200 for generating a set of documents related to a set of documents, based on user data indicating one or more preferred documents in the set of documents.
- the example technique 1200 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 1200 .
- the system can be, for example, a search system such as the search system 314 , or a toolbar running in a user's web browser.
- the system receives data indicating one or more preferred documents in a first set of documents (step 1202 ).
- the first set of documents can be, for example, a set of documents responsive to a search query, or the first set of documents described above with reference to FIG. 11 .
- the data indicating one or more preferred documents can be search history data, for example, how long a user viewed each of the documents (or whether the user viewed the documents), or it can be a user rating indicating, for example, that a document is preferred or that the user has given the document a certain score on a scoring scale (e.g., 3 out of 5 stars).
- the system determines weights for the preferred documents (step 1204 ).
- the weights are derived from the time the user viewed the document or the rating the user gave the document (e.g., the weights can be the time, the rating, or a factor derived from the time or the rating). In other implementations, the weights are fixed, e.g., each document that is preferred (e.g., because a user said it was preferred, viewed it for a threshold period of time, or gave it a rating above a threshold) is given the same weight.
- the system then obtains a second set of documents related to the first set of documents using the weight for the preferred documents (step 1206 ).
- the system can obtain the set of documents as described above with reference to FIG. 7 , where the strength of relationship scores between individual documents in the first set of documents and candidate documents are weighted during aggregation by the weights determined by the system.
- the system then presents the related documents to the user, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 11 .
- the system also receives data indicating that a user dislikes a document, determines weights for the disliked documents (e.g., negative weights, or weights less than 1), and obtains the second set of documents based on the weights for the preferred and disliked documents.
- weights for the disliked documents e.g., negative weights, or weights less than 1.
- FIG. 13 illustrates an example technique 1300 for generating a set of queries related to a set of documents, and then presenting the queries to a user as a set of suggested queries.
- the example technique 1300 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 1300 .
- the system can be, for example, a search system such as the search system 314 .
- the system selects a first set of documents from documents responsive to queries issued during a session (step 1302 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 9 .
- the system obtains a second set of documents related to the first set of documents, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 7 .
- the system generates a set of queries related to the second set of documents (step 1306 ).
- the system generates the set of related queries by mapping the second set of documents to a set of related queries, and then selecting the queries most often associated with the documents. For example, in some implementations, the system generates a list of queries for each document, where the document is responsive to the queries, counts the number of times each query is associated with a document, and then selects a number of the queries with the highest count (or all queries whose count exceeds a threshold).
- the number and the threshold can be determined, for example, empirically.
- the system uses a document-query database to identify queries that are related to documents from user preference data, where the user preference data indicates how often a user selects a document after viewing a query.
- the user preference data can be stored, for example, in a database that stores a tuple for each document and query pair.
- Each tuple identifies the document, the query, and includes aggregated click data for all users that select the document in response to the query.
- the aggregated click data can be, for example, a tuple score. In general, the tuple score estimates how responsive users found a given document to be as a search result for a given query.
- a tuple score can be an average of the weighted long clicks for a given document and query pair, a sum of the weighted clicks for a given document and query pair, or a click fraction for a given document and query pair.
- the clicks can be weighted by the length of the clicks (e.g., how long the user viewed the document), by how quickly a user clicked on a result, and whether a user clicked on a result first, second, third, etc.
- click fractions are possible.
- the click fraction is calculated by dividing the number of clicks (or the number of weighted clicks) by the number of impressions (e.g., the number of times the document was presented as a search result for the query). In other implementations, the click fraction is calculated by dividing the sum of the weighted clicks by the total number of clicks. In still other implementations, the click fraction is the sum of weighted clicks for the document presented in response to the query divided by sum of weighted clicks for all documents presented in response to the query. Other click fractions are also possible.
- the data is specific to a geographic location (e.g., a city, metropolitan region, state, country, or continent), specific to a language preference of users (e.g., as specified by the users in a profile or as determined from user search behavior, for example, the language of the queries issued by the user), or specific to a locale (e.g., specific to a geographic location or a set of geographic locations, and optionally a language preference).
- a geographic location e.g., a city, metropolitan region, state, country, or continent
- a language preference of users e.g., as specified by the users in a profile or as determined from user search behavior, for example, the language of the queries issued by the user
- a locale e.g., specific to a geographic location or a set of geographic locations, and optionally a language preference.
- the user preference data can be generated, for example, by a search engine or a user's browser.
- the system chooses a set of queries that covers the second set of documents (or a subset corresponding to the top scoring documents in the second set of documents) with minimal overlap. For example, if the top set of documents includes documents 1-9, query A is associated with documents 1, 2, 5, and 6, query B is associated with documents 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9, and query C is associated with documents 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, the system would select query A and query B and ignore query C, because queries A and B have no overlap in documents, and every document associated with query B is also associated with either query A or query B. Standard techniques can be used to select the queries such that they have minimum overlap in documents.
- the system presents the set of queries as suggested queries (step 1308 ).
- the system presents the first set of documents by presenting them in (or transmitting them to the user's computer for presentation in), for example, a search engine interface or a toolbar window.
- FIGS. 14A and 14B illustrate example user interfaces for presenting recommended queries to users.
- a search engine interface 1400 is shown. When a user enters a query 1402 for “San Francisco Vacation,” search results 1404 responsive to the query are presented. The user interface 1400 also presents recommended queries 1406 . When a user clicks on one of the recommended queries 1406 , a new search is performed for that query.
- a user interface 1450 containing a toolbar 1452 is shown. When the user clicks on the suggest button 1454 in the toolbar interface, a toolbar window appears that presents recommended queries 1456 to the user. If the user clicks on one of the recommended queries 1456 , a new search is performed for that query.

- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), e.g., the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- the strength of relationship score between each candidate document and each first document described above, for example, with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 can be based on other measures of relatedness between documents besides whether the user viewed the candidate document after the first document was presented as a search result.
- the strength of relationship can be based on how many users that viewed the first document later viewed the candidate document.
- the score for the first document and the candidate document is weighted by one or both of the number of documents users viewed between the two documents, or the amount of time that passed between the time the first document was viewed by a user and the second document was viewed by that user.
