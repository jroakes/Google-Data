Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing an offer sheet to a user. A method includes: receiving an image from a user and additional information about the image; evaluating the image to identify content included in the image including using optical character recognition to identify text included in the image and object recognition techniques to identify objects included in the image; identifying location information including one or more of location of where the image was captured, location associated with the content included in the image, or a current location of the user; identifying a plurality of eligible offers based on the identified content, the location information, the additional information, and a profile associated with the user; generating an offer sheet that includes the plurality of offers and a representation of the received image; and providing the offer sheet to the user.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive an image from a user and additional information about the image; evaluate the image to identify content included in the image including using optical character recognition to identify text included in the image and object recognition techniques to identify objects included in the image; identify location information including one or more of location of where the image was captured, location associated with the content included in the image, or a current location of the user; identify a plurality of eligible offers based on the identified content, the location information, the additional information, and a profile associated with the user; generate an offer sheet that includes the plurality of offers and a representation of the received image; and provide the offer sheet to the user.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes: a text recognizer configured to identify text included in an image received from a user; an object recognizer configured to identify objects included in the image; an offer identifier configured to: identify location information including one or more of location of where the image was captured, location associated with the content included in the image or a current location of the user; identify a plurality of eligible offers based on the identified content, the location information, additional information received with the image, and a profile associated with the user; and an offer sheet generator configured to: generate an offer sheet that includes the plurality of offers and a representation of the received image; and provide the offer sheet to the user.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The location information can be used to assist in identifying content included in the image. A plurality of images can be received, the plurality of images can be evaluated, and identifying the plurality of offers can be based on the evaluating. The image can be part of a scene, the scene can be received, the scene can be evaluated including evaluating images and audio associated with the scene, and the identifying can be based on the evaluating of the scene. Receiving the additional information can include receiving context information from the user along with the image and the context information can be used to identify the eligible offers. The context information can be of the form of an audible command signal that provides context for what the user is interested in related to the image. The user can be enabled to share the offer sheet with other users. Enabling can include providing a control to enable the user to name the offer sheet, store the offer sheet, augment the offer sheet with other metadata, or share the offer sheet with the other users. Generating the offer sheet can include generating a map portion for inclusion in the offer sheet including a map of an area related to a location associated with the image. Generating the map portion can include generating a map including one or more indicators, wherein each indicator can be associated with a location on the map that is relevant to an offer of the plurality of offers. The offer sheet can be maintained as a business page accessible by the user that is configured to be updated at each viewing by the user. Information from the evaluating can be stored in the profile for use in identifying other content to serve to the user at another time.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. A content provider can present offers to a user that relate to image content captured by the user. A user can receive offers based on a captured image, with the offers relating to one or more of text included in the image, an object included in the image, the location at which the image was captured or other data related to the image.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- A user can capture an image using a camera, mobile device, or some other device. The image can be, for example, of a landmark, printed material, or some other object. The image can be provided to a content management system in a number of ways. The content management system can evaluate the image to identify content included in the image, including using optical character recognition to identify text included in the image and object recognition techniques to identify objects included in the image. A set of offers can be identified based on the identified content and a profile associated with the user. An offer sheet can be generated and provided to the user, where the offer sheet includes the set of offers and, in some implementations, a representation (e.g., thumbnail) of the image.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, demographics, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to a user. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connects user devices 106 (e.g.,user devices content providers 108, acontent management system 110, and a search system 112. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands of user devices 106 andcontent providers 108. Thecontent providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. - A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the
network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers (e.g., theuser device 106 b), tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., theuser device 106 a), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants, digital cameras, such as adigital camera 106 c, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. A user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. Some or all user devices 106 can interface with ascanner 114 or with thedigital camera 106 c. - A
user 116 can use themobile device 106 a, thedigital camera 106 c, or thescanner 114 to capture an image. For example, a camera on themobile device 106 a or the digital camera can capture an image of a scene or an image of a document. Thescanner 114, for example, can be used to capture an image of a document. Other devices can be used to capture an image. As described in more detail below, other information can be captured in association with the image, such as location information, other images, audio signals (e.g., audio commands), and other context information. - A captured
image 118 can be provided to thecontent management system 110. The capturedimage 118 can be provided as a download/upload or in association with an application that is executing on a device that captured the image. In some implementations, theuser 116 can use an application that is associated with (e.g., provided by or linked to) thecontent management system 110 to capture theimage 118 and the application can be configured to automatically send capturedimages 118 to thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, images are captured over time and provided in a batch to thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, capturedimages 118 are uploaded in near real time. In some implementations, the user provides a manual input to the application to request that theimage 118 be sent to thecontent management system 110. In some implementations captured images are provided during predetermined periods, such as non-peak, low usage or high bandwidth periods, and held during other periods. - The
content management system 110 can evaluate the receivedimage 118 to identify content within theimage 118 or suggested by theimage 118. For example, atext recognizer 120 can use optical character recognition (OCR) to identify text included in theimage 118. As another example, anobject recognizer 122 can use object recognition techniques to identify objects included in theimage 118. Other tools can be used to identify content included in or suggested by a receivedimage 118. - Other information can be received along with an image. For example, metadata related to the image can be provided, wherein the metadata can include information about the image capture/generation device (e.g., the camera used to acquire the image), time of image capture, location of image capture or other related information.
- An
offer identifier 124 can identify a set of offers from anoffers data store 126 based on the content identified from theimage 118 and the other information received. For example, an offer can be identified if a keyword associated with the offer relates to content identified from theimage 118. As described in more detail below, other information, such as location information and other contextual information can be used to identify the offers. In some implementations, offers can be identified based on the content identified from theimage 118 and from information associated with the user that is identified from a user profiles data store 128. The user profile information can be based, for example, on user activities related to thecontent management system 110, the search system 112, and/or one or more other systems. - Offers can be of the form of advertisements, promotions, coupons, testimonials, discounts, incentives, suggestions, sample content, trials, or other forms of sponsored content. Offers can be associated with a content sponsor and can include selection criteria that are used to determine when and how a given offer is presented to a user. Selection of offers is discussed in greater detail below.
- An
offer sheet generator 130 can generate an offer sheet that includes the identified offers. The offer sheet can be provided to theuser device 106 a. Theuser 116 can view the offer sheet and previously generated offer sheets using, for example, anoffer sheet browser 131. For example, previously generated offer sheets can be stored in an offersheet data store 132 and can be retrieved in response to a request to view a particular offer sheet. An offer sheet can be named/or otherwise labeled for ease of indexing and retrieval. For example, a name or label associated with theimage 118 can be used as (or to generate) a label for a given offer sheet. Other data can be associated with the offer sheet such as date, time, location, user or other data related to the generation of the offer sheet or the image from which it was derived. - A previously generated offer sheet can be shared. For example, the
user 116 can share an offer sheet with auser 134. In some implementations, the shared offer sheet can be customized for theuser 134, such as based on information associated with theuser 134 that is identified in the user profiles data store 128. Such information can/will be different than the information associated with theuser 116. When the offer sheet is shared, customized information can be provided to theuser 134 while still maintaining a general theme associated with the offer sheet. The shared offer sheet can be provided to theuser device 106 b. For example, an offer sheet that relates to automobiles may include one or more offers that are the same for bothusers 116 and 134 (e.g., a general offer for auto financing) and others that are different (e.g., different offers from specific dealerships that are in proximity to a location associated with each of the respective users). A shared offer sheet can be customized for a particular user based on other factors, such as user activity (e.g., recent search requests sent to the search system 112). - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items (e.g., offers) using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. A content campaign can specify that a content item associated with a given campaign is eligible to be included in generated offer sheets. Thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - A
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 136 which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 136 specified by thecontent provider 108. Thecampaign parameters 136 can be stored in aparameters data store 138.Campaign parameters 136 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., offers or other forms of creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms. As another example, acontent provider 108 can designate as part of the selection criteria that one or more content items are eligible for presentation on a generated offer sheet. - Although illustrated as a client-server implementation, in some implementations, a service located on and installed on a user device 106 can evaluate a captured image, identify eligible offers from a database of offers stored on the user device 106, and generate an offer sheet to be presented on the user device 106 without any or limited interaction with a central service. Other system configurations are possible.

FIG. 2 is a block diagram of anexample system 200 for providing an offer sheet to a user. A user 202 (e.g., “user one”) located in or near San Diego captures animage 204 using amobile device 206. Theimage 204 can be sent to acontent server 208. In some implementations, location information indicating a location where theimage 204 was captured can be sent along with or in association with theimage 204. In some implementations, a user identifier (e.g., that is included with or as part of a cookie) can be received along with or in association with theimage 204. - The
content server 208 can evaluate theimage 204 to identify content included in the image. For example, thecontent server 208 can use object recognition techniques to identify objects included in the image, such as animage 209 of a car. As another example, thecontent server 208 can use OCR to identify text included in the image, such as thename 210 of a car model. - The
content server 208 can identify a set of offers for theuser 202 based, for example, on identified text (e.g., the car name 210), on identified objects (e.g., the car image 209), and/or on location information indicating where theimage 204 was captured. Thecontent server 208 can generate an offer sheet 216 that includes the set of identified offers. In some implementations, the offer sheet 216 includes a thumbnail 217 of the received image and includesoffers offer 218, an identified offer can include an image. Theoffer 218, which is an offer for “XYZ Car Reviews”, can be identified, for example, based on the identifiedcar name 210 and/or the identifiedcar image 209. Similarly, theoffer 221, which is an offer for XYZ cars for sale, can be identified based on the identifiedcar name 210 and/or the identifiedcar image 209. The offer 219, which is an offer for San Diego car financing, can be identified, for example, based on the identifiedcar name 210, the identifiedcar image 209, and on location information received with theimage 204. Theoffer 220, which is for an elite auto club catering to wealthy car owners, can be identified, for example, based on the identifiedcar name 210 and the identifiedcar image 209. - As an example, the
user 202 can take a picture of a vacation destination, for example, using themobile device 202. Animage 224 of the vacation destination can be provided to thecontent server 208. In some implementations, theuser 202 can provide context information along with theimage 224. For example, the user can, for example, speak an audible command that provides context for what the user is interested in related to the image. For example, the user can say “vacation”. The audible command can be recorded and can be sent to thecontent server 208 in association with the sending of theimage 224. - As another example, in some implementations, the
user 202 is presented a user interface such as auser interface 229, which includes a set of labels from which theuser 202 can select a label designation which provides context for a supplied image. For example, theuser 202 can select alandmark label 229 a. In some implementations, theuser 202 can enter a custom label using theuser interface 229. In some implementations, the set of labels are determined by thecontent server 208 based on content identified in theimage 224. - For example, the
content server 208 can evaluate image data of theimage 224 and can identify anobject 226 as an Eiffel Tower object and can identify text 228 (e.g., including “Paris” and “vacation”). Thecontent server 208 can identify a set of offers based on one or more of the identifiedEiffel Tower object 226, the identifiedtext 228, a received audio input (e.g., an audible command), a received label designation, and/or a user profile associated with theuser 202. Thecontent server 208 can generate anoffer sheet 236 that includes the identified set of offers, including offers 230, 231, 232, and 233. - The offers 231, 232, and 233 are offers for a Paris vacation, a Paris tour guide, and Paris maps, respectively, and may have been identified, for example, based on one or more of the identified
Eiffel Tower object 226, the identifiedtext 228, a received audio input, or a received label designation. The offer 230, which is for an army museum, may have been identified, at least in part, based on a user profile associated with theuser 202. For example, thecontent server 208 may have identified auser profile 238 for theuser 202 in a userprofile data store 240 and may have identified a “World War II” interest for theuser 202 in theuser profile 238. Thecontent server 208 may have identified the offer 230 as being associated with the World War II interest of theuser 202 and as being associated with, for example, the identifiedtext 228. - In some implementations, the
user 202 can share theoffer sheet 236 with another user, such as auser 244. Upon sharing theoffer sheet 236, a sharedoffer sheet 246 can be provided to auser device 248 of theuser 244. In some implementations, the sharedoffer sheet 246 can include a representation (e.g., a thumbnail 250) of theimage 224, and can include an annotation 252 added by theuser 202. Theuser 202 can annotate, or provide metadata, for the sharedoffer sheet 246 and/or for thepersonal offer sheet 236. - The shared
offer sheet 246 includesoffers offer sheet 246 can be the same set of offers as included in theoffer sheet 236. As another example, some or all of the offers included in the sharedoffer sheet 246 can be different from offers included in theoffer sheet 236. For example, some or all of the offers included in the sharedoffer sheet 236 can be customized for the receivinguser 244, such as based on auser profile 258 associated with theuser 244. For example, theoffers 255 and 256, which are for a French food book and for Paris restaurants walking tours, respectively, can be identified based on an interest of “food” of theuser 244 as determined from theuser profile 258 and based on content identified from theimage 224, such as the identifiedtext 228. In some implementations, a section of the sharedoffer sheet 246 is customized for the user 244 (e.g., the section can be an “offers for you” section). Other sections of the sharedoffer sheet 246 can include offers that are also included on theoffer sheet 236. For example, theoffer 254 corresponds to the offer 231. - A shared offer sheet (e.g., the offer sheet 246), as well as an original offer sheet (e.g., the
offer sheet 236, the offer sheet 216), can be dynamic, where the content of the shared or original offer sheet change over time in subsequent viewings of the shared or original offer sheet. For example, an offer sheet can be maintained as a business page that is accessible to one or more users. A user can, for example, use an offer sheet browser and select a previously generated offer sheet for viewing. - For example, the
user 202 may open the previously generated offer sheet 216 while vacationing in or near San Francisco, as illustrated by anoffer sheet 260 displayed on auser device 262. Theoffer sheet 260 can be updated, as compared to the offer sheet 216, based, for example, on one or more of a time of day, time of year, updated profile or interests or location of theuser device 262. Updated offers can include offers that may not have been relevant when theuser 202 previously viewed the offer sheet 216. For example, theoffer sheet 260 includesoffers 264, 265, and 266. The offer 264 may be identified, for example, based on the offer 264 corresponding to a sale occurring on the current day and on the offer 264 being related to content identified from theimage 204 which is associated with theoffer sheet 260. Theoffers 265 and 266 may be identified, for example, based on the location of theuser device 262 and on the respective offers 265 and 266 each being related to content identified from theimage 204. - In some implementations, the
user 202 can rate and/or review an offer. For example, a user can review theoffer 264, 265, or 266 and provide feedback by selecting a review link (not shown). As another example, the user can provide a rating for one or more of theoffers 264, 265, or 266. For example, the user can select a thumbs-upimage 268 or a thumbs-down image 270 to rate the offer 264 or can select one ormore stars 272 to rate the offer 265. Rating and review information can be provided to thecontent server 208. Thecontent server 208 can evaluate previously-received rating and review information when selecting future offers for theuser 202 and for users in general. For example, thecontent server 208 can update theuser profile 238 with rating and review information and can use the updated user profile information when identifying future offers for theuser 202. For example, a new interest can be added to theuser profile 238 based on positive reviews received from theuser 202. As another example, theuser profile 238 can be updated to indicate theuser 202 does not like certain things based on the receipt of negative ratings or reviews from theuser 202. - The identification of content associated with a captured image can be based on the location of the user when the image is captured. For example, the
user 202 can use theuser device 262 to capture an image 274 of the Golden Gate bridge. The image 274 can be sent to thecontent server 208. Thecontent server 208 can identify the image 274 as an image of the Golden Gate bridge, based, at least in part, on the San Francisco location of theuser device 262. Thecontent server 208 can identify offers based on the identified Golden Gate bridge object and the San Francisco location. Anoffer sheet 276 includingoffers user device 262. Theoffer sheet 276 includes amap 284 of the San Francisco area. Themap 284 includes indicators (e.g., pushpins) 286, 287, and 288 which correspond, respectively, to locations associated with theoffers map 284 includes a representation (e.g., thumbnail) 290 of the image 274 placed on themap 284 corresponding to the location at which the image 274 was captured. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example campaignmanagement user interface 300. Theuser interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a content item provider or content sponsor, can use to configure a campaign. The content item provider can select atab 302 to display acampaign configuration area 304. The content item provider can view alist 306 of campaigns by selecting acontrol 308. The content item provider can edit an existing campaign in thecampaign configuration area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 310) in thecampaign list 306. The content item provider can select a content item (e.g., an offer) associated with the campaign using acontrol 312. - A
control 314 lists keywords that are associated with the selected content item and/or with the content item provider. The content item provider can provide (e.g., enter) some or all of the keywords using thecontrol 314. As another example, some or all of the keywords in thecontrol 314 can be automatically determined and suggested to the content item provider. For example, some or all of the keywords in thecontrol 314 can be automatically determined from one or more web pages that are associated with a web site of the content item provider or from other information provided by or otherwise associated with the content item provider. Some or all of the keywords in thecontrol 314 can be determined based on the content of the selected content item. - The content item provider can select a
control 316 to configure selection criteria that indicates that the selected content item is eligible for presentation on an offer sheet generated based on image content of a received image when the image content relates to one or more of the keywords included in thecontrol 314. A bid associated with the selection criteria associated with thecontrol 316 can be configured using acontrol 318. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for providing content to a user. The process 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 or thecontent server 208 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - An image and, in some implementations, additional information about the image is received from a user device (402). The image can be, for example, a digital image provided by an image capture device, such as a digital camera or a scanner. The image can be, for example, part of a scene. For example, video content that includes audio and a plurality of images can be received. In some implementations, a plurality of still images can be received. In some implementations, the image can be an image of a document.
- In some implementations, the additional information can include context information, such as one or more audio (e.g., command) signals that provide context for what the user is interested in related to the image. As another example, context information providing context for what the user is interested in related to the image can be provided by one or more user inputs provided by the user on a user interface. Other examples of additional information include the user designating the image (e.g. “liking” the image), or providing comments about the image (e.g., “this picture relates to my upcoming trip to Paris”).
- The image is evaluated to identify content included in the image (40). For example, optical character recognition can be used to identify text included in the image. As another example, object recognition techniques can be used to identify objects included in the image. Information from the evaluating can be stored in a profile associated with the user for use in identifying other content to serve to the user at another time. For example, one or more interests can be added to the profile based on the identified content.
- When the image is an image of a document, the source of the document can be identified. Textual content and/or image content can otherwise be used to identify the source of the image. When a plurality of images are received, the plurality of images can be evaluated, including the identifying of text and/or objects in some or all of the plurality of images. When the image is part of a scene, the scene can be evaluated, including the evaluation of images and audio associated with the scene.
- Location information is identified (406). For example, the location information can include one or more of location information indicating where the image was captured, location information indicating the current location of the user, or location information determined from the image. For example, the image may have been captured at or near a user's home in San Jose, Calif., the image may include a sign relating to New York style pizza resulting in location information of New York being identified, and the user's current location may be San Francisco, Calif. In some implementations, the location information can be used to assist in identifying content included in the image. For example, an object may be identified in the image and can be identified as a particular building or other landmark based on the location information.
- A plurality of eligible offers are identified based on the identified content, the profile associated with the user, the additional information, and the location information (408). For example, the plurality of offers can include offers that are each associated with one or more keywords that are related to the identified content. As another example, one or more of the offers can be identified based on information in the profile being related to the identified image content and matching one or more keywords associated with one or more offers. As yet another example, when context information is received with the image, the context information can be used to assist in identifying the eligible offers. One or more offers can be identified based on the location information. For example, one or more offers may have an associated location that is within a threshold distance of the location represented by the received location information. When a plurality of images or a scene is received, at least one offer can be identified based on the evaluating of the plurality of images or the scene, respectively.
- Continuing the example from above where the location information indicates that the image was captured at or near a user's home in San Jose, Calif., the image relates to New York style pizza, and the user's current location is San Francisco, Calif., one or more offers relating to New York style pizza restaurants at or near San Francisco or San Jose, Calif. can be identified.
- An offer sheet is generated that includes the plurality of offers and, in some implementations, a representation of the received image (410). The representation of the received image can be, for example, a thumbnail image. In some implementations, offer sheets can include representations of multiple received images. For example, when a plurality of images are received, the offer sheet can include representations (e.g., thumbnails) of some or all of the plurality of images.
- The offer sheet can be, for example, a web page. In some implementations and for some images, the offer sheet can include a map portion that includes a map of an area related to a location associated with the image. The map can, for example, include an indicator, pushpin or other marker related to one, some or all of the plurality of offers.
- In some implementations, the offer sheet enables the user to provide feedback on each offer (e.g., a thumbs-up/thumbs-down indication, a rating from one to four stars). The feedback can be used in future identification of offers or other purposes. For example, offers for particular entities (e.g., particular restaurants), particular types of entities, or particular types of services might get a higher weighting or a lower weighting in an identification process based on previously received feedback.
- The offer sheet is provided to the user (412). For example, the offer sheet can be provided to a user device of the user, for presentation on the user device. The user can, for example, name the offer sheet and/or provide other metadata to augment the offer sheet.
- The offer sheet can be provided to the user, for example, in direct response to the receiving of the image. As another example, offer sheets can be maintained as business pages that are accessible by the user and that are configured to be updated at each viewing by the user. For example, the identification of offers can be re-performed at each viewing and offers can be identified, for example, based on the current day, current time of day, current location of the user, current information in the user profile of the user, feedback received from the user since the previous viewing of the offer sheet by the user, as well as on the identified image content and on other context information.
- In some implementations, offer sheets can be shared with other users. The shared offer sheet can be customized for the other user. For example, the shared offer sheet can be based, at least in part, on information in a user profile associated with the user to which the offer sheet is shared.
