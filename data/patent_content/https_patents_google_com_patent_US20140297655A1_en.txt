Abstract
The disclosed subject matter presents a method of using social connections to provide a content region definition that priorities the display of content on a user device based on information obtained from the social connections of the user.
Description
- Digital media content, such as video, audio and textual content, may be obtained from a variety of sources. With the massive amount of digital media content available, a variety of methods of filtering through the digital media content to provide relevant content to a user typically are provided. For example, digital media content sources may provide filters and search mechanisms that allow a user to identify specific content or types of content in which he is interested. Other filtering mechanisms identify content that is believed to be of interest to a user, such as content created by the same author as content the user has previously viewed or purchased, or individual content items that are part of a larger corpus such as episodes of a television series, movie sequels, or the like.
- According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, a digital media content server may identify a user presence. The server may obtain an indication of content available for delivery, and may access a social connection of the user to determine a content recommendation provided by the social connection. Based upon the content recommendation provided by the social content, a presentation recommendation score may be generated. In response to the presentation recommendation score, a content region definition specific to the content available for delivery may be generated. The content region definition may include a presentation value.
- The described method and system may provide more relevant content to the user based on the user's social recommendations. As a result, the user is presented with content that the user is more likely to enjoy and subsequently purchase, which is a benefit to the content provider. Furthermore, users are able to interact with their social network connections in yet another manner that strengthens the social connections between users.

FIG. 3 shows a computer according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 4 shows a network configuration according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. - The amount of content available for consumption by users from websites may be staggering, and may intimidate some users. However, present filtering methods are often easily confused by, for instance, one time deviations from a user's typical content consumption patterns and may not sufficiently narrow the amount of content appropriately. In addition, the filters do not account for all of the environmental factors that may influence which content a user may want to consume. It would be advantageous if a reasonable amount of the content could be filtered to present more relevant content to the user.
- In social networks, users may interact with groups of users based on some interest, such as friendship, common interest (e.g., book club, fan club, business clubs, hobbies, school, or work), trusted sources of content, such as particular magazines, news sources and the like, or other interactive groups. The social network users may generate reviews or recommendations of content. The reviews may be posted, for example, to the social network group associated with the reviewing user, or some other internet forum. Similarly, a user may recommend content to other users associated with the recommending user through the group associations. The disclosed subject matter may leverage the user's social network connections by incorporating recommendations by the user's social network into the determination of which content may be presented to the user. For example, a primary user may log into a website that provides content, and be presented with a webpage providing options for different categories of content. Categories of content may be, for example, music, books, videos, magazines, apps and the like. Specific content may include website content, such as blogs, computer applications, content reviews, video feeds, live audio or live video, user web queries, audio, video, digital magazines, digital books, gaming content and the like. The specific content may be arranged into content collections that are based on a respective content category. Upon selection of a category, a variety of content from the selected category may be presented to the primary user as a collection. The content in the content collection may be determined based on information from or related to the user's social connections and other factors.
- The social connection may be with a trusted source of content, such as a digital magazine, digital book, blog sites, electronic newspaper or news program, computer application reviews, reference website, a commentator, or the like. Alternatively, the social connection may be an individual, such as a friend or favorite commentator, or a group of individuals, for example, a cycling club, a user group, or knitting circle. The content recommendations from either the trusted source or individual may be an indicator of the trusted source's, group's or individual's satisfaction, impression, feelings, value or the like with the content, such as a star ranking or a thumb's up icon. For example, if the primary user has a history with a content provider via a website, the variety of content in the content collection may be biased by content that the user previously purchased, sampled or reviewed while interacting with the content provider. Other factors may include a user's query history relative to the content, a user's content sampling history, a user's navigation within a website and other user activities. In other words, the content selected for delivery to the user device or server may be based on recommendations from the user's social connections, the user's history within the on-line store and other factors. The content described herein may include links or pointers to the underlying actual digital content. For example, when content is presented to a user, it may be presented in the form of an image, description, link, or the like, which is selectable by the user and links to the underlying content or to a location from which the user may view or purchase the underlying content. As a specific example, when a video is to be presented to a user as disclosed herein, it may be presented in the form of a content card or similar interface. The interface may include an image, text, and/or a playable video which, when selected by the user, allows the user to navigate to a website or other entity from which the user may view and/or purchase the complete video.

FIG. 1 shows a flowchart of a process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Themethod 100 may include identifying, at a digital media content server, a user presence (110). In addition, the server may obtain user preference data and user history. The user's preference data and user history may be received from a portable device associated with the user, a different server, or may be stored in a data storage associated with the digital media content server. The user preference data and the user history may be stored at various locations and may be obtained from various sources. The user history may relate to a user's interaction with a content provider. For example, a user's history with an on-line content store may relate to the user's purchases of content. The user history may change over time because it may be adaptively based on various actions, such as a user's searches and a user's navigation through content. User history may include, for example, at least one of the user's content purchasing history, content viewing history, content listening history, content download history, content sharing history, content rating history and the like. The content viewing history may include, for example, at least one of viewing of website content, user web queries, video content, digital magazines, digital books, gaming content and the like. In addition, user preferences may also include information obtained from non-content-sources, such as, for example, a user's email history, a user's text messaging, a user's web search and browsing history, and the like. - An indication of the content that a user is interested in receiving more information about or having delivered may be obtained by the digital media content server (120). Either the user device or the server may indicate which of a plurality of social connections may be accessed based on a type of the content available for delivery. For example, a trusted source may be the social connection that is accessed for political-related content, while a user's friend may be accessed for music-related content. A social connection of the user may be accessed to determine a content recommendation based on information obtained by the social connection (130).
- The social connections may be those connections that a primary user has with other, secondary, users or trusted sources in a social network. For example, other secondary users may be friends, family, business associates, work colleagues, acquaintances, sports teammates, book club members, and the like. A trusted source may be a blog site, a digital magazine, electronic news agency, a content specific website, a standards organization website, or the like. Primary users as well as other secondary users may have “share” controls that allow the primary and secondary users to specifically set the user's sharing of information. For example, in the instance where the user consents to the use of such data, the data may be used for providing a recommendation related to content. Permission for a user to access the social connection may be confirmed, for example, by the digital media content server or some other device. Information retrieved from the social connection, such as a user's friend or family member may include recommendations of content (which may be written recommendations), ratings, such as an alphanumeric or symbolic ranking, whether the secondary user downloaded particular content, and the like. This information may be used to provide a content recommendation. The content server may process the user preference, user history, content recommendations, and additional information provided by the social connection to calculate a presentation recommendation score specific to the content available for delivery.
- In a specific example, the available content on the digital media server may be a pop music band. While preparing to calculate the presentation recommendation, the user's history with respect to the particular pop music band may be accessed based on the user's sharing settings. For example, the user's e-mail may be scanned for e-mails or for particular text relating to the pop music band, or on-line chat history or text messages may also be scanned for messages related to the pop music band. All or some of the text of the e-mails or messages may be scanned for information related to the pop music band. In addition, the user's social connections, such as the user's friends (i.e., a secondary user), may be accessed and scanned for information related to the pop music band. If the secondary user has information, such as a recommendation for a particular song by the pop music band, the server may obtain the recommendation. Information obtained from these connections may be used calculate the presentation recommendation for the pop music band.
- The presentation recommendation score based upon the content recommendation provided by the social connection may be generated (140). The presentation recommendation score may be determined using a variety of algorithms. For example, the server may assign a user preference weighting to the content based on user preferences, assign a user history weighting to content based on the user's history related to the content, and assign a social weighting to the content based on social connection recommendations. The server may assign any combination of the above weightings, or may use additional weightings of different data. Using at least one of the user preference weighting, user history weighting, and the social weighting, the server may calculate a presentation recommendation score specific to the content. Of course, other factors and/or weightings may be used.
- In response to the presentation recommendation score, a content region definition specific to the content available for delivery may be generated (150). The content region definition may include a presentation dimension, or percentage or other value, for a content region that is sized relative to another content region of a plurality of content regions based upon the content specific presentation recommendation score. The presentation recommendation score may be used to select a content region template that satisfies the presentation dimension. The content region template may specify how the content and any information related to the content may be arranged on a display device.
- In addition to the social connections, the presentation recommendation score may also take into account other factors determined by other sources, such as the content provider. For example, content may receive a higher presentation recommendation score because the content provider is offering a discount for the purchase or rental of the particular content in the content category being accessed. Other factors that may influence the presentation recommendation scores may be sponsorship of particular content, media events, such as an awards show or nominations of content for awards, and the like.
- Optionally, the content region definition specific to the selected content may be transmitted by the content server (160) to, for example, the user device or another server. The content may also be delivered with the content region definition, delivered prior to the content region definition, or after the delivery of the content region definition. In response to receiving the indication of a selection of content from the delivered content, an updated content region definition may be delivered (170). At the user device, the content may be presented according to the content region definition.
- The digital media content server may receive additional indications based on user interactions with the presented content. For example, the digital media device may receive indications that the user has navigated in relation to the delivered content by selecting related content or new and different content. As a result, the server may generate and provide an updated content region definition and content based on the indications related to the user inputs. Alternatively, the server may provide several content region templates based on the content region definition delivered with the content. Although described with respect to a digital media content server, the above described process may be performed locally by for example, a smart phone, a set top box, a desktop, a laptop, a gaming device or similar computing devices. Furthermore, the above process may be performed by a combination of local devices, such as a set top box and smartphone, and remote devices, such as the digital media content server.

FIG. 2A shows an example illustration of content presentation according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. As discussed above, available content may be presented to a user according to a content region definition. The content region definition may indicate the placement and positioning of content cards, such as 220 and 230, for presentation to a user. In addition, the content region definition may include information related to the arrangement of content information within the content cards. - Each content card, such as
content cards content cards -
Content cards card 220.Card 220 may include content information such as the content name, price, and recommendation information that may be presented on the smartphone display. The recommendation information may be information of the type shown by recommendation information types 210. For example, recommendation information may include the number of downloads by friends obtained through the social connection, or the number of overall downloads, which may be obtained from the content provider. In addition, - The content region definition may have different settings for indicating the arrangement of the content information included in the content card. For example, depending on the different settings,
content card 220 may include acontent description 220A, acontent price 220B, a content name 220C, and recommendation information 220C-F. Thecontent description 220A may be an album cover art work, a magazine cover, book cover, an embedded or link to a movie trailer, movie poster art, or any other description of the content. The recommendation information 220C-F may be one or more of the specific recommendation information types 210. In contrast, different settings and a larger display device may allow for a content card to present more or less information, such ascontent card 230.Content card 230 may be larger, but, in this example, may have less information thancontent card 220. The content region definition may arrange the content information into clusters of information drawn from, for example, a user's preferences and a content recommendation of the user's social connection. In an implementation, only the user's preferences, only the content recommendation of the user's social connection, or only both are used to define the arrangement of the content information within the content card. The content region definition may indicate the arrangement of the content information in the cluster using a template indicator that is assigned to one of a plurality of templates. The clusters of content information may be arranged according to the template. -
FIG. 2B illustrates an example of a content cluster according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. In the illustrated example, a cluster ofavailable content 270 may be presented to a user with a title of the content 273 incorporating a number ofcontent cards content cards 277A-C and 279A-D incorporate multiple cards in the same dimensions ascontent card 275. For example,content cards 277A-C may refer to multiple content cards that may includesub-regions 278 having recommendation information. - The content region definition may define region and sub-region, such as
sub-regions 278, dimensions for presentation of the content description and the additional information. For example, the presentation dimension may be greater for content with a higher presentation recommendation score than content with a lower presentation recommendation score. As illustrated inFIG. 2B from left to right,content card 275 may have larger dimensions and present a single content card and additional information related to the content, whereascontent cards 277A-C and 279A-D may encompass multiple content cards having smaller dimensions thancontent card 275.Content card 275 may have the larger dimensions due to a higher recommendation score in the respective content category provided by the content server for particular content compared to other content, such as the content shown incards 277A-C and 279A-D. As a result of the higher recommendation score,content card 275 may have larger presentation dimensions than theother cards 277A-C and 279A-D. Similarly, the content cards encompassed withincontent card 277A-C may have medium dimensions and have a recommendation score that is considered a medium recommendation score, and thecontent cards 279A-D may have less content information smaller dimensions and a lower recommendation score than content in bothcontent cards individual content cards 277A-C may also be based on the presentation recommendation scores for the content ofcontent cards 277A-C. The content region definition may include the template for presenting content and information related to the content. - In an implementation, a user device may provide to the content server an indication of at least one of the device type, device capabilities and device specifications, such as processor type, display screen dimensions and the like. This indication may be included with, or in addition to, user preferences and user history obtained by the digital media server. Based on the provided capabilities and specification, a template may be selected based on a screen width and height of a device to which the content is being delivered. For example, the content region definition may include a template for presenting content and information related to the arrangement of content based on the at least one of a particular device type, device capabilities and device specifications. The content region definition may further indicate how content may be arranged within the regions and sub-regions of the template in addition to how the content may be arranged when the display is in either portrait or landscape mode.
- With reference to
FIG. 2B , the cluster ofcontent 270 may be provided, for example, for a tablet or laptop computing device. The content server may deliver a number of templates with the content, after or prior to the content being provided. The specific content with a higher recommendation score may entail not only dedicating more area of the display device real estate to the higher preference scored content, but may also incorporate more information related to the content. The additional display real estate may be used to provide other in sub-regions that may include additional recommendation information, such as snippets related to, for example, the content author or artist, a review or recommendation from a secondary user or trusted source, the number of downloads of the content (which may be an indication of popularity) by all users, the number of downloads by secondary users related to the primary user, the number of other secondary users that have purchased or recommended the content, reviews written by the secondary users or the like. For example, inFIG. 2B ,content card 275 may have snippets related to the content, such as the content name, badge, review starts-comments, or number of downloads by the user's friends. Similarly, the threecontent cards 277A-C may includeadditional information 278 that provides snippets related to the content. Theadditional information 278 may be arranged in sub-regions that are related to the respective content. Theadditional information 278 may not be as extensive as that provided for the content presented incontent card 275 because thecontent cards 277A-C may have a lower presentation score than the content ofcontent card 275. - The cluster arrangement may change according to the presentation recommendation scoring. For example, with reference to
FIGS. 2A and 2B , the arrangement of the recommendation information in the sub-regions of the respective content cards may change within the respective template based on the recommendation scores. For example, thecontent card 275 may be presented because the content shown in it may have the highest presentation score. The arrangement of the recommendation information presented incontent cards 279A-D may be different than the recommendation information provided incontent cards 277A-C due to a lower recommendation score. - The content region definition may include region and sub-region dimensions that maintain the percentage of screen display for presented content in both a portrait and landscape presentation orientation. For example, the template may be configured to optimize the presentation of content on a tablet, smartphone, desktop, laptop, television or the like, and also take into account the display orientation, such as portrait or landscape. In general, the plurality of templates may be generated to organize the content based on preference scores, so that a user may make a more informed and quicker decision related to the content, such as purchasing, renting, or investigating further.
