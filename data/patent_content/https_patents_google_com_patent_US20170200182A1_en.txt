- Implementations of the methods and systems described herein annotate an advertisement (i.e., an online content item) displayed on a client computing device to include information about a loyalty program that a user of the client computing device may be a member of and may earn rewards for being such a member. More specifically, the system generates a profile of the user, including determining that the user has a membership account for a loyalty program of a first merchant (e.g., merchant A). The system additionally retrieves the content item to transmit to the client computing device associated with the user. The system determines that the content item is associated with a second merchant (e.g., merchant B) that is also associated with the loyalty program.
- a second merchant e.g., merchant B
- the second merchant may be partnering with the first merchant such that, if the user purchases products or services from the second merchant (e.g., merchant B), rewards under the loyalty program are applied to the membership account. Accordingly, the user is able earn merchant A loyalty rewards by purchasing products or services from merchant B.
- the system annotates the content item to include an indication that purchasing one or more of the products or services from the second merchant will cause loyalty rewards to be applied to the membership account.
- the system then transmits the annotated content item to the client computing device for display to the user.
- the system determines which loyalty programs the user has an account with by: (i) reviewing loyalty card information stored in the user's electronic wallet, (ii) detecting one or more references to a loyalty program in an email sent to the user, (iii) detecting that one or more applications associated with merchants running loyalty programs (e.g., a merchant A app) are installed on the user's computing device (e.g., smartphone or tablet), and/or (iv) detecting actions of the user on one or more social networking sites that indicate the user's interest in the merchant operating the loyalty program (e.g., merchant A).
- the system uses the information regarding the membership account to select the content item.
- the system may select a content item pertaining to goods and/or services of merchant B to annotate and transmit to the client computing device, because the user has a membership account for merchant A's loyalty program.
- the system transmits the content item as part of a search results page.
- the system includes a link in the content item that, when clicked on (“activated”), causes the client computing device to visit a webpage that describes the loyalty program.
- the system is configured to detect that the link has been activated on the client computing device, for example, by receiving a corresponding signal from the client computing device or a server computing device that hosts the webpage.
- the system is configured to annotate the content item to include an indication that the products or services can be purchased using an electronic wallet.
- the system configures the annotation to be displayed as a floating tag adjacent to the content item.
- the system configures the annotation to be displayed as a menu that includes a reference (i.e., a menu item) to the loyalty program.
- the menu may include references to other loyalty programs associated with the second merchant as well.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, interests, preferences, or current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, interests, preferences, or current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as a city, a ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as a city, a ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may include at least one of: (a) generating a profile of a user associated with a client computing device, wherein the profile identifies a first merchant that operates a loyalty program that the user has a membership account with; (b) retrieving a content item from a memory to transmit to the client computing device, wherein the content item is associated with products or services sold by a second merchant; (c) determining that the second merchant is associated with the loyalty program of the first merchant; (d) annotating the content item to include an indication that purchasing one or more of the products or services from the second merchant will cause loyalty rewards to be applied to the membership account; and (e) transmitting the annotated content item to the client computing device.
- the systems and methods described herein include annotating an online advertisement that is displayed to a user with a reference to a loyalty program that the user may be a member of.

Abstract
A method for annotating a content item to be displayed on at least one client computing device having a display is described. The method includes generating a profile of a user associated with a client computing device. The profile identifies a first merchant that operates a loyalty program that the user has a membership account with. The method additionally includes retrieving a content item from memory to transmit to the client computing device. The content item is associated with products or services sold by a second merchant. Additionally, the method includes determining that the second merchant is associated with the loyalty program of the first merchant, annotating the content item to include an indication that purchasing one or more of the products or services from the second merchant will cause loyalty rewards to be applied to the membership account, and transmitting the annotated content item to the client computing device.
Description
- This description relates to presenting online content items on client computing devices, and more particularly, to annotating an online content item to include information about a loyalty program.
- In at least some known systems, a merchant operates a loyalty program to retain customers through incentives. More specifically, under the loyalty program, when a customer purchases goods and/or services from the merchant operating the program, the merchant assigns rewards, such as points, to a loyalty program account associated with the customer. In such systems, the customer may redeem the points for dollar-amount discounts on additional products and/or services sold by the merchant. In some such systems, one or more additional merchants function as a partner to the merchant offering the program such that if the customer purchases certain goods or services from the partner merchant, rewards are applied to the customer's account under the loyalty program.
- In one aspect, a method for annotating a content item to be displayed on at least one client computing device having a display is provided. The method is implemented by a server computing device that is communicatively coupled to a memory and to the at least one client computing device. The method includes generating a profile of a user associated with the client computing device. The profile identifies a first merchant that operates a loyalty program that the user has a membership account with.

Any feature of any drawing may be referenced and/or claimed in combination with any feature of any other drawing.
- The following detailed description of implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the claims.
- Implementations of the methods and systems described herein annotate an advertisement (i.e., an online content item) displayed on a client computing device to include information about a loyalty program that a user of the client computing device may be a member of and may earn rewards for being such a member. More specifically, the system generates a profile of the user, including determining that the user has a membership account for a loyalty program of a first merchant (e.g., merchant A). The system additionally retrieves the content item to transmit to the client computing device associated with the user. The system determines that the content item is associated with a second merchant (e.g., merchant B) that is also associated with the loyalty program. For example, the second merchant may be partnering with the first merchant such that, if the user purchases products or services from the second merchant (e.g., merchant B), rewards under the loyalty program are applied to the membership account. Accordingly, the user is able earn merchant A loyalty rewards by purchasing products or services from merchant B. The system annotates the content item to include an indication that purchasing one or more of the products or services from the second merchant will cause loyalty rewards to be applied to the membership account. The system then transmits the annotated content item to the client computing device for display to the user.
- In some implementations, the system determines which loyalty programs the user has an account with by: (i) reviewing loyalty card information stored in the user's electronic wallet, (ii) detecting one or more references to a loyalty program in an email sent to the user, (iii) detecting that one or more applications associated with merchants running loyalty programs (e.g., a merchant A app) are installed on the user's computing device (e.g., smartphone or tablet), and/or (iv) detecting actions of the user on one or more social networking sites that indicate the user's interest in the merchant operating the loyalty program (e.g., merchant A). In some implementations, the system uses the information regarding the membership account to select the content item. More specifically, the system may select a content item pertaining to goods and/or services of merchant B to annotate and transmit to the client computing device, because the user has a membership account for merchant A's loyalty program. In some implementations, the system transmits the content item as part of a search results page. In some implementations, the system includes a link in the content item that, when clicked on (“activated”), causes the client computing device to visit a webpage that describes the loyalty program. In some implementations, the system is configured to detect that the link has been activated on the client computing device, for example, by receiving a corresponding signal from the client computing device or a server computing device that hosts the webpage.
- In some implementations, the system is configured to annotate the content item to include an indication that the products or services can be purchased using an electronic wallet. In some implementations, the system configures the annotation to be displayed as a floating tag adjacent to the content item. In some implementations, the system configures the annotation to be displayed as a menu that includes a reference (i.e., a menu item) to the loyalty program. The menu may include references to other loyalty programs associated with the second merchant as well.
- In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, interests, preferences, or current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as a city, a ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and preceded with the word “a” or “an” should be understood as not excluding plural elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited. Furthermore, references to “one embodiment” of the subject matter disclosed herein are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may include at least one of: (a) generating a profile of a user associated with a client computing device, wherein the profile identifies a first merchant that operates a loyalty program that the user has a membership account with; (b) retrieving a content item from a memory to transmit to the client computing device, wherein the content item is associated with products or services sold by a second merchant; (c) determining that the second merchant is associated with the loyalty program of the first merchant; (d) annotating the content item to include an indication that purchasing one or more of the products or services from the second merchant will cause loyalty rewards to be applied to the membership account; and (e) transmitting the annotated content item to the client computing device. The systems and methods described herein include annotating an online advertisement that is displayed to a user with a reference to a loyalty program that the user may be a member of. Such as system enables a user to easily see that an advertising merchant is associated with a loyalty program that the user is a member of so that the member is able to make purchases that will maximize loyalty points to the member.

FIG. 3 is a block diagram of anexample relationship 300 between aprofile 302,sources 308 of data used to generateprofile 302, andmerchants loyalty program data profile 302.CMS 106 receives information from one or more ofsources 308 and generatesprofile 302.Sources 108 include anelectronic wallet 310,electronic messages 312,applications 314 associated with merchants, and one or moresocial networking sites 316 that a user, such asuser 154, is associated with.Electronic wallet 310 includes data pertaining to loyalty program cards associated withuser 154, of a user access device (“client computing device”) 108. More specifically, theelectronic wallet 310 includes loyalty program card numbers and/or loyalty program account numbers associated withuser 154. For example,electronic wallet 310 may include an account number formembership account A 303 and/or an account number formembership account B 305. In some implementations,electronic wallet 106 is stored byCMS 106, for example ingeneral database 146. In other implementations, electronic wallet is stored inmemory 206 and/orstorage device 210 ofclient computing device 108 associated withuser 154. In such implementations,client computing device 108 transmits all or a portion ofelectronic wallet 310 toCMS 106, for example after receiving a corresponding request message fromCMS 106 and, at least in some implementations, after receiving authorization fromuser 154, for example throughinput device 212. - In addition, or alternatively,
CMS 106sources 308 includeelectronic messages 312 transmitted to or fromclient computing device 108 and/or an account associated withuser 154. For example, an email transmitted to an account associated withuser 154 may include an electronic receipt for purchases made byuser 154 using loyalty rewards for a loyalty program, such asloyalty program A 304, a confirmation message thatuser 154 has enrolled inloyalty program A 304, or another reference toloyalty program A 304.CMS 106 may storeelectronic messages 312 on behalf ofuser 154, for example in an email account accessed byuser 154 usingclient computing device 108. Electronic messages may additionally or alternatively include chat messages, text messages (e.g., short message service (SMS) messages) and/or other messages transmitted to or fromclient computing device 108 and/or an account associated withuser 154.CMS 106 may be at least partially responsible for transmitting or storing suchelectronic messages 312, thereby enablingCMS 106 to detect references toloyalty program A 304. In other implementations,CMS 106 is not involved in transmitting or storingelectronic messages 312, but suchelectronic messages 312 are stored and/or transmitted by one ormore computing devices 200 that enableCMS 106 to access theelectronic messages 312. - In some implementations,
sources 308 additionally or alternatively includeapplications 314 installed toclient computing device 108. For example,CMS 106 may include or be communicatively coupled to one or more servers that provide an online store from whichclient computing device 108 has downloaded and installed an application pertaining to a loyalty program, such asloyalty program A 304. For example, the application may pertain tomerchant A 318, which operatesloyalty program A 304. The application may provide information regarding products and/or services sold bymerchant A 318, provide information about locations ofmerchant A 318 within a specific geographic area (i.e., zip code), and provide information aboutloyalty program A 304, such as information about rewards associated withloyalty program A 304.CMS 106 may detect a log entry stored, for example indatabase 146, indicating the downloading and installation ofsuch applications 314 onclient computing device 108. Additionally, or alternatively, in some implementations,CMS 106 may receive an indication transmitted fromclient computing device 108 identifying one or more ofapplications 314 operating onclient computing device 108. For example, in some implementations, whenclient computing device 108 initially opens such anapplication 314,client computing device 108 transmits an indication toCMS 106 that theapplication 314 is running. -
Sources 308 additionally include one or moresocial networking sites 316 thatuser 154 is associated with (e.g., has an account with). For example,user 154 may indicate approval of or interest in an article about a particular merchant, such asmerchant A 318, by flagging the article on thesocial networking site 316. Additionally or alternatively,user 154 may indicate approval of or interest in merchant A itself, for example by indicating such approval or interest in an account or other representation ofmerchant A 318 and/or by following updates frommerchant A 318 on thesocial networking site 316.CMS 106 is communicatively coupled to the one or moresocial networking sites 316 and detects such social networking actions for example by searching thesocial networking sites 316 for items that include a reference touser 154. In some implementations,CMS 106 operates one or more suchsocial networking sites 316. - Using data from
sources 308,CMS 106 generatesprofile 302 associated withuser 154. Profile includes anindication 301 of the possible existence ofmembership account A 303 forloyalty program A 304 and anindication 307 of the possible existence ofmembership account B 305 forloyalty program B 306. More specifically, in some implementations,CMS 106 determines, from one of more ofsources 308, a likelihood thatuser 154 has a membership account with one or more ofloyalty programs CMS 106 stores theindication 301 and/or 307 of the existence of the corresponding membership account (e.g.,membership account A 303 and/or membership account B 305). -
Profile 302 includes afirst reference 317 that identifies a first set of merchants that are associated withloyalty program A 304, and asecond reference 323 that identifies a second set of merchants that are associated withloyalty program B 306.Loyalty program A 304 is operated bymerchant A 318. More specifically,merchant A 318 enables loyalty rewards earned byuser 154 to be redeemed throughmerchant A 318. For example,merchant A 318 enables such rewards to be applied towards the purchase of products and/or services sold bymerchant A 318. In addition,merchant B 320 andmerchant C 322 are associated withloyalty program A 304. In other words,merchant B 320 andmerchant C 322 are partners withmerchant A 318 inasmuch as ifuser 154 purchases one or more products and/or services frommerchant B 320 ormerchant C 322,user 154 earns rewards underloyalty program A 304 that may be redeemed throughmerchant A 318. -
Loyalty program B 306 is operated bymerchant D 324. More specifically,merchant D 324 enables loyalty rewards earned byuser 154 to be redeemed throughmerchant D 324. For example,merchant D 324 enables such rewards to be applied towards the purchase of products and/or services sold bymerchant D 324. In addition,merchant E 326 andmerchant F 328 are associated withloyalty program B 306. In other words,merchant E 326 andmerchant F 328 are partners withmerchant D 324 inasmuch as ifuser 154 purchases one or more products and/or services frommerchant E 326 ormerchant F 328,user 154 earns rewards underloyalty program B 306 that may be redeemed throughmerchant D 324. - In some implementations, the operator of each respective loyalty program transmits a message to
CMS 106 indicating which merchants are partners for the loyalty program operated by the merchant. For example,merchant A 318 transmits a message toCMS 106 indicating thatmerchant B 320 andmerchant C 322 are partners forloyalty program A 304. Similarly,merchant D 324 transmits a message toCMS 106 indicating thatmerchant E 326 andmerchant F 328 are partners forloyalty program B 306. In other implementations, each partner merchant, for example each ofmerchant B 320,merchant C 322,merchant E 326, andmerchant F 328 transmits a message toCMS 106 indicating their partnership in the respective loyalty program (i.e.,loyalty program A 304 and loyalty program B 306). In some implementations, the message is transmitted through a user interface included, for example, in a web page generated byCMS 106. In other implementations, the message is transmitted as an email or in another format. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram ofexample communications 400 amongclient computing device 108,CMS 106, and publisherserver computing device 114. More specifically,merchant B 320 operates publisherserver computing device 114, which hosts a web site with information about products and services sold bymerchant B 320. In addition, publisherserver computing device 114 hosts a particular webpage 414 (a “landing page”) that describes the relationship betweenmerchant B 320 andloyalty program A 304. More specifically,landing page 414 lists products and services offered bymerchant B 320 that, if purchased, cause loyalty rewards to be applied tomembership account A 303 forloyalty program A 304. - Initially,
client computing device 108 transmits asearch query 402 toCMS 106.Search query 402 includes one ormore keywords 404.CMS 106 identifies thatclient computing device 108 is associated withprofile 302, for example becauseclient computing device 108 stores one or more cookies (not shown) inmemory 206 orstorage device 210 and transmits and indication of the association ofclient computing device 108 withprofile 302 toCMS 106 before, after, or as part ofsearch query 402.CMS 106 transmits aresponse 406 toclient computing device 108 including apublication 408. More specifically,publication 408 includes search results and an annotated content item 504 (FIG. 5 ).Annotated content item 504 includes a link 508 (FIG. 5 ) tolanding page 414 hosted by publisherserver computing device 114.User 154 clicks on thelink 508 and, in response,client computing device 108 transmits arequest 410 to publisherserver computing device 114 forlanding page 414. After receivingrequest 410, publisherserver computing device 114 transmits aresponse 412 that includeslanding page 414 toclient computing device 108. Thelanding page 414 describes products and services offered bymerchant B 320 that, if purchased, would cause rewards associated withloyalty program A 304 to be awarded to the purchaser (e.g., user 154). In addition, publisherserver computing device 114 transmits anotification 416 toCMS 106 thatclient computing device 108 accessed thelanding page 414. In other words, thenotification 416 indicates that thelink 508 was clicked on or activated onclient computing device 108. In other implementations,client computing device 108 transmitsnotification 416 toCMS 106. -

When clicked on or otherwise activated, for example using input device 212 (FIG. 2 ),client computing device 108 transmitsrequest 410 to publisherserver computing device 114, as described with reference toFIG. 4 . In other words,menu item 610 functions as a link, similar to link 508 (FIG. 5 ). In some implementations, drop-down menu 608 includes multiple menu items. For example, in some implementations, each such menu item includes a reference to a different loyalty program thatmerchant B 320 is associated with. -
FIG. 7 is a flowchart of anexample process 700 for annotating a content item, such ascontent item 504, to be displayed on a client computing device, such asclient computing device 108.Process 700 is carried out by a server computing device, forexample CMS 106. Initially,CMS 106 generates 702 a profile, such asprofile 302, of a user, such asuser 154, associated withclient computing device 108.Profile 302 identifies a first merchant, such asmerchant A 318, that operates a loyalty program, such asloyalty program A 304, thatuser 154 has a membership account with (e.g., membership account A 303). Additionally,CMS 106 retrieves 704 a content item, such ascontent item 504, from memory, such ascontent repository 126, to transmit toclient computing device 108.Content item 504 is associated with products or services sold by a second merchant, such asmerchant B 320. Additionally,CMS 106 determines 706 that the second merchant (e.g., merchant B 320) is associated with the loyalty program (e.g., loyalty program A 304) of the first merchant (merchant A 318). Further,CMS 106 annotates 708 thecontent item 504 to include an indication (e.g., annotation 506) that purchasing one or more of the products or services from the second merchant (e.g., merchant B 320) will cause loyalty rewards to be applied tomembership account A 303. Additionally,CMS 106 transmits 710 the annotatedcontent item 504 toclient computing device 108. - In some implementations, in generating
profile 302,CMS 106 determines thatuser 154 hasmembership account A 303 based on an electronic wallet (e.g., electronic wallet 310) associated withuser 154. In some implementations, in generatingprofile 302,CMS 106 identifies at least one reference toloyalty program A 304 in anelectronic message 312 transmitted to a messaging account associated withuser 154 and determines, based at least in part on the identification of the reference in the electronic message, thatuser 154 hasmembership account A 303 withloyalty program A 304. In some implementations, in generatingprofile 302,CMS 106 detects an installation of at least oneapplication 314 associated withmerchant A 318 onclient computing device 108 and determines, based at least in part on the detected installation, thatuser 154 hasmembership account A 303 forloyalty program A 304. In some implementations, in annotating the content item (e.g., content item 504),CMS 106 includes alink 508 to a webpage (e.g., landing page 414) ofmerchant B 320 that describesloyalty program A 304. In some implementations,CMS 106 determines thatlink 508 has been activated onclient computing device 108, for example by receivingnotification 416 from publisherserver computing device 114 or fromclient computing device 108. - In some implementations,
CMS 106 receives a search query, forexample search query 402, transmitted fromclient computing device 108 and transmits the annotatedcontent item 504 in response tosearch query 402, for example inresponse 406. In some implementations,CMS 106 selectscontent item 504 based, at least in part, onindication 301 of membership account A 303 inprofile 302. In some implementations, in annotatingcontent item 504,CMS 106 includes in theannotation 506 anindication 512 that the products or services may be purchased using an electronic wallet (e.g., electronic wallet 310). In some implementations, in annotatingcontent item 504,CMS 106 includes instructions withcontent item 504 that, when executed byclient computing device 108, causeclient computing device 108 to displayannotation 506 as a floating tag adjacent tocontent item 504. In some implementations, in annotating a content item (e.g., content item 604),CMS 106 includes instructions withcontent item 604 that, when executed byclient computing device 108, causeclient computing device 108 to display a menu 608 adjacent tocontent item 604 wherein the menu 608 includes a reference, such asmenu item 610, toloyalty program A 304. In some implementations, in generatingprofile 302,CMS 106 determines thatuser 154 has an interest inloyalty program A 304 based on detecting thatuser 154 is following updates associated withmerchant A 318 or has indicated support formerchant A 318 on asocial networking site 316. -
