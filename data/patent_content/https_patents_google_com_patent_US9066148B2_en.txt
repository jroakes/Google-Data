- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of a process 200 for presenting a collection of data according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- the process 200 occurs at a client device, on a client application that permits a user to view web pages or other documents or information.
- the process 200 begins by a user-initiated action on the client application, which results in an opening of a “landing page” or a presentation of search results 202 .
- the user may enter a particular Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a specific web page, which results in the opening of a landing page.
- a landing page is typically the home page or an entryway page for an online service.
- the user may enter a search query into an online search engine, such as the Google search engine, which results in the presentation of search results.
- an online search engine such as the Google search engine
- the process 200 may comprise operations that occur simultaneously.
- One of these operations steps is to present a subset of a collection of data on a first grid having a first axis and a second axis 204 .
- the first axis corresponds to units of time, and the collection of data includes data representing time-bounded events. Examples of time-bounded events are television programs, movies (e.g., movies broadcast by television signal, satellite or cable), and sporting events (e.g., sporting events broadcast by television signal, satellite or cable) that have a scheduled start time and duration.
- a second operation is to present a second grid having first and second axes that correspond to the first and second axes of the first grid 206 .
- the second grid corresponds to a larger portion of the collection of data than the subset that is presented on the first grid. In other words, the second grid displays a larger portion of the collection of data. However, even the second grid may display a subset of the collection.
- a third operation is to present a user-movable window for selecting a portion of the second grid and for selecting the subset presented on the first grid in accordance with a current position of the window 208 .
- the process 200 may begin by a user-initiated movement of the movable window in the second grid, or a new user-initiated search 210 .
- the user-movable window is within the second grid and movable in any planar direction within the second grid.
- the events being displayed on the first grid change accordingly.
- the portion that is contained within the user-movable window of the second grid is displayed on the first grid in a larger view.
- FIG. 3A is a schematic screenshot of a web browser 300 presenting a web page 302 that displays a collection of data according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- the web browser 300 represents a typical web browser and can be any type of browser that permits a user to display and interact with web pages or other documents or information.
- the web browser 300 comprises a URL field 304 for entering the URL of any web page that a user wants to display, as well as for displaying the URL of the web page currently being displayed. The user may begin the process 200 as shown in FIG. 2 by entering a specific URL in the URL field 304 .
- the web browser 300 displays an exemplary web page 302 .
- Web page 302 comprises a search field 306 with a corresponding search button 307 (for initiating a search for information corresponding to the search query entered in the search field 306 ), a main map 308 , and a results panel 310 .
- the main map 308 may be a grid representing scheduled multimedia events being broadcast on a particular day. As illustrated in FIG. 3A , the main map 308 is a grid displaying television programs being broadcasted on a particular day.
- a calendar 312 displays a grid representing a range of dates. The date of the events shown in main map 308 is indicated by a highlighted date 314 in the calendar 312 . The date 314 may be highlighted by surrounding it with a box, as shown in FIG. 3A , or the text of the date may be displayed in a different color than the other dates, or the “whitespace” around the date may be a different color than the whitespace around the other dates in the calendar 312 .
- the calendar may also be represented in a different manner For example, the calendar may be represented by a horizontal bar displaying the days of the week as shown in FIG. 3B .
- the main map 308 may be a grid representing scheduled multimedia events (also called time-bounded events), such as television shows, being broadcast on a particular day.
- the information shown on the grid includes basic information (sometimes called “low resolution data” or “low resolution information”) about the scheduled events, such as event names (e.g., show names and/or episode titles for television shows).
- event names e.g., show names and/or episode titles for television shows.
- additional information sometimes called “medium resolution data” or “medium resolution information”
- medium resolution data may include channel, time of broadcast, duration or end time, and a summary or short description of the event corresponding to the user selected event name.
- a user when a user selects an event within the main map 308 , another webpage with more detailed information (sometimes called “high resolution data” or “high resolution information”) about the event may open. Additionally, when a user selects an event from results 316 in the list of results in the results panel 310 , the detailed high resolution information for the user-selected event may also be displayed. The user may select an event from results 316 by selecting (e.g., clicking on) an event name in the results 316 , such as the title of a television show or the title of the television show episode.
- a database structure for storing the low resolution data, medium resolution data and the high resolution data is described below with reference to FIGS. 6A and 6B .
- the main map 308 has two axes.
- the first (horizontal) axis represents time of day and the second (vertical) axis represents television channels.

In some embodiments, memory 506 stores the following programs, modules, and data structures, or a subset thereof:
- the web interface 108 facilitates communication between the server 106 and the communication network 104 and allows for the transfer of information from the server 106 to the communication network 104 to be displayed on a client application 112 of a client 102 .
- the multimedia events database 110 stores information associated with multimedia events.
- the server 106 may also comprise a search module 514 for conducting searches of the multimedia events database 110 .
- memory 506 includes a query server interface 516 .
- the query server interface 516 receives queries from another server, such as a query server, and returns search results to that other server.
- a query server may direct a search query from a user to multiple databases, including the multimedia events database 110 , and then send search results from one or more of those databases to the user.
- FIGS. 4 and 5 may be stored in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices, and corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above.

- FIGS. 4 and 5 show respectively a client 102 and a server 106
- the figures are intended more as functional descriptions of the various features which may be present in a client and set of servers than as a structural schematic of the embodiments therein.
- items shown separately could be combined and come items could be separated.
- some items shown separately in FIG. 5 could be implemented on a single server and single items could be implemented by one or more servers.
- the actual number of server used to implement a server 106 and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- FIG. 6A is a block diagram of a database structure 600 according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- database structure 600 applies, at least conceptually, to the multimedia events database 100 of the server 106 .
- database structure 600 may also apply to the local database 420 of a respective client 102 .
- One or more map functions 602 may be called upon to acquire information from the database 600 .
- the database structure 600 includes storage for low resolution information 604 , medium resolution information 606 , and high resolution information 608 . Each of these types of information which may be accessed by the server 106 for sending to a client 102 in response to a client request for information of that type.
- low resolution information corresponding to the request is acquired from the multimedia events database 110 and is sent to the client.
- the low resolution information is used to display basic information about multimedia events that correspond to the request.
- the low resolution information sent to the client (or a portion of the low resolution information sent to the client) may be displayed in the main map 308 ( FIG. 3 ) of a landing page or search results page, as described above. Since the main map 308 can only display events that fall within a currently specified time period, any low resolution information that is sent to the client, but which is for times earlier or later than the currently specified time period is not initially displayed on the main map 308 .
- the client may prefetch low resolution information for events outside the currently specified time window. For example, if the beginning of the currently specified time window corresponds to the current time, the client may prefetch low resolution information for a next time window, immediately following the currently specified time window, so that the user will experience zero or almost zero latency when the user scrolls the time window of the main map “forward” (to a future time window). All the downloaded event information is stored in the local database 420 of the client ( FIG. 4 ). When the user scrolls the time window backwards or forwards on the main map 308 , prefetched low resolution already stored at the client can be immediately displayed on the main grid 308 . Additionally, medium resolution information corresponding to the low resolution information being displayed on the main map may also be prefetched.
- the medium resolution information is data that is displayed when a user hovers a pointer over a television show title that is being displayed on the main map. Therefore, if the medium resolution information for a particular event is prefetched, when the user hovers a pointer over the event title (e.g., a television show title), the medium resolution information is displayed without latency.
- Medium resolution information may include channel, duration, time of broadcast and other types of information about the television show.
- the high resolution information is data that is displayed when a user selects an event title (e.g., a television show title) displayed on the main map 308 .
- the high resolution information is displayed in an iframe (also called an inline frame) that partially obscures the landing page or search results page, but leaves the landing page or search results page in place in the client application. See exemplary schematic screenshot in FIG. 3E .
- the user can return to the landing page or search results page by closing the iframe 356 or clicking on a portion of the landing page that is not covered by the iframe.
- FIG. 6B is a block diagram of a database structure according to other embodiments of the present invention.
- this database structure may be used in either the server 106 , or a respective client 102 , or both.
- a multimedia events database or local database contain a set of events 612 .
- the data representing an event may be found in the database by the use of one or more mapping functions on indices 602 .
- a respective mapping function or index may map an event identifier to an event record, or set of records, in the database.
- a respective event in the set of events has corresponding low resolution event information 614 , medium resolution event information 616 , and high resolution event information 618 . While most events in the database may have all three sets of information, it is possible that some events in the database will be devoid of high resolution information 618 , or even medium resolution information.
