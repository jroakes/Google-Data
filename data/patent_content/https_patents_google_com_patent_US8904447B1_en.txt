- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.

- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- Content sponsors can create campaigns that define the parameters for when and how their content items are presented. Controls can be provided for the content sponsor to identify one or more content items for distribution and to specify targeting parameters along with a bid.
- a content management system can facilitate the presentation of the content items in accordance with the parameters associated with a given campaign.

- the method can include: receiving selections to exclude one or more of the networks in the filtered list of networks; and presenting a list of attributes required to be provided to complete the campaign.
- Receiving attribute information from the user can include input satisfying the list.
- Automatically preparing the video content item for distribution can include preparing the video content item for distribution in only the selected formats and to only the selected networks.

- the system automatically configures the video content item to be included in all supported formats and networks and divides the user's budget across the supported formats and networks to achieve balanced results ( 406 ).
- a campaign budget can be distributed evenly across network and format combinations formed from the selected formats and networks or the campaign budget can be distributed according to some other algorithm, such as an algorithm that allocates budget amounts according to how presenting a video content item in a particular format and on a particular network might meet one or more goals of the campaign, as compared to other format and network combinations.
- the user chooses which networks and/or formats to opt out of ( 408 ). For example, in response to the user selecting the control 212 , the user interface 300 described above with respect to FIG. 3 can be displayed. The user can, using the user interface 300 , select one or more formats to exclude and/or can select one or more networks to exclude.

- one or more attribute controls can be displayed which allow the user to enter attributes to be used for preparing the selected video for distribution in the selected formats and across the selected networks.
- An attribute can be received, for example, if the attribute is needed to prepare the selected video in at least one format or for at least one network.
- the system automatically prepares the video content item using the provided assets and attributes ( 414 ).
- the content management system 110 can prepare a video content item for each network and format combination that can be formed from the selected networks and formats.
- the user can preview a video content item in some or all of network and format combinations that can be formed from the selected formats and networks.

- a content distribution system as part of a campaign ( 502 ).
- the user can select a video using the control 202 .
- a user is prompted to determine if the user wants control over formats and networks in which the video content item will be displayed ( 504 ).
- the user can be presented with the controls 204 and 212 , where the user can select the control 212 if the user wants control over formats and networks the video content item will be displayed in and can select the control 204 if the user does not want control over formats and networks the video content item will be displayed in.
- a user selection indicating that the user wants automatic format and network selection is received ( 506 ). For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , the user can select the control 204 .
- Attribute information is received from the user for use in presenting the video content item in accordance with the received selection for automatic format and network selection ( 508 ).
- the user can provide attribute information using the controls 206 , 208 , and 210 .
- the video content item is automatically prepared for distribution in a predetermined number of formats and across a predetermined number of networks, including determining a distribution among the formats and the networks consistent with a first predetermined criteria ( 510 ).
- the pre-determined formats can include, for example, search-result-embedded format, selected-from-group format, in-display format, and stream-embedded format.
- the predetermined criteria can specify, for example, to deliver the video content consistent with campaign goals. For example, displaying a video in a first format and on a first network may be more advantageous towards meeting a campaign goal than displaying the video in a second format and on a second network. Accordingly, a larger portion of the campaign budget (e.g., larger bids) can be allocated to the first network and first format combination as compared to the second network and second format combination.
- the campaign is stored ( 512 ).
- one or more prepared video content items and campaign settings can be stored in the parameters data store 112 .
