- the metadata 244 for a unique media item includes, but is not limited to, the content identifier 243 for the unique media item, at least a subset of the metadata 240, 241, and 242 for each instance of the unique media item. For example, Episode 1 of "The Simpsons" may have 6 instances across various content sources.
- the content mapping module 205 may assign a content identifier 243 having a value of "1" to Episode 1 of "The Simpsons” and may include metadata for each instance of Episode 1 of "The Simpsons.”
- the content mapping module 205 uses the content identifiers 243 and the metadata 244 for the instances of the unique media items to generates a search index 203 that is used to efficiently identify content identifiers 243 for media items.
- the content mapping module 205 also uses the content identifiers 243 and the metadata 244 for the instances of the unique media items to generate an availability database 204 that is indexed by the content identifiers 243 and content sources on which the corresponding instances of the media items are available.
- the front end module 201 receives a search query 230 from the client device 101 and dispatches the search query 230 to the availability module 202. Prior to dispatching the search query 230 to the availability module 202, the front end module 201 optionally normalizes and expands the search query 230. The front end module 201 optionally receives information relating to content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 from the client device 101. Alternatively, the availability module 202 obtains the information relating to content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 from a database (e.g., a profile of the user 106 of the client device 101, a profile for the client device 101, etc.).
- a database e.g., a profile of the user 106 of the client device 101, a profile for the client device 101, etc.
- the availability module 202 queries the search index 203 using the search query 230 to obtain content identifiers 232 and metadata 233 for instances of media items that satisfy the search query 230.
- the availability module 202 queries the availability database 204 using the content identifiers 232 and content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 to obtain instances 234 of media items that are available on content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101.
- the instances 234 of media items are both (1) available on content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 and (2) satisfy the search query 230.
- the availability module 202 then generates search results 235 and aggregate information 236 based on the metadata 233 and the instances 234 of media items that are available on content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101. In some
- the search results 235 include information relating to the instances 234 of media items (e.g., a name and/or an episode number for episodes of a television series, a name of a television series, a name of movie, etc.) and the aggregate information 236 corresponding to the unique media items.
