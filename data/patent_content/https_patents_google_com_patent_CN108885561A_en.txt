Specific embodiment
In shared parallel computation environment, computing resource can be deployed to different tasks, can both be deployed to
Different parallel operation tasks in single operation, can also be deployed to the different work that can be handled simultaneously.In order to true
Surely these resources how should be deployed, one can be distributed for operation and overstock (backlog) size, which, which defines, permit
Many few inputs are overstock.Then resource is dynamically distributed and deleted according to overstocked actual size, so that practical overstock to be maintained at
The overstocked rank distributed or the overstocked rank lower than distribution.For example, this can permit the dynamic adaptation of resource as time goes by
Match the demand of operations specific.
This dynamic adaptation can be referred to as auto zoom.This is because can be used for the resource of operations specific can contract automatically
It puts, to match the process demand for the input for being supplied to operation over time.As input quantity changes over time, need more
More resources prevents the unacceptable building of untreated input.It is this it is untreated input will create it is overstocked, substantially
On be that can handle but still untreated input.
Overstock can with size of data (for example, byte, Mbytes), the processing time (for example, data can with but not yet located
The duration of reason currently overstocks data processed expeced times, number until all using current or fixed quantity resource
According to throughput value at any time), count (for example, quantity of file or fragment) and measure, or come along other dimensions appropriate
Measurement.
Overstocked size is the useful measurement for tuning automatically, because it still can influence the degree of other computing resources
Amount, can influence computer based product serviceability and can be by the readily comprehensible measurement of human user.For example, with
Overstocked increase, be stored in calculator memory overstocked will need more and more memories.By keep overstock be equal to or
Less than target sizes, it is known that and planning required memory size.Equally, be maintained at target sizes by will overstock hereinafter,
Service quality can be provided.Model is only parsed when being posted by, the operation for parsing social media model is just useful.Passing through will
The overstocked of the model not parsed is maintained within such as two minutes, it can be ensured that the operation is useful to its expected purpose.By with
It records and reports and overstock to human user is intelligible dimension, these users can use their operation and not with decision
How the operation come is utilized and pays.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram that highly distributed calculates environment 100, tunes resource allocation automatically for a group job.Such as office
Domain net (LAN), wide area network (WAN), internet or these the combined connection of computer network 102 distributed processing system(DPS) 104,
Flow data provider 106 and one or more network storage equipments 108.For example, distributed processing system(DPS) 104 may include point
Cloth processing system manager 110, working device manager 112 and multiple data processors 114.Although network storage equipment 108
It is depicted as separating with distributed processing system(DPS) 104, but they may also be included in that in distributed processing system(DPS) 104.
Flow data provider 106 provides the data handled by distributed processing system(DPS) 104.Distributed processing system(DPS) 104 can
To obtain data record and instruction for executing one or more operations 111 in data record.As an example, flow data mentions
For device 106 can to distributed processing system(DPS) 104 provide search inquiry record with for filter, classify and other analysis.For example,
Search inquiry record may include the search inquiry and relevant information for submitting to search system, such as indicate the receiving time of inquiry
Timestamp.
For example, the data from flow data provider can be non-boundary (unbounded), unpredictable, height
It is variation and/or burst.Non-boundary data include be continuous updating the size not determined data set data or stream
Data.The example of continuous updating data set can be server log when they are generated, or all new when handling them
Order.Unpredictable data include that at least in certain dimensions, it is difficult to predict, data that are unpredictable or not yet predicting.For example,
The rate that user receives Email may be unpredictable, because it, which is likely to be dependent on highly distributed, calculates environment 100
The factor that cannot or can not be accessed.The data of height change include at least data of significant changes in one dimension.Height becomes
The data of change may be that height is seasonal or periodic.Log from vendor web site may faster or slower more
Newly, time and shopping season are specifically dependent upon.Bursty data includes that the instant rate of data generation keeps off being averaged for data generation
The data of rate.In other words, bursty data often calculates environment 100 by highly distributed with the burst reception of high data receiver,
The subsequent of high data receiver is low data receiver interval.
Distributed processing system(DPS) manager 110 can execute processing scheduling and resource management clothes for data processing system 104
Business, such as by distributing the operation 111 to be run by working device 113, distributing one or more data processors for working device 113
114, distribute one or more disks (disk) of network storage equipment 108 for working device 113, identify and solve failure and overstock,
And management temporarily and for a long time stores.Although working device manager 112 is described as
Separated, but in some embodiments, work manager 112 can be a part of distributed processing system(DPS) manager 110.
Working device manager 112 monitors working device 113, data processor 114 and network storage equipment 108 to determine that workload is overstock
Whether and when it is created.If creating workload overstock, or resource (for example, data processor 114 and/
Or network storage equipment 108) it is idle when do not create workload and overstock, then workload manager 112 can tune point automatically
The resource of dispensing operation 111.
Operation 111 handles the data from flow data provider 106, and generates and be possibly stored to network storage equipment 108
Or output for other purposes.In some embodiments, operation 111 is from multiple data stream reception input datas.For example, making
Industry 11 can receive social media model stream from flow data provider 106, and mention from different (unshowned) streamed datas
Weather data stream is received for device.In order to handle the input traffic received, operation 111 can be assigned to working device 113.Example
Such as, each working device 113 may have been allocated for the entity of one or more processors 114 and network storage equipment 108 or
Virtual one or more disks.It is then assigned to the processing that the working device 113 of operations specific 111 can be defined according to operation 111
Carry out processing stream input data, and sends other places for the output of products being stored in network storage equipment 108.
Although this example describes distribute to the resource of working device 113 (for example, data processor 114 and network storage
Equipment 108) and the working device 113 of operation 111 is distributed to, but other schemes for deploying resource to operation 111 are also
It is possible.For example, the disk of data processor 114 and/or network storage equipment 108 can be straight by distributed processing system(DPS) manager
It connects and distributes to operation 111.
In some cases, operation 111 can be broken down into processing, wherein each processing is assigned to a working device
113.For example, when operation 111 be can parallelization when this may be advantageous, such as operation 111 can be broken down into multiple activities,
Each activity can be run independently from each other.
Fig. 2 includes chart 200,208 and 216, shows automatic tuning and without the resource for operation tuned automatically
Allotment.If resource may excessively be provided (overprovisioned) or be provided insufficient without automatic tuning
(underprovisioned).Meeting waste of resource is excessively provided, while providing deficiency and may cause during workload peaks
Backwardness.In contrast, when workload increases, working device is provided in tuning automatically, and similarly when workload is reduced
Working device quantity is reduced, can according to need dynamic adjustresources.
In chart 200, the excessive output of resource is shown.Line 202 indicates that the constant level provided, the constant level are big
The workload shown in line 204.Region 206 indicates resource that is formulated not used and therefore wasting.
In chart 208, the under production of resource is shown.Line 210 indicates that the constant level provided, the constant level are low
The workload shown in line 212 during peak value.Region 214 indicate to cause it is overstocked can not processed workload,.
In chart 216, the automatic tuning of resource allocation is shown.Line 218 indicates negative in response to working shown in line 220
The dynamic adaptation rank of the resource of the variation of load.As shown, the resource being deployed is no better than or is greater than workload.This
Outside, although workload is greater than the resource of allotment in some cases, so as to cause backlog increase, resource allocation rank is rapid
It improves, so that resource is deployed more in a short time.Therefore, increased overstock can be disposed by increased resource allocation, be gone forward side by side
Row processing is to return to target rank.
For example, following signals can be used to make a policy in automatic tuning.Cpu busy percentage：All working in operation
The average CPU utilization of device virtual machine.Stage, which overstocks, to be increased：The size of untreatment data.Stage backlog：The data received
The measurement of untreatment data in stream, the data flow received will input to operation.In some embodiments, backlog can be
The time is overstock, this overstocks time when given current throughput is reached without additional input, when to solving overstocked spent
Between measurement.Also other signals can be used.
Automatic tuning is sought to balance using between all stages for constraining in operation as follows：Overstock growth, backlog and CPU
Utilization rate.The subset of these constraints can be used for being adjusted.For example, in some embodiments, can be used overstock increase and
Backlog.Overstocking growth constraint is averagely overstocked growth<=0.If overstock increase be it is positive, overstock accumulation and operation fall
Afterwards.Backlog constraint is backlog<=target backlog.For example, needing relatively short product when backlog is to overstock the time
Press the time to avoid such stable state：It overstocks and does not increase, but there are biggish processing delays.Shorter is acceptable overstocked
Reach lower delay, while needing more process resources.In some cases, acceptable overstocked delay time be 0 or
Close to 0.In other cases, acceptable overstocked delay time is longer.CPU constraint is CPU (for example, data processor 114)
Utilization rate is higher than threshold value.The low stable state of cpu busy percentage shows that less working device may be kept up with by flowing operation.Some
In embodiment, overstocked constraint is used to determine whether to be deployed to the resource quantity of operation, and if the system determine that adjustment
Resource quantity, CPU constraint are used for determining the resource quantity to be adjusted.
Overall operation size depends on the maximum quantity of working device needed for meeting the overstocked constraint in all stages.If product
The stage for pressing constraint satisfaction all, then CPU constraint is used for determining reduce what degree be formulated to.
In some embodiments, permanent (persistent) disk is used for storage state.Operation can have a fixed number
The permanent disk of amount stores job state, and in some cases, the quantity is identical as the maximum quantity of working device of operation is used for.
Each disk corresponds to the critical range that operation is being handled.Therefore, the working device with more polydisc is than the working device with less disk
Busier (assuming that the data in range are uniformly distributed).In some cases, scaling has the working device of non-uniform disk distribution
Quantity will lead to the maximum load rank that performance is in working device.Therefore, automatic tuning can select provide substantially uniform
Disk distribution working device quantity (for example, if aims of systems is d disk of each working device, by the work with d1 disk
The number for making device is minimized).
In some embodiments, by by current input rate (handling capacity+overstock increase) divided by current throughput come
The desired amt of the working device of moment is calculated, and is zoomed in and out by work at present device quantity.For example, if 10 working devices
Handling capacity be 1MB/s, and overstock that increase be 200K/s, then automatic tuning will request 1.2*10=12 working device.In addition,
Extra work device may be increased due to being more than the desired overstocked time.
In some embodiments, each stage independently calculates the desired amt of working device.Then operating pool is scaled
To the desired maximum functional device quantity in all stages.
In order to reduce the quantity for the resource for being deployed to operation, operation may be at averagely overstocking the time simultaneously lower than some threshold value
And overstock increase for 0 (for example, on average, over time, within the threshold range) stability state.In some implementations
In mode, system determines reduce what degree be formulated to according to such as under type.The given expectation that average disk is distributed, it is automatic to tune
Use CPU whether can be with the other agency of next lower level of disposing task device, as described below as operation.Assuming that working device
Current quantity w1, each working device have d1 (or d1-1) a disk.Find the minimum d2 of each working device>D1 disk and it is necessary most
Small w2 working device, so that w2<W1 and each working device obtain d2 (or d2-1) a disk.Assuming that perfect scale and do not open
Pin, then new working device will be run with current CPU rate multiplied by w1/w2.If new CPU rate is lower than reasonable threshold value (example
Such as, lower than 1.0), then automatic tuning is attempted allotment being reduced to w2.
Just the signal after allotment increases or decreases previous does not represent stable state usually (for example, due to frequent
Cache miss etc.).Therefore, the smoothing of decision can be used to avoid unnecessary oscillation in automatic tuning, while still
So make a response to the real change of workload.Amplification decision occurs smoothly through following manner：1) change in working device
Input signal is waited to stablize a period of time later；And 2) assume that the minimum working device quantity requested in window is higher than current number
Amount, smoothed output signals are with the working device of the selection average expectation on the time window of amplification.Wait minimum value on entire window
Rising avoid the reaction to the short-term noise in input rate.For example, if the quantity of work at present device less than 10, and should
Window includes following desired working device quantity [11,12,10], then deploying increase will select 11 as working device to be started
Quantity (before standardised amount is to obtain uniform disk distribution).
For reducing, in some embodiments, automatic tuning is waited until each of window in special time period
Value lower than working device current quantity after, narrow down to maximum value (its currently by be always with uniform disk distribution it is next compared with
The working device of low level).

Max_backlog_to_downscale constraint is that our trial reduces the signal of allotment.If system is lower than the threshold
Value, then the system waste of resource and can may be completed with less system working device.
In some embodiments, amplification is based on addition working device 1) to keep up with input rate and 2) by overstocked reduction
To minimum length.In some cases, it can be assumed that final handling capacity is with working device quantity linear scale, that is to say, that with
Working device quantity increases or decreases x times, and handling capacity increases or decreases x times.In some embodiments, required work can be calculated
The quantity for making device is the minimal level of required handling capacity divided by the handling capacity of each working device.
Residue overstock be above it is acceptable overstock overstock, i.e., when growth is negative, system seems not reduce current
It overstocks and increases.This, which may be calculated to overstock, enlivens size, subtracts overstocked acceptable size, along with negative overstocked negative growth and product
Press the sum of recovery time.
Based on the current throughput of each working device, the additives amount of working device is selected to solve in overstocking recovery time
Residue is overstock.When the quantity of additional work device may be calculated the remaining handling capacity and overstocked recovery overstock divided by each working device
The sum of between.Then, the desired amt of new working device be calculated as the piling up work quantity of device is added into the number of working device handling capacity
Amount.
Due to the disk sum of each operation may be it is fixed, when system zooms in and out, system can will be existing
Disk be distributed in working device.Disk corresponds to source/range of data, and therefore, the working device ratio with more polydisc has less
The working device of system disk is busier (assuming that data are uniformly distributed in range).In some cases, it zooms to uneven disk
The working device quantity of distribution will lead to the working device level that performance is in highest load.Therefore, system can be attempted to zoom to mention
For the immediate working device quantity of uniform disk distribution.
In order to reduce allotment, in some embodiments, system may be needed in the averagely overstocked time lower than max_
Backlog_to_downscale and the stability state for overstocking growth average out to 0.In order to determine what degree reduction is formulated to,
System uses whether CPU can dispose the agency of the other working device of next lower level as system.One determination based on agency
Example can be as follows.Assuming that the current quantity w1 of working device means each working device maximum # disk d1.System-computed maximum functional
Device w2<W1, each working device at most have d2>D1 disk.In some cases, new working device will be with current CPU rate multiplied by w1/
W2 operation.If new CPU attempts allotment being reduced to w2 lower than acceptable maximum value (for example, being lower than 1.0), system.
Operation is scaled, each stage can be independently with the quantity of desired working device.Then operating pool is contracted
It is put into the greatest hope working device quantity in all stages.
It can smoothly occur in the following manner：1) input signal is waited to stablize a period of time after working device variation,
And 2) assume minimum value be higher than current quantity, smoothed output signals in amplification on window select average expectation work
Device.Wait the rising of minimum value on entire window can be to avoid the reaction made to the short high peak in min_throughput.
For reducing, in some embodiments, system can wait until each value in window lower than working device
Current quantity, then narrowing down to maximum discre value, (it currently will be always next system level with the distribution of uniform disk
Working device).

Fig. 4 is the flow chart for tuning the instantiation procedure 500 of resource allocation automatically.Process 500 can be by such as height
The element of distributed computing environment 100 executes.So that it takes up a position, for example, 100 pairs of reference altitude distributed computing environment are handled
500 are described.However, it is possible to use other elements handle 500 or other similar processing to execute.
Processing 500 includes the operation operation 502 in the computer system comprising multiple process resources, which receives data
Stream is as input, and wherein the data volume in data flow is unlimited.For example, distributed processing system(DPS) manager 110 can be from outer
Portion user receives operation.The operation may include the instruction of such as one or more input sources from flow data provider 106,
For use as input data.Highly distributed calculates environment 100 can be by will be at the disk of network storage equipment 108 and/or data
Reason device 114 distributes to one or more working devices 113 to run operation, or instruction working device manager 112 carrys out network storage and sets
Standby 108 disk and/or data processor 114 distributes to one or more working devices 113 to run operation, and by by this one
A or multiple working devices 113 distribute to operation to run operation.Operation it is initial allotment can based on it is any technically it is appropriate because
It usually sets, including but not limited to past operation, free system resources or the other factors of operation 111.
Processing 500 includes iteratively determining to overstock for operation to increase by 504, backlog 506 and whether adjust allotment
508。
Iteratively determine that overstocking growth by 504 includes the overstocked growth determined in first time period for operation, wherein accumulating
Press the measurement of the growth of untreatment data in the data flow received increased be in operation to be input into.For example, working as operation
When 111 operation, it receives from flow data provider 106 and inputs.The input can be stored in storage organization appropriate, such as
Queue or buffer, until operation 111 can receive and handle more data.If operation 111 is received without the image of Buddha
As rapidly process data, this growth that may create or increase accumulation over time.If operation 111 can be more
The data in the storage organization received are handled fastly, this may result in the reduction for overstocking growth.It is anyway possible to monitor
The variation of growth or not.For example, can according to size of data (i.e. bit, byte, Mbytes, gigabytes, record, base
Number), processing time (i.e. microsecond, second, minute, hour, day, MB/s) or other variation to be to measure this overstocked growth.
Iteratively determine that backlog 506 includes determining backlog for operation, which is that will be input into operation
The data flow received in untreatment data measurement.As described, wait the data that are handled by operation 111 can be by
Referred to as overstock.For example, can according to size of data (i.e. bit, byte, Mbytes, gigabytes, record, radix), processing when
Between (i.e. microsecond, second, minute, hour, day) or other modes overstock to measure this.
The iteration for whether adjusting allotment 508 for operation is determining including determining whether to adjust with backlog based on overstocked increase
It is deployed to the amount of the process resource of operation.As will be further described in following example process 600, overstock increase and
The state of backlog may be used as excessively providing or providing insufficient index, and may or it is expected to deploy less or more money
Source.
Determine that adjustment for each iteration of the quantity for the process resource for being deployed to operation, is deployed to the processing of operation
The quantity 510 of resource.For example, they may be reduced if Internet resources are excessively supplied to operation 111.And if net
Network resource provides deficiency, then may will increase.
It determines each iteration for not adjusting the quantity for the process resource for being deployed to operation, maintains the place for being deployed to operation
Manage the quantity 512 of resource.For example, if Internet resources had not both been provided excessively or without providing deficiency, can have been dialled to operation 111
The Internet resources of standby same or similar rank.This may include continue to provide identical resource, or may include with etc.
Same mode provides different resource.
Other example process may include the sequence of different elements, number amount and type.For example, in addition to overstocking growth and product
Except pressure amount, the utilization rate of average processor can be determined.In this example, also based on processor utilization, iteratively determination is
The amount of the no process resource for being deployed to operation.If processor utilization is (for example, being averaged between used virtual machine
Lower than one value of value, then system can determine that the quantity for the process resource for being deployed to operation will be adjusted.For example, if processor
Lower than one value of utilization rate, then system can be determined to be below the value in response to processor value, and determination is deployed to operation
The quantity of process resource is determined adjusting.Then the quantity of the adjustable process resource for being deployed to operation of system includes：It rings
A value should be determined to be below in processor value and reduce the quantity for being deployed to the process resource of operation.For example, if many
Working device has the low processor of processor utilization, then this is likely interpreted as the mark excessively provided, and system can be with
By reducing the resource of allotment come the resource of automatic tuning and matching.
Fig. 5 is for determining that resource allocation is to increase or the flow chart of the example process 600 of reduction.Processing 600
The element of environment 100 can be calculated for example, by highly distributed to execute.Processing 600 can be for example as execution processing 500
A part execute.However, a part as processing 500 or a part not as processing 500, can be used other
Element handles 600 or other similar processing to execute.
It can maintain the amount 606 for being deployed to the process resource of operation.For example, being determined being negative or zero if overstocking to increase
(for example, zero, in zero threshold value) and backlog be determined in target value (for example, it is identical as target, in targets threshold
It is interior), this can be shown that deployed resource is enough that operation is allowed to handle input data in the case where not providing excessively.
The amount 608 for the process resource for being deployed to operation can be reduced.For example, being determined being negative or zero simultaneously if overstocking to increase
And backlog is lower than target, then allows to overstock growth --- target may be close to or up to until overstocking.
The quantity 610 for the process resource for being deployed to operation can be increased.For example, if overstock increase be confirmed as zero and
Backlog is at target, then it is overstocked to reduce can to deploy additional resource --- target may be close to or up to until overstocking.
It can maintain the quantity 612 for being deployed to the process resource of operation.For example, if overstock increase be determined being positive and
Backlog is determined to be below target, then overstocking can be allowed to increase --- target may be close to or up to until overstocking.
The quantity 614 for the process resource for being deployed to operation can be increased.For example, if overstock increase be determined being positive and
Backlog is not less than target, then additional resource can be deployed to operation, can stop or reverse so that overstocking and increasing.
Other example process may include the element of different number, type and sequence.
Fig. 6 A, 6B and 6C are for establishing, being sized the flow chart with the example process of suspended task.
During initial start 700, current load balanced device can be responsible for telling working device they possess which range, to pacify
It fills which disk and coordinates data disks being attached to correct working device.In adjusted size of processing, load balancer can be with
It tells working device to stop working in particular range, unload corresponding disk, separator disk, be attached disk again, created for all working device
New topology is built to establish task and create new starting calculating task.
Stream is carried balanced device and is interacted using small step running example with working device.When current load balanced device needs and works
When device interacts, these examples can be triggered.These steps can be to generate the particular plate migration of current load balancer consumption more
New result terminates, to know that the step of it starts is completed.After current load equalizer input is updated to disk migration, it can be used
New disk distributes to all working device and issues new foundation (topology) task.
Initial start 702.Current load balancer initially sends distributing comprising topology and disk for task to each working device and builds
Vertical message.The task of initially setting up can for each working device include disk, but system may decision not on initially setting up task
Transmitting panel distribution.This can prevent working device from attempting to install the disk that they are not yet attached.Working device can state that this establishes task,
And because this can be their first, they can attempt mounting disc, but be not in disk in installation task, this
It may result in and occur mistake in system.
Then current load balanced device can star disk attachment 704.The first step can open up all give in step input
The working device flutterred executes disk attachment.For example, once all disks are attached, it is all working that subsequent calculating starting, which can trigger,
Device generates stream calculation task, to inform what disk they are attached.The step can complete shape until all these tasks all enter
State.Working device can state these calculating tasks and attempt mounting disc and start to inquire associated range.At that time, working device can be with
Start-up operation 706.
When system detection has been completed to all stream calculation tasks, disk migration, which updates 708, can start to inform current load
Balancer all be completed.Current load balanced device observation DiskMigrationUpdate and cancel it is all it is existing establish task,
And it can be issued to all working device that is distributed comprising most final quotation and new establish task.
Working device can be abandoned establishing task and be found new in the update next time in its task creation message rental period (1s)
Task.Assuming that working device has had the disk of correct installation, working device is not necessarily to execute behaviour to disk in new establishing in task
Make, because this is not their first.
It is sized (for example, mobile disk) 710.At least may exist 2 kinds of situations, expand and reduces.They can be
It is disposed in agreement using same or similar step, one example of which is as follows：New sky is issued for new working device to build
Vertical task 712 (not reducing).These do not include disk initially.Wait new working device state these skies establish task (in order to avoid
Stop existing stream too early).It may not be needed etc. to be zoomed out.It is sent to all working device for losing disk and stops calculating task 712, and
All of which is waited to complete.Execute disk separating step 714.It executes disk and is attached step 716.Beginning calculating task is sent to obtain to all
It takes the working device 718 of disk and all of which is waited to complete.Cancel it is all it is existing establish task, and issue to all working device new
Finally establish task 720.Coordination between current load balanced device and above-mentioned mini workflow step can according to it is initial
It establishes the identical mode of processing to complete, that is to say, that after completing final step, issue finally new in current load balanced device
The disk migration that the consumption of current load balanced device can be generated before establishing task updates result.
Pause 740.It, can be with initiated suspension parameter 742 for break-off process.Can start to work device calculating it is temporary
Stop 704.It can be from some or all working device separator disks 706.It can complete disk migration and update 708.
Although processing 700,710 and 740 is described as having specific operation amount, order and type, other processing
It is possible.For example, another processing is described below.In this processing, system can issue in system and start and stop meter
Issued while calculation task it is new establish task, to make the behavior of working device relative to being unsuccessfully idempotent.It is moved in each disk
It, may at least 3 kinds of working devices when shifting：Lose the working device of disk.Obtain the working device of disk.Keep the working device of identical disk.
In order to test, system also supports the 4th kind of combination, obtains and lose the working device of disk.
They the available task of working device of any disk is lost, and needs no longer including disk that they lose
It obtains new establishing task simultaneously.In addition, if working device can obtain disk in next task, the foundation issued at this time
Task may not include the disk that it not yet possesses.Therefore, if they are collapsed, they may not necessarily attempt to install them
/ disk for just having abandoned, and they may not necessarily attempt the still unreceived disk of installation.If they successfully unload
Their disk, then they can achieve desired state.Otherwise, they can state again again and run unloading, if
It has been completed, then this may be do-nothing operation (noop).If they occur to collapse and restart, they only will be installed them
The disk (both do not lose or do not obtain) retained in this wheel
The working device for obtaining disk obtains new establishing task while obtaining starting calculating task.If they are collapsed,
Regardless of whether starting calculating task is completed, they can install new building in restarting.Again, if they have installed
Some disks are reinstalled can be idempotent and may not cause problem.During migration, the work of identical disk is kept
Device can be endowed at any time new establishes task.System can create newly stopping calculating at point for these working devices
Establish task, that is, stop calculating point being that a few thing device is had at first point stopped working using existing topology.
Initial start.In initial start, system no longer issues the task that initially sets up, but system is attached disk, then sends out
All a part finally established task and calculate step as starting out.Which solves contest and the starting time is shortened, because
It is abandoned not establish task needs, states again.
It is sized (migration).When amplification, by disk before removing in productivity working device, system should wait new virtual
Machine is ready.Therefore, system still can initially set up task for the sending of new working device, at the same be arranged a mark (flag) (by
In no unappropriated disk, at that time they do not include any disk actually).The foundation of the new initial available sky of working device is appointed
Business, but this allows to wait until that they are ready.
Later, for lose the work on hand device of disk issue stop calculating task and its new to establish task (and existing
Establish the cancellation of task).Meanwhile system may be both not increase or the working device for not losing disk to issue all foundation to appoint
Business.Once all stopping calculating tasks being completed, disk will be separated and is then attached.Finally, NEW BEGINNING calculating task is issued, with
And task (and existing cancellation for establishing task) is established in the new of the working device for obtaining disk.
Then, what new working device can see them newly establishes task with the distribution of most final quotation, or sees beginning first
Calculating task.Alternative one can make them be mounted on their possessed disks at that time.If they collapse in that time,
They also can achieve new dbjective state.
Pause.When pause, system is issued to all virtual machines stops calculating task, and creates to disk distribution is not included
Vertical task and receive some to establish the cancellation of task (therefore, in the case where collapsing, working device is not attempted to install them can
The disk that can have been abandoned).Disk is separated.
It may be useful for calculating from working device to its mapping for establishing task.Because this is mapped in stopping and starts to count
Calculate step in modified, they have the subtransaction of oneself, thus we cannot as previously done in current load balanced device that
Sample consistently maintains this mapping.It is mapped on the contrary, we carry out on-demand computing using result cache in those steps.This
Provide the chance for deleting the old call result of all suspension and completion task.
No matter when we it is new in order to which this working device issues establish task with cancel it is existing establish task (if present),
It can calculate and inquire the mapping.This is stopping calculating or is starting to calculate step, and reduces or occur after suspending.
Further, it is possible to use sending the communication that operation is handled to use to the information that system is more available but is not all of
Family.It is some example details that possible use below.
