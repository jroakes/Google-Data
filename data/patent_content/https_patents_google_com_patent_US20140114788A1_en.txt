Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to determining a price for content.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources.
- video, audio, and Web pages are accessible over the Internet.
- These resources present opportunities for other content (e.g., advertising or non-advertising content, such as audio, video, or the like) to be provided with the resources.
- a Web page can include slots in which content can be presented. Similarly, such slots can be part of television programming.
- Slots can be allocated to content providers (e.g., advertisers).
- a network can be used to allocate content to the slots based, e.g., on various factors relating to the content and the context in which it is to be presented.
- the content can be allocated based, in part, on keywords input to a system, such as a search engine.
- An auction can be performed for the right to present advertising in a slot. In the auction, content sponsors provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of their content. Typically, the winning bidder is given the right to present content.
- Example techniques for determining a price for content may include the following operations: obtaining bids from content providers, where the bids correspond to amounts that the content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher; obtaining surcharges corresponding to an effect on the publisher of presenting content from the content providers on the portal; using one or more processing devices to adjust the bids in accordance with corresponding surcharges to thereby produce adjusted bids; comparing the adjusted bids to determine a winner of an auction to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher; determining a price for the winner to pay based on the surcharge; and charging the winner the price for presenting content on the portal.
- the foregoing example techniques may include one or more of the following features, either alone or in combination.
- Surcharges may be different for different content providers, and the effect may include a cost borne by the publisher of presenting a content item from a content provider.
- the cost may include a monetary effect on a business of the content provider of presenting the content item.
- Surcharges may be obtained from the publisher. Each surcharge may correspond to a content item from a content provider. At least one of the surcharges may be based on an adjusted bid of a winner of a prior auction.
- the surcharges may be based on one or more of the following factors: a type of the content, subject matter of the content, functionality of the content, a developer of the content, features included in the content, an industry associated with the content, whether the content is for a competitor of the publisher, and links associated with the content.
- Each of the surcharges may be determined using a linear classifier that multiplies values corresponding to one or more of the factors by corresponding weights and that processes resulting products to produce a surcharge.
- the content may be advertising, and the content providers may be advertisers.
- the content providers may include Web site providers
- the advertising may include an online advertisement (ad)
- the surcharges may be based on one or more of the following: whether the ad is expandable, subject matter of the ad, whether the ad includes pixel tags, an ad agency that developed the ad, whether the ad contains audio, whether the ad contains video, whether video contained in the ad starts when a page is loaded or requires interaction before starting, an industry that the ad represents, whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher, and whether the ad clicks-through to a Web page that meets one or more predefined criteria regarding Web page quality.
- the content providers may be television providers, the advertising may be a television advertisement (ad), and the surcharges may be based on one or more of the following: subject matter of the ad, an industry that the ad represents, and whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher.
- Determining the price may include adding, to an adjusted bid of the winner, a surcharge corresponding to the adjusted bid of the winner to produce the price.
- Determining the price may include obtaining an adjusted bid of a content provider who placed second in the auction behind the winner; and adding, to the adjusted bid of the content provider who placed second in the auction, a surcharge corresponding to the adjusted bid of the winner to produce the price.
- the systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices.
- the systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system for distributing content to users over a network.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example content exchange system.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a price of content.
- FIG. 4 shows examples of computing devices on which the processes described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented.
- Described herein are techniques for determining a price of content, such as advertisements, that can be included in other content, such as web pages or multimedia presentations.
- content such as advertisements
- advertisers pay content providers for presenting their advertising content to users in association with their web pages or other primary content.
- advertising content is created equal. Relative to the web page or other media content in which advertising content is to be provided, some advertising content may be more or less desirable than others. For example, the operator of a Web site directed toward healthy lifestyles may prefer an advertisement for an organic foods market over an advertisement for fast food. In another example, the provider of a family-oriented television program may prefer to show a commercial for a “G” rated movie rather than one for an “R” rated movie.
- the choice of which advertising content to present can also have a financial impact upon the web page or other media content in which the advertising content is presented.
- the presentation of less desirable content may hurt a web page's reputation or image, and this may cause users to become fractionally less likely to revisit the page.
- the display of some advertisements can have different impacts and resulting costs to the web page providers.
- the higher negative impact of certain advertising content upon a content provider can be offset by adding a content-dependent surcharge to the cost of presenting the advertising content, and this surcharge can be included in a bidding process for selecting the advertising content that will be presented.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example network environment 100 that may be used in the processes described herein for determining a price for content (e.g., ads).
- content e.g., ads
- network 102 connects various entities, such as Web sites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers (e.g., advertisers 108 ), online publishers 109 , television broadcasters 134 , and a content management system 110 .

- Web sites 104 may include one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example Web site 104 a is a collection of Web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each Web site 104 can be maintained by a publisher 109 , which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the Web site 104 .
- a resource 105 may be any appropriate data that can be provided over network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 can include HypterText Mark-up Language (HTML) pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name a few.
- Resources 105 can also include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- environment 100 can include a search system 112 , as described below, that identifies resources 105 by crawling and indexing resources 105 provided by the content publishers on the Web sites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds. Indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 that match input keywords can be retrieved and output.
- An example user device 106 a is an electronic device that is under control of a user and that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- a user device may include one or more processing devices, and may be, or include, a mobile telephone (e.g., a smartphone), a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a network appliance, a camera, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices.
- the user device can be included as part of a motor vehicle (e.g., an automobile, an emergency vehicle (e.g., fire truck, ambulance), a bus).
- a motor vehicle e.g., an automobile, an emergency vehicle (e.g., fire truck, ambulance), a bus).
- User device 106 a can request resources 105 from a Web site 104 a .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 a for presentation by the user device 106 a .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- a request for a resource 105 or a search query 116 sent from a user device 106 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of the user device.
- the search system 112 can access a search index to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 . As described below, the search system 112 identifies resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to a user device 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 may include data generated by search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and that includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a Web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the Web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the Web page.
- Content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- Content management system 110 also can update database 124 based on activity of a user.
- the database 124 can store a profile for the user which includes, for example, information about past user activities, such as visits to a place or event, past requests for resources 105 , past search queries 116 , other requests for content, social network profiles and connections, Web sites visited, or interactions with content.
- the information in database 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement (“ad”) log, or requests for content.
- the database 124 can include, for each entry, a cookie identifying the user, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requesting user device 106 , a type of usage, and details associated with the usage.
- IP Internet Protocol
- content management system 110 can receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page.
- the data representing the resource 105 can include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or Web page, in which content can be presented.
- An example slot is an ad slot.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- Information about slots can be provided to content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system identifies content, such as advertising, that is associated with keywords that match, or are substantially similar to, the input keywords (e.g., are a variant of the keywords, such as “car” or “cars”). When a match is detected, content management system 110 outputs the corresponding content.
- the processes described herein may be used to serve customized ads based, e.g., on input keywords or other search query content.
- content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (referred to as “eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can be eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are associated with user-provided keywords (e.g., terms in the input search query).
- the universe of eligible content items can be narrowed by taking into account other factors, such as the content of previous search queries 116 .
- content items corresponding to historical search activities of the user including, e.g., search keywords used, particular content interacted with, sites visited by the user, etc. may also be used in the selection of eligible content items by the content management system 110 .
- the eligibility of content items may be determined by a combination of two or more characteristics.
- an identified advertisement may include a characteristic that indicates that the ad may have a negative impact upon on the web page in which the ad may be presented (e.g., a fast food ad on a health Web site), in which case the ad may be charged an additional fee by the publisher in order to sufficiently offset the cost of the ad's negative impact. If the ad's price, even once this surcharge is deducted, is sufficient to meet all appropriate other selection criteria, then the ad may be identified as being eligible for presentation.
- Content management system 110 can select the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource 105 or search results page 118 based, at least in part, on results of an auction. For example, for eligible content items, content management system 110 can receive bids from content providers (e.g., advertisers 108 ) and allocate slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 105 or search results page 118 .
- content providers e.g., advertisers 108
- the bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 105 or search results page 118 .
- a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM (cost per mille) bid.
- the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the bid will be multiplied by the expected probability of the selection occurring within 1000 impressions.
- the resulting bid is referred to as an eCPM (or expected CPM) bid.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a content provider can bid for an identified audience of users.
- one or more of the publishers 109 and/or the content management system 110 may provide one or more audiences of users, where each user in the audience matches one or more targeting criteria, such as matching one or more demographics.
- An audience of users may be represented, for example, as a user list.
- User lists or other representations of audiences may be stored, for example, in a database 124 .
- a bid from a content provider can specify, for example, an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item to a particular audience of users.
- the content management system 110 may, for example, manage the presentation of the content item to users included in a particular audience and may manage charging of the content provider for the impressions and distributing revenue to the publishers 109 based on the impressions.
- TV broadcasters 134 produce and present television content on TV user devices (not shown), where the TV content may be organized into one or more channels.
- the TV broadcasters 134 may include, along with the TV content, one or more content slots in which other content (e.g., advertisements) may be presented.
- content slots e.g., advertisements
- a TV network may sell slots of advertising to advertisers in TV programs that they broadcast. Some or all of the content slots may be associated with keywords that relate, e.g., to the television programs in broadcast on a particular channel.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example content exchange system 200 .
- the content exchange system 200 can be included in the network environment 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the content exchange system 200 can be part of the content management system 110 .
- buyers can be offered the ability to decide how much they are willing to pay to show an ad in real time (e.g., “real-time bidding”).
- Sellers can have an interest in applying different pricing rules to different bidders; for example, some kinds of ads may negatively affect their site's user experience, so a seller may only be willing to show such an ad in exchange for a greater payment. Additionally, sellers may want to try and capture a greater share of their inventory's value by charging high prices for valuable inventory.
- the content exchange system 200 can provide sellers with real-time flexibility similar to that offered to buyers.
- the content exchange system 200 identifies a candidate content item 202 , such as an advertisement that can be included in a web page, media presentation or other appropriate resource.
- a collection of content features 204 associated with the candidate content item 202 is identified by the content exchange system 200 .
- the collection of content features 204 includes information that describes the candidate content item 202 .
- the collection of content features 204 can include information such as the content item's format (e.g., text, image, video, audio), size, duration, functionality (e.g., the ad is static until clicked or hovered, the ad plays a media clip automatically, the ad is completely static), subject matter (e.g., the type of product, good, or service being advertised), intended customer audience (e.g., demographic information), developer of the content, links associated with the content, or combinations of these and other information that can describe the candidate content item 202 .
- the content features 204 may indicate that the candidate content item 202 is an advertisement for a political candidate, is intended for a male audience aged 30-40 years, is formed as a 30 ⁇ 70 pixel multimedia panel, and periodically plays a loop of audiovisual content.
- the collection of content features 204 are provided to a pricing model 206 .
- the pricing model 206 can be part of a system that is external to the content exchange system 200 .
- the pricing model 206 can be operated by the Web site 104 a to estimate the possible negative impact and cost of presenting the content item 202 along with the resource 105 .
- the pricing model 206 determines a collection of surcharge factors 208 that are provided to the content exchange system 200 .
- the surcharge factors 208 correspond to effects on the publisher of presenting the candidate content 202 on a portal, such as a Web site, television program, radio program, or other appropriate host in which advertising content can be included. For example, if presenting content has a negative effect on the publisher's business, the surcharge will be higher to represent the added burden on the publisher.
- the surcharge factors can be determined based on a type of the candidate content item 202 , subject matter of the candidate content item 202 , functionality of the candidate content item 202 , a developer of the candidate content item 202 , features included in the candidate content item 202 , an industry associated with the candidate content item 202 , whether the candidate content item 202 is for a competitor of the publisher, and links associated with the candidate content item 202 .
- the surcharges can be determined using one or more linear classifiers that multiply values corresponding to one or more of the factors by corresponding weights and that process resulting products to produce the surcharges.
- a collection of unadjusted bids 210 for the candidate content item 202 is obtained from content providers.
- the collection of unadjusted bids 210 corresponds to amounts that content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher.
- the advertisers 108 may submit competing bids to present the candidate content item 202 on one or more of the Web sites 104 or in one or more broadcasts provided by the TV broadcasters 134 .
- the unadjusted bids 212 are adjusted in accordance with corresponding ones of the collection of surcharge factors 208 to produce the collection of adjusted bids 212 .
- one of the advertisers 108 may provide an unadjusted bid to place the candidate content item 202 on one or more of the web pages 104 .
- the web pages 104 may include different content or address different audiences, and as a result the content features 204 of the candidate content item 202 may have a different effect and cost to each of those web pages 104 . These different costs can be reflected in the surcharge factors 208 to determine the adjusted bids 212 .
- An auction 214 is performed based on the adjusted bids 212 .
- the adjusted bids 212 are compared to determine a winner of the auction 214 to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher.
- the incentive issues in online advertising auctions may differ, and so too may the auction type. For example, in a “first-price auction”, where the advertising space is sold to the highest bidder who pays the amount that they bid, bidders may have an incentive to bid “strategically”, e.g., to lower their bid to just above that of the next highest bidder in order to pay as little as possible.
- some online advertising auctions can be “second-price auctions” in which the highest bidder can pay the second-highest bid.
- first-price auctions can be helpful to sellers of advertising, since they may capture the difference between the first and second prices in the short run. In examples such as these, it may be important to solve the above problem without giving sellers access to bids directly, or they may use the bids in a way that would induce buyers to bid strategically.
- a system in order to allow the sellers to make incentive-compatible pricing decisions in real time, a system can be implemented in which sellers may not have access to the bids themselves. Instead, the sellers are provided with information about the candidate content item's 202 features, not including bids, and they can use the pricing model 206 to compute the surcharge factors 208 for each bid.
- the surcharge factors 208 are surcharges or bonuses that will be subtracted from or added to each ad's bid before it enters the auction 214 .
- the surcharge factors 208 are applied, whereupon the bids enter the auction 214 and can compete in a second-price-auction.
- the price adjustment factors are applied to the price paid by the winning content item in reverse to compute an actual price 218 (e.g., how much the candidate content item 202 is charged).
- a report 220 is provided.
- the report 220 can include information that identifies the ad that won the auction 214 and the actual price 218 paid, but not the bids of non-winning ads back to the seller.
- the features of advertisements A, B, and C can be provided to the pricing model 206 , which can return, for example:
- Adjusted bids for A, B, and C can then be determined, such as:
- Ad A $1.25 aCPM (adjusted cost per mille)
- Ad B $1.50 aCPM
- Ad C $1.10 aCPM
- the second price auction 214 can then be performed.
- the result would be advertisement B winning and paying an aCPM of $1.25.
- advertisement B's surcharge would be re-applied, yielding an actual paid CPM of $1.75.
- the auction 214 in such examples can have a number of desirable properties.
- the bidder may not ever pay more than they bid.
- the auction can still be incentive-compatible.
- the winner of the auction 214 can be the advertisement the seller most desires to show. As such, the features of real-time bidding can be extended to sellers substantially without encountering incentive-compatibility issues.
- sellers can specify their pricing model to the content exchange system 200 .
- the content exchange system 200 can verify the properties of the pricing model ahead of time, and provide bids in implementations in which the incentive-compatibility of the model could be confirmed in advance.
- different tools other than surcharges or bonuses can be provided to sellers.
- sellers can be allowed to set reserve prices, which would be similar to the surcharge/bonus model but would not allow “price inversion” among advertisements (e.g., the advertisement that wins can be the eligible content with the highest initial CPM).
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing an example process 300 for determining the price of content, such as online advertising.
- Process 300 may be performed, e.g., by content management system 110 or the content exchange system 200 .
- bids are obtained from content providers.
- the bids correspond to amounts that the content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher.
- the content exchange system 200 receives the collection of unadjusted bids 210 from bidders such as the advertisers 108 .
- surcharges corresponding to an effect on the publisher of presenting content from the content providers on the portal are obtained.
- the surcharge factors 208 can be obtained from the pricing model 206 .
- surcharges can be different for different content providers, and the effect can be a cost borne by the publisher of presenting a content item from a content provider.
- the cost can be a monetary effect on a business of the content provider of presenting the content item.
- an advertisement may have a negative impact upon a web page in which the ad is presented, and the magnitude of the negative impact may be defined in terms of the financial impact (e.g., the surcharge) that the ad has upon the web page or Web site in which it was presented.
- an advertisement may have a positive impact upon the Web site that presents the ad, and the positive impact may be described in terms of a monetary value (e.g., a bonus).
- the content can be advertising, and the content providers can be advertisers.
- the content providers can be the advertisers 108 who provide advertisements that can be managed by the content management system 110 .
- the content providers can be Web site providers
- the advertising can be an online advertisement
- the surcharges can be based on one or more of the following: whether the ad is expandable, subject matter of the ad, whether the ad includes pixel tags, an ad agency that developed the ad, whether the ad contains audio, whether the ad contains video, whether video contained in the ad starts when a page is loaded or requires interaction before starting, an industry that the ad represents, whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher, and whether the ad clicks-through to a Web page that meets one or more predefined criteria regarding Web page quality.
- the publisher of a high-quality web page may charge a surcharge for presenting an ad that links the user to a page of relatively lower quality.
- the surcharges can be obtained from the publisher, and each surcharge can correspond to a content item from a content provider. At least one of the surcharges can be based on an adjusted bid of a winner of a prior auction. For example, the actual price 218 can be provided to the pricing model 206 as part of the reports 220 .
- the surcharges can be based on one or more of the following factors: a type of the content, subject matter of the content, functionality of the content, a developer of the content, features included in the content, an industry associated with the content, whether the content is for a competitor of the publisher, and links associated with the content.
- a type of the content For example, the operator of a yoga Web site may charge a surcharge for presenting an advertisement that includes sound or flashy animation.
- the operator of an airline Web site may charge a surcharge for displaying an advertisement for a bus line (e.g., a competitor).
- each of the surcharges can be determined using a linear classifier that multiplies values corresponding to one or more of the factors by corresponding weights and that processes resulting products to produce a surcharge.
- the operator of a Web site may establish a pricing model (e.g., the pricing model 206 ) in which multimedia advertisements (e.g., as opposed to text ads) and advertisements for competitors are both to be charged a surcharge for their negative effects upon the Web site.
- the pricing model may reflect the Web site operator's philosophy that competitor's advertisements have a greater negative impact than do multimedia ads.
- the surcharge associated with an advertisement belonging to a competitor may be given a relative greater mathematical weight than the weight given for the use of multimedia.
- the linear classifier can multiply the surcharges for the individual features of the ad by their respective weights to determine the total surcharge to be associated with the advertisement.
- the bids are adjusted in accordance with corresponding surcharges to thereby produce adjusted bids.
- the surcharge factors 208 and the unadjusted bids 210 are compared to provide the collection of adjusted bids 212 .
- the additional bids are obtained at 305 . If there are no additional bids at 320 , then at 325 the adjusted bids are compared to determine a winner of an auction to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher.

Abstract
Example techniques for determining a price for content may include the following operations: obtaining bids from content providers, where the bids correspond to amounts that the content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher; obtaining surcharges corresponding to an effect on the publisher of presenting content from the content providers on the portal; using one or more processing devices to adjust the bids in accordance with corresponding surcharges to thereby produce adjusted bids; comparing the adjusted bids to determine a winner of an auction to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher; determining a price for the winner to pay based on the surcharge; and charging the winner the price for presenting content on the portal.
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to determining a price for content.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, and Web pages are accessible over the Internet. These resources present opportunities for other content (e.g., advertising or non-advertising content, such as audio, video, or the like) to be provided with the resources. For example, a Web page can include slots in which content can be presented. Similarly, such slots can be part of television programming.
- Slots can be allocated to content providers (e.g., advertisers). In some systems, a network can be used to allocate content to the slots based, e.g., on various factors relating to the content and the context in which it is to be presented. For example, the content can be allocated based, in part, on keywords input to a system, such as a search engine. An auction can be performed for the right to present advertising in a slot. In the auction, content sponsors provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of their content. Typically, the winning bidder is given the right to present content.
- Example techniques for determining a price for content may include the following operations: obtaining bids from content providers, where the bids correspond to amounts that the content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher; obtaining surcharges corresponding to an effect on the publisher of presenting content from the content providers on the portal; using one or more processing devices to adjust the bids in accordance with corresponding surcharges to thereby produce adjusted bids; comparing the adjusted bids to determine a winner of an auction to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher; determining a price for the winner to pay based on the surcharge; and charging the winner the price for presenting content on the portal. The foregoing example techniques may include one or more of the following features, either alone or in combination.
- Surcharges may be different for different content providers, and the effect may include a cost borne by the publisher of presenting a content item from a content provider. The cost may include a monetary effect on a business of the content provider of presenting the content item.
- Surcharges may be obtained from the publisher. Each surcharge may correspond to a content item from a content provider. At least one of the surcharges may be based on an adjusted bid of a winner of a prior auction.
- The surcharges may be based on one or more of the following factors: a type of the content, subject matter of the content, functionality of the content, a developer of the content, features included in the content, an industry associated with the content, whether the content is for a competitor of the publisher, and links associated with the content. Each of the surcharges may be determined using a linear classifier that multiplies values corresponding to one or more of the factors by corresponding weights and that processes resulting products to produce a surcharge.
- The content may be advertising, and the content providers may be advertisers. The content providers may include Web site providers, the advertising may include an online advertisement (ad), and the surcharges may be based on one or more of the following: whether the ad is expandable, subject matter of the ad, whether the ad includes pixel tags, an ad agency that developed the ad, whether the ad contains audio, whether the ad contains video, whether video contained in the ad starts when a page is loaded or requires interaction before starting, an industry that the ad represents, whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher, and whether the ad clicks-through to a Web page that meets one or more predefined criteria regarding Web page quality.
- The content providers may be television providers, the advertising may be a television advertisement (ad), and the surcharges may be based on one or more of the following: subject matter of the ad, an industry that the ad represents, and whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher.
- Determining the price may include adding, to an adjusted bid of the winner, a surcharge corresponding to the adjusted bid of the winner to produce the price. Determining the price may include obtaining an adjusted bid of a content provider who placed second in the auction behind the winner; and adding, to the adjusted bid of the content provider who placed second in the auction, a surcharge corresponding to the adjusted bid of the winner to produce the price.
- The systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices. The systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system for distributing content to users over a network. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example content exchange system. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a price of content. -
FIG. 4 shows examples of computing devices on which the processes described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented. - Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Described herein are techniques for determining a price of content, such as advertisements, that can be included in other content, such as web pages or multimedia presentations. In general, advertisers pay content providers for presenting their advertising content to users in association with their web pages or other primary content.
- Not all advertising content, however, is created equal. Relative to the web page or other media content in which advertising content is to be provided, some advertising content may be more or less desirable than others. For example, the operator of a Web site directed toward healthy lifestyles may prefer an advertisement for an organic foods market over an advertisement for fast food. In another example, the provider of a family-oriented television program may prefer to show a commercial for a “G” rated movie rather than one for an “R” rated movie.
- The choice of which advertising content to present can also have a financial impact upon the web page or other media content in which the advertising content is presented. For example, the presentation of less desirable content may hurt a web page's reputation or image, and this may cause users to become fractionally less likely to revisit the page. In such examples, the display of some advertisements can have different impacts and resulting costs to the web page providers. In general, the higher negative impact of certain advertising content upon a content provider can be offset by adding a content-dependent surcharge to the cost of presenting the advertising content, and this surcharge can be included in a bidding process for selecting the advertising content that will be presented.
- The processes described herein may be implemented in any appropriate network environment, with any appropriate devices and computing equipment. An example of such an environment is described below.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample network environment 100 that may be used in the processes described herein for determining a price for content (e.g., ads). - As shown in
FIG. 1 ,network 102 connects various entities, such asWeb sites 104,user devices 106, content providers (e.g., advertisers 108),online publishers 109, television broadcasters 134, and acontent management system 110. In this regard,example environment 100 may include many thousands ofWeb sites 104,user devices 106, and content providers (e.g., advertisers 108). Entities connected tonetwork 102 include and/or connect through one or more servers. Each such server may be one or more of various forms of servers, such as a Web server, an application server, a proxy server, a network server, or a server farm. Each server can include one or more processing devices, memory, and a storage system. -
Network 102 can represent a communications network that can allow devices, such as auser device 106 a, to communicate with entities on the network. Network 102 can include one or more networks. The network(s) may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) voice calls, Short Message Service (SMS), Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS), or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messaging, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), CDMA2000, General Packet Radio System (GPRS), or one or more television or cable networks, among others. For example, the communication may occur through a radio-frequency transceiver. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other such transceiver. - In
FIG. 1 ,Web sites 104 may include one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample Web site 104 a is a collection of Web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. EachWeb site 104 can be maintained by apublisher 109, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns theWeb site 104. - A
resource 105 may be any appropriate data that can be provided overnetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 can include HypterText Mark-up Language (HTML) pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name a few.Resources 105 can also include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - To enable searching of
resources 105,environment 100 can include asearch system 112, as described below, that identifiesresources 105 by crawling andindexing resources 105 provided by the content publishers on theWeb sites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 to which the data corresponds. Indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 that match input keywords can be retrieved and output. - An
example user device 106 a is an electronic device that is under control of a user and that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102. A user device may include one or more processing devices, and may be, or include, a mobile telephone (e.g., a smartphone), a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a network appliance, a camera, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. In some implementations, the user device can be included as part of a motor vehicle (e.g., an automobile, an emergency vehicle (e.g., fire truck, ambulance), a bus). -
User device 106 a can requestresources 105 from aWeb site 104 a. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 a for presentation by theuser device 106 a.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. A request for aresource 105 or asearch query 116 sent from auser device 106 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of the user device. - In response to a
search query 116, thesearch system 112 can access a search index to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. As described below, thesearch system 112 identifiesresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to auser device 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 may include data generated bysearch system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and that includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a Web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the Web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the Web page. -
Content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.Content management system 110 also can updatedatabase 124 based on activity of a user. In this regard, thedatabase 124 can store a profile for the user which includes, for example, information about past user activities, such as visits to a place or event, past requests forresources 105, past search queries 116, other requests for content, social network profiles and connections, Web sites visited, or interactions with content. In some implementations, the information indatabase 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement (“ad”) log, or requests for content. Thedatabase 124 can include, for each entry, a cookie identifying the user, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requestinguser device 106, a type of usage, and details associated with the usage. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106,content management system 110 can receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. For example, the data representing theresource 105 can include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or Web page, in which content can be presented. An example slot is an ad slot. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - Information about slots can be provided to
content management system 110. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. For example, the content management system identifies content, such as advertising, that is associated with keywords that match, or are substantially similar to, the input keywords (e.g., are a variant of the keywords, such as “car” or “cars”). When a match is detected,content management system 110 outputs the corresponding content. The processes described herein may be used to serve customized ads based, e.g., on input keywords or other search query content. - Based at least in part on data included in a request,
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (referred to as “eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can be eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are associated with user-provided keywords (e.g., terms in the input search query). The universe of eligible content items (e.g., ads) can be narrowed by taking into account other factors, such as the content of previous search queries 116. For example, content items corresponding to historical search activities of the user including, e.g., search keywords used, particular content interacted with, sites visited by the user, etc. may also be used in the selection of eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. - In some implementations, the eligibility of content items may be determined by a combination of two or more characteristics. For example, an identified advertisement may include a characteristic that indicates that the ad may have a negative impact upon on the web page in which the ad may be presented (e.g., a fast food ad on a health Web site), in which case the ad may be charged an additional fee by the publisher in order to sufficiently offset the cost of the ad's negative impact. If the ad's price, even once this surcharge is deducted, is sufficient to meet all appropriate other selection criteria, then the ad may be identified as being eligible for presentation.
-
Content management system 110 can select the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of aresource 105 orsearch results page 118 based, at least in part, on results of an auction. For example, for eligible content items,content management system 110 can receive bids from content providers (e.g., advertisers 108) and allocate slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with aresource 105 orsearch results page 118. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM (cost per mille) bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. In this case, the bid will be multiplied by the expected probability of the selection occurring within 1000 impressions. The resulting bid is referred to as an eCPM (or expected CPM) bid. The selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. - In some implementations, a content provider can bid for an identified audience of users. For example, one or more of the
publishers 109 and/or thecontent management system 110 may provide one or more audiences of users, where each user in the audience matches one or more targeting criteria, such as matching one or more demographics. An audience of users may be represented, for example, as a user list. User lists or other representations of audiences may be stored, for example, in adatabase 124. A bid from a content provider can specify, for example, an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item to a particular audience of users. Thecontent management system 110 may, for example, manage the presentation of the content item to users included in a particular audience and may manage charging of the content provider for the impressions and distributing revenue to thepublishers 109 based on the impressions. - In some implementations, TV (Television) broadcasters 134 produce and present television content on TV user devices (not shown), where the TV content may be organized into one or more channels. The TV broadcasters 134 may include, along with the TV content, one or more content slots in which other content (e.g., advertisements) may be presented. For example, a TV network may sell slots of advertising to advertisers in TV programs that they broadcast. Some or all of the content slots may be associated with keywords that relate, e.g., to the television programs in broadcast on a particular channel.

For example, thecontent exchange system 200 can be part of thecontent management system 110. In general, buyers can be offered the ability to decide how much they are willing to pay to show an ad in real time (e.g., “real-time bidding”). Sellers can have an interest in applying different pricing rules to different bidders; for example, some kinds of ads may negatively affect their site's user experience, so a seller may only be willing to show such an ad in exchange for a greater payment. Additionally, sellers may want to try and capture a greater share of their inventory's value by charging high prices for valuable inventory. However, unlike buyers, sellers may generally be constrained to specifying their pricing rules (e.g., how much buyers must pay, at minimum, to show ads of various types in various situations) in advance. As will be discussed below in the descriptions ofFIGS. 2 and 3 , thecontent exchange system 200 can provide sellers with real-time flexibility similar to that offered to buyers. - The
content exchange system 200 identifies acandidate content item 202, such as an advertisement that can be included in a web page, media presentation or other appropriate resource. A collection of content features 204 associated with thecandidate content item 202 is identified by thecontent exchange system 200. - The collection of content features 204 includes information that describes the
candidate content item 202. The collection of content features 204 can include information such as the content item's format (e.g., text, image, video, audio), size, duration, functionality (e.g., the ad is static until clicked or hovered, the ad plays a media clip automatically, the ad is completely static), subject matter (e.g., the type of product, good, or service being advertised), intended customer audience (e.g., demographic information), developer of the content, links associated with the content, or combinations of these and other information that can describe thecandidate content item 202. For example, the content features 204 may indicate that thecandidate content item 202 is an advertisement for a political candidate, is intended for a male audience aged 30-40 years, is formed as a 30×70 pixel multimedia panel, and periodically plays a loop of audiovisual content. - The collection of content features 204 are provided to a
pricing model 206. In some implementations, thepricing model 206 can be part of a system that is external to thecontent exchange system 200. For example, thepricing model 206 can be operated by theWeb site 104 a to estimate the possible negative impact and cost of presenting thecontent item 202 along with theresource 105. - The
pricing model 206 determines a collection ofsurcharge factors 208 that are provided to thecontent exchange system 200. The surcharge factors 208 correspond to effects on the publisher of presenting thecandidate content 202 on a portal, such as a Web site, television program, radio program, or other appropriate host in which advertising content can be included. For example, if presenting content has a negative effect on the publisher's business, the surcharge will be higher to represent the added burden on the publisher. In some implementations, the surcharge factors can be determined based on a type of thecandidate content item 202, subject matter of thecandidate content item 202, functionality of thecandidate content item 202, a developer of thecandidate content item 202, features included in thecandidate content item 202, an industry associated with thecandidate content item 202, whether thecandidate content item 202 is for a competitor of the publisher, and links associated with thecandidate content item 202. In some implementations, the surcharges can be determined using one or more linear classifiers that multiply values corresponding to one or more of the factors by corresponding weights and that process resulting products to produce the surcharges. - A collection of
unadjusted bids 210 for thecandidate content item 202 is obtained from content providers. The collection ofunadjusted bids 210 corresponds to amounts that content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher. For example, theadvertisers 108 may submit competing bids to present thecandidate content item 202 on one or more of theWeb sites 104 or in one or more broadcasts provided by the TV broadcasters 134. - The
unadjusted bids 212 are adjusted in accordance with corresponding ones of the collection ofsurcharge factors 208 to produce the collection of adjustedbids 212. For example, one of theadvertisers 108 may provide an unadjusted bid to place thecandidate content item 202 on one or more of theweb pages 104. Theweb pages 104, however, may include different content or address different audiences, and as a result the content features 204 of thecandidate content item 202 may have a different effect and cost to each of thoseweb pages 104. These different costs can be reflected in thesurcharge factors 208 to determine the adjusted bids 212. - An
auction 214 is performed based on the adjusted bids 212. In theauction 214, the adjustedbids 212 are compared to determine a winner of theauction 214 to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher. In various implementations, the incentive issues in online advertising auctions may differ, and so too may the auction type. For example, in a “first-price auction”, where the advertising space is sold to the highest bidder who pays the amount that they bid, bidders may have an incentive to bid “strategically”, e.g., to lower their bid to just above that of the next highest bidder in order to pay as little as possible. Thus, some online advertising auctions can be “second-price auctions” in which the highest bidder can pay the second-highest bid. Nevertheless, first-price auctions can be tempting to sellers of advertising, since they may capture the difference between the first and second prices in the short run. In examples such as these, it may be important to solve the above problem without giving sellers access to bids directly, or they may use the bids in a way that would induce buyers to bid strategically. - In some implementations, in order to allow the sellers to make incentive-compatible pricing decisions in real time, a system can be implemented in which sellers may not have access to the bids themselves. Instead, the sellers are provided with information about the candidate content item's 202 features, not including bids, and they can use the
pricing model 206 to compute thesurcharge factors 208 for each bid. The surcharge factors 208 are surcharges or bonuses that will be subtracted from or added to each ad's bid before it enters theauction 214. The surcharge factors 208 are applied, whereupon the bids enter theauction 214 and can compete in a second-price-auction. - Once the
auction 214 has identified a winningcontent item 216, the price adjustment factors are applied to the price paid by the winning content item in reverse to compute an actual price 218 (e.g., how much thecandidate content item 202 is charged). - In order to help sellers compute their
pricing model 206, areport 220 is provided. In some implementations, thereport 220 can include information that identifies the ad that won theauction 214 and theactual price 218 paid, but not the bids of non-winning ads back to the seller. - As an example, the following bids may be made:
- Advertisement A: $3.00 CPM (cost per mille)
- Advertisement B: $2.00 CPM
- Advertisement C: $1.00 CPM
- The features of advertisements A, B, and C can be provided to the
pricing model 206, which can return, for example: - A: $1.75 surcharge
- B: $0.50 surcharge
- C: $0.10 bonus
- Adjusted bids for A, B, and C can then be determined, such as:
- Ad A: $1.25 aCPM (adjusted cost per mille)
- Ad B: $1.50 aCPM
- Ad C: $1.10 aCPM
- The
second price auction 214 can then be performed. The result would be advertisement B winning and paying an aCPM of $1.25. Then, advertisement B's surcharge would be re-applied, yielding an actual paid CPM of $1.75. Theauction 214 in such examples can have a number of desirable properties. For example, the bidder may not ever pay more than they bid. Moreover, the auction can still be incentive-compatible. In another example, instead of a normal second price auction, the winner of theauction 214 can be the advertisement the seller most desires to show. As such, the features of real-time bidding can be extended to sellers substantially without encountering incentive-compatibility issues. - In some implementations, rather than call an external system (e.g., the pricing model 206), sellers can specify their pricing model to the
content exchange system 200. Thecontent exchange system 200 can verify the properties of the pricing model ahead of time, and provide bids in implementations in which the incentive-compatibility of the model could be confirmed in advance. - In some implementations, different tools other than surcharges or bonuses can be provided to sellers. For example, sellers can be allowed to set reserve prices, which would be similar to the surcharge/bonus model but would not allow “price inversion” among advertisements (e.g., the advertisement that wins can be the eligible content with the highest initial CPM).
-
FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing an example process 300 for determining the price of content, such as online advertising. Process 300 may be performed, e.g., bycontent management system 110 or thecontent exchange system 200. - At 305, bids are obtained from content providers. The bids correspond to amounts that the content providers will pay to present content on a portal hosted by a publisher. For example, the
content exchange system 200 receives the collection ofunadjusted bids 210 from bidders such as theadvertisers 108. - At 310, surcharges corresponding to an effect on the publisher of presenting content from the content providers on the portal are obtained. For example the
surcharge factors 208 can be obtained from thepricing model 206. In some implementations, surcharges can be different for different content providers, and the effect can be a cost borne by the publisher of presenting a content item from a content provider. In some implementations, the cost can be a monetary effect on a business of the content provider of presenting the content item. For example, an advertisement may have a negative impact upon a web page in which the ad is presented, and the magnitude of the negative impact may be defined in terms of the financial impact (e.g., the surcharge) that the ad has upon the web page or Web site in which it was presented. In another example, an advertisement may have a positive impact upon the Web site that presents the ad, and the positive impact may be described in terms of a monetary value (e.g., a bonus). - In some implementations, the content can be advertising, and the content providers can be advertisers. For example, the content providers can be the
advertisers 108 who provide advertisements that can be managed by thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, the content providers can be Web site providers, the advertising can be an online advertisement, and the surcharges can be based on one or more of the following: whether the ad is expandable, subject matter of the ad, whether the ad includes pixel tags, an ad agency that developed the ad, whether the ad contains audio, whether the ad contains video, whether video contained in the ad starts when a page is loaded or requires interaction before starting, an industry that the ad represents, whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher, and whether the ad clicks-through to a Web page that meets one or more predefined criteria regarding Web page quality. For example, the publisher of a high-quality web page may charge a surcharge for presenting an ad that links the user to a page of relatively lower quality. - In some implementations, the surcharges can be obtained from the publisher, and each surcharge can correspond to a content item from a content provider. At least one of the surcharges can be based on an adjusted bid of a winner of a prior auction. For example, the
actual price 218 can be provided to thepricing model 206 as part of thereports 220. - In some implementations, the surcharges can be based on one or more of the following factors: a type of the content, subject matter of the content, functionality of the content, a developer of the content, features included in the content, an industry associated with the content, whether the content is for a competitor of the publisher, and links associated with the content. For example, the operator of a yoga Web site may charge a surcharge for presenting an advertisement that includes sound or flashy animation. In another example, the operator of an airline Web site may charge a surcharge for displaying an advertisement for a bus line (e.g., a competitor).
- In some implementations, each of the surcharges can be determined using a linear classifier that multiplies values corresponding to one or more of the factors by corresponding weights and that processes resulting products to produce a surcharge. For example, the operator of a Web site may establish a pricing model (e.g., the pricing model 206) in which multimedia advertisements (e.g., as opposed to text ads) and advertisements for competitors are both to be charged a surcharge for their negative effects upon the Web site. Furthermore, the pricing model may reflect the Web site operator's philosophy that competitor's advertisements have a greater negative impact than do multimedia ads. As such, the surcharge associated with an advertisement belonging to a competitor may be given a relative greater mathematical weight than the weight given for the use of multimedia. The linear classifier can multiply the surcharges for the individual features of the ad by their respective weights to determine the total surcharge to be associated with the advertisement.
- At 315, the bids are adjusted in accordance with corresponding surcharges to thereby produce adjusted bids. For example, the
surcharge factors 208 and theunadjusted bids 210 are compared to provide the collection of adjustedbids 212. - If at 320 there are additional bids remaining, then the additional bids are obtained at 305. If there are no additional bids at 320, then at 325 the adjusted bids are compared to determine a winner of an auction to present content on the portal hosted by the publisher. For example, the
auction 214 determines the winningcontent 216 that will be provided for inclusion in one of theweb pages 104 or programs provided by the TV broadcasters 134. - At 330, a price for the winner to pay is determined based on the surcharge. In implementations in which a first price auction is used to determine the price, at 332 determining the price comprises adding, to an adjusted bid of the winner, a surcharge corresponding to the adjusted bid of the winner to produce the price.
- In implementations in which a second price auction is used to determine the price, at 334 an adjusted bid of a content provider who placed second in the auction behind the winner is obtained, and a surcharge corresponding to the adjusted bid of the winner to produce the price is added to the adjusted bid of the content provider who placed second in the auction.
- At 340, the winner is charged the price for presenting content on the portal. For example, the winner can be charged the
actual price 218. - In some implementations, the content providers can be television providers, the advertising can be a television advertisement, and the surcharges can be based on one or more of the following: subject matter of the ad, an industry that the ad represents, and whether the ad is for a competitor of the publisher. For example, the advertising can be a commercial placed in the programming broadcast by one or more of the TV broadcasters 134.
