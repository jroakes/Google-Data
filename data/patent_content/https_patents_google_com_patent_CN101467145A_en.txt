General introduction
Most of picture search and searching system all are text-driven, and wherein user entered keyword is as inquiry, and computer system (perhaps more specifically, search engine) is handled this inquiry by the search text relevant with image in image data base.Search engine returns associated " relevant " image of text message that is complementary with key word.In such scheme, can't retrieve not by the image of note, even this picture material is related with the key word height.Therefore, search and the search operaqtion that provides relevant textual information can promote image for annotating images not.
An embodiment of the invention provide a kind of technology, and it produces the text related with image by utilizing web to go up available cyclopean image storehouse, comes automatically annotating images with this.More specifically, an embodiment of the invention are extracted characteristics of image from given image, and searching image comprises the image set of similar image feature with sign on the internet then.Then, obtain these images text on every side.This technology identifies subsequently in order to the common keywords in the text that obtains of this given image of note.Notice that this technology does not need manual intervention, and utilize many existing image processing techniquess to carry out such as image characteristics extraction with in the sensible step of web subscript like image.
Automatic annotation procedure
Fig. 1 has provided the process flow diagram of describing according to the process that is used for automatically annotating images of one embodiment of the present invention.
This process starts from receiving image and request (step 100) about the relevant textual information of this image is provided.Note, can format and memory image, include, but are not limited to: JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PDF, PS, EMF, MNG, PNG, PSD, SWF and WMF by digital format arbitrarily.In addition, also can from the frozen frozen mass of digital video, obtain image.For example, we can extract image in the single frame from the MPEG video, and this image of note subsequently.
Then, this process becomes the sheet (step 102) of specific size with image segmentation, and extracts characteristics of image (step 104) subsequently from each sheet.Notice that the typical image feature that can be extracted out can include but not limited to: shape, color and texture from these sheets.For example, can extract the shades of colour feature of giving stator in the image, include but not limited to: color histogram; Color histogram layout and color moment.In addition, can use multiple image processing techniques to extract specific image features, these image processing techniquess can include but not limited to: discrete cosine transform (DCT) technology, principal component analysis (PCA) technology and Jia Bai wavelet technique.In an embodiment of the invention, characteristics of image can also comprise direction histogram.
It shall yet further be noted that the present invention is not limited to the feature that is associated with sheet.The present invention can also be widely used in the characteristics of image of any type, and is not limited to the feature that is associated with sheet.For example, the present invention can use together with not related with sheet borderline phase characteristics of image, such as the attribute of the color histogram of entire image.
Characteristics of image that this process then will be extracted and the known-image-features in the characteristics of image storehouse are mated (step 106).In an embodiment of the invention, use similar image extractive technique has been obtained the known-image-features in the characteristics of image storehouse in advance.For example, if in step 104, use the DCT technology to extract characteristics of image, then can utilize the DCT coefficient to represent known-image-features.In an embodiment of the invention, the characteristics of image that extracted and known-image-features are mated comprise: the characteristics of image of each extraction and the nearest known-image-features in the storehouse are mated.
Then, this process is in conjunction with the known-image-features of coupling, to form the feature combinations (step 108) of image.More specifically, this process is the set that is divided into the image generation feature combinations of specific tile sizes.
In an embodiment of the invention, for different sheet sizes, repeating step 102 to 108 iteratively, and wherein the sheet magnitude range can only comprise some pixels from every and changes to single that comprises entire image.Especially, for each sheet size, this processing becomes the sheet of this sheet size with image segmentation, and extracts characteristics of image then from respective flap.This process is then mated characteristics of image and the known-image-features extracted, and then utilizes known-image-features to produce the set of the feature combinations of image.Therefore, the feature combinations of step 108 generation comprises the feature combinations that obtains at different images sheet size.Note, use different sheet sizes to help on multiple dimensioned, catching characteristics of image.Substitute with known-image-features and mate, the value that this system can limit characteristics of image alternatively falls into the discrete value finite aggregate.
This process then identifies a plurality of other images (step 110) with similar image feature and/or feature combinations.Especially, this process is searched for great amount of images from various sources.These image sources can include but not limited to: be stored in the image in the image data base of having organized; Be embedded into the image in the webpage on the internet; With the relevant image of video on the internet, perhaps be linked to the arbitrary image of the network address on the internet.Note, the image on the internet and the difference between the image in the organized image databases be: the image on the internet is not classified usually and is independent of each other usually.
Determine that the similar image feature whether specific image comprises original image comprises: handle specific image according to the mode identical, to produce the characteristics of image of specific image with original image.
When the characteristics of image in the original image and/or feature combinations and other image are compared, can use various probability models.For example, these probability models can comprise any technology that is characterized as the complexity " polynary distribution technique " of polynary normal distribution from any simple computation technology of the number that calculates similar or same characteristic features to supposition when comparing two images.(discussion about polynary normal distribution sees also
Http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_gaussian_distribution)
After a plurality of similar images of sign, this process is obtained the text (step 112) around these images.In an embodiment of the invention, obtain text around the image tag from the html file that is included in this image links.In another embodiment, obtain the text of real image in the direct encirclement webpage.It is contemplated that, the text that obtains around the given image in webpage is very possible relevant with the content of this image.As a result, step 112 is used from the key word of the text around each the institute's identification image candidate key as the note original image.Notice that some in these candidate keys may be also uncorrelated with the content of original image.
This process is then expanded (step 114) by the synonym that increases this set of keyword to each institute's associated set of keywords of identification image.In an embodiment of the invention, use intelligent thesaurus tools to increase synonym for each key word in the set.For example, key word " sea " and " ocean " may appear at two respectively in the sets of keywords for two of identification image.Behind etendue critical word in this manner, two images all will be associated with this both keyword.
Then, this process is carried out between the set of keywords of identification image relatively at these, to identify crossing key word (step 116).Notice that the synonym that increases key word has improved and identifies the possibility that these intersect.
At last, this process obtains a plurality of crossing key words between the identification image, and utilizes these crossing key word note original images (step 118).Note, can be by improving the correlativity that intersects key word and original image at the more images of step 110 sign.Because the internet is extremely huge image data base, the searched and inspection along with increasing image, finding more, the possibility of matching image increases thereupon.In addition, the crossing key word that obtains from more images becomes more accurate equally.
