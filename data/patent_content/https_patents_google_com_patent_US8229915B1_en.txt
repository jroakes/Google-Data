- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online advertising system 100 .
- one or more advertisers 105 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement information in an advertising management system 110 .
- the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the advertisements can also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 115 can submit requests for advertisements to the system 110 .
- the system 110 responds by sending advertisements to the requesting publisher 115 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content). Though reference is made to advertisements, other forms of content can be served by the system 110 .
- Other entities such as users 120 and the advertisers 105 , can provide usage or interaction information to the system 110 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or click-through related to an advertisement has occurred.
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on an advertisement.
- the click-through rate can be a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the advertisement or a link associated with the advertisement by the number of times the advertisement was delivered. For example, if an advertisement is delivered 100 times, and three persons clicked on the advertisement, then the click-through rate for that advertisement is 3%.
- a “conversion” occurs when a user, for example, consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served.
- the usage information can also include usage information that relates to how many clicks have occurred at particular locations historically on a page.
- the system 110 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 115 and charging the advertisers 105 based on the usage information.
- An example of such a system is AdWordsTM offered by Google, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.).
- CPC Cost-Per-Click
- CPC Cost-Per-Click
- a computer network 125 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 105 , the system 110 , the publishers 115 , and the users 120 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 105 , the system 110 , the publishers 115 , and the users 120 .
- a publisher 115 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for advertisements to an advertisement server in the system 110 .
- the advertisement request can include a number of advertisements desired.
- the advertisement request can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 110 .
- This combined content and advertisements can be sent to the user that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- a search service can receive queries for search results. In response, the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- An exemplary search service is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999.
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for advertisements to the system 110 .
- the request can include a number of advertisements desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc. In some implementations, the number of desired advertisements will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for advertisements can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 110 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the search service can transmit information about the advertisement and when, where, and/or how the advertisement was to be rendered back to the system 110 .
- the advertising management system 110 can serve publishers 115 , such as content servers and search services.
- the advertising management system 110 permits serving of advertisements targeted to documents served by content servers.
- a network or inter-network can include an advertisement server serving targeted advertisements in response to requests from a search service with advertisement spots for sale.
- the search service can crawl much or all of the content.
- advertisement spots also referred to as “inventory” available.
- one or more content servers can include one or more documents.
- Documents can include web pages, email, content, embedded information (e.g., embedded media), meta-information and machine executable instructions, and advertisement spots available.
- the advertisements inserted into advertisement spots in a document can vary each time the document is served or, alternatively, can have a static association with a given document.
- the advertising management system 110 can render one or more advertisements on a content page.
- the advertisement can, for example, be rendered in one or more location slots and blocks on the content page.
- the advertisements can be rendered according to one or more performance metrics associated with the advertisements as well as interaction rates associated with the location slots and blocks.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example content item placement system 200 .
- the content item placement system 200 can, for example, be implemented in a computer device or one or more computer devices connected through a network, e.g., a LAN or a WAN, such as the Internet.
- the content item placement system 200 can, for example be implemented in the advertising system manager 110 , which can be implemented in a computing system.
- the one or more computing devices can, for example, include memory devices storing processing instructions and processing devices for executing the processing instructions.
- An example computing system is shown and described with reference to FIG. 8 . Other implementations, however, can also be used.
- the content item placement system 200 can include a content item location engine 205 , content item engine 210 , and a content item rendering engine 215 .
- the content item location engine 205 , content item engine 210 , and content item rendering engine 215 can, for example, be distributed among a plurality of computer devices, e.g. server computers communicating over a network, or can be implemented on a single computer, e.g., as multiple threads on a server computer. Other implementation architectures can also be used.
- the content item location engine 205 , content item engine 210 , and content item rendering engine 215 can, for example, be implemented in software, such as executable object code, interpreted script instructions, or in combinations of executable and interpreted instructions. Other software and/or hardware implementations can also be used.
- an example publisher 115 in an example implementation of an online advertising system 100 is a search service.
- a search service can receive a search query from a user for search results.
- the search service can submit the search query to the advertising management system 110 that can be used to identify potentially relevant content items, e.g., advertisements, from a content items database 220 .
- a relevant content item from the content items database 220 can be one of a variety of different content item types, e.g., advertisements, video, audio, text, news feeds, digital print, images, etc., that is determined to be relevant to one or more keywords in a search query.
- an example publisher 115 in an example implementation of an online advertising system 100 is a general content server.
- a general content server can receive a request for content items, e.g., advertisements, articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, related topics, etc., from the content items database 220 and retrieve the requested content in response to the request.
- content items e.g., advertisements, articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, related topics, etc.
- FIG. 3 is an example user interface for a content page 300 that can display the relevant content items from the content items database 220 to a user 120 .
- the content page 300 can include multiple locations 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 , e.g. content item location blocks, to display one or more identified content items to a user.
- Each location block can contain one or more location slots.
- location block 306 includes four location slots 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 .
- the content item location blocks 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 can be arranged in any order on the content page 300 .
- the location blocks 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 can be of different sizes, shapes, and can be located at different page locations.
- the location blocks 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 can, for example, be arranged into a single block of slots, several blocks containing multiple slots, or as one individual block per slot.
- the content item engine 210 can determine content item rankings for a plurality of content items.
- the plurality of content items can be stored in the content items database 220 and can include advertisements, articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, related topics, etc.
- the content items database 220 can store one or more performance metrics associated with each content item.
- the content items database 220 can, for example, store performance metrics such as the click-through rate or conversion rate associated with each content item.
- the content item engine 210 can determine content item rankings by determining a performance value based on one or more performance metrics for each of the content items. For example, the content item engine 210 can determine a performance value by using only the click-through rates associated with each advertisement. The content item engine 210 can then rank the content items based on the performance values.
- the performance values of the four advertisements Ad 1 , Ad 2 , Ad 3 , and Ad 4 therefore are 0.08, 0.06, 0.02, and 0.01 respectively.
- the content item engine 210 can rank the advertisements in decreasing order of performance value. Therefore, Ad 1 would be ranked first, followed by Ad 2 ranked second, Ad 3 ranked third, and Ad 4 ranked fourth.
- the content items can be ranked using other formulas and other performance metrics, such as the cost-per-click associated with each advertisement, or any combination of performance metrics.
- the content item location engine 205 can determine location rankings of a plurality of content item location slots, 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 on the content page 300 .
- the content item location slots, 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 can be stored in the content items database 220 and can include positions on the content page 300 to display one or more identified content items to a user.
- the content item location engine 205 can determine the location rankings of the content item location slots, 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 by ranking the plurality of content item location slots, 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 based on content item location data.
- the content item location data can, for example, include one or more interaction rates associated with the content item location slots.
- an interaction rate associated with the content item location slots and stored in the content items database 220 can include one or more click-through rates associated with each location slot.
- the one or more click-through rates can, for example, include actual click-through rates or predicted click-through rates.
- the actual_ctr is the average click-through rate of all content items in a particular location
- the quality_ctr is the average predicted click-through rate for all the content items in a particular location.
- the actual_ctr as described above is the number of clicks on all content item in the particular location divided by the number of times the content items were displayed in the particular location.
- content item location slot 312 can have an actual click-through rate of ten percent (10%) for advertisements displayed in the content item location slot 312 .
- the actual click-through rates of content item location slot 312 can indicate that a user clicks on advertisements displayed to the user in the content item location slot 312 ten percent (10%) of the time.
- the following actual click-through rates can, for example, be associated with the content item location slots in location block 306 on a content page 300 : ten percent (10%) for content item location slot 312 ; five percent (5%) for content item location slot 314 ; one and a half percent (1.5%) for content item location slot 316 ; and one percent (1%) for content item location slot 318 . Therefore, a user may be more likely to click on a content item in content item location slot 312 , based on the higher click-through rate associated with the content item location slot 312 .
- the actual click-through rates for the slots can, for example, be based on users' historical click-through data and can be stored in the user accounts database 205 .
- the quality_ctr can be calculated using a machine learning algorithm that continually predicts click-through rates, i.e., predicted click-through rates, of content items based on quality and historical data associated with the content items. These click-through rate predictions can be independent of the slot in which the content item is to be displayed.
- the predicted click-through rate is an average over all slots in which the content item could be displayed. In another implementation, the predicted click-through rate would be the expected click-through rate if the content item is to be displayed in the top slot.
- the location_multiplier can then be determined by comparing the average actual click-through rate of content items displayed in the slot with the average slot-independent predicted click-through rate of content items in the slot. For example, suppose the average predicted click-through rates for the content items shown in the location slots are: four percent (4%) for content items displayed in location slot 312 ; three percent (3%) for content items displayed in location slot 314 ; two percent (2%) for content items displayed in location slot 316 ; and one percent (1%) for content items displayed in location slot 318 .
- the click-through rates estimate is corrected by dividing out the component related to the quality, the “raw quality click-through rates” of the content item.
- the location_multiplier is the measure of the location performance used to determine which slot or location is the best, i.e., where the content item in the slot would be clicked on the most.
- the slots can then be ranked in order of decreasing location performance. Therefore, in the example above, the content item locations slots, 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 can be ranked as follows:
- the location multipliers can be calculated by evaluating all of the CTRs for each (ad, slot) pair, and this data can be used to separate out the ad-specific and slot-specific contributions to each CTR. For example, if for two ads and two slots, the following CTRs exist:
- the system 200 can directly deduce that ad 1 has an average CTR of 10%, ad 2 of 5%, and that slot 1 has a location_multiplier of 2.0, and slot 2 of 0.5.
- each location block 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 can include a location_multiplier.
- each of the three blocks 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 can, for example, be associated with a different actual click-through rate. Therefore, each of the location blocks 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 can be associated with a multiplier.
- the location slots within a location block can be associated with a multiplier that can be computed by multiplying the multiplier of the block with the slot.
- the multiplier for each of the location slots 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 can be calculated by multiplying “1.2” by “2.5,” “1.67,” “0.75,” and “1” respectively.
- the actual click-through rates associated with the content item location blocks 302 , 306 , 308 , 310 and the slots 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 can be based on historical data associated with one or more users and one or more content items located at one time in the location blocks and location slots.
- the content items database 220 can store historical data associated with all users who have interacted with the content page 300 as well as other content pages, and can include the total number of clicks and impressions for all the users and the content items associated with the clicks and impressions associated with the content items.
- the total number of clicks and impressions can be associated with different content item types and different content item locations based on the users' historical data.
- the total number of past clicks and total number of past impressions can be retrieved from the content items database 220 that are associated with the top slot in content item location block 306 .
- the location data can be based on eye movement tracking studies. Therefore, the content item location engine 205 can determine the location_multiplier based on the eye movement tracking studies. For example, if the format of the content page 310 is known in advance, the eye movement tracking studies can be used to determine which portions of the content page 310 the eye is most frequency drawn. The location can then be ranked in order of decreasing location performance.
- the location data can be based on mouse movement tracking, e.g. if users hover their mouse over a particular location on the page, a slot placed there would have high performance.
- the content item rendering engine 215 can associate one of the plurality of content items with one of the plurality of content item locations, e.g., content item location slots 312 , 314 , 316 , 318 based upon the location rankings and content item rankings.
- the content item rendering engine 215 can, for example, assign a content item having the highest content item ranking to a content item location having the highest location ranking.
- the content item rendering engine 215 can match each content item with the content item location slots that have the same rank in the location rankings. For example, as described above, Ad 1 was ranked first, Ad 2 second, Ad 3 third, and Ad 4 fourth. The content item ranked first, Ad 1 , would be placed in the location that has the first position, content item location slot 312 .
- the content item ranked second, Ad 2 would be placed in the location that has the second position, content item location slot 314 .
- the content item ranked third, Ad 3 would be placed in the location that has the third position, content item location slot 318 .
- the content item ranked fourth, Ad 4 would be placed in the location that has the fourth position, content item location slot 316 .
- the content item rendering engine 215 can render the plurality of content items in the associated content item location on a content page.
- the content item rendering engine 215 can render the identified content items in the content page 310 based on the determined placement. For example, the content rendering engine 215 can render Ad 1 in content to item location slot 312 , Ad 2 in content item location slot 314 , Ad 4 in content item location slot 316 , and Ad 3 in content item location slot 318 .
- the format of the content item can be changed dynamically to fit the location slot.
- the content rendering engine 215 can render a thumbnail version of a large image ad to fit into a small location slot.
- the content rendering engine 210 can render the identified content items in the content page 310 along with other content.
- a publisher 115 can be a content server that can combine identified content items with one or more of the advertisements provided by an advertisement system 110 .
- the combined content items and advertisements can be sent to the user that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can, for example, transmit information including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML, CSS, JavaScriptTM, etc.).
- the content rendering engine 215 can assign the content item having the highest content item ranking to the content item location having the highest location ranking until each of the content items are associated with a content item location. In another implementation, the content rendering engine 215 can assign the content item having the highest content item ranking to the content item location having the highest location ranking until each of the content item locations is associated with a content item. Therefore, not all the locations would need to be filled. If there are more content items than locations, then only the top content items are rendered in the location slots. If there are more location slots than content items, some of the location slots depending on how they rank, can be empty and not include a content item.
- a server such as the content server, can render the identified content items in a content page 300 by serving code, e.g., HTML, CSS, etc., to a browser.
- code e.g., HTML, CSS, etc.
- the content server can alter the code to move a content item location block, e.g. 302 , 306 , 308 , or 310 , on a content page 300 .
- the code for the content item location block can, for example, be inserted at a dynamically determined position within the code to change its location on the content page.
- the same dynamic methods could be used to place the content items within each slot, in addition to position the blocks/slots on the page as described above.
- the properties of the HTML “ ⁇ div>” tag that is served to the content page can be altered so the browser displaying the content page will position the content item location in the determined placement.
- the properties of the CSS code that is served to the content page can be altered so the browser displaying the content page will position the content item location in the determined placement.
- the HTML and CSS code can be altered by using a server-side scripting language, e.g., Python or PHP, or a templating language.
- the content server can directly generate the appropriately formatted HTML and/or CSS code.
- the content item location can be dynamically rendered into an image that contains the content for the content page.
- a client-side implementation can be used to render the identified content items in a content page based on the determined placement.
- the content item location can be dynamically positioned/repositioned on the content page by utilizing a web scripting language that runs in the browser, e.g. Javascript.
- the content item location can be dynamically repositioned on the content page by utilizing other scripting languages or browser display technology, such as Flash, Adobe PDF, SVG, Java, or VRML.
- the code can position/reposition the content item location once at the load time of the content page.
- the code can dynamically reposition the content item location block in response to real-time changes made to the content of the content page by other code, e.g. a new email being received in a web-based email client.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for placing a content item.

Abstract
Description
Performance value=click-through rate*2
Location_multiplier(location)=actual— ctr(location)/quality— ctr(location)
actual— ctr(location)=number of clicks from content items in the location/number of content item impressions in the location
quality— ctr(location)=sum of predicted click-through rates for content items shown in the location/number of content item impressions in the location
location_multiplier(312)=10%/4%=2.5
location_multiplier(314)=5%/3%=1.67
location_multiplier(316)=1.5%/2%=0.75
location_multiplier(318)=1%/1%=1
