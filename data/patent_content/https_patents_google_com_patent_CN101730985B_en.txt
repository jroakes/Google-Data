Detailed description of the invention
In being such as proposed to be used in the AS of system of 3GPPLTE, subframe includes the control channel element (CCE) of many fixing scales, each control channel element is made up of certain number of resource element (such as, 36 resource elements). It should be noted that, transmitting signal in each time slot (slot) is described by the resource grid of Nrb �� Nsc subcarrier that (Nrb is the number of Resource Block in subframe and depends on that carrier bandwidths is (such as, 25 for 5MHzLTE carrier wave) and Nsc be the number of sub carrier wave (such as, 12) in Resource Block). It is referred to as resource element and by the index in time slot to (d about each element in the resource grid of given antenna port p, b) unique identification is (such as, subframe exists the time slot of two 0.5ms), wherein d and b is the index in frequency domain and time domain respectively. Each resource element d, b on antenna port p corresponds to complex value modulated symbol. The modulated symbol of the resource element of the transmission corresponding to being not used for physical channel or physical signalling in time slot should be set to zero. Layer 1/ layer 2 (L1/L2) controls channel (up-link or downlink mandate) and is made up of 1,2,3,4 or 8 CCE. Depend on the data (n of the CCE supported in the control area of subframeCCEs), form control channel (CCH) candidate collection of some. Such as, for nCCE, there are 27 kinds of CCH and be likely in the set (that is, having 13 to control channel element in subframe) of=13, (that is, CCH candidate collection has scale NCCH=27) HCCH�� 2 �� nCCE. (it should be noted that, Ncch is also known as nCCE, it is the sum of the CCE supported in the control area of subframe. )
When UE checks CCH candidate collection to obtain control information (if existence), its which control channel not known about in CCH candidate collection is used. Therefore all control channel elements are performed blind Detecting (BD) by UE. The motility that this blind Detecting provides has the advantage that, namely by allowing each mandate scale to be suitable for making this mandate by the necessary number of resources of reliable reception, and not always use worst condition mandate scale (8 CCE), reduce and control required channel resource total amount for L1/L2. Such as, for extraordinary channel quality, it is possible to UE, the high confidence level reliably receiving control signal is used single CCE, and for excessively poor signal quality, such as subscriber equipment is positioned at the situation of cell edge, it is possible to use substantial amounts of CCE. Therefore, blind Detecting allows base station to be dynamically selected control channel scale, thus without using substantial amounts of CCE always. But, blind Detecting requires the very high complexity in subscriber equipment. When performing blind Detecting, UE is trial detection control message when hypothesis CCH-i is used, i=0, and 1 ..., NCCH-1. If effectively controlling message (such as, CRC passes through) although obtaining, then UE is likely to stop, but for given control message format, UE needs the maximum number of the blind Detecting performed to be NCCH. Being different owing to controlling the form of the upper up-link sent of channel (DPCCH) and downlink scheduling mandate at L1/L2, therefore UE needs to be similar to and performs 2 �� N altogetherCCH=4 �� nCCE time blind Detecting is to adapt to both DL and UL.
When E-UTRA carrier bandwidths be 5MHz and 3 OFDM symbol (" n "=3) for control area, it is possible to there are 18 CCE, cause both DL and UL are attempted more than 54 blind Detecting. For carrier frequency be 20MHz and 3 OFDM symbol for controlling channel in the case of, it is possible to there are 44 CCE, it means that attempt controlling channel adapting to DL and UL more than 176 blind Detecting.
The inventors discovered that the number of times of blind Detecting is limited to that less than 50, and be more preferably less than 40, to improve UE performance. Substantial amounts of blind Detecting is less desirable, this is because: complete excessive hardware complexity is produced for all blind Detecting of OFDM symbol; Which increase the probability of false detection of given CRC size limit (such as, 16 bit-scale restriction); And it negatively affects the power consumption in UE. Specifically, it should be noted that UE expectation is found and controlled channel, subsequently enters micro-dormancy until next subframe starts. In this case, major part UE processs involves L1/L2 and controls channel-decoding, and limits blind Detecting and can produce greatly improving of power management performance.
In order to improve equipment performance, the number of CCH candidate is limited, thus reduce the average time attempted for the blind decoding reliably detected needed for being intended to for the control channel of this equipment. According to an aspect of the present invention, by the device identifier of subscriber equipment being mapped to about at least one search volume controlling channel element, the number of candidate is limited. According to a further aspect in the invention, the search volume for special user equipment is identified based in part on control signal.

With reference now to Fig. 1, the wireless communication system 100 including multiple cell serves elementary cells forms distribution network over a geographical. This elementary cell may be additionally referred to as access point, accesses terminal, node B or similar terms as known in the art. One or more elementary cells 101 and 102 serve many remote units 103 and 110 in coverage or community or its sector. This remote unit may be additionally referred to as subscri er unit, mobile unit, user, terminal, subscriber station, subscriber equipment (UE), user terminal or other terms as known in the art. Network base units and remote unit communication use available radio resource to receive to perform such as dispatch terminal or launch the function of data. This wireless network also includes management function, and it includes data route, access control, subscriber's charging, terminal authentication etc., and this management function can be controlled by those of ordinary skill in the art's other network entities known.
Elementary cell 101 and 102 at least part of same asset (time being divided and/or frequency) to the remote unit transmission downlink communication signal 104 and 105 serviced. Remote unit 103 communicates with one or more elementary cells 101 and 102 with 113 via uplink communication signal 106 with 110. These one or more elementary cells can include one or more transmitters 117 and the one or more receiver 118 of serving this remote unit. The number of the transmitter 117 at elementary cell place can with such as, and the number of the transmitting antenna 109 at elementary cell place is correlated with. Using multiple antenna serves in each sector to provide multiple advanced communication modes, for instance, when adaptive beamforming, transmitting diversity, transmitting SDMA and multiple stream transmission etc., it is possible to dispose multiple elementary cell. That these elementary cells in sector can be a highly integrated and various hardware and software parts can be shared. Such as, all elementary cells being jointly placed together to serve community may be constructed the unit being conventionally referred to as base station. Remote unit can also include one or more transmitter 107 and one or more receiver 108. At remote unit place, the number of transmitter can with such as, and the number of transmitting antenna 125 is correlated with. Such as, remote unit can have 1,2,3,4 or more antenna. Remote unit 103,110 operates under the control of controller 116. Controller 116 controls the operation of this remote unit, including processing user's input, the transmission of signal and reception, scheduling, coding, formatting etc.
In one embodiment, communication system utilizes OFDMA or for the next generation of ul transmissions based on the FDMA framework of single carrier, the FDMA (IFDMA) that such as interweaves, localization FDMA (LFDMA), has the DFT-spread spectrum OFDM (DFT-SOFDM) of IFDMA or LFDMA. In other embodiments, this framework can also include using spread spectrum, such as direct sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA), CDMA multiple carrier (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA), the orthogonal frequency with one-dimensional or two-dimensional spread-spectrum and code division multiplexing (OFCDM) or better simply time-division and frequency division multiplexing/multiple access technology.
Generally, the wireless communication network infrastructure scheduling entity being arranged in each elementary cell 101 and 102 place of such as Fig. 1 is distributed to the remote unit in network or assignment radio resource. Elementary cell all includes the scheduler 120 for dispatching and to the remote unit Resources allocation in corresponding with service region or community or sector. Such as based in the Multiple Access scheme of the evolution scheme of the Long Term Evolution scheme (being also known as evolution UTRA/UTRAN (EUTRA/EUTRAN)) of the UTRA/UTRAN research project in OFDM method and 3GPP or 3GPPLTE etc, it is possible to use frequency selects (FS) scheduler to perform scheduling in time and frequency dimension. In certain embodiments, each remote unit can provide frequency band channel quality indicator (CQI) or other tolerance to realize scheduling to scheduler.
In the system of ofdm system or the similar OFDM of such as DFT-SOFDM and IFDMA, resource distribution is arrived by the information MAP about the particular base unit frequency of sub-carrier resources of available subcarrier set that scheduler freely determines and time distribution. This distribution can be depended on such as, and frequency selective channel quality indicates (CQI) or reported to some other tolerance of scheduler by remote unit. Can being different for the different piece of sub-carrier resources, channel code speed and modulation scheme, this channel code speed and modulation scheme be also determined by scheduler and can also depend on CQI or other tolerance reported. In code division multiplexed networks, resource distribution is that arrived by the information MAP about the particular base unit code division of sub-carrier resources of available subcarrier set that scheduler freely determines is joined.
Fig. 2 illustrates the subframe 200 of the part constituting radio frame. Radio frame generally includes multiple subframe, and the plurality of subframe can form the entity in succession of subframe. Each frame corresponds to Transmission Time Interval (TTI). Example T TI is 1ms. If single TTI has the length of 1ms, then this TTI can be divided into two subframes being respectively provided with 0.5ms length. But this structure imply need the multiple Resource Block of addressing, namely more than the number of the Resource Block in single 0.5ms subframe, unless Resource Block (RB) definition be extended to automatically be defined as by RB in the whole length of TTI extend and unrelated with TTI duration. But, this poor efficiency that may result in there is the form of the capacity of too much each RB. When RB is defined as extension in a part for TTI length, it is possible to addressing constitutes each Resource Block in multiple subframes of TTI independently. It is thus desirable to such mechanism, namely at frame or TTI by signal resource assignments subframe forms in succession. In addition, it is desirable to can based on the mechanism needing assigned resources of independent UE, wherein less resource is assigned to the UE of smaller packet service, and more resource is assigned to by the UE of bigger packet service. When UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), TTI is defined as launching the time span of transmission or transmission block. Transmission block or transmission block are made up of by the data block of common code what single CRC protected. In this example, the alternative definition of TTI can be the length of the transmission of the single instance control controlling channel signaling.
As illustrated in Figure 2, subframe includes frequency subband (longitudinal axis) and time slot (timeslot) (trunnion axis), and the number of subband depends on the bandwidth of channel. Such as, in 3GPPLTE, the communication link between remote unit and elementary cell can have the carrier bandwidths of 1.25MHz, 2.5MHz, 5MHz, 10MHz or 20MHz, and each frequency bandwidth has the subband of the greater number proportional to its scale. Frame may include that such as 14 time slots, and in these time slots, 1,2 or 3 time slots can be assigned to the control area 210 of frame or control channel strip, and remaining 11,12 or 13 time slots can be used for dispatching the data area 220 of data. Illustrative sub-frame is organized as multiple Resource Block (RB) alternatively, illustrated example has illustrated 6 Resource Block RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4, RB5, RB6, each Resource Block includes the subcarrier of 12 vicinities or the group of subband, and it can be used for 1.25MHz carrier bandwidths. Although describing number above for example purposes, but actual number used herein is for descriptive purposes, person of skill in the art will appreciate that, without deviating from the invention, the number of frequency band, subband, time slot, channel control element etc. can be different. Control area is for dispatching the radio resource (RS) for the transmission of UL and DL data.
In frame, depending on the number distributing to the OFDM symbol controlling channel, composite control channel part 210 includes 1,2 or 3 time slots. Illustrated subframe has 3 OFDM symbol. But, 1 or 2 code element can be assigned to control channel. In controlling channel strip, each time slot and subband constitute control channel element (CCE), and thus each CCE includes multiple resource element.
Control channel and include one or more CCE. As mentioned above, each CCE is shown by frame table and is defined by time slot and subband. Therefore, in RB6, it is possible to the time slot 1 in the time slot 1 in subcarrier 5 and in subcarrier 11 finds the CCE about t1. If controlling channel to include two CCE, then the two CCE will together make up the control channel about t1.
If by more than one CCE polymerization to constitute control channel, then form the CCE of this control channel and can be continuous print (the identical time slot adjacent from subband) or be dispersed throughout control channel strip (different subband in control area 210, subcarrier and/or different code elements) discontinuously. Fig. 2 illustrates, and composite control channel includes multiple control channel element. This control channel element all includes code word, and this code word provides the logical control channel physical mappings to the such as sequence of symhols of QAM code element. Control channel element and be frequently not identical type. In fig. 2, for instance, control channel element 212 and 218 and there is different scales. In a preferred embodiment, control channel element and there is the identical scale about given carrier bandwidths. Control channel element and can be additionally used in up-link or downlink allocation, and there is different related information payload. Therefore special user equipment must position the control channel element for this special user equipment, and is polymerized the position in the time to dispatch its data for up-link and downlink identification and frequency. Control channel element and can also issue association from different specifications. In certain embodiments, composite control channel includes reference symbol, for instance, pilot frequency code element, it is away from controlling channel element. This reference symbol is typically read by all remote units.
In one embodiment, each control channel element only comprises radio resource assignment information, for instance, code word, it is addressed to single wireless communication entity exclusively, for instance, one of remote unit 103,110 in Fig. 1. Except other remote unit specific information, radio resource assignment information includes T/F radio resource assignment. In other embodiments, radio resource assignment information can include modulation, code check, chunk scale, antenna mode indicator and other information extraly.
In one embodiment, wireless communication network infrastructure entity, for instance, scheduler 120, it is possible to more than one is controlled channel element and is addressed to identical wireless communication entities, for instance, one of remote unit 103 or 110 in Fig. 1. More specifically, control channel and can include the first version of code word and the second edition of code word, the first version of this code word includes the resource assignation of the to composite control channel first control channel element, and the second edition of this code word includes the resource assignation of the to composite control channel second control channel element, and wherein the first version of code word and the second edition are all addressed to identical user equipment unit. In one embodiment, the first version of code word and the second edition are identical, and in another embodiment, the first version of code word and the second edition are different. As discussed further below, whether how this addressed entity of same affect combines described control channel element to be addressed to the code word of identical entity. Therefore wireless communication network infrastructure entity is launched and is included at least two and control the composite control channel of channel element, wherein each element include being addressed to the first corresponding code word version of identical entity and second code letter this. In some instances, wireless network infrastructure entity can will be typically based on the channel condition of entity, launches and includes being addressed to the composite control channel of the single control channel element of this entity. Additionally, as mentioned above, control 8 CCE that channel can include being dispersed throughout control area.
Including comprising in the embodiment of composite control channel that the different types of radio resource assignment of at least two controls channel element at composite control channel, remote unit generally determines the number of types controlling channel element constituting this composite control channel when receiving this composite control channel. In one embodiment, composite control channel includes the type indicator information about each type of control channel element constituting this composite control channel. Therefore remote unit can determine, based on the type indicator information, the number of types controlling channel element. In figure 3, radio frame 300 includes composite control channel 310, and composite control channel 310 includes the first control channel element type 312 and second and controls channel element type 316. First controls channel element type 312 is identified by the first designator 314 (such as, bit sequence), and the first designator 314 is affixed on the last control channel element of the first kind. Second controls channel element type 316 is identified by the second designator 318, and the second designator 318 is affixed on the last control channel element of Second Type. In another embodiment illustrated in the diagram, designator 314 and 318 is absent from, and determines control channel element type afterwards in being successfully decoded of control element. Such as, the CCE412 controlling channel for remote unit 103 can include one or more type bit 414, type bit 414 may indicate that the up-link control element in the payload of decoding or downlink control element and identifies remote unit, and the CCE416 for remote unit 110 can include one or more control bit 418, and control bit 418 points out the up-link control element for remote unit 110 or downlink control element. This control element can be addressed to single UE by the CRC of colour code or by other means. According on the other hand, remote unit determines the number controlling channel element constituting composite control channel according to the control signal launched. Fig. 3 and 4 are only exemplary embodiments of the physical layout controlling channel element in radio-sub frame. In alternative embodiment, this layout can be considered logic placement, wherein controls channel element and includes crossing over many subcarriers of control area pseudo-random distribution, but is constrained to accord with, with mobile logo, the control channel set associated.
In one embodiment, it is determined that the number controlling channel element constituting composite control channel includes determining many uplink control channel elements and determining many downlink control channel elements. Based on one or more factors, such as the first and second bit sequences are embedded in the position in frame, number for the control code element in the channel quality communicated with movement station, the carrier frequency of communication link and frame, determine uplink control channel element and the number of downlink control channel element. May determine that the number of uplink control channel element based on the first bit sequence, and may determine that the number of downlink control channel element based on the second bit sequence being embedded in frame. Alternatively, different bit sequences is used to may indicate that different control channel element number. Such as, the first bit sequence may indicate that the first number of uplink elements, and the second bit sequence may indicate that the second number of uplink elements.
In certain embodiments, composite control channel includes the first composite control channel part in the first reception bandwidth on the first mid frequency and the second composite control channel in the second reception bandwidth on the second mid frequency. This type of controls channel architecture can be implemented as the long-distance user adapting to have limited acceptance bandwidth. More generally, composite control channel can be divided into the multiple composite control channel parts on the mid frequency of correspondence. Such as, the receiver bandwidth that terminal has is limited to 10MHz, and carrier bandwidths is 20MHz. In order to adapt to this Terminal Type with limited minimum bandwidth capacity, it is necessary to composite control channel to be mapped to the 10MHz below 20MHz carrier wave and 10MHz subband above. There is terminal preemption upper one of the subband or lower subband of 10MHz capacity and receive corresponding composite control channel.
The present invention allows to reduce the number of times of blind Detecting when not increasing signaling consumption. Disclose the many methods that can advantageously individually realize, but these methods are most preferably combinations to be realized.
According to first aspect, can reducing the number of times of blind Detecting by control channel element is limited to CCH candidate collection, this CCH candidate collection is different for downlink scheduling mandate and the uplink scheduling grant sent on L1/L2 control channel. Such as, when control area has 18 CCE, these CCE all distribution is used for uplink scheduling grant and downlink scheduling mandate, it would be desirable to movement station performs 72 blind Detecting and attempts. By distributing independent non-overlapped or partly overlapping control channel element candidate collection for up-link and downlink, it is possible to reduce the number of times of blind Detecting. Such as, if 10 CCE being assigned to downlink control channel set and 8 CCE being assigned to uplink candidate set, then for altogether 36 blind Detecting, the blind Detecting number of attempt for up-link is 20, and the blind Detecting number of attempt for downlink is 16. By 18 CCE combined, which results in total blind Detecting number of attempt of the search volume of the reduction about UL and DL and reduce 50%. It is envisioned that each uplink candidate set and downlink candidate collection can comprise equal number of assignment CCE to form candidate control channel, or more CCE can be distributed to one of up-link and downlink. For 5MHz, it has been found that, in order to realize for completely buffering the whole spectrum efficiency with web-browsing business, downlink or up-link only need for each subframe about 6 to 8 channels of scheduling. Therefore, receive downlink transmission in order to ensure 8 remote equipments can be dispatched and 8 remote equipments can be dispatched for ul transmissions, about 8 CCE are only needed for downlink search volume, and 8 CCE are only needed for up-link search volume. It is envisioned that in 5MHz situation, it is possible to use cover to improve CCH more than 8 CCE.
More specifically, in one exemplary embodiment, it is envisioned that, for 5MHz3GPPLTE carrier wave, wherein n=3 OFDM symbol, the number controlling channel element in control area is 18 (nCCE=18), if up link control channel elements and downlink control channel element not difference, then single search volume can include 18 CCE, causes 2 �� 36 blind Detecting for each up-link and downlink, then causes 72 blind Detecting altogether. But, for two search volumes, n=3 OFDM symbol, nCCE=18, having the downlink of 10 CCE will cause 20 blind Detecting and has the up-link of 8 CCE 16 blind Detecting will be needed to attempt, and 36 blind Detecting are attempted altogether. This allows the less blind Detecting of each subframe to attempt covering the two search volume (namely, up-link and downlink), and can it is further contemplated that, owing to attempting being about 2 �� 27=54 for total blind Detecting of up-link and downlink scheduling mandate, it is therefore desirable to distribute no more than 13 CCE for UL or DL.
According to other method, UE can determine the number of the control channel candidate for UL and DL transmission when not increasing the signaling of association, to use the number of control code unit to support that this is determined. Therefore can be used for the function that the given CCE controlling channel candidate set is the OFDM symbol number being assigned to control area. Such as, the number (1,2 or 3) according to the control code element in control area is understood the scale controlling channel candidate set by remote unit and elementary cell. For a code element, situation compared to 2 OFDM symbol, remote unit and elementary cell can use less CCE candidate collection for CCH, and during for 2 OFDM symbol, the number of its CCE candidate is by the number less than the CCE candidate for 3 OFDM symbol. It is envisioned that remote unit is by checking the control signal pointing out OFDM symbol number, such as physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH), it is possible to find out the OFDM symbol number in control area.
According to other method, elementary cell the number of the antenna disposed affects the number of CCE. This is because, downlink reference code element (RS) form changes based on the number of the elementary cell antenna adopted, and thus uses the most of resource element (subcarrier) being likely to have been used for creating CCE to replace reference symbol.
Except it should be understood that except downlink RS form, need the scale of downlink ACK/NACK (A/N) resource and cat0 resource scale (wherein cat0 be the information launched on PCFICH (such as, CCFI)), control area there are how many resources (resource element) can be used for forming control channel element to determine. Table 1 highlights this relation and illustrates the resource cat0 distributing to downlink ACK/NACK (A/N) in the first OFDM symbol of control area, with the resource not assigned because controlling the granularity of channel element, wherein controlling channel element (CCE) in Table 1 to be made up of 9 miniature CE, wherein miniature CE is made up of 4 controls resource element (RE). Therefore, CCE is made up of 36 RE. In OFDM symbol 1 (ofdm1) and 2 (ofdm2), there is the reference symbol taking some RE, these RE are likely to have been used for CCE. In Table 1, there are 4 antennas, RS occupies the RE of 1/3 in RE and the ofdm2 of 1/3 in ofdm1. Being absent from RS in ofdm3, therefore all RE can be assigned to control to form CCE. Due to n=3, the available resources therefore from all 3 the ofdm code elements in control area can be used for forming CCE. If n=2, then the resource being only from initial two OFDM symbol (Ofdm1 and ofdm2) can be used for forming CCE. Similarly, for n=1, the resource being only from the first OFDM symbol can be used for forming CCE.
Table 2 illustrates that about K be 12 (wherein for all bandwidth, KDL=KUL=12) number of the search volume with about difference control channel configuration. In table, k (small letter k) points out the actual CCE for controlling channel configuration, as #CCEs < K, (namely, k=MIN (K, #CCEs)), k can less than K, wherein for different carrier bandwidths (5,10 and 20MHz) table gives #CCEs. Although there is no need to point out independent K for each bandwidth modeDLAnd KULBut, it has an advantage that, performs less blind Detecting, which reduce crc error and reduce the complexity of movement station. Table 2 illustrates about K=12 (wherein for all bandwidth, KDL=KUL=12) number of the search volume with about difference control channel configuration.
According to another embodiment, carrier frequency can be used for determining the number of the CCE controlled in channel and controlling the scale of channel candidate set. Carrier frequency is more big, then the number of CCE is more big. Accordingly, with respect to the number of CCE of 5MHz by the number less than the CCE about 10MHz, and will be greater than the number of the CCE about 10MHz about the number of the CCE of 20MHz. Table 2 illustrates about K=12 (wherein for all bandwidth, KDL=KUL=12) number of the search volume with about difference control channel configuration. Although there is no need to point out independent K for each bandwidth modeDLAnd KULBut, it has an advantage that, performs less blind Detecting, which reduce crc error.
As mentioned below table 2 and 3 illustrates, it is possible to combine these methods according to most preferred embodiment. Table 2 illustrates about K=12 (wherein for all bandwidth, KDL=KUL=12) number of the search volume with about difference control channel configuration. Although there is no need to point out independent K for each bandwidth modeDLAnd KULBut, it has an advantage that, performs less blind Detecting, which reduce crc error. For less K, the number of region of search increases (referring to table 3), result in some the CCH performance loss because the junction efficiency reduced causes. But, decrease the number of times of blind Detecting, turn, this reduces crc error.
Table 4 relates to another embodiment, the number (S) of search volume is wherein illustrated for different CCE sum (#CCEs=nCCE), wherein by the scale number of the OFDM symbol in control area (n be) of control area, carrier bandwidths, control channel configuration (its different numbers considering Base Transmitter antenna and the reference symbol form used) and PCFICH state is (namely for this CCE sum, CCFI value) determine, and for K=max (KDL, KUL), wherein KDL=8 and KUL<=KDL(such as, KUL=6). Make KDL> KULHelp to maintain there is downlink form control channel (such as, PDCCH in E-URTA) cover identical with the control channel with uplink format, this is because the uplink format about scheduling authorization has the payload bit fewer than the downlink form about scheduling authorization. So, for K=8, the number of times of blind Detecting is less than 40, and this is considered the complexity advantageously reducing movement station and reduces crc error. PCFICH state " 10 " as shown in table 4 and " 11 " are used for the up-link S determining in the situation of n=3ULWith downlink SDLThe number of search volume, wherein given S=SDL+SUL, and the upper limit of wherein S=nCCE/K. Downlink search volume (namely there is the search volume being mainly downlink form corresponding to downlink scheduling mandate) in the number of the CCE that can be used for controlling channel candidate be KDL, and the number of the CCE that can be used for controlling channel candidate in up-link search volume (namely having the search volume being mainly uplink format corresponding to uplink scheduling grant) is KUL. The hash function giving the unique identifier of each movement station based on base station or network assigned is used for determining movement station should be assigned which downlink search volume and which up-link search volume. It should be noted that, table 4 uses S and table 2 and 3 uses s, but S and s has identical definition. In the row 1 of the table 4 of PCFICH state=00, in the control area about given n=1 and the 5MHz carrier wave controlling channel configuration=1, there is 4 available CCE altogether. Due to #CCEs < K (that is, #CCEs=4 < K=8), therefore only exist single search volume for downlink search volume and up-link search volume. In this case, downlink search volume and up-link search volume have the overlap of 100%. In the situation of the 20MHz being expert in 1, #CCEs=10 and owing to #CCEs=10 is more than K=8, therefore there are 2 search volumes, one is scale is KDLDownlink search volume and one be scale be KULUp-link search volume. For up-link search volume and downlink search volume, there is very big overlap. In the row 4 of table 4, for PCFICH state=10, the control area about 10MHz carrier wave exists 27 available CCE altogether. In this case, the number (S of downlink search volumeDL) it is given as the number (S of 2 and up-link search volumeUL) it is given as 2. But for PCFICH state=11 in row 5, during for 10MHz carrier wave, for 27 available CCE (nCCE=27) that the sum in the control area of 10MHz carrier wave is identical, SDL=3 and SUL=1. Therefore, PCFICH state can be used for pointing out the number about the up-link search volume existed in the subframe of n=3 and downlink search volume to movement station.
In table 2, it is illustrated that four control channel configuration. This configuration has the control channel scale of 1,2 or 3 OFDM symbol (time slot). The number of the CCE at 5MHz, 10MHz and 20MHz place will depend upon which that the scale of CCH changes. Therefore, for the control channel configuration 1 at 5MHz place, the number that there are 4 possible CCE, CCE is limited to 4, and there is single search set; For 10MHz, there are 6 possible CCE, the number that can be used for controlling the CCE of channel is 6 and there is 1 search set; And for 20MHz carrier wave, there are 10 available CCE, the number of the CCE in search set is 10, and the number searching for set is 1. For controlling channel configuration 2, carrier channel is bigger, thus there are 2 code elements: at 5MHz place, the number that there are 9 possible CCE, CCE is limited to 9, and there is single search set; For 10MHz, there are 14 possible CCE, the number that can be used for controlling the CCE of channel is limited to 12, and there are 2 search set; And for 20MHz carrier wave, there are 24 available CCE, the number of the CCE in search set is limited to 12, and the number searching for set is 2. For having the control channel configuration 3 of 2 code elements: at 5MHz place, the number that there are 12 possible CCE, CCE is limited to 12, and there is single search set; For 10MHz, there are 19 possible CCE, the number that can be used for controlling the CCE of channel is limited to 12, and there are 2 search set; And for 20MHz carrier wave, there are 30 available CCE, the number of the CCE in search set is limited to 12, and the number searching for set is 3. For having the control channel configuration 4 of 3 code elements: at 5MHz place, the number that there are 18 possible CCE, CCE is limited to 12, and there are 2 search set; For 10MHz, there are 27 possible CCE, the number that can be used for controlling the CCE of channel is limited to 12, and there are 3 search set; And for 20MHz carrier wave, there are 44 available CCE, the number of the CCE in search set is limited to 12, and the number searching for set is 4. It is envisioned that search set is by overlap. These scales are stored in elementary cell and remote unit, and thus elementary cell and each of remote unit have much based on CCH configuration, scale and bandwidth understanding search set.
It is enough for MBMS subframe n=1 or 2 (1 or 2 OFDM symbol is for control area), this is because of no need of supporting downlink scheduling mandate (only supporting ACK/NACK, CCFI and uplink scheduling grant). In this case, as long as the scale of up-link search volume comprises whole control area (all CCE), if control area is also considered as downlink and also searching downlink link thereon by remote unit, then do not have very big problem. Would be likely to occur the detection of mistake, cause that potential soft buffer deteriorates (corruption), but, when the sub-frame in scheduling packet detects the scheduling authorization of reality, this soft buffer will be refreshed, and thus performance is not affected by the detection of mistake. This needs uplink scheduling grant and downlink scheduling mandate having to explicitly or implicitly to support new Data Indicator bit. If it will be recognized which subframe UE understands is MBMS, then UE controller 116 can be default to not check downlink CCH candidate completely. To be typically enough for 10 and 20MHz, n=1. If using n=2, if given K*s < nCCEs or some search volume are pointed out as downlink, then would be likely to occur some untapped CCE. Therefore, when UE understand which subframe be MBMS, it assume that all search volumes are for up-link subsequently.
According to from elementary cell 101,102 to the control signaling of remote unit 103,110, it may be determined that the position of search set. Alternatively, it is envisioned that search set can be predefined and be stored in elementary cell and remote unit. Therefore, control area 210 is divided into multiple CCE candidate collection or search volume. Available CCE number is equal to search set size in frame, search for whole control area. In the example of table 2 above, this be in all carrier frequencies CCH configuration 1 and when 5MHz carrier wave configuration 2 and 3 situation. For the configuration 2 and 3 at 10MHz place, and the configuration 3 when 5MHz carrier wave, 2 overlapping search volumes of 12 predetermined C CE are used for the search set of each up-link and downlink search set. Can be include that two of 12 predetermined C CE candidates are non-overlapped or the search volume of overlap for the configuration 2 at 20MHz place, up-link CCE and downlink CCE. Can be 3 the overlapping search volumes including 12 predetermined C CE candidates for the configuration 3 at 20MHz place, up-link CCE and downlink CCE. Configuration 4 for 10MHz place, it is possible to use all include 3 search volumes for UL and DL of 12 predetermined C CE. 4 the overlapping search volumes including 12 predetermined C CE candidates can be had for the configuration 4 at 20MHz place, up-link CCE and downlink CCE. Table 3 illustrates the alternative of table 2, has wherein been limited to 10 about the search volume of each set but not 12 predetermined C CE. To put it more simply, table 3 is not described here, this table is similar besides the numeric. Fig. 2, illustrate search volume in 3 and 4, the CCE wherein associated with each search volume by graph representation.
In order to avoid increasing signaling consumption, it is preferred that elementary cell and remote unit can determine which search volume is assigned to remote unit. Elementary cell 101,102 will be appreciated by which control channel element can be used for movement station 103 and which control channel element can be used for movement station 110. It is envisioned that for this purpose can advantageously with the known unique mobile logo symbol of remote unit and elementary cell. Specifically, it is envisioned that, remote unit Electronic Serial Number (ESN), international mobile logo symbol (IMSI) or the mobile logo symbol issued by elementary cell, such as community particular radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI) can be adopted. When control signal is intended for one group of movement station, it is possible to use horde group identifier, such as Stochastic accessing RNTI (RA-RNTI) or paging RNTI (P-RNTI). Given known identifiers, remote unit and elementary cell all use this number to determine the CCE candidate collection that will use. This can use hash function (hashfunction) or use the most end numerical digit of unique identifier to complete. Such as, when there is 2 set, the odd number most end numerical digit of identifier can be used for first in the set pointing out to use, and even number most end numerical digit can be used for second in the set pointing out to use. When using more than two set, it is possible to adopt modular function. By using mobile logo symbol and the predetermined relationship of search set, and storing and the position of predetermined C CE of each search set associative that CCH scale and bandwidth identify, remote unit and elementary cell can find out the suitable search set about CCE independently. In another embodiment, hash function include using with the subframe index in uniquely the identifying of remote unit association, system frame number or radio frame at least one and make remote unit jump to the device of different control channel candidate search volumes based on subframe.
Some consideration of table 2 and 3 is as follows. If the number of available CCE is less than k (that is, nCCE <=k, (wherein such as, k=13)), then for uplink scheduling grant and downlink scheduling mandate, only use a search volume. If k is < nCCE <=2k, then and adopt scale to be k two are likely to overlapping search volume, and one is used for downlink (DL), and one is used for up-link (UL). By making search volume 0 be initial k CCE, and to make search volume 1 be the CCE of most end, it is possible to makes overlapping minimum. Specifically, search volume 0 is CCH candidate collection { CCE0, CCE1..., CCEk-1, and search volume 1 is CCH candidate collection { CCEnCCE-k, CCEnCCE-k-2..., CCEnCCE-1. Lap is equal to nCCE-2 �� (nCCE-k)=2k-nCCE. If nCCE=2k, then DL and UL search volume is not overlapping. If nCCE=k+1, then there is the Maximum overlap of k-1. This search volume can be assigned to DL/UL, wherein (search volume 0-> DL, search volume 1-> UL), or (search volume 1-> DL, search volume 0-> UL). Such as, if there are 18 CCE, then k=13 the CCE that initial k=13 CCE is assigned to DL search volume and most end is assigned to UL search volume. Due to overlap, 2 �� 13-18=8 CE is public for DL and UL search volume. When nCCEs is more than 2k, i.e. nCCE > 2k (if k=13, take 26), then CCFI will point out there is s1Or s2Individual search volume. For s1(or s2) individual search volume, s1, d(s2, d) search volume is for DL, and s1, u(s2, u) search volume is for UL, wherein s1=s1, d+s1, u, s2=s2, d+s2, u. Such as, s1=3 (s1, d=2, s1, u=1) or s2=4 (s2, d=2, s2, u=2) individual search volume, wherein each search volume corresponds to the CCH candidate collection that scale is k CCE. If it should be noted that, notice via BCH, then (s1, d, s1, u)��(s2, d, s2, u) can be static or semi-static, if or implicitly notice via cat0 (being also known as controlling channel format indicator (CCFI)), then can be dynamic. Another assumption is that, PICH/AICH is always located in the first search volume, and this first search volume is only both DL or DL and UL (if nCCEs is <=k).
When there is more than two search volume (nCCE > 2k), the definition of search volume is more complicated. Assume the candidate collection that each search volume is made up of k CCE, then the minimal amount of search volume isMore search volume can be defined as overlapping with other search volumes. CCE is taken, i.e. { CCE by starting order from a CCE0, CCE1..., CCEk-1, { CCEk, CCEk+1..., CCE2k-1..., define DL search volume. CCE is taken, i.e. { CCE by starting order from most end CCEnCCE-k, CCEnCCE-k-2..., CCEnCCE-1, { CCEnCCE-2k, CCEnCCE-2k-3..., CCEnCCE-k-1..., define UL search volume. Use BW=10MHz, n=3 exemplarily, it is possible to there are 27 CCE, wherein each CCE is made up of 48 RE (R1-072169), i.e. nCCE=27. If each search volume is made up of k=13 CCE, then the minimal amount of search volume is Fig. 1 illustrates, if using s1How=3 search volumes, can distribute search volume, wherein s for DL and UL1, d=2, s1, u=1. Alternatively, Fig. 2 illustrates, if using s2How=4 search volumes, can distribute search volume, wherein s for DL and UL2, d=2, s2, u=2. It should be noted that, search volume 3 is overlapping with search volume 0 and 1. For BW=20MHz, n=3, there is more CCE, for instance, 44 CCE, each CCE is made up of 60 RE (R1-072169). In this case,Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrates the two ways of assignment search volume.
According to another method, in the control area of each subframe two control channel format indicator (CCFI) the bit notice control area scale about each subframe (in the number n of OFDM symbol, wherein n=1,2,3) and the number of DL/UL search volume. Such as: if controlling channel format indicator bit is " 00 ", then control area has n=1 OFDM symbol. If o is nCCE < k, then only existing a search volume, it is used for both DL and UL. If o is k < nCCE <=2k, then there are two search volumes. Search volume 0 is CCH candidate collection { CCE0, CCE1..., CCEk-1And for DL. Search volume 1 is CCH candidate collection { CCEnCCE-k, CCEnCCE-k-2..., CCEnCCE-1, and for UL. o, for n=1, does not predict nCCE > 2k. If controlling channel format indicator bit is " 01 ", then control area has n=2 OFDM symbol. If o is nCCE < k, then only existing a search volume, it is used for both DL and UL. If o is k < nCCE <=2k, then there are two search volumes. Search volume 0 is CCH candidate collection { CCE0, CCE1..., CCEk-1And for DL. Search volume 1 is CCH candidate collection { CCEnCCE-k, CCEnCCE-k-2..., CCEnCCE-1, and for UL. o, for n=2, does not predict nCCE > 2k. If controlling channel format indicator bit is " 10 ", then control area has 3 code elements. o is for the carrier bandwidths (BW <=5MHz) of 5MHz or less: if �� is nCCE < k, then only exist a search volume, and it is used for both DL and UL. If �� is k < nCCE <=2k, then there are two search volumes. Search volume 0 is CCH candidate collection { CCE0, CCE1..., CCEk-1And for DL. Search volume 1 is CCH candidate collection { CCEnCCE-k, CCEnCCE-k-2..., CCEnCCE-1, and for UL. ��, for n=3 and BW <=5MHz, does not predict nCCE > 2k. o, for the carrier bandwidths (BW > 5MHz) of 10 or 20MHz, is respectively present s1Or s (10)1(20) individual search volume. At s1(10), in individual search volume, s is used1, d(10) individual search volume controls channel candidate for DL and uses s1, u(10) individual search volume controls channel candidate, wherein s for UL1(10)=s1, d(10)+s1, u(10). For s1(20) similar distribution is defined. The number of the CCE in each search volume is k. If controlling channel format indicator bit is " 11 ", then control area has 3 code elements. o is for the carrier bandwidths (BW <=5MHz) of 5MHz or less, and search volume is defined as identical with the situation of " 10 ". o, for the carrier bandwidths (BW > 5MHz) of 10 or 20MHz, is respectively present s2Or s (10)2(20) individual search volume. At s2(10), in individual search volume, s is used2, d(10) individual search volume controls channel candidate for DL and uses s2, u(10) individual search volume controls channel candidate, wherein s for UL2(10)=s2, d(10)+s2, u(10). For s2(20) similar distribution is defined. The number of the CCE in each search volume is k.
As seen by above description, an aspect of this embodiment relates to the transmission of " cat0 ", CCFI or P-CFICH. CCFI transmits the scale of the TDM control area in subframe; Such as, n=1,2 or 3 OFDM symbol. Generally, CCFI can notice 2^#CCFI bit value or state. Therefore, CCFI can be used as determining the subset of the value of TDM control area yardstick, to identify more than one search volume form. In the above example, for the search volume configuration specifically associated, there is a n=3 state, and for alternative configuration, there is another n=3 state. This alternative configuration can include the different definition of the resource ratio for UL and DL search volume. Such as, in some instances, space is needed not search for for UL or DL, therefore greatly reduce the maximum times of blind Detecting.
In the process 800 of Fig. 8, as pointed out in step 802, unique identifier determined by remote unit (or UE) controller 116. Such as, remote unit 103,110 receives mobile logo symbol from base station 102. In step 804, remote unit controller 116 determines, according to this mobile logo symbol, the candidate collection controlling channel element. Alternatively, this remote unit can receive the control signal associated with this candidate collection. Remote unit 103,110 receives the frame including composite control channel, and this composite control channel includes controlling channel element. Described control channel element can comprise radio resource assignment information, and some this radio resource assignment information is addressed to single wireless communication entity exclusively.
In fig. 8, remote unit controller 116 can be attempted single control channel element decoded when not first composite component, or it can attempt single control channel element decoded after to composite component decoding or trial decoding. Whether necessity generally depends on whether remote unit is successfully decoded single control channel element in any combination. Such as, Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) or other Information Authentication inspection failures or decode in unsuccessful example after to single control channel element decoded, it is necessary to combination. Information Authentication typically involves remote unit specific information, and this remote unit specific information can include in the control channel element of decoding, or by coding-control channel element by mask, or by mask or be fed in CRC for CRC colour code.
In some implementations, each control channel element in multiple control channel elements has related index, and this root index may serve as combination and controls the basis of channel element. Such as, if composite control channel includes 12 controls channel element, then 4 these elements can have identical association root index, and this root index may serve as the basis to the decoding of described control channel element and combination. As discussed above, in the embodiment controlling multiple parts that channel is divided on corresponding mid frequency, remote unit only combines the control channel element from identical control channel strip. In other words, the control channel element controlling channel strip from difference is not combined.
In certain embodiments, at least two of composite control channel is controlled channel element combination by remote unit, and wherein each control channel element has the type only comprising the radio resource assignment information being addressed to single wireless communication entity exclusively. Such as, Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) or the failed example of other Information Authentication inspections or decode in unsuccessful example after to single control channel element decoded, it is necessary to combination. But, generally, remote unit can be attempted when first not combining controlling channel element decoding.
In one embodiment, by the Soft Inform ation deriving from the first codeword information and the second codeword information is sued for peace, at least two controls channel element combination, and wherein the first codeword information controls in channel element first, and the second codeword information controls in channel element second. In this combination, the control channel element of combination is by interim alignment and superposition (being referred to as Chase combination). This superposition can involve high specific combination, or is added together by log-likelihood ratio (LLR), etc. Here hypothesis is, the first codeword information and the second codeword information are addressed to identical remote unit. Otherwise, decoding or decoding after Information Authentication inspection will be unsuccessful. When failure, remote unit such as, by combining the different sets controlling channel element or by combining extra element, can form the various combination controlling channel element.
In another embodiment, by rearranging and the Soft Inform ation deriving from the first different codeword information and the second codeword information being sued for peace, at least two is controlled channel element combination, wherein the first codeword information controls in channel element first, and the second codeword information controls in channel element second. Such as, the first code word and the second code word can include the check bit of the channel encoder generation from relatively low rate and the subset of information aggregate. This subset can be non-overlapped or partly overlapping. Soft Inform ation corresponding to overlapping codeword bit position is typically summed in a remote unit, but not overlapping bit position is typically rearranged appropriate location for decoding.
In one embodiment, the remote unit combination according to predefined control channel element, at least two is controlled channel element combination. Such as, at least one this predefined combination includes the combination controlling channel element that at least two logic is contiguous. Described logic contiguous control channel element or can not be and is physically adjacent to. Such as, if the t easet ofasubcarriers (comb) of crossover frequency distribution controls channel element for one, then another control channel element can take or be not take up to control, with first, the subcarrier that channel element is adjacent by physics. Or, if the logically and physically sequence of subcarrier is identical, i.e. there is the mapping one to one of logic subcarrier and physical sub-carrier, then to mean physics adjacent for Logic adjacent, and vice versa. In other embodiments, being combined by non-adjacent at least two control channel element, wherein non-adjacent control element can be physics or logic.
In some implementations, remote unit attempts the order of combination control channel element based on one or more conjectures or hypothesis according to predefined combination. For example, it is possible to based on the determination of the number controlling channel element constituting composite control channel, control channel element is combined. Include in the embodiment of more than one element type at composite control channel as discussed above, such number determining the control channel element also including determining the certain types of control channel element of composition. For example, it is possible to the existence controlling channel element number information included based on composite control channel, it is determined that control the number of channel element. For example, it is possible to based on the bit sequence being attached to composite control channel, it is determined that control the number of channel element. In an implementation, different bit sequences points out to control the different numbers of channel element. In another implementation, the number of channel element is pointed out to control in bit sequence position in frame. In the implementation of the latter, depending on bit sequence position in frame, identical bit sequence can be used for the different numbers pointing out to control channel element. It is also based on data shared between Wireless Telecom Equipment and network infrastructure entity or information receiving and transmitting, it is determined that control the number of channel element. This can occur in and is sent to the message of all remote units via the broadcast channel sent occasionally or occurs in the broadcast sent in each TTI. Can also via being exclusively used in the message of remote unit to send the number controlling channel element that remote unit should decode or the subset controlling channel element.
In one embodiment, controlling channel can be that one or two controls channel element, and the scale of control element points out the type of control element. Convolutional encoding can be used for control element. And decoder can to first control element decode, check CRC, and if subsequently this control element be specified for user, then stop decoding. Otherwise, this decoding can from the just tail bit on the first control element insert before point, until including the end of grid of the two control element. Check again for CRC. By which, compared to situation about starting from grid starting point combination control element decoding, can realize controlling channel-decoding by less effort. It should be noted that, in this embodiment, must be identical for single and two control elements bit rates.
In certain embodiments, a part of composite control channel is allocated for the radio resource assigned in each frame. In these embodiments, the unallocated part controlling channel can be used for data transmission. Therefore, wireless communication network infrastructure entity, for instance, scheduler, it is possible to by being embedded in by bit sequence in the frame of correspondence, a distribution part controls channel, for assigning the radio resource in each frame. In one embodiment, the scale of channel is pointed out to control in bit sequence position in frame, for instance, it is allocated for the number controlling channel element assigning radio resource to one or more remote units. In this implementation, control channel element and can be addressed to single remote unit or more than one remote unit exclusively. More generally, network infrastructure entity can be passed through to change the position embedding bit sequence or bit sequence in each frame before frame emission, dynamically changes the part controlling channel for assigning the radio resource in each frame. And, as pointed out above, network infrastructure entity can also dynamically distribute the different types of control channel element in frame and number thereof.
In another embodiment, the bit sequence in subframe it is embedded in for identifying that control channel element is for remote unit. In this case, being embedded in the bit sequence in subframe can be data related bits sequences, such as passes through the CRC of Wireless Telecom Equipment identification information processing, by the code word etc. of Wireless Telecom Equipment identification information mask. In this embodiment, the first subframe can be the most end subframe of TTI, and this first subframe comprises control information, and this control information includes modulation type, resource or antenna mode indicator. Each control channel can be one or more control channel elements, and the scale controlling channel in the first subframe and the second subframe can be different. Second subframe can occur in the part controlling channel identical or different with the control information from the first subframe. If using the different piece of subframe, by by the control channel element in location learning second subframe of the remote units control channel element in the first subframe, it is possible to reduce blind decoding complexity.
In the fate map 900 of Fig. 9, in step 902, wireless communication network infrastructure entity, for instance elementary cell 101,102, it is determined that for remote unit be unique mobile logo symbol. This unique identifier can be generated by elementary cell or receive from movement station, and is preferably in the common process that movement station is attached, but alternatively can also as independent operation. In step 904, network determines the candidate collection controlling channel element for particular remote unit. Then, in step 906, elementary cell selects to be used for the control channel element of this remote unit from this candidate collection. Then in selected control channel element, control information is delivered to remote unit.
As mentioned above, by being embedded in by bit sequence in the corresponding frame used by remote unit, a part controls the channel radio resource for assigning in each frame. Distribution part control channel includes all applicable part of distribution control channel or less than its all applicable part, wherein unappropriated part can be used for other purposes, for instance, data are transmitted. The wireless communication network infrastructure entity of such as elementary cell can dynamically change the part controlling channel for assigning the radio resource in each frame, and plurality of frame constitutes radio frame. This aspect according to the disclosure, can distribute the different piece of each control channel in each frame constituting radio frame potentially for assigning radio resource. As discussed above, by changing the position embedding bit sequence in each frame or by using different bit sequences, it is possible to dynamically change the part controlling channel for assigning the radio resource in each frame.
Generally, the different frame constituting radio frame can distribute the different piece controlling channel of correspondence for radio resource assignment. In an implementation, Wireless Telecom Equipment includes receiver, and this receiver is able to receive that the frame corresponding to Transmission Time Interval, and wherein this frame includes controlling channel and embedding bit sequence in the frame. The controller being communicatively coupled to receiver is configured for the position that the bit sequence of correspondence is embedded in the frame of reception, determining the part controlling channel for radio resource assignment, wherein the part controlling channel for radio resource assignment can less than complete control channel.
Elementary cell determines the part controlling channel for the radio resource assignment in each frame based on the position that corresponding bit sequence is embedded in frame. The part controlling channel being commonly used for radio resource assignment can less than complete control channel, and each frame can be embedded in the position in frame based on corresponding bit sequence and use the different piece controlling channel for radio resource assignment.
In some instances, all control channel elements transmission of composite control channel controls channel information. In this particular example, being absent from of channel element number information is controlled, for instance, being absent from of the bit sequence being embedded in frame, it is indicated that use whole composite control channel for radio resource assignment. Such as, when being absent from controlling channel element number information, remote unit assume that, the control channel element of default number is used for assigning radio resource.
Thus, it can be seen that by creating multiple search volumes, it mates the maximum number of the CCE needed for supporting the required maximum number of the scheduling remote units in subframe preferably, thus reducing the maximum times of blind Detecting. Defined signaling can dynamically point out to subframe control area scale and search volume layout one by one. According to the information that the information dynamically pointed out by CCFI (or each subframe include PCFICH), elementary cell (elementary cell assignment mobile logo symbol) are semi-statically pointed out, with based on LTE bandwidth mode (carrier wave) with control channel configuration (1,2, the 3 or 4) information pointed out statically, determine search volume number and which search volume for downlink and which search volume for up-link.
Another aspect of the present invention is devoted to be intended to the needs controlling to reduce while channel the average time that blind Detecting is attempted for UE not missing. This is for bigger bandwidth, for instance 5MHz to 20MHz, is particular importance, and wherein the number of candidate CCH is higher (such as, 30��40). For the control channel of different user, L1/L2 controls the averaged energy levels of channel can be different. L1/L2 controls energy (the EPRE) (emitted energy of resource element of each resource element of the RE in channel, do not include the energy in Cyclic Prefix, it is the expection energy of RE, and wherein this expection exceedes possible modulation condition) can also change between RE. But, when being likely to, it is necessary to make the EPRE of control channel RE same or similar, in order to reduce average blind Detecting number of times. For UE advantageously, it is assumed that the EPRE controlling channel RE about L1/L2 is identical. In this case, all CCERE are uniformly taken from from any energy for DLRS obtained of other CCERE with non-zero energy.
By using the following fact, namely there are greatly different two CCE receiving energy level and be less likely to belong to identical control channel, it is possible to reduce the average time of blind Detecting. Therefore CCE energy level can be used for eliminating the consideration to some CCH candidate. Fig. 5 illustrates the example with 4 CCE. If CCE0 and CCE2 has greatly different reception energy, then may infer that the control channel of scale 3 and 4 is infeasible, and only need two of inspection scale 2 to control channels except the control channel of scale 1. Due to channel and interference be all likely to that different reception energy is had contribution, therefore use threshold value guarantee not miss effectively control detection. It reduce the average time that blind decoding is attempted.
At UE place, controller 116 can measure the averaged energy levels of different control channel element in advance to reduce the set of possible blind Detecting. Such as, CCE0 and CCE1 can have the similar energy of the energy the being different from CCE2 energy also different from CCE3. The blind Detecting of CCE0 to CCE3 (1CCE) and CCE0+CCE1 occurs. The blind Detecting controlling channel and CCE2+CCE3 including 3 and 4 CCE does not occur. UE can also be measured the averaged energy levels of CCE when CCE is polymerized and decodes, to limit the number of times of follow-up blind Detecting. In preferable case, first single CCE is controlled channel-decoding, subsequently effective 2 CCE are controlled channel-decoding, subsequently effective 3 CCE are controlled channel-decoding, effective 4 CCE are controlled channel-decoding, etc.
At eNOdeB place, the control channel of different user can be arranged as so that the CCE with different average energies mixes. This is better than making CCE arrange according to the energy from minimum to maximum, because the change in this situation will be more progressive.
CCE energy measurement can advantageously be combined with the CQI information of operation report (instant or average), similarly to reduce maximum blind decoding number of times. CQI can be used for making maximum blind Detecting number of times minimum, if the CQI of wherein report is higher than threshold value, then the UE only scale of checking is the CCH candidate of 1,2,3 CCE, and if the CQI reported is lower than threshold value, then and the UE only scale of checking is the CCH candidate of 3,4,8 CCE. This brings the restriction about CCE distribution to scheduler, but is consistent with distributing the normal CCE assigning process of more CCE of the relatively low CQI with report.
Possible CCH candidate collection (such as, { 1,2 is determined by being primarily based on CQI for one for the process combined, 3} CCE or 3,4,8} CCE), use the CCE energy measurement in less CCE combination subsequently, to get rid of the control channel with bigger CCE combination possibly. Alternatively, in order to not miss any possible control channel, CQI can be used for defining the sequence of CCH candidate, for instance, first look at most probable set (execution energy measurement) based on CQI, then look to other set. This search order can exist control channel (CQI is particularly useful) and be absent from control channel (energy measuring is particularly useful) two kinds of situations in reduction average detected number of times.
When combining with CQI, ENERGY METHOD is useful especially, many inconsistent for the CQI CCE that its permission eNodeB assigns and reports. This can when eNodeB feels that CQI is likely to change or control channel needing to send less UE and more CCE can be used to occur when improving reliability. Exemplarily, all remaining CCE can be provided to UE, thus UE can be assigned 8 CCE, even if it only needs 1 CCE, and be typically in the UE in poor condition can 3,4 or 8 CCE of expectability (if or CQI be actually poor, then 8 CCE of expection), and UE 1 to 2 CCE of expection in the condition being in. Only when energy condition suitably (unanimously), the UE of good condition can consider that bigger CCE combines.
If it is envisioned that the energy identical (more stable is average) of each resource element of each RE controlled in channel, then this aspect effect is best. But, when energy changes because of some energy controlling channel from the DLRS in some code element, this aspect can also play a role. If allowing such motility, then another aspect of the present invention can make the CCE number with different RE energy minimum or be used in the energy of DLRS to spread equally on all CCE.
Can it is further contemplated that, this aspect need measure receive energy, this reception energy is the combined effect of emitted energy and fading channel. For DL, owing to the RE of CCE substantially evenly crosses over time and frequency distribution, accordingly, because CCE is likely to be made up of at least 36 RE, the effect of the fading channel of change is balanced to a great extent. Therefore the essential difference receiving energy of CCE is from the difference (if exist) of emitted energy.
As discussed, need in this embodiment to set two threshold values. One for the energy level difference between CCE, and one for CQI. These threshold values need carefully to be set to be effective. For energy level difference, if threshold value is set too high, then may not reduce blind Detecting number of times; If threshold value is set too low, then it is likely to miss the CCH of assignment. Without CCE, there is enough energy, it is possible to there is another threshold value not performing BD completely. Intended reception energy level can based on the CQI of report and the path loss estimated for condition with the #CEs in the CCH candidate considered (part that up-link power controls).
Can it is further contemplated that, by this embodiment of the present invention, when using CQI, UE can adjust its search based on the CQI of its report recently and/or its CQI history, this is because, scheduler may decide that, although channel has been for UE and improves, but it is likely to be only provisional channel condition and therefore it should be conservative and provide CCE more more than the CQI being intended for current report. In fact, CQI from multiple reports can be averaged, and therefore UE by it should be understood that be averaged window and/or assume that scheduler is strictly conservative and can only search the CCH candidate of (such as) 1 or 2 CCE safely but not before the candidate of 1,2,3,4 CCE, it will obtain the several CQI higher than threshold value at it.
In another embodiment, for having the UE of certain capabilities, after to network, this UE points out that this ability and precoding have begun to be applied to PDCCH, it is possible to for the particular range of the CCE position in this UE assignment PDCCH search space, this UE will search for precoding PDCCH.
A kind of method is the specific CCE scope being mapped in PDCCH search space by each precoding vector of the grade 1 from each entry in 16 matrix entries of precoding codebook. This allows the UE precoding vector (that is, this is implicitly determined) used without blind Detecting by the CCE scope being used for being formed precoding PDCCH candidate, but only in the CCE number used, candidate must be carried out blind Detecting. When using only two precoding vectors of the grade 1 corresponding with the PMI of UE report or " default PMI ", the method becomes very simple.
In another embodiment, each PDCCH candidate will be carried out blind Detecting by the UE with precoding PDCCH ability in each possible CCE location sets and operable each possible precoding vector. It means that for 16 possible precoding vectors, the number of blind Detecting rises 16. This ability is delivered to eNB when call setup by the certain capabilities UE with the ability this extra process load being processed and performing precoding blind Detecting. By the subset by specific CCE range assignments to little precoding vector, it is possible to reduce #BDs. By semi-static mode via layer 3 information receiving and transmitting, this subset can be noticed. Otherwise can broadcast this subset (such as, using the D-BCH in LTE).
Finally, in one embodiment, the process of determination and assignment for controlling channel candidate search volume is provided by following process: 1. for each n, notice (broadcasting by means of the SU-1 system information block via D-BCH) or constraint when predefined K, Kdl, Kul, Sdl, Sul2. determine Kdl and Kul is #BDs (K) < 18, wherein K=max (Kdl, Kul). if #BDs (K) is more than 18, then movement station complexity becomes unacceptable and crc error is too high. 3. another constraint when determining Kdl and Kul is, the given bigger DLSG payload scale compared to ULSG, Kdl > Kul4. is therefore, such as select Kdl=8, Kul=6 is used for covering, maximum #BD (UE complexity) and crc error problem 5. notice n (PCFICH points out at least n and broadcasts this first PCFICH in first ofdm code element of each subframe) all CCE7. that 6. scale nCCEs list comprises the control area according to consecutive order logical mappings according to n, BW, CCH_config determines that nCCEs and CCE position (the logical mappings lists from 5.) a. notices BWb. according to the #TX antenna used in control area via P-BCH, n, DLA/NRE scale, PCFICHRE scale, DLRS form (is included: unused antennas RSRE is perforated or for CCE), determine CCH_config. if 8. nCCE <=K, if control area then only having a SP and it being for the overlapping 9. nCCE > K of both UL and DL forms a. and UL and DLSP100%, then there is the SP of a scale Kdl of SP and the DL form of at least one scale Kul of main UL form. 10.S=nCCE/K the upper limit, and Sdl+Sul=S, 11.Kdl the DLSP of individual CCE starts from the top of the continuous list of logical mappings CCE and descending a. is selected as Kdl*Sdl < nCCE due to Kdl and Sdl, therefore it is absent from the ULSP that overlap 12. scale is Kul CCE of DLSP to start from the bottom of logical mappings CCE list and up a. and be chosen to Kul*Sul < nCCE due to Kul and Sul, the lap in overlapping b.DL and the ULSP region being therefore absent from ULSP is provided the 13. all UE understandings RE position about each CCE by Kdl*Sdl+Kul*Sul-nCCE, PCFICH, DLA/N and each RS and understand CCE and be mapped to which SP14.UE and be assigned to the one of each of DL form SP and UL form SP. if there is the more than one SP of given format, then based on unique mark (UEID) of its assignment of such as C-RNTI, PUCCH# etc., it is used in UE and eNB and locates known public hash function, UE being assigned to wherein main one 15. and may is that such as based on the simple hash function of UEID, result that SP number=UEID obtains with Sdl for mould or UEID are with the Sul result obtained being mould
