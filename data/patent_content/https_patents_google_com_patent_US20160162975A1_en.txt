- collaborative filtering is a process for filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple data points or sources. That is, recommendations are typically made according to user-based collaborative filtering, where items are recommended according to items purchased by similar users. Recommendations are also presently made by systems using item-based collaborative filtering (i.e., the cross-selling of items). Some present systems provide search-based collaborative filtering or content-based collaborative filtering.
- Present systems for recommending items are typically skewed, so that popular items are more frequently recommended. Moreover, present systems do not account for direction in item consumption, where, for example, users are more likely to consume item B after item A, but less likely to consume item A after item B.

- Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may provide expanded user recommendation experiences for items by providing directional recommendations according to a user's previously acquired items, and minimizing skewing by merely recommending the most popular items. Because many items to be recommended may have a number of acquisitions that is less than a minimum threshold, traditional recommender systems may have increased difficulty in providing a recommendation for a second item after a first item with few acquisitions. That is, when a relatively small number of users have acquired a particular item, an automated recommendation system may have difficulty in accurately determining whether or when to recommend that item to other users, and/or when a particular recommendation is likely to result in an additional acquisition of the item by a new user.
- the systems and methods disclosed herein expand a recommendation experience for a user by identifying items to acquire that follow a user's previously acquired items.
- the embodiments of the disclosed subject matter allow for the promotion of items and/or content that do not have a cost to acquire, while also increasing revenue by promoting items of interest to a user that have a cost to acquire, so as to expand recommendation experiences to a user for items that may be of interest.
- the embodiments of the disclosed subject matter improve efficiency of recommendation systems such that relevancy of recommended items is increased by accounting for directionality in the acquisition of items.
- Recommended items can include, for example, physical and/or tangible goods, media data, information data, applications, and service providers.
- the embodiments of the disclosed subject matter may improve efficiency of recommendation systems by reducing the amount of skew (e.g., reduced quality of recommendations because of limited acquisition data) in providing recommendations of items.

- items may be any product and/or service that may be viewed, downloaded, purchased, shared, and/or acquired.
- the systems and method disclosed herein may provide recommendations to acquired items that may be physical and/or tangible goods, media data, information data, applications, and service providers.
- a server such as server 13 illustrated in FIG. 2 , or processing unit 14 and analysis system 5 illustrated in FIG. 3 , may generate empirical transition matrix data that includes row data for a first item and column data for a second item.
- empirical transition matrix data may be generated that includes column data for a first item and row data for a second item. It is noted, however, the operations discussed below would need to be transposed to maintain consistency with respect to row data and column data.
- the server may also generate an entry in the empirical transition matrix data for the number of users that acquire the second item after the first item.
- the server may generate an empirical (n+1)-by-(n+1) transition matrix (e.g., empirical transition matrix A) with row i for item i, column j for item j, and entry (i,j) for the number of users who acquire item j after item i, for 1, j in ⁇ 1, 2, . . . , n ⁇ .
- empirical transition matrix A e.g., empirical transition matrix A
- entry (i,j) for the number of users who acquire item j after item i, for 1, j in ⁇ 1, 2, . . . , n ⁇ .
- For the (n+1)-th row of the empirical transition matrix its j-th entry is the number of new users whose first acquisition is item j.
- the (n+1)-th column may be all 0. That is, in operation 110 , the server may form an un-normalized empirical transition matrix.
- the server may generate metadata transition matrix data by partitioning items for each item metadata type. For example, the server may set a uniform transition probability for all items in the partition, and may sum the uniform transition probabilities across all metadata types.
- the server may generate a metadata (n+1)-by-(n+1) transition matrix (e.g., metadata transition matrix M) with row i for item i and column j for item j.
- the server may partition the items, and assume a uniform transition probability among all items within the partition.
- the book metadata types may include author, subject, and the like, and the server may assume a uniform transition probability among all books within the partition.
- the author metadata type the books may be partitioned by author, and the server may assume a uniform transition probability among all books within each partition.
- the server may generate the metadata transition matrix (M) by summing these probabilities across all metadata types.
- the (n+1)-th row and column of M is all 0.
- the server may generate transition probability matrix data by multiplying the metadata transition matrix data (e.g., metadata transition matrix M) with a weight parameter (e.g., weight parameter w), adding the result to the empirical transition matrix data (e.g., empirical transition matrix A), and normalizing each row in operation 130 .
- the server may normalize each row by dividing entries in each row by the sum of each row.
- a matrix C may be calculated by the equation A+ ⁇ *M, where A is the empirical transition matrix, M is metadata transition matrix, and ⁇ is a weight parameter.
- a transition probability matrix T may be generated by normalizing each row i of the matrix C by dividing its entries by its sum to yield the (n+1)-by-(n+1) transition probability matrix T with each entry in [0, 1] and each row sum is 1.
- the computation of the metadata transition matrix M may be generalized as a prior.
- the metadata transition matrix M can be generated according to a transition model on metadata, according to the transpose of the empirical transition matrix A, according to other data, or according to any suitable combination thereof.
- the relevancy of items recommended and the user experience may be expanded, as the systems and methods disclosed herein account for the directionality of item consumption, as opposed to typical recommendation systems using collaborative filtering.
- large-scale recommender systems for items may be skewed, such that a plurality of items in such systems may have few transactions (e.g., purchases, downloads, views, sharing events, and the like).
- recommendations for items may be provided for items, even when an item has few transactions.
- summing the metadata transition data with the empirical transition data can reduced the relative skew of recommended results.
- the server may assume an item transition is uniformly random within each item segment defined by item attributes.

- B ij indicates whether the book-i has V j , where B is a vector space representation of item attributes (e.g., book attributes).
- the Dim(B) is n-by-m, but B may be very sparse.
- the metadata transition matrix (M) may be determined with the following equation:
- D is equal to diag(colSums(B))
- t is a transpose operator
- I is an identity matrix (e.g., a matrix with diagonal entries of ‘1’ and all other values being ‘0’)
- n is the number of items (e.g., books)
- m is the number of item segments (e.g., book segments).
- the server may provide item recommendations to a user computing device communicatively coupled to the server according to the generated transition probability matrix data (e.g., transition probability matrix T) at operation 140 .
- the top probabilities output may be used to provide recommendations for items to the user computing device.
- the server may combine the generated transition probability matrix data (e.g., transition probability matrix 7 ) with user history data to provide the item recommendations.
- the user history data may include items that the user has acquired. For example, if the items that the user has acquired previously are books, the system may determine the transition probabilities to a given candidate book, and accumulate the probabilities (e.g., as weighted by acquisition time of the previously-acquired books) into a score. The server may rank the candidate books based on the scores. That is, the candidate books with the highest scores may be used by the server to provide recommendations to a user computing device.
- the server may generate the transition probability matrix data according to next consumption data for a predetermined time window.
- the time window may be measured in minutes, hours, days, months, or the like, depending on the item.
- the server may generate the transition probability matrix data according to items acquired within the same time window. That is, the server may provide recommendations to a user computing device for an item according to the transition probability matrix data for items acquired at the same time and/or within the same time period (e.g., the same time window).
- Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter may relax a counting strategy with weights. For example, if a user acquires multiple instances of the item j after the item i is acquired, the user may be weighted by the number of instances.
- a server in the system may generate transition-count tables, weighted-sum the generated transition-count tables, and normalize by rows as disclosed herein into a transition probability matrix.
- FIG. 5 shows an operation of the method illustrated in FIG. 4 , the operation including providing item recommendations by ranking according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- a server e.g., server 13 shown in FIG. 2 and described above, and/or processing unit 14 or remote service 11 shown in FIG. 3 and described above
- the server may determine transition probabilities from acquired items to at least one candidate item according to items that have been previously acquired that are included in the empirical transition matrix data (e.g., the empirical transition matrix A described above).
- the server may accumulate the transition probabilities into scores at operation 144 , and may rank candidate items according to the scores.
- the ranked candidate items may be transmitted from the server to a user computer device (e.g., devices 10 , 11 as shown in FIG. 2 and described above). A user may select one of the ranked candidate items to acquire and/or purchase.
- the transmitted item recommendations may be the candidate items having the highest score for a predetermined number of items.
- the machine learning system 5 illustrated in FIG. 3 and discussed above may retrieve user item acquisition data for one or more geographic locations for learning.
- the retrieved item acquisition data may be used by the server to train a transition table and calculate prediction accuracy on, for example, empirical item transitions in a predetermined date range (e.g., a one month period, a three month period, a six month period, a one year period, and the like).
- a server may provide an expanded user experience for recommendations of items by identifying “significant” candidate transition pairs. That is, a significant candidate may be isolated by utilizing metadata attributes that are more restrictive. For example, when the item is a book, using author metadata may be more restrictive in isolating a candidate book.
- items e.g., a book
- the segment of the book item may be defined by author, publisher, subject, series set, title, language, availability locale, and the like. If a segment is greater than a predetermined value, the system can ignore the transition probability.
- h a predetermined value
- the segment may have 0.1M books.
- the transition probability due to “fiction” may be 1e ⁇ 5 , which may be determined as not being significant.
- Significant candidate transition pairs may be merged with candidates by overlap-segmentation and user transaction data.
- the metadata-based transition score may consider the transition probabilities contributed by common attributes (e.g., transition probabilities contributed by common attributes for two books), but may not take into account of the difference in the attributes themselves.
- common attributes e.g., transition probabilities contributed by common attributes for two books
- books A, B, and C may all have English as a primary language, but book B may have a secondary language as Chinese, and book C may have a secondary language of Spanish. That is, the scores for A->B and A->C should be different.
- the system disclosed herein may generate an improved transition score by considering both common attributes and different attributes with the following:
- B is a vector space representation of item attributes (e.g., book attributes)
- D is equal to diag(colSums(B))
- t is a transpose operator
- I is an identity matrix (e.g., a matrix with diagonal entries of ‘1’ and all other values being ‘0’)
- n is the number of items (e.g., books)
- m is the number of item segments (e.g., book segments)
- (n, m) dim(B).
- the item to be recommended may be a book.
- the server of the system may sequentially split books into segments according to the attributes until the maximum segment size is less than a threshold.
- the server of the system may define segments of the available books to recommend, where the segments may have overlap. For example, the server may define 1000 segments of books with overlap.
- the server may partition the books according to availability of books in a particular geographic or distribution region. For example, the server may partition the books according to their availability in the United States.
- the server may segment the partition of books available in the United States, for example, by subject, series name, language (e.g., English, Spanish, Korean, Italian, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Chinese, and the like), author, publisher, and the like.
- the server may split segments of a large predetermined size (e.g., segments having greater than 1000 entries, 5000 entries, 10,000 entries, or the like) by attributes sequentially.
- the server may merge segments of a small predetermined size (e.g., segments having less than 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 entries, or the like). That is, the server may form segments of books into a partition, where each book belongs to a segment size that is less that a predetermined segment size.
- the values may be zero, except for the segment book pairs.
- the entries in the metadata transition matrix M may be computing according to the follow equation:
- M ⁇ [ i , j ] ⁇ k ⁇ B ⁇ [ i , k ] ⁇ B ⁇ [ j , k ] D ⁇ [ k , k ] + 1 m ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ( 1 - B ⁇ [ i , k ] ) ⁇ ( 1 - B ⁇ [ j , k ] ) n - D ⁇ [ k , k ]
- B is a vector space representation of item attributes (e.g., book attributes)
- D is equal to diag(colSums(B))
- n is the number of items (e.g., books)
- m is the number of item segments (e.g., book segments)
- k is number of segments.
- FIG. 6 shows an example method 200 of providing recommendations to a user device to expand the recommendation experience according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- Operation 210 may be the same as operations 110 as shown in FIG. 4 and described above.
- a server may generate metadata transition matrix data according to a selected prior.
- any prior can be used, instead of the metadata transition matrix as described above in connection with FIG. 4 .
- a plurality of priors, each having its own weight, can be used in generating the transition probability matrix data. For example, an undirected variant of A may be selected as a prior. For each item transition from i to j, the entries of A[i,j] and A[j, i] may be added.
- the server may generate transition probability matrix data by multiplying the metadata transition matrix data with a weight parameter, adding the result to the empirical transition matrix data, and normalizing each row.

- the server may normalizing each row of the empirical transition matrix data directly when other data is unavailable in operation 320 . That is, when no other data, such as metadata, is available, the server may normalize each row of the empirical transition matrix directly.
- the server may provide item recommendations to a user computing device communicatively coupled to the server according to the normalized empirical matrix data at operation 330 .

Abstract
Description
- Many systems for providing recommendations utilize collaborative filtering, which is a process for filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple data points or sources. That is, recommendations are typically made according to user-based collaborative filtering, where items are recommended according to items purchased by similar users. Recommendations are also presently made by systems using item-based collaborative filtering (i.e., the cross-selling of items). Some present systems provide search-based collaborative filtering or content-based collaborative filtering.
- Present systems for recommending items are typically skewed, so that popular items are more frequently recommended. Moreover, present systems do not account for direction in item consumption, where, for example, users are more likely to consume item B after item A, but less likely to consume item A after item B.
- Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide systems and methods of improving revenue and expanding user experiences when recommending items for a user to acquire. In particular, some items and/or content may be acquired without cost, while acquiring other items and/or content may be incurred with cost. The embodiments of the disclosed subject matter allow for the promotion of items and/or content that do not have a cost to acquire, while also increasing revenue by promoting items of interest to a user that have a cost to acquire, so as to expand recommendation experiences to a user for items that may be of interest. As the acquisition of items may occur sequentially, the systems and methods of the disclosed subject matter provide recommendations which consider the sequential order of acquiring items so as to expand recommendation experiences to a user for items that may be of interest. That is, the systems and method of the disclosed subject matter consider directionality of acquiring items (e.g., users may be more likely to consume item B after item A, but less likely to consume item A after item B) in providing expanded recommendation experiences to a user.
- In embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a user's next acquisition of an item by a download, purchase, share, or viewing operation, may depend upon the user's previous acquisitions.

FIG. 7 shows an example method of providing recommendations to a user device to expand the recommendation experience according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. - Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may provide expanded user recommendation experiences for items by providing directional recommendations according to a user's previously acquired items, and minimizing skewing by merely recommending the most popular items. Because many items to be recommended may have a number of acquisitions that is less than a minimum threshold, traditional recommender systems may have increased difficulty in providing a recommendation for a second item after a first item with few acquisitions. That is, when a relatively small number of users have acquired a particular item, an automated recommendation system may have difficulty in accurately determining whether or when to recommend that item to other users, and/or when a particular recommendation is likely to result in an additional acquisition of the item by a new user. The systems and methods disclosed herein expand a recommendation experience for a user by identifying items to acquire that follow a user's previously acquired items. The embodiments of the disclosed subject matter allow for the promotion of items and/or content that do not have a cost to acquire, while also increasing revenue by promoting items of interest to a user that have a cost to acquire, so as to expand recommendation experiences to a user for items that may be of interest.
- The embodiments of the disclosed subject matter improve efficiency of recommendation systems such that relevancy of recommended items is increased by accounting for directionality in the acquisition of items. Recommended items can include, for example, physical and/or tangible goods, media data, information data, applications, and service providers. The embodiments of the disclosed subject matter may improve efficiency of recommendation systems by reducing the amount of skew (e.g., reduced quality of recommendations because of limited acquisition data) in providing recommendations of items.
- Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in and used with a variety of component and network architectures.

FIG. 4 shows anexample method 100 of providing recommendations for items to a user computing device to expand the recommendation experience according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. As disclosed herein, items may be any product and/or service that may be viewed, downloaded, purchased, shared, and/or acquired. For example, the systems and method disclosed herein may provide recommendations to acquired items that may be physical and/or tangible goods, media data, information data, applications, and service providers. Inoperation 110, a server, such asserver 13 illustrated inFIG. 2 , orprocessing unit 14 andanalysis system 5 illustrated inFIG. 3 , may generate empirical transition matrix data that includes row data for a first item and column data for a second item. Alternatively, empirical transition matrix data may be generated that includes column data for a first item and row data for a second item. It is noted, however, the operations discussed below would need to be transposed to maintain consistency with respect to row data and column data. The server may also generate an entry in the empirical transition matrix data for the number of users that acquire the second item after the first item. - For example, the server may generate an empirical (n+1)-by-(n+1) transition matrix (e.g., empirical transition matrix A) with row i for item i, column j for item j, and entry (i,j) for the number of users who acquire item j after item i, for 1, j in {1, 2, . . . , n}. For the (n+1)-th row of the empirical transition matrix, its j-th entry is the number of new users whose first acquisition is item j. The (n+1)-th column may be all 0. That is, in
operation 110, the server may form an un-normalized empirical transition matrix. - In
operation 120, the server may generate metadata transition matrix data by partitioning items for each item metadata type. For example, the server may set a uniform transition probability for all items in the partition, and may sum the uniform transition probabilities across all metadata types. - That is, in
operation 120, the server may generate a metadata (n+1)-by-(n+1) transition matrix (e.g., metadata transition matrix M) with row i for item i and column j for item j. For each item metadata type, the server may partition the items, and assume a uniform transition probability among all items within the partition. For example, if the item is a book, the book metadata types may include author, subject, and the like, and the server may assume a uniform transition probability among all books within the partition. For the author metadata type, the books may be partitioned by author, and the server may assume a uniform transition probability among all books within each partition. The server may generate the metadata transition matrix (M) by summing these probabilities across all metadata types. The (n+1)-th row and column of M is all 0. - The server may generate transition probability matrix data by multiplying the metadata transition matrix data (e.g., metadata transition matrix M) with a weight parameter (e.g., weight parameter w), adding the result to the empirical transition matrix data (e.g., empirical transition matrix A), and normalizing each row in
operation 130. The server may normalize each row by dividing entries in each row by the sum of each row. - For example, a matrix C may be calculated by the equation A+λ*M, where A is the empirical transition matrix, M is metadata transition matrix, and λ is a weight parameter. A transition probability matrix T may be generated by normalizing each row i of the matrix C by dividing its entries by its sum to yield the (n+1)-by-(n+1) transition probability matrix T with each entry in [0, 1] and each row sum is 1. By summing the metadata transition matrix M with the empirical transition matrix A, the server of the disclosed subject matter can improve results for items with few transactions. That is, the server may increase the user experience by providing increased relevant results with a reduced number of transactions. For example, for an item i with an empirical transition i->j and no other transitions should not yield 100% certainty of purchasing j. That is, the relevancy of the recommended items may be increased.
- Optionally, the computation of the metadata transition matrix M may be generalized as a prior. For example, the metadata transition matrix M can be generated according to a transition model on metadata, according to the transpose of the empirical transition matrix A, according to other data, or according to any suitable combination thereof.
- The relevancy of items recommended and the user experience may be expanded, as the systems and methods disclosed herein account for the directionality of item consumption, as opposed to typical recommendation systems using collaborative filtering.
- Generally, large-scale recommender systems for items may be skewed, such that a plurality of items in such systems may have few transactions (e.g., purchases, downloads, views, sharing events, and the like). With the system disclosed herein, recommendations for items may be provided for items, even when an item has few transactions. As disclosed herein, summing the metadata transition data with the empirical transition data can reduced the relative skew of recommended results.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, the server may assume an item transition is uniformly random within each item segment defined by item attributes. The server may generate a vector space representation, where V may be the vector of unique values of item attributes. For example, if the item is a book, the vector V of unique values of book attributes may include the subject, series name, text language, author, publisher, availability locale, title, and the like. In this example, Bij indicates whether the book-i has Vj, where B is a vector space representation of item attributes (e.g., book attributes). For example, book-i in a particular subject (e.g., political science/political process/general), may have Bij=1 for three Vj, with values of political science, political science/political process, and political science/political process/general. The Dim(B) is n-by-m, but B may be very sparse. The metadata transition matrix (M) may be determined with the following equation:
-
M=BD −1 B t - where D is equal to diag(colSums(B)), t is a transpose operator, I is an identity matrix (e.g., a matrix with diagonal entries of ‘1’ and all other values being ‘0’), n is the number of items (e.g., books), and m is the number of item segments (e.g., book segments).
- The server may provide item recommendations to a user computing device communicatively coupled to the server according to the generated transition probability matrix data (e.g., transition probability matrix T) at
operation 140. The output transition matrix T may be expressed as T=RowNormalize (A+λM), and then the top k probabilities for each row are output. The top probabilities output may be used to provide recommendations for items to the user computing device. - According to embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, the server may combine the generated transition probability matrix data (e.g., transition probability matrix 7) with user history data to provide the item recommendations. The user history data may include items that the user has acquired. For example, if the items that the user has acquired previously are books, the system may determine the transition probabilities to a given candidate book, and accumulate the probabilities (e.g., as weighted by acquisition time of the previously-acquired books) into a score. The server may rank the candidate books based on the scores. That is, the candidate books with the highest scores may be used by the server to provide recommendations to a user computing device.
- In embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, criteria for recommending the next item for consumption to a user may be relaxed. For example, the server may generate the transition probability matrix data according to next consumption data for a predetermined time window. The time window may be measured in minutes, hours, days, months, or the like, depending on the item. In embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, the server may generate the transition probability matrix data according to items acquired within the same time window. That is, the server may provide recommendations to a user computing device for an item according to the transition probability matrix data for items acquired at the same time and/or within the same time period (e.g., the same time window).
- Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter may relax a counting strategy with weights. For example, if a user acquires multiple instances of the item j after the item i is acquired, the user may be weighted by the number of instances. In case of multiple types of transactions in the same recommendation system, a server in the system may generate transition-count tables, weighted-sum the generated transition-count tables, and normalize by rows as disclosed herein into a transition probability matrix.
-
FIG. 5 shows an operation of the method illustrated inFIG. 4 , the operation including providing item recommendations by ranking according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. Atoperation 142, a server (e.g.,server 13 shown inFIG. 2 and described above, and/orprocessing unit 14 orremote service 11 shown inFIG. 3 and described above) may determine transition probabilities from acquired items to at least one candidate item according to items that have been previously acquired that are included in the empirical transition matrix data (e.g., the empirical transition matrix A described above). The server may accumulate the transition probabilities into scores atoperation 144, and may rank candidate items according to the scores. The ranked candidate items may be transmitted from the server to a user computer device (e.g.,devices FIG. 2 and described above). A user may select one of the ranked candidate items to acquire and/or purchase. The transmitted item recommendations may be the candidate items having the highest score for a predetermined number of items. - The
machine learning system 5 illustrated inFIG. 3 and discussed above may retrieve user item acquisition data for one or more geographic locations for learning. The retrieved item acquisition data may be used by the server to train a transition table and calculate prediction accuracy on, for example, empirical item transitions in a predetermined date range (e.g., a one month period, a three month period, a six month period, a one year period, and the like). - In embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a server may provide an expanded user experience for recommendations of items by identifying “significant” candidate transition pairs. That is, a significant candidate may be isolated by utilizing metadata attributes that are more restrictive. For example, when the item is a book, using author metadata may be more restrictive in isolating a candidate book. In a metadata mode, items (e.g., a book) may transit randomly within a segment. The segment of the book item may be defined by author, publisher, subject, series set, title, language, availability locale, and the like. If a segment is greater than a predetermined value, the system can ignore the transition probability. That is, in embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, significant transitions may come from segments with size being less than or equal to h, where h is a predetermined value (e.g., 100). Prediction accuracy may not change meaningfully when h is greater than 100, and thus h=100 may be used. For example, in a segment of books, where the segment is a subject and the subject is fiction, the segment may have 0.1M books. Thus, the transition probability due to “fiction” may be 1e−5, which may be determined as not being significant. Significant candidate transition pairs may be merged with candidates by overlap-segmentation and user transaction data.
- In some embodiments, the metadata-based transition score may consider the transition probabilities contributed by common attributes (e.g., transition probabilities contributed by common attributes for two books), but may not take into account of the difference in the attributes themselves. For example, books A, B, and C may all have English as a primary language, but book B may have a secondary language as Chinese, and book C may have a secondary language of Spanish. That is, the scores for A->B and A->C should be different. The system disclosed herein may generate an improved transition score by considering both common attributes and different attributes with the following:
-
M=BD −1 B t+(1/m)(1−B)(nI−D)−1(1−B)t - where B is a vector space representation of item attributes (e.g., book attributes), D is equal to diag(colSums(B)), t is a transpose operator, I is an identity matrix (e.g., a matrix with diagonal entries of ‘1’ and all other values being ‘0’), n is the number of items (e.g., books), m is the number of item segments (e.g., book segments), and where (n, m)=dim(B).
- In an example implementation of the system disclosed herein, the item to be recommended may be a book. Computing M, as described in detail above (e.g., where M=BD−1Bt), may be computationally expensive. In embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, the server of the system may sequentially split books into segments according to the attributes until the maximum segment size is less than a threshold. The server of the system may define segments of the available books to recommend, where the segments may have overlap. For example, the server may define 1000 segments of books with overlap. The server may partition the books according to availability of books in a particular geographic or distribution region. For example, the server may partition the books according to their availability in the United States. The server may segment the partition of books available in the United States, for example, by subject, series name, language (e.g., English, Spanish, Korean, Italian, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Chinese, and the like), author, publisher, and the like. The server may split segments of a large predetermined size (e.g., segments having greater than 1000 entries, 5000 entries, 10,000 entries, or the like) by attributes sequentially. The server may merge segments of a small predetermined size (e.g., segments having less than 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 entries, or the like). That is, the server may form segments of books into a partition, where each book belongs to a segment size that is less that a predetermined segment size. In the metadata transition matrix M, as described above, the values may be zero, except for the segment book pairs. The entries in the metadata transition matrix M may be computing according to the follow equation:
-
- where i and j are items, B is a vector space representation of item attributes (e.g., book attributes), D is equal to diag(colSums(B)), n is the number of items (e.g., books), m is the number of item segments (e.g., book segments), and k is number of segments.

FIG. 6 shows anexample method 200 of providing recommendations to a user device to expand the recommendation experience according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.Operation 210 may be the same asoperations 110 as shown inFIG. 4 and described above. Inoperation 220, a server may generate metadata transition matrix data according to a selected prior. In embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, any prior can be used, instead of the metadata transition matrix as described above in connection withFIG. 4 . A plurality of priors, each having its own weight, can be used in generating the transition probability matrix data. For example, an undirected variant of A may be selected as a prior. For each item transition from i to j, the entries of A[i,j] and A[j, i] may be added. Atoperation 230, the server may generate transition probability matrix data by multiplying the metadata transition matrix data with a weight parameter, adding the result to the empirical transition matrix data, and normalizing each row. Atoperation 240, the server may providing item recommendations to a user computing device according to the generated transition probability matrix data. -
FIG. 7 shows anexample method 300 of providing recommendations to a user device to expand the recommendation experience according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. Inoperation 310, a server generates an empirical transition matrix data that includes row data for a first item and column data for a second item, and an entry in the empirical transition matrix data for a number of users that acquire the second item after the first item. The server may normalizing each row of the empirical transition matrix data directly when other data is unavailable inoperation 320. That is, when no other data, such as metadata, is available, the server may normalize each row of the empirical transition matrix directly. The server may provide item recommendations to a user computing device communicatively coupled to the server according to the normalized empirical matrix data atoperation 330. - In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a system as disclosed herein.
- Various embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may include or be embodied in the form of computer-implemented processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes. Embodiments also may be embodied in the form of a computer program product having computer program code containing instructions embodied in non-transitory and/or tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, USB (universal serial bus) drives, or any other machine readable storage medium, such that when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. Embodiments also may be embodied in the form of computer program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into and/or executed by a computer, or transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, such that when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program code segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.
