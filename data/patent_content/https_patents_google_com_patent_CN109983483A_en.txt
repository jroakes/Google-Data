It obtains machine learning model and at least one performance indicator of needle device learning model can be assessed.Specifically, can relative to
The data being locally stored at user calculating equipment assess at least one performance indicator for machine learning model.User calculates
Equipment and/or server computing device can be based at least partially at least one performance indicator to determine whether to activate user's meter
Calculate the machine learning model in equipment.In another example, user calculating equipment can obtain multiple machine learning models, and
It can be assessed relative to the data being locally stored at user calculating equipment for each of multiple machine learning models
At least one performance indicator.User calculating equipment and/or server computing device can be based at least partially on performance indicator
To select at least one of machine learning model for using at user calculating equipment.For example, can choose has (one
Or multiple) model of optimal performance index is used to activate and use at user calculating equipment.
Therefore, present disclose provides the improved technologies for model management and assessment, and it makes use of existing local records
User data.For example, one or more models can be assessed before activation, if using determination that model is visible as user
Feature enabler, each this model will bring how many value.As this evaluation process as a result, the system of the disclosure can be done
Out about the wiser and specific machine learning model of the user decision for using and activating.In addition, due to user data sheet
Ground is stored at user calculating equipment, rather than is uploaded for being stored at central server, therefore enhance privacy of user, and
And reduce the data volume for needing to upload.In this way, the bandwidth and power requirement for data can be reduced.
More specifically, all aspects of this disclosure are based on the insight that traditional " centralized recording " and " not recording " conflicts
It is the dichotomy of mistake.On the contrary, user data can be locally recorded to storage device in equipment according to all aspects of this disclosure
(on-device storage).In this way, data and user coexist, to increase privacy of user.
Specifically, according to one aspect of the disclosure, in user calculating equipment (for example, the mobile meter of such as smart phone
Calculate equipment) on the application realized and/or operating system can provide and be written to the local of record entry (log entry) and set
Standby upper database (on-device database).In some implementations, (one or more) database can be or can not
It is that user is checkable.Record entry in database may or may not it is expired (for example, due to life span constraint,
Memory space constraint or other constraints).In addition, to can be or can not be user omissible for record entry
(expungable).Record to (one or more) database can logically be similar to the number to central server storage
According to the record in library, but record can be placed in the local storage without departing from the safety of equipment.
According to one aspect of the disclosure, when desired training pattern, by feature is personalized or parameter when, can will count
Calculation is sent to data, rather than opposite.According to this method, minimum information needed for only centralized collection executes specific action.
In some cases, individualized feature is provided using the data of local record and/or executes model training and/or manages possible
Lead to not centralized collection user data.Specifically, in some implementations, the application library and/or operation of user calculating equipment
System, which can provide, to be supported for, come operating analysis, uploading data for dividing without concentrating for local data base
Analysis uses.
As an example, in some implementations, it can be trained by user calculating equipment based on the data of local record

Model structure and training algorithm.User calculating equipment can be instructed to make using the entry in local data base (or its some subset)
For the training data for training algorithm.Hereafter, prediction can be transmitted using newly trained machine intelligence model immediately, this can
To be useful in any amount of scene.Alternatively, as will be discussed further below, instruction can be assessed before activation
Practice model.
In some implementations, machine learning model can pass to user's calculating and set through partially or even wholly pre-training
It is standby.For example, server computing device can be before sending user calculating equipment for model on the data top of centralized collection
Divide ground or fully trains the model.In some this realizations, user calculating equipment can be with further reference to local record number
According to library training pattern.In some cases, this additional local training can be considered as model personalization.
In some implementations, service can be passed back to by user calculating equipment about some information of the parameter of training pattern
Device calculates equipment.For example, the parameter information of return can be used to construct across population model (cross- in server computing device
population model)。
According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, user calculating equipment can be set relative to calculating in user
The data assessment that standby place is locally stored is directed at least one performance indicator of machine learning model.For example, performance indicator can be used for
If determining that new model is activated as user's visible features, how many value will be brought.One example performance indicator is correctly predicted
Average probability.Another exemplary energy index is the expected utility (expected utility) of model.For example, it is desirable to which effectiveness can

Or centralized recording.
As an example, user calculating equipment can based on machine learning model predict future customer behavior ability come
Assess machine learning model.Specifically, user calculating equipment can be used new after reception and/or training machine learning model
The new local data of record assesses at least one performance indicator of machine learning model.For example, the model can be used to be based on
New received data are predicted.In some implementations, prediction is not used in offer user characteristics or otherwise influences equipment
Or the performance of application, but be compared with new truthful data (ground truth data) to evaluate the correctness of prediction.
Alternately or in addition, user calculating equipment is referred to the local data assessment machine learning mould of precedence record
Type.Specifically, the historical data of the precedence record at user calculating equipment can be used to assess at least one in user calculating equipment
A performance indicator.Therefore, it is referred to the historical data previously collected and/or referring to the data assessment machine learning mould newly collected
Type.
According to another aspect of the present disclosure, user calculating equipment and/or server computing device can at least partly grounds
In at least one performance indicator come determine whether activate machine learning model.For example, if (one or more) performance indicator ratio
One or more performance threshold are advantageous, then model can be activated for using at user calculating equipment.In various implementations, it uses
Family, which calculates equipment, may determine whether that activation model or user calculating equipment can provide (one to server computing device
Or multiple) performance indicator, and server computing device may determine whether activation model.
According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, user calculating equipment can receive and/or train multiple machines

Device calculating equipment of being engaged in provides performance indicator, and server computing device can execute selection.
In order to provide particular example, server computing device can have trained three different machine learning models
(for example, based on the string having previously entered) prediction will be keyed into next word in text messaging application.However, machine
Learning model can be trained on different types of training data.For example, the first model can it is open can
It is trained on document (such as books)；Second model can be instructed on publicly available social media model
Practice；And third model can be trained on publicly available electronic mail conversation.Server computing device can be with
Three models are supplied to user calculating equipment.
Before activating any model, user calculating equipment can be relative to the data being locally stored in three models
Each assess at least one performance indicator.For example, the data being locally stored may include that user is input to text message receipts
The example of the precedence record of text in hair application and/or user are input to the new record of the text in text messaging application
Example.As an example, user calculating equipment can be determined for each model when in the example of the record of given text input
One a part when, the average probability of correctly predicted next word.
User calculating equipment and/or server computing device can be selected based on the performance indicator of assessment in three models
One.As an example, if it find that the model of training is with correctly predicted next on publicly available electronic mail conversation

Can be used for predicting can text messaging application on the user computing device be automatically performed emersion in feature (surface)
Next word.
It, can be before activation based on the data being locally stored come the model of individualized selection in further realize.
In further realize, if the execution of two or more models is advantageous relative to one or more threshold values, it can gather
Two or more models are closed to form single model, then activation (or personalized and activate) the single model.As showing
Example can polymerize two or more models favorably executed relative to one or more threshold values according to weighted average, wherein
The weight for being respectively applied to each of two or more models is to be directed to the respective performances index of this model evaluation
Function (for example, the model more advantageously executed can receive increased weight).
According to the another aspect of the disclosure, the finger inquired based on typical polymerization can also be calculated referring to the data of local record
Mark.Contribution of each user to overall objective can be calculated on the user computing device.In some cases, these every users are poly-
Conjunction (per-user aggregate) is sufficiently small and is gone privacy, allows them to be passed to central server and is used for
Further across user polymerization is without exposure sensitive data.In other cases, in order to enhance privacy of user, difference privacy is available
In introducing noise into during every user polymerize every user polymerization to be transmitted to before central server is used for across user polymerization.
In some implementations, before across the user polymerization that will be obtained is transmitted to central server, encryption skill can be used
Art safely combines every user's polymerization across multiple users.In other cases, in order to further enhance privacy of user, by result
It is transmitted to before central server, across user polymerization that difference privacy can be used for during encrypting polymerization process to computations adds
Plus noise.
According to another aspect of the present disclosure, it can be calculated by the complete stream of some form of data not being maintained at user
Privacy of user is further enhanced in equipment.For example, in some implementations, the abstracts of the data of local record rather than number of users
It can store on the user computing device according to itself.As an example, abstract can be standard polymerization measurement, such as maximum value, most
Small value, average value, histogram counts etc..As another example, abstract can be the machine learning mould from streaming data training
Type.
As another example, can be stored in a manner of secret protection by using general private (pan-private) technology and
Update abstract itself.It is, for example, possible to use general private technologies to inject noise into stream transmission algorithm to realize in the algorithm
The difference privacy reassurances of portion's state and its output.
According to the another aspect of the disclosure, in some implementations, the local data base or local data of user calculating equipment
The abstract version in library can store in an encrypted form.In some implementations, the abstract version of local data base or local data base
It only can be via privilege software (for example, with task in the operating system of special permit operation) or privileged hardware (for example, credible
