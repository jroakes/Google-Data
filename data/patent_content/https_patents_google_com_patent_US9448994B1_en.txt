- the voice action system 130 includes a front-end 132 , a grammar engine 134 , and an action engine 136 .
- the voice action system 130 may identify a resource that is associated with an action.
- An action may be the act of offering a particular service to a user (e.g., a web site that offers table reservations).
- the voice action system 130 may collect anchors in other resources that point to the identified resource, extract the respective anchor text, and generate action initiation grammar associated with the action based on the anchor text.
- the action initiation grammar may include a set of one or more terms associated with the action to be performed by the voice action system 130 or the client device 110 .
- anchor text is the text associated with, and displayed for, the anchor in a resource.
- An anchor typically links to a destination resource as specified by an anchor tag of the anchor.
- Anchor text is the text surrounded by anchor tags, and generally includes natural language describing the destination on the link defined by the anchor tags.
- an anchor can be represented by the following code:
- the text “URL_of Destination_Resource” is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the destination resource
- the text “Make a reservation” is the anchor text for the anchor.
- the voice action system 130 may receive a command, referred to by this specification as a “voice command,” a “command,” or a “query,” from the client device 110 over the network 120 .
- the voice system 130 identifies an action based on the grammar of the command.
- the voice action system 130 may initiate the action or subsequent interactions with the client device 110 over the network 120 .
- the voice action system 130 may send a response to the client device 110 over the network 120 , and the client device 110 may initiate the action or subsequent interactions based on the response.
- the grammar engine 134 identifies anchor text associated with an action from resources stored at the index database 142 .
- the grammar engine 134 may then analyze the anchor text and generate one or more action initiation grammars associated with the action. Once the action initiation grammars have been generated, the grammar engine 134 may store the action initiation grammars at the action initiation grammar database 146 .
- the action engine 136 receives requests from the front-end 132 , and determines corresponding actions to be performed based on the received requests. In some implementations, the action engine 136 determines the action to be performed based on action initiation grammars stored at the action initiation grammar database 146 .

- second resources 204 , 206 , and 208 include anchors 222 , 226 , and 232 , respectively, where the anchors 222 , 226 , and 232 link the second resources 204 , 206 , and 208 to the first resource 202 .
- the anchors 222 , 226 , and 232 include anchor text 224 , 228 , and 234 , respectively.
- an anchor may include anchor text that is easily identifiable to be associated with an action.
- the anchor text 224 “Reserve a table at Bob's Pizza” is clearly associated with the action of making a restaurant reservation.
- an anchor may include anchor text that is not easily identifiable to be associated with an action. For example, when a system analyzes the anchor text 228 “We can squeeze you in at Mario's,” the system may associate the anchor text 228 with an action of squeezing, not the action of making a restaurant reservation.
- an anchor may include anchor text that is not relevant with an action.

- a user of the client device 250 sends a command 248 to the voice action system 240 via the network.
- the command 248 is a voice command stating “Can you squeeze my family in at Dan's Burger on Friday?”
- the command 248 may be processed by a voice-recognition program on the client device 250 before transmitting to the voice action system 240 .
- the command 248 may be in an audio format while being transmitted to the voice action system 240 .

- the action engine 244 sends the command 248 to the action initiation grammar database 246 for a match.
- the action engine 244 may revise, or normalize, the command 248 before sending the revised command to the action initiation grammar database 246 .
- the action engine 244 determines that the terms “squeeze in at” in the command 248 matches a grammar associated with making a restaurant reservation stored at the action initiation grammar database 246 . Based on the grammar, the action engine 244 may also determine that the terms “Dan's burger” in the command 248 is an argument associated with the action. In some implementations, the action engine 244 may further determine that the terms “my family” and “Friday” in the command 248 are contextual arguments associated with the action.
- the action engine 244 may initiate the particular action for the client device 250 .
- the action engine 244 may complete the restaurant reservation for the user's family at Dan's Burger at an available time slot on Friday.
- the action engine 244 may generate a response identifying the particular action, and send the response to the client device 250 for the client device 250 to initiate the particular action of making a restaurant reservation.
- the action engine 244 may generate a response to be sent to the client device 250 to collect additional information from the user. For example, there may be multiple time slots available at Dan's Burger on Friday, and the action engine 244 may generate a response specifying that (i) the action is associated with making a restaurant reservation, and (ii) more information is required to complete the reservation.
- the voice action system 240 sends a response to the client device 250 .
- the response may include an indication of whether the command has been satisfied by the voice action system 240 .
- the response may include instructions for the client device 250 to perform the particular action.
- the client device 250 processes the response, and outputs the response to the user.
- the client device 250 outputs through a speaker a message “Making a reservation for four at Dan's Burger on Friday!” indicating a restaurant reservation has been completed.
- the client device 250 may output the message through a display of the client device 250 .
- FIG. 2C is an example block diagram 200 of how to process anchor text and arguments.
- the process 200 will be described as being performed by a computer system comprising one or more computers, for example, the grammar engine 244 as shown in FIG. 2B .
- the block diagram 200 includes a raw anchor text table 252 , a processed anchor text table 254 , and an argument table 256 .
- the anchor text database 247 stores the raw anchor text table 252
- the action initiation grammar database 246 stores the processed anchor text table 254 and the argument table 256 .
- the format of data as shown in the tables 252 , 254 , 256 is for the purpose of illustration. In some implementations, the format of data stored at the anchor text database 247 and the action initiation grammar database 246 is different from the format as shown in tables 252 , 254 , and 256.
- the data in the raw anchor text table 252 represents anchor text extracted from anchors of resources.
- the raw anchor text table 252 stores all anchor text where the corresponding anchors point to the first resource 202 .
- the anchor text database 247 stores multiple raw anchor text tables, where each raw anchor text table corresponds to a different resource associated with a respective action.
- the raw anchor text table 252 includes anchor text 224 , 228 , 234 , as well as other anchor text that has been added by the grammar engine 244 .
- the grammar engine 244 by using the set of phrases stored at the raw anchor text table 252 , generates an action initiation grammar that is associated with the particular action. In some implementations, the grammar engine 244 generates the action initiation grammar by identifying a frequency of occurrence of a particular phrase of the set, and generating the action initiation grammar based on the identified frequency of occurrence of the particular phrase. In some implementations, the grammar engine 244 normalizes the anchor text before identifying the frequency of occurrence of a particular phrase. The grammar engine 244 may normalize the anchor text by removing one or more terms from the anchor text, substituting a term in the anchor text by a substituted term, reordering the terms in the anchor text, or adding one or more terms to the anchor text. For example, the grammar engine 244 may normalize the anchor text 228 as “Squeeze in at ⁇ business name>.”
- the grammar engine 244 may normalize the anchor text in the raw anchor text table 252 , and then determines that the counts associated with normalized phrases “Make a reservation at ⁇ business name>,” “Squeeze in at ⁇ business name>,” “Reserve a table at ⁇ business name>,” and “Click here” are 3, 2, 2, and 4, respectively.
- the grammar engine 244 may determine that the normalized phrases “Make a reservation at ⁇ business name>,” “Squeeze in at ⁇ business name>,” and “Reserve a table at ⁇ business name>” are action initiation grammars associated with the action of making a restaurant reservation, and subsequently add these normalized phrases and the corresponding frequency counts to the processed anchor text table 254 .
- the grammar engine 244 may determine that the normalized phrase “Click here” is not associated with the action of making a restaurant reservation, and as the result the grammar engine 244 would not add this normalized phrase to the processed anchor text table 254 .
- the grammar engine 244 may identify one or more terms in the anchor text as arguments associated with the action initiation grammar. For example, the grammar engine 244 may identify that the terms “Bob's Pizza,” “Mario's” and “ABC” are arguments for making a restaurant reservation, and not a part of the action initiation grammar. Subsequently, the grammar engine 244 may add these arguments to the argument table 256 .
- FIG. 3A is a flow chart 300 illustrating an example process for identifying anchor text to generate action initiation grammar.
- the process 300 analyzes a set of anchor texts that are linked to a resource associated with an action, and generates grammar associated with the action from the set.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a computer system comprising one or more computers, for example, the grammar engine 134 as shown in FIG. 1 .

- the system generates the action initiation grammar by identifying a frequency of occurrence of a particular phrase of the set, and generating the action initiation grammar based on the identified frequency of occurrence of the particular phrase.
- the system subsequently may add the generated action initiation grammar to an action initiation grammar database.
- the system may determine that certain anchor texts (e.g., “Go to this web page”) are not associated with the particular action. The system would not add these anchor texts to the action initiation grammar database.
- FIG. 3B is a flow chart 300 illustrating an example process for generating action initiation grammar based on normalized anchor text.
- the system adds the identified anchor text to a set of phrases used for generating an action initiation grammar associated with the particular action ( 308 ).
- the system then normalizes the set of phrases ( 310 ).
- the system may normalize the anchor text by removing one or more terms from the anchor text, substituting a term in the anchor text by a substituted term, reordering the terms in the anchor text, or adding one or more terms to the anchor text. For example, the system may normalize the anchor text “We can squeeze you in at Mario's” to “Squeeze in at ⁇ business name>.”
- system then generates the action initiation grammar based on the normalized phrases ( 312 ).
- the system may determine that certain normalized phrases are action initiation grammars associated with the particular action, and subsequently add these normalized phrases to the action initiation grammar database.
- the system may determine that certain normalized phrases (e.g., “Click here”) are not associated with the particular action. The system would not add these normalized phrases to the action initiation grammar database.
- FIG. 3C is a flow chart 300 illustrating an example process for identifying anchor text to generate arguments associated with action initiation grammar.
- the system adds the identified anchor text to a set of phrases used for generating an action initiation grammar associated with the particular action ( 308 ).
- the system generates the action initiation grammar ( 332 ).
- the system generates the action initiation grammar by identifying a frequency of occurrence of a particular phrase of the set, and generating the action initiation grammar based on the identified frequency of occurrence of the particular phrase.
- the system normalizes the anchor text before identifying the frequency of occurrence of a particular phrase.
- the system then identifies an argument associated with the action initiation grammar ( 334 ). The system may then add the identified argument to the action initiation grammar database for subsequent commands.
- implementations of the systems and techniques described here may be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.
- ASICs application specific integrated circuits
- These various implementations may include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- the systems and techniques described here may be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user may provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- a keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices may be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user may be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- the systems and techniques described here may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user may interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet the global information network
- the computing system may include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
