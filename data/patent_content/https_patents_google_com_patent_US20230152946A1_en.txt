- the disclosure is related to searching of content displayed in a webpage through a capture of at least a portion of the webpage content.
- an area of the webpage can be selected (e.g., selected using a gesture and/or an input device) and the selected region can be searched in response to the selection of the region.
- the search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, or in a search result area of another browser, so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while the search results are displayed.
- At least one of the search results can be selected, and content associated with selected search result can be displayed.
- the content associated with the search results can replace content of the webpage within the browser.
- the content associated with the search results can be displayed within another browser.
- the search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed.
- the browser can be referred to as a browser window when associated with a window of an operating system (OS
- a technical problem associated with content in a webpage is that the content may not be readily selected and/or may not be immediately processed for searching.
- the content within the webpage can be consumed by a user and/or links within the webpage can be accessed, but the content itself may not be readily searched using a search engine.
- text within the webpage can be copied and pasted into a search engine, but this process may require multiple manual steps, time, storage resources, and/or so forth.
- Another technical problem associated with content in a webpage is that even after content to be searched within the webpage is identified, the content within the webpage may not be maintained during a search unless a separate browser, tab, or application is used.
- content within a webpage can be copied for searching, and the webpage can be replaced with a search engine interface or a separate browser or tab can be used to search the content.
- At least one technical solution to the technical problems described above is that an area of a webpage within a browser can be selected. Also, the selected region can be searched in response to the selection of the region (e.g., with little or no manual intervention). The search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser in a separate display area while the search results are displayed.
- At least one technical effect of this technical solution is that the original webpage content is not lost while the search results are consumed by a user.
- Search results within a search result area and webpage content within a display area can be simultaneously displayed within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser).
- the proposed solution allows for making search results available to a user in a separate area of the browser so that the user may interact with the search result, e.g., for having content presented associated with the search results, while at the same time still and simultaneously allowing interaction of the user with the webpage and in particular the selected region which was used for triggering the search query.
- a search result area can be integrated as part of the browser so that the search result area may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by a third party or the owner of the webpage content.
- This can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate (e.g., authentic) search results provided by a search query from search results that may not be legitimate can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage.
- the technical problem of spoofing search results can be obviated by the technical solution of integrating a search result area within the browser as described above.
- the technical effect of integration of a search result area within a browser is that spoofing can be prevented.
- search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) in a search result area even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed.
- the content associated with the search results can be displayed within a navigation area simultaneously within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser) with the search result area.
- the browsers described herein can be executed within a computing device.
- the browsers can be executed within a laptop device.
- the browsers can be executed within a mobile device.

- an interaction e.g., a user interaction
- FIG. 1 C where the webpage W 2 is rendered within the browser 110 (e.g., within the same browser).
- the navigation area 240 of the browser 210 does not replace the display area 125 of the browser 110 (as shown in FIG. 1 C ) and instead is opened in the browser 210 . Accordingly, the content of the webpage W 1 can be maintained within the display area 125 in the browser 110 alongside the search result area 130 .
- the search results S 1 in the search result area 130 are maintained in browser 110 .

- the search results S 1 within the search result area 330 can be navigated within the navigation area 340 in substantially the same way as described above in connection with at least FIG. 1 B . Accordingly, the search result area 330 and the navigation area 340 of the browser 310 do not replace (or reduce the area of) the display area 120 of the browser 110 (including webpage W 1 ). Accordingly, the content of the webpage W 1 can be maintained within the display area 120 in the browser 110 without a search result area.
- the search result area 330 is generated within a new browser-browser 310 .
- the search results S 1 in the search result area 330 can be maintained in browser 310 .
- the search results S 1 can be maintained within the search result area 330 within the browser 310 even while navigating within the navigation area 340 of the browser 310 . Accordingly, the original webpage W 1 can be maintained within browser 110 , while further navigation can occur in browser 310 while also maintaining the search result area 330 in browser 310 .
- a browser window where search results are rendered can be referred to as a search result browser window.
- the browser 310 can be the search result browser window.

- Content of the tab 112 - 1 e.g., existing tab, main tab
- FIG. 4 B illustrates the display area 120 similar to what is shown in at least FIG. 1 A .
- search results S 1 are rendered within a search result area 130 of the tab 112 - 2 (e.g., a new tab, auxiliary tab) of the browser 110 as shown in FIG. 4 A .
- a copy I 2 ′ of the portion of the content I 2 is illustrated in the search result area 130 . Accordingly, the search result area 130 of the tab 112 - 2 of the browser 110 does not replace (or reduce the area of) the display area 120 of the tab 112 - 1 of the browser 110 (including webpage W 1 ).
- the search results S 1 within the search result area 130 of the tab 112 - 2 of the browser 110 can be navigated within the navigation area 140 in substantially the same way as described above in connection with at least FIG. 1 B . Accordingly, the search result area 130 and the navigation area 140 of the tab 112 - 2 of the browser 110 do not replace (or reduce the area of) the display area 120 of the tab 112 - 1 of the browser 110 (including webpage W 1 ). Accordingly, the content of the webpage W 1 can be maintained within the display area 120 in the tab 112 - 1 of the browser 110 without a search result area.
- navigation of search results S 1 can be rendered within an existing tab (rather than a new tab). Content in the existing tab can be replaced in some implementations.

- a tab where search results are rendered can be referred to as a search result tab (e.g., as shown in FIG. 4 A ).
- a tab where navigation occurs can be referred to as a navigation tab.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein.
- the address bar area 114 of the browser 110 and the search result area 130 are merged into one contiguous area (e.g., continuous area).
- This contiguous area e.g., combined address bar area 114 and search result area 130
- This implementation shown and described in connection with FIG. 5 can be combined with any of the implementations described above, for example, in connection with FIGS. 1 A through 4 B (and other figures below (e.g., FIG. 6 B )).

- FIG. 5 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a security feature
- FIG. 5 can be a transition from FIG. 1 A
- the browser search area 135 can be implemented in FIGS. 1 B and 1 C .
- the browser search area 135 can be implemented in at least FIGS. 2 , 3 , 4 A, 6 B, 9 , 11 A, 11 B , and so forth.
- the search result area 130 can be integrated as part of the browser 110 (e.g., address bar area 114 ) as the browser search area 135 so that the search result area 130 may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by, for example, a third party or the owner of the content of the webpage W 1 (not shown) and/or the webpage W 2 content. Because the search result area 130 is part of the application of the browser 110 , the integration of the search result area 130 would be difficult to imitate. No clear separation (e.g., no separate line (e.g., line 131 shown in FIG. 1 B is eliminated)) exists between the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 .
- any background or theme applied to the address bar area 114 would flow into (and would be contiguous with) the search result area 130 (as illustrated by the gray area).
- the contiguous background would be difficult for a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W 1 ) to imitate within an application of the browser 110 .
- the browser search area 135 can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage.
- a contiguous background across the entirety of the browser search area 135 can be an indicator of control of the entire browser search area 135 by the browser 110 . If the entire browser search area 135 were not contiguous (e.g., if there were breaks or discontinuities in the background theme, image, and/or so forth), this would be an indication that the entirety of the browser search area 135 and/or the content included therein, were not controlled by the browser 110 and/or may not be authentic.
- the content that is rendered in the navigation area 140 can be attributed to (e.g., controlled by, produced by) content producer of the webpage W 2 (after navigation to the webpage W 2 is triggered via the search results S 1 ).
- the content rendered within the browser search area 135 can be attributed to (e.g., controlled by, produced by) the browser 110 .
- the content in the webpage W 2 can be independently controlled by the content owner of the webpage W 2 and separate from the browser 110 .
- the content within the browser search area 135 (and specifically the search results S 1 ) can be independently controlled by (and produced by) the browser 110 and separate from the webpage W 2 .
- a content producer of the webpage W 2 may not produce or modify the search results S 1 .
- the combining of the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 can be an indicator of the authenticity of the content in the search result area 130 .
- the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 are combined, it signifies that the browser 110 (or provider of the browser 110 ) is providing the search results S 1 in the search result area 130 .
- a separating line is present (e.g., line 131 shown in FIG. 1 B )
- results in the area of the search result area 130 may be provided by an untrusted provider (e.g., a third party).
- the navigation area 140 is shown as being adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof).
- the display area 125 (as shown in FIG. 1 B , for example) can be included in the browser 110 adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof).
- FIGS. 6 A and 6 B illustrate a search query triggered based on a selection of an area SA 2 that spans multiple elements (e.g., at least two elements or images) within the webpage W 1 .
- the concepts associated with FIGS. 6 A and 6 B can be combined with any of the features described above in connection with FIGS. 1 A through 5 (or any of the figures described after FIGS. 6 A and 6 B ).
- the selection area SA 2 spans at least portions of the images I 1 and I 2 . Accordingly, an image capture associated with the selection area SA 2 includes portions of the images I 1 and I 2 as well as portions of the webpage W 1 around the images I 1 and I 2 .
- the image capture of the area SA 2 can be used to trigger a search query as described above, and can result in search results S 1 (which can be persistent as described above).
- a search server (not shown) can be configured to receive the area SA 2 .
- the search server can be configured to trigger a search primarily on the area I 2 ′ corresponding with image I 2 .
- the search server can be configured to discard areas that should not be searched (e.g., the area between images I 1 and I 2 ).
- the search server can apply one or more criteria to determine that the area I 2 ′ should be searched.
- the criteria can include, but is not limited to, an area of image I 2 being greater than an area of image I 1 , the search results of image I 2 being more robust (or complete) than the search results of image I 1 , and/or so forth.
- the search results of image I 2 can be more robust (or complete) than the search results of image I 1 if there are more search results associated with image I 2 than image I 1 .
- the search results of image I 2 can be more robust (or complete) than the search results of image I 1 if there are more confident search results (e.g., search result hits have a higher confidence score) associated with image I 2 than image I 1 .
- multiple different search queries can be triggered in response to an area such as area SA 2 that spans multiple areas of interest (e.g., multiple areas that could be independently searched).
- a search server can be configured to conduct a first search query based on the portion of image I 1 included in area SA 2 and conduct a second search query based on the portion of image I 2 included in area SA 2 .
- This type of multiple search triggering can be useful when navigating, for example, a shopping website. If the webpage W 1 is a shopping website, the images I 1 and I 2 can be associated with different products. Searches of the multiple products can be triggered with a single selection of area SA 2 .
- search results from multiple searches that are triggered by a single area can be presented in various ways.
- search results from multiple searches that are triggered by a single area can be rendered in the search result area 130 .
- the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different search result areas within the tab 112 of the browser 110 . For example, search results from a first search can be associated with a first search result area and search results from a second search can be associated with a second search result area.
- the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different tabs. For example, search results from a first search can be associated with a first tab and search results from a second search can be associated with a second tab.
- the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different windows.
- search results from a first search can be associated with (e.g., triggered to be rendered within and/or launch) a first browser window and search results from a second search can be associated with (e.g., triggered to be rendered within and/or launch) a second browser window.
- the search results associated with the first browser window and the search results associated within the second browser window can be rendered within search result areas within the respective first and second browser windows.

- the search results associated with the first tab and the search results associated within the second tab can be rendered within search result areas within the respective first and second tabs.
- One or more of the search result areas of the respective first and second tabs of the browser can be persistent search result areas as described above in connection with FIGS. 1 A through 5 .
- the search results from multiple searches can be associated with (e.g., stored as) different bookmarks.
- search results from a first search can be associated with a first bookmark (that can be later accessed) and search results from a second search can be associated with a second bookmark (that can be later accessed).

- A web browser can be used to display content that is searched via a search engine. Content can be displayed within the web browser in response to selection of one or more of the search results by a user.
- The disclosure is related to searching of content displayed in a webpage through a capture of at least a portion of the webpage content. Specifically, an area of the webpage can be selected (e.g., selected using a gesture and/or an input device) and the selected region can be searched in response to the selection of the region. The search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, or in a search result area of another browser, so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while the search results are displayed. At least one of the search results can be selected, and content associated with selected search result can be displayed. In some implementations, the content associated with the search results can replace content of the webpage within the browser. In some implementations, the content associated with the search results can be displayed within another browser. The search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed.
- In one general aspect, a method can include causing display of a webpage within a display area of a browser, and causing display of a search area indicator associated with an area of the webpage. The method can include receiving a selection of the search area indicator. In response to the selection of the search area indicator being received the method can include defining an image corresponding to the area, and triggering a search query based on the image. The method can include receiving a search result in response to the search query, and causing display of the search result in a search result area outside of the display area where the search result area is within the browser.

FIG. 12 shows an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device, which may be used with the techniques described herein. - The disclosure is related to searching of content displayed in a webpage through a capture of at least a portion of the webpage content. Specifically, an area of the webpage can be selected (e.g., selected using a gesture and/or an input device) and the selected region can be searched in response to the selection of the region. The search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, or in a search result area of another browser, so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while the search results are displayed. At least one of the search results can be selected, and content associated with selected search result can be displayed. In some implementations, the content associated with the search results can replace content of the webpage within the browser. In some implementations, the content associated with the search results can be displayed within another browser. The search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed. The browser can be referred to as a browser window when associated with a window of an operating system (OS).
- A technical problem associated with content in a webpage is that the content may not be readily selected and/or may not be immediately processed for searching. The content within the webpage can be consumed by a user and/or links within the webpage can be accessed, but the content itself may not be readily searched using a search engine. For example, text within the webpage can be copied and pasted into a search engine, but this process may require multiple manual steps, time, storage resources, and/or so forth.
- Another technical problem associated with content in a webpage, is that even after content to be searched within the webpage is identified, the content within the webpage may not be maintained during a search unless a separate browser, tab, or application is used. For example, content within a webpage can be copied for searching, and the webpage can be replaced with a search engine interface or a separate browser or tab can be used to search the content.
- At least one technical solution to the technical problems described above is that an area of a webpage within a browser can be selected. Also, the selected region can be searched in response to the selection of the region (e.g., with little or no manual intervention). The search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser in a separate display area while the search results are displayed.
- At least one technical effect of this technical solution is that the original webpage content is not lost while the search results are consumed by a user. Search results within a search result area and webpage content within a display area can be simultaneously displayed within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser). Accordingly, the proposed solution allows for making search results available to a user in a separate area of the browser so that the user may interact with the search result, e.g., for having content presented associated with the search results, while at the same time still and simultaneously allowing interaction of the user with the webpage and in particular the selected region which was used for triggering the search query.
- In some implementations, a search result area can be integrated as part of the browser so that the search result area may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by a third party or the owner of the webpage content. This can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate (e.g., authentic) search results provided by a search query from search results that may not be legitimate can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage. Accordingly, the technical problem of spoofing search results can be obviated by the technical solution of integrating a search result area within the browser as described above. The technical effect of integration of a search result area within a browser is that spoofing can be prevented.
- As mentioned above, in some implementations, search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) in a search result area even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed. The content associated with the search results can be displayed within a navigation area simultaneously within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser) with the search result area. Accordingly, the technical problem of being unable to simultaneously navigate content associated with search results while viewing the search results in a search result area is solved by the technical solution and technical effect described above.
- The browsers described herein can be executed within a computing device. For example, the browsers can be executed within a laptop device. In some implementations, the browsers can be executed within a mobile device.
-
FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams that illustrate search of content I2 displayed in a webpage W1 through capture of a selection of an area SA of at least a portion of the content I2 within the webpage W1. The webpage W1 is displayed (e.g., rendered) within adisplay area 120 within atab 112 of abrowser 110. In response to the selection (illustrated with dashed lines) of the area SA of the webpage W1, a search query is triggered of the portion of the content I2. Accordingly, the search query is triggered without, or with very little manual intervention from a user. Specifically, in response to the selection of the area SA of the webpage W1 being completed, the search query is triggered without manual intervention. Additional steps (e.g., saving information, entering a search query, interacting with a user interface such as another browser to launch a search) to trigger the search query are eliminated. - For example, a user can select the area SA using an input device such as a mouse or touchpad (e.g., not shown), a search query is triggered of the portion of the content I2. Accordingly, the search query is triggered without, or with very little manual intervention from a user other than selection of the area SA. Additional input other than the selection may not be needed to trigger the search query.
- In response to the search query being completed, search results S1 are rendered within a
search result area 130 of thetab 112 of thebrowser 110 as shown inFIG. 1B . A copy I2′ of the portion of the content I2 is illustrated in thesearch result area 130. The correspondence between the area I2 and the copy I2′ is illustrated with a dashed arrow. In some implementations, the copy I2′ of the portion of the content I2 is not shown in thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the copy I2′ of the portion of the content I2 is scaled to a different size (e.g., smaller size) than the original area SA. - The search results S1 can be rendered within the
search result area 130 in response to the search query being triggered without, or with very little manual intervention from a user (other than selection of the search area SA). In some implementations, in response to the selection of the area SA of the webpage W1 being completed, the search query and rendering of the search results S1 within thesearch result area 130 are triggered without manual intervention. Additional steps (e.g., saving information, entering a search query, interacting with a user interface such as another browser to launch a search) to trigger the search query and rendering of the search results S1 within thesearch result area 130 can be eliminated. - The search results S1 can be search results (e.g., rank-ordered search results) that include, and/or are linked, to content associated with the area SA (e.g., the copy I2′ of the area SA). In some implementations, the search results S1 can include text or can be represented by text. In some implementations, the search results S1 can include images. In some implementations, the search results S1 can include images associated with text. In some implementations, the search results S1 can include links to content (e.g., images, webpages, etc.) associated with the area SA. In some implementations, the search results S1 can be prioritized so that the most relevant search results (or a subset thereof) are rendered within the
search result area 130. In some implementations, the search results S1 can be prioritized so that the most relevant search results (or a subset thereof) are rendered toward a top of thesearch result area 130. - In some implementations, the search of the area SA can be an image search. The area SA that is selected can be captured as an image (e.g., a collection of pixels associated with or representing the image). Accordingly, a search engine (not shown) at, for example, a search server (not shown) can receive the captured image of the area SA and can conduct a search based on the captured image. A search query by the search engine can include, or can be based on, the captured image. In some implementations, the captured image can be, for example, an image in a bitmap format. In some implementations, the captured image can be, for example, a screen capture of the area SA.
- The search of area SA can be a search used to identify various objects such as landmarks, products, wildlife, logos, brands, and/or so forth. The search of area SA can be a search used to identify objects similar to those captured in the area SA. In some implementations, text can be identified and/or searched from the area SA. In some implementations, text in the area SA can be translated into another language. In some implementations, the text represented in a language different from the original language of the original text.
- As shown in at least
FIG. 1A , content I1, I2, and T1 are rendered within the webpage W1. In some implementations, the content I1, I2 and/or T1 can be images, text, and/or so forth rendered within the webpage W1. The content I1, I2, and/or T1 can be provided by the provider of the webpage W1 or provided by another provider into the webpage W1. - In some implementations, a search query by the search engine can include, or can be based on, a captured image of a dynamic element (e.g., a video, a moving series of elements, an object in motion) being rendered with the webpage W1. Accordingly, a search can be conducted on a portion of (e.g., a screen capture of) a video or other dynamic element being rendered within, for example, the webpage W1.
- In some implementations, the selection of the area SA can be performed in response to an input device (not shown). For example, the selection of the area SA can be triggered in response to an input device such as a touchpad device, a keyboard, a mouse input device, controller, and/or so forth. In some implementations, the selection of the area SA can be performed in response to a gesture (e.g., a gesture triggered via touchpad device, a hand gesture, a gesture performed using an input device, etc.).
- In this implementation, the area SA does not correspond exactly with an area of the content I2. In some implementations, the area SA can be smaller than the area of the content I2. In some implementations, the area SA can be larger than the area of the content I2. More details regarding selection of areas across multiple elements is described in connection with at least
FIGS. 6A and 6B . - As shown in
FIGS. 1A and 1B , the browser includes anaddress bar area 114. An address of the webpage W1 can be illustrated in the address bar area 114 (e.g., input address area 113). Other controls, icons, and/or so forth can be included in theaddress bar area 114. Theaddress bar area 114 can be controlled by and/or associated with the browser 110 (e.g., the browser application). Theaddress bar area 114 can be controlled by thebrowser 110 instead of the webpage W1 and/or a provider of the webpage W1. - As shown in
FIG. 1B , thesearch result area 130 is separated from theaddress bar area 114 by aline 131. In some implementations, theline 131 can be eliminated (e.g., omitted), in any of the implementations described herein, for security purposes. This is a line that a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W1) may not remove (e.g., paint over, scrub out). This is a line that is controlled (e.g., provided by, eliminated by) the provider of the browser 110 (e.g., browser application). More details regarding this security feature are described below in connection with at leastFIG. 5 . - As shown in
FIG. 1B , in response to thesearch result area 130 being rendered in response to the search query, the size (e.g., an area) of thedisplay area 120 is decreased to a size of thedisplay area 125. In other words, thedisplay area 120 is resized (e.g., decreased in size) in response to thesearch result area 130 being displayed. The webpage W1 can be modified (e.g., scaled) in layout to fit (e.g., fit for display) into thedisplay area 125. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 shown inFIG. 1A can be divided into thedisplay area 125 and thesearch result area 130 as shown inFIG. 1B . The combined areas of thedisplay area 125 and thesearch result area 130 as shown inFIG. 1B can be the same as the area of the display area 120 (e.g., original display area of the browser 110) shown inFIG. 1A . In some implementations, the combined areas of thedisplay area 125 and thesearch result area 130 can be different from (e.g., smaller than, larger than) the area of thedisplay area 120. Thedisplay area 120 is resized to displayarea 125 such that thesearch area 130 is disposed within an area allocated, prior to the receiving the selection of the area (e.g., search area S1), to the display area 120 (e.g., entire display area 120). - Although not shown in
FIG. 1B , the location of thesearch result area 130 can be different than shown inFIG. 1B . For example, thesearch result area 130 can be smaller in size. In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can be included along a different side of the browser 110 (e.g., along a bottom portion, along a top portion, along the left side, and/or so forth). In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can float above (e.g., can be rendered in a window above, can be rendered in a window above that moves independent of the browser 110) thedisplay area 120 so that thedisplay area 120 inFIG. 1A is not decreased in size to the area of thedisplay area 125 shown inFIG. 1B . In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can be a different shape (e.g., a circular shape) rather than a square or rectangular shape. - In some implementations, after the
search result area 130 has been rendered with the search results S1 as shown in at leastFIG. 1B , an additional search query can be triggered using thesearch result area 130. For example, a search result within thesearch result area 130 can be selected and used to trigger a rendering of one or more images and/or text associated with the search result selected from thesearch result area 130. - In some implementations, after the
search result area 130 has been rendered with the search results S1 as shown in at leastFIG. 1B , an additional search query can be triggered using the browser 110 (e.g., the display area 125). In some implementations, the additional search query can include selection of an additional area within thedisplay area 125 of the webpage W1 other than the search area SA. In some implementations, the additional search query can be a text-based search query that modifies (e.g., further refines, filters) the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. The additional search query can be an image-based search query that modifies (e.g., further refines, filters) the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. In other words, the additional search query can modify the search results S1 to further prioritize the search results S1, filter the search results S1, and/or so forth. - In some implementations, although not shown, the search results S1 can be bookmarked or associated with a bookmark of the
browser 110. In some implementations, each of the search results can be bookmarked or associated with a bookmark of thebrowser 110. In some implementations only a finite number of (or only a portion of) the search results (e.g., top 5) may be bookmarked. - In some implementations, although not shown, the search results S1 (or a prioritized subset thereof) can be associated with a tab group (e.g., a set of tabs within the
browser 110 that are related manually, based on content, and/or so forth). For example, a first search result from the search results S1 can be associated with a first tab (not shown), and a second search result although not shown, can be associated with a second tab (not shown). The first search result and the second search result can be associated with a tab group (e.g., a group of tags that are associated with a single name). In some implementations only a finite number of the search results (e.g., top 5) may be associated with a tab and/or associated with a tab group. - Further to the implementation shown in
FIGS. 1A and 1B , in some implementations, a new web address (in place of a web address for the webpage W1) can be input intoinput address area 113 of theaddress bar area 114 after thesearch result area 130 is defined. In response to the new web address area, a different webpage (not shown) (or other content) can replace the webpage W1 in thedisplay area 125, while maintaining the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. In other words, the search results S1 can be maintained even while navigating within thedisplay area 125 using theaddress bar area 114 of thebrowser 110. - In some implementations, a user interface element (e.g., a back button, a back arrow) can be used to remove (e.g., clear, navigate away from) the search results S1 in the
search result area 130. In some implementations, the user interface element can be used to remove (e.g., clear) the search results S1 and/or thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the user interface element can be used to navigate away from (e.g., backward from) the webpage W1, the search results S1 and/or thesearch result area 130. -
FIG. 1C illustrates content of a webpage W2 rendered in anavigation area 140 within thetab 112 of thebrowser 110 shown inFIG. 1A . The content of the webpage W2 is rendered in thenavigation area 140 in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. Thenavigation area 140, in this implementation, replaces (e.g., changes) thedisplay area 125. The webpage W2 displayed in thenavigation area 140, in this implementation, replaces the webpage W1 displayed in thedisplay area 125. - The
navigation area 140 can be used to consume (e.g., explore) the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. For example, in response to a first search result being selected from the search results S1, first content can be rendered in thenavigation area 140. In response to a second search result being selected from the search results S1, second content can be rendered in thenavigation area 140 instead of, or in addition to, the first content. The content can be navigated while the search results S1 are maintained within thesearch result area 130. - Further to the implementation shown in
FIG. 1C , in some implementations, a new web address can be input intoinput address area 113 of theaddress bar area 114 after thesearch result area 130 and thenavigation area 140 are defined. In response to the new web address area, a different webpage (not shown) can replace the webpage W2 (or other content) in thenavigation area 140, while maintaining the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. In other words, the search results S1 can be maintained even while navigating within thenavigation area 140 using theaddress bar area 114 of thebrowser 110. - In some implementations, a user interface element (e.g., a back button, a back arrow) can be used to remove (e.g., clear, navigate away from) content rendered in the navigation area 140 (e.g., the webpage W2). In some implementations, the user interface element can be used to remove (e.g., clear) the search results S1,
search result area 130, and/or thenavigation area 140. In some implementations, the user interface element can be used to navigate away from (e.g., backward from) the webpage W2, the search results S1 and/or thesearch result area 130. - Although discussed in the context of a webpage W2, in some implementations, the content rendered in the
navigation area 140 may not be a webpage. In some implementations, the content displayed in thenavigation area 140 may not be a webpage and/or may not be associated with a webpage. In some implementations, the content displayed in thenavigation area 140 can be in an image, a link, a video, text, and/or so forth. - In some implementations, an interaction can include a selection. In some implementations, an interaction and/or selection (or an indication thereof) can be used to trigger an action or result.

FIG. 2 illustrates content of a webpage W2 rendered in anavigation area 240 within atab 212 of a browser 210 (e.g., browser window) separate from the browser 110 (e.g., browser window).FIG. 2 is a variation of the implementations described in connection withFIGS. 1A through 1C . Accordingly, the description ofFIGS. 1A through 1C and the variations described therein, can be applied toFIG. 2 . Specifically,FIG. 1C corresponds with thebrowser 110 state shown in the left ofFIG. 2 . - In this implementation, the content of the webpage W2 is rendered in the
navigation area 240 of the browser 210 (which is a separate browser frombrowser 110 and can be referred to as an additional browser) in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130 of thebrowser 110. This is in contrast toFIG. 1C where the webpage W2 is rendered within the browser 110 (e.g., within the same browser). Thenavigation area 240 of thebrowser 210 does not replace thedisplay area 125 of the browser 110 (as shown inFIG. 1C ) and instead is opened in thebrowser 210. Accordingly, the content of the webpage W1 can be maintained within thedisplay area 125 in thebrowser 110 alongside thesearch result area 130. - Also, in response to the webpage W2 (or other content) being rendered in the
navigation area 240 of thebrowser 210, the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130 are maintained inbrowser 110. In other words, the search results S1 can be maintained even while navigating within thenavigation area 240 of thebrowser 210. -
FIG. 3 illustrates asearch result area 330 and anavigation area 340 rendered within atab 312 of a browser 310 (e.g., browser window) separate from the browser 110 (e.g., browser window). In response to the search query being completed, search results S1 are rendered within asearch result area 330 of thetab 312 of thebrowser 310 as shown inFIG. 3 . A copy I2′ of the portion of the content I2 is illustrated in thesearch result area 330. Accordingly, thesearch result area 330 of thebrowser 310 does not replace (or reduce the area of) thedisplay area 120 of the browser 110 (including webpage W1). - The search results S1 within the
search result area 330 can be navigated within thenavigation area 340 in substantially the same way as described above in connection with at leastFIG. 1B . Accordingly, thesearch result area 330 and thenavigation area 340 of thebrowser 310 do not replace (or reduce the area of) thedisplay area 120 of the browser 110 (including webpage W1). Accordingly, the content of the webpage W1 can be maintained within thedisplay area 120 in thebrowser 110 without a search result area. - As shown in
FIG. 3 , thesearch result area 330 is generated within a new browser-browser 310. The search results S1 in thesearch result area 330 can be maintained inbrowser 310. The search results S1 can be maintained within thesearch result area 330 within thebrowser 310 even while navigating within thenavigation area 340 of thebrowser 310. Accordingly, the original webpage W1 can be maintained withinbrowser 110, while further navigation can occur inbrowser 310 while also maintaining thesearch result area 330 inbrowser 310. - In some implementations, a browser window where search results are rendered can be referred to as a search result browser window. In this case, the
browser 310 can be the search result browser window. In some implementations, a browser window where navigation occurs can be referred to as a navigation browser window. In this case, thebrowser 310 can be the navigation browser window. In some implementations, a browser window including the original webpage W1 can be referred to as a main browser window. In this case, thebrowser 110 can be the main browser window. Accordingly, as shown inFIG. 3 , thebrowser 310 can be the search result browser window and the navigation browser window, and thebrowser 110 can be the main browser window. -
FIG. 4A illustrates thesearch result area 130 and thenavigation area 140 rendered within a tab 112-2 of thebrowser 110 separate from a tab 112-1 (not shown inFIG. 4A ) where thedisplay area 120 is rendered. Content of the tab 112-1 (e.g., existing tab, main tab) is shown inFIG. 4B .FIG. 4B illustrates thedisplay area 120 similar to what is shown in at leastFIG. 1A . - In response to a search query being completed, search results S1 are rendered within a
search result area 130 of the tab 112-2 (e.g., a new tab, auxiliary tab) of thebrowser 110 as shown inFIG. 4A . A copy I2′ of the portion of the content I2 is illustrated in thesearch result area 130. Accordingly, thesearch result area 130 of the tab 112-2 of thebrowser 110 does not replace (or reduce the area of) thedisplay area 120 of the tab 112-1 of the browser 110 (including webpage W1). - The search results S1 within the
search result area 130 of the tab 112-2 of thebrowser 110 can be navigated within thenavigation area 140 in substantially the same way as described above in connection with at leastFIG. 1B . Accordingly, thesearch result area 130 and thenavigation area 140 of the tab 112-2 of thebrowser 110 do not replace (or reduce the area of) thedisplay area 120 of the tab 112-1 of the browser 110 (including webpage W1). Accordingly, the content of the webpage W1 can be maintained within thedisplay area 120 in the tab 112-1 of thebrowser 110 without a search result area. - In some implementations, navigation of search results S1 can be rendered within an existing tab (rather than a new tab). Content in the existing tab can be replaced in some implementations. In some implementations, a new tab can be opened for navigation of each search result from the search results S2 being selected.
- In some implementations, a tab where search results are rendered can be referred to as a search result tab (e.g., as shown in
FIG. 4A ). In some implementations, a tab where navigation occurs can be referred to as a navigation tab. -
FIG. 5 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein. As shown inFIG. 5 , theaddress bar area 114 of thebrowser 110 and thesearch result area 130 are merged into one contiguous area (e.g., continuous area). This contiguous area (e.g., combinedaddress bar area 114 and search result area 130) can be referred to as abrowser search area 135. This is illustrated by the gray color that is contiguous between theaddress bar area 114 and thesearch result area 130. This implementation shown and described in connection withFIG. 5 can be combined with any of the implementations described above, for example, in connection withFIGS. 1A through 4B (and other figures below (e.g.,FIG. 6B )). Specifically, as an example,FIG. 5 can be a transition fromFIG. 1A , and thebrowser search area 135 can be implemented inFIGS. 1B and 1C . Similarly, thebrowser search area 135 can be implemented in at leastFIGS. 2, 3, 4A, 6B, 9, 11A, 11B , and so forth. - The
search result area 130 can be integrated as part of the browser 110 (e.g., address bar area 114) as thebrowser search area 135 so that thesearch result area 130 may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by, for example, a third party or the owner of the content of the webpage W1 (not shown) and/or the webpage W2 content. Because thesearch result area 130 is part of the application of thebrowser 110, the integration of thesearch result area 130 would be difficult to imitate. No clear separation (e.g., no separate line (e.g.,line 131 shown inFIG. 1B is eliminated)) exists between thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114. Any background or theme applied to theaddress bar area 114 would flow into (and would be contiguous with) the search result area 130 (as illustrated by the gray area). The contiguous background would be difficult for a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W1) to imitate within an application of thebrowser 110. Moreover, thebrowser search area 135 can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage. - A contiguous background across the entirety of the browser search area 135 (including the search result area 130) can be an indicator of control of the entire
browser search area 135 by thebrowser 110. If the entirebrowser search area 135 were not contiguous (e.g., if there were breaks or discontinuities in the background theme, image, and/or so forth), this would be an indication that the entirety of thebrowser search area 135 and/or the content included therein, were not controlled by thebrowser 110 and/or may not be authentic. - Described another way, the content that is rendered in the
navigation area 140 can be attributed to (e.g., controlled by, produced by) content producer of the webpage W2 (after navigation to the webpage W2 is triggered via the search results S1). The content rendered within thebrowser search area 135 can be attributed to (e.g., controlled by, produced by) thebrowser 110. The content in the webpage W2 can be independently controlled by the content owner of the webpage W2 and separate from thebrowser 110. The content within the browser search area 135 (and specifically the search results S1) can be independently controlled by (and produced by) thebrowser 110 and separate from the webpage W2. A content producer of the webpage W2 may not produce or modify the search results S1. - The combining of the
search result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114 can be an indicator of the authenticity of the content in thesearch result area 130. When thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114 are combined, it signifies that the browser 110 (or provider of the browser 110) is providing the search results S1 in thesearch result area 130. When a separating line is present (e.g.,line 131 shown inFIG. 1B ), results in the area of thesearch result area 130 may be provided by an untrusted provider (e.g., a third party). - In
FIG. 5 , thenavigation area 140 is shown as being adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof). In some implementations, the display area 125 (as shown inFIG. 1B , for example) can be included in thebrowser 110 adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof). -
FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate a search query triggered based on a selection of an area SA2 that spans multiple elements (e.g., at least two elements or images) within the webpage W1. The concepts associated withFIGS. 6A and 6B can be combined with any of the features described above in connection withFIGS. 1A through 5 (or any of the figures described afterFIGS. 6A and 6B ). - In this example implementation, the selection area SA2 spans at least portions of the images I1 and I2. Accordingly, an image capture associated with the selection area SA2 includes portions of the images I1 and I2 as well as portions of the webpage W1 around the images I1 and I2. The image capture of the area SA2 can be used to trigger a search query as described above, and can result in search results S1 (which can be persistent as described above).
- Because the area SA2 spans multiple areas of interest (e.g., images, text areas), disambiguation may be needed before triggering (e.g., conducting) a search. For example, a search server (not shown) can be configured to receive the area SA2. The search server can be configured to trigger a search primarily on the area I2′ corresponding with image I2. The search server can be configured to discard areas that should not be searched (e.g., the area between images I1 and I2). The search server can apply one or more criteria to determine that the area I2′ should be searched. The criteria can include, but is not limited to, an area of image I2 being greater than an area of image I1, the search results of image I2 being more robust (or complete) than the search results of image I1, and/or so forth. As a specific example, the search results of image I2 can be more robust (or complete) than the search results of image I1 if there are more search results associated with image I2 than image I1. As another specific example, the search results of image I2 can be more robust (or complete) than the search results of image I1 if there are more confident search results (e.g., search result hits have a higher confidence score) associated with image I2 than image I1.
- In some implementations, multiple different search queries can be triggered in response to an area such as area SA2 that spans multiple areas of interest (e.g., multiple areas that could be independently searched). For example, a search server can be configured to conduct a first search query based on the portion of image I1 included in area SA2 and conduct a second search query based on the portion of image I2 included in area SA2.
- This type of multiple search triggering can be useful when navigating, for example, a shopping website. If the webpage W1 is a shopping website, the images I1 and I2 can be associated with different products. Searches of the multiple products can be triggered with a single selection of area SA2.
- In some implementations, search results from multiple searches that are triggered by a single area (e.g., area SA2) can be presented in various ways. In some implementations, search results from multiple searches that are triggered by a single area (e.g., area SA2) can be rendered in the
search result area 130. Although not shown, in some implementations, the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different search result areas within thetab 112 of thebrowser 110. For example, search results from a first search can be associated with a first search result area and search results from a second search can be associated with a second search result area. - In some implementations, the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different tabs. For example, search results from a first search can be associated with a first tab and search results from a second search can be associated with a second tab.
- In some implementations, the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different windows. For example, search results from a first search can be associated with (e.g., triggered to be rendered within and/or launch) a first browser window and search results from a second search can be associated with (e.g., triggered to be rendered within and/or launch) a second browser window. The search results associated with the first browser window and the search results associated within the second browser window can be rendered within search result areas within the respective first and second browser windows. One or more of the search result areas of the respective first and second browser windows can be persistent search result areas as described above in connection with at least
FIGS. 1A through 5 (or in connection with any of the figures afterFIG. 5 ). - In some implementations, the search results from multiple searches can be associated with different tabs within a single browser window. For example, search results from a first search can be associated with (e.g., triggered to be rendered within and/or launch) a first tab and search results from a second search can be associated with (e.g., triggered to be rendered within and/or launch) a second tab. The search results associated with the first tab and the search results associated within the second tab can be rendered within search result areas within the respective first and second tabs. One or more of the search result areas of the respective first and second tabs of the browser can be persistent search result areas as described above in connection with
FIGS. 1A through 5 . - In some implementations, the search results from multiple searches can be associated with (e.g., stored as) different bookmarks. For example, search results from a first search can be associated with a first bookmark (that can be later accessed) and search results from a second search can be associated with a second bookmark (that can be later accessed).

FIG. 7 illustrates a system 700 including acomputing system 702 and asearch server 740 configured for implementing the concepts and various implementations shown and described herein. As shown inFIG. 7 , thecomputing system 702 is configured to communicate with thesearch server 740 and/or a webpage provider 710 (e.g., a web server) via anetwork 750. Thecomputing system 702 includes at least abrowser manager 720 and aselection manager 730. In some implementations, thebrowser manager 720 is configured to manage content, such as webpage content, provided by the webpage provider 710 (e.g., also can be referred to as a web server). In some implementations, thebrowser manager 720 is configured to operate as one of several application(s) 728 executed via an operating system (O/S) 729. Thebrowser manager 720 can be configured to implement the key portions of the user interface, search results, windows, and/or so forth, as described in connection with the implementations described herein. - As shown in
FIG. 7 , thecomputing system 702 includes several hardware components including acommunication module 761, one ormore cameras 762, amemory 763, a central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) 764, one ormore input devices 767, and one ormore output devices 768. The hardware components can be used to facilitate operation of thebrowser manager 720, theselection manager 730, and/or so forth of thecomputing system 702. - The
browser manager 720 includes a user interface (UI)generator 721 configured to generate and/or manage the various user interface elements of a browser such asbrowser 110 as shown and described herein. For example, theUI generator 721 can generate UI elements including the various windows in thebrowser 110 such as thedisplay area 120, thesearch result area 130, and/or thenavigation area 140 shown in at leastFIGS. 1A through 1C (and other figures). - The
browser manager 720 includes atab manager 722 configured to generate and/or manage the various tabs of a browser such asbrowser 110 as shown and described herein. For example, thetab manager 722 can generate the tabs in thebrowser 110 such as the tabs 112-1, 112-2 shown in at leastFIG. 4A (and other figures). - The
browser manager 720 includes asearch result manager 723 configured to generate and/or manage content rendering such as search results S1 in the search result area 130 (shown in at leastFIG. 1B and other figures). Thebrowser manager 720 includes adisplay area manager 724 configured to generate and/or manage content rendering associated with a webpage W1 in thedisplay areas 120, 125 (shown inFIG. 1B and other figures). The webpage W1 content can be provided to thecomputing system 702 by thewebpage provider 710. Thebrowser manager 720 includes anavigation manager 725 configured to generate and/or manage content rendering associated with the navigation areas 140 (shown in at leastFIG. 1C and other figures). - As shown in
FIG. 7 , session data 727 (which can be stored in memory 763 (not shown)) can be managed as, or by, one of theapplications 728. Thesession data 727 can include data related to one or more browser sessions. Theapplication information 726 can include information related to the various applications operating within and/or that can be executed by the O/S 729. - The
selection manager 730 can be configured to manage one or more elements selected for searching. The information from theselection manager 730 can be communicated to thesearch server 740 to trigger one or more search queries. Theselection manager 730 includes anarea detector 732 that can detect one or more areas (e.g., search area SA shown inFIG. 1B and other figures) selected for searching. Theselection manager 730 also includes acapture manager 731 that can manage communication of content captured within one or more areas detected by thearea detector 732. Selection of one or more areas for searching can be triggered by one or more input devices 767 (e.g., a mouse, a gesture, etc.) and can be communicated to the selection manager 730 (and area detector 732). - As shown in
FIG. 7 , the communication module 244 can be configured to facilitate communication with thewebpage provider 710 and/orsearch server 740 via thenetwork 750 via one or more communication protocols. Thecamera 762 can be used for capturing one or more images, thememory 763 can be used for storing information associated with thebrowser manager 720 and/orselection manager 730, the CPU/GPU 764 can be used for processing information and/or images associated with thebrowser manager 720 and/orselection manager 730. Thecomputing system 702 also includes one ormore output devices 768 such as communication ports, speakers, displays, and/or so forth. The functionality described in this application can be implemented based on one ormore policies 765 and/orpreferences 766 stored in thememory 763. -
FIG. 7 illustrates some aspects of thesearch server 740. For example, thesearch server 740 includes one ormore processors 746 and one ormore memory devices 748. Thesearch server 740 includes animage receiver 744 configured to receive one or more images from thecomputing system 702 that can be used to trigger a search query that can be executed at thesearch server 740. The one or more images can correspond with, for example, a search area (e.g., search area SA shown in at leastFIG. 1A and in other figures). Thesearch server 740 includes asearch disambiguator 742 configured to determine a specific area to be searched when multiple areas (e.g., multiple images) that could be searched are sent to thesearch server 740. For example, thesearch disambiguator 742 can be used to resolve search queries covering multiple images such as the situation described in connection withFIGS. 6A and 6B . Thesearch disambiguator 742 can be configured to implement the algorithms described in connection withFIGS. 6A and 6B . -
FIG. 8 is a flowchart that illustrates a method of performing at least some of the concepts described herein in the various figures. Many elements of the flowchart can be implemented by the components shown in at leastFIG. 7 . - The method includes causing display of a webpage within a display area of a browser (block 802). The webpage can be displayed as shown in, for example, the
display area 120 of thebrowser 110 ofFIG. 1A . The displaying of the webpage can be triggered by, for example, thedisplay area manager 724 shown inFIG. 7 . - The method includes receiving a selection of an area of the webpage (block 804). An example of selection of an area is shown as selection of search area SA of image I2 shown in
FIG. 1B . The selection of the area of the webpage can be managed by theselection manager 730 shown inFIG. 7 . - The method includes defining an image corresponding to the area (block 808) and triggering a search query based on the image (block 810), both in response to the selection of the area being received (block 806). For example, this process is depicted at least as an example in
FIG. 1B . The search query can be triggered by the search area SA shown inFIG. 1B . The image corresponding to the area can be defined by thecapture manager 731 of theselection manager 730 shown inFIG. 7 . The image for searching can be sent by theselection manager 730 to thesearch server 740 shown inFIG. 7 . Theimage receiver 744 can receive the image and the search query can be executed at thesearch server 740 shown inFIG. 7 . - The method includes receiving a search result in response to the search query (block 812). For example, the search result S1 can be received by the
browser 110 shown inFIG. 1A . The search result can be sent from thesearch server 740 to thecomputing system 702 via thenetwork 750. Receipt and processing of the search results can be handled by thesearch result manager 723 of thebrowser manager 720. - The method includes causing display of the search result in a search result area outside of the display area, the search result area being within the browser (block 814). As shown in
FIG. 1B , the search results S1 are rendered in thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, rendering of search results can be managed by thesearch result manager 723 of thebrowser manager 720. Further navigation, in a navigation area (e.g.,navigation area 140 shown in, for example,FIG. 1C ), of search results triggered by interaction with the search results can be managed by thenavigation manager 725 of thebrowser manager 720 shown inFIG. 7 . -
FIG. 9 illustrates an implementation where history related to search queries are shared between devices. The diagram inFIG. 9 is based on at least the implementation described in connection withFIGS. 1A through 1C . The implementation ofFIG. 9 can be applied to any of the implementations described herein. The search history may be shared when permission has been granted by an owner of an account associated with the search history. - In this implementation, the
browser 110 is displayed within adisplay 974 of acomputing device 970. At least a portion of a search history related to the search area SA (or another search area) can be stored in amemory 972 of thecomputing device 970. In some implementations, the search history can be stored in response to a search query being triggered by the search area SA selection. In some implementations, the search history can be the search results S1 (or a representation of the search results S1) shown inFIG. 9 and in other figures such asFIG. 1A . At least a portion of search history can be shared with a server 980 (e.g.,search server 740 shown inFIG. 7 ) and/or acompanion device 990 based on permission granted via thecomputing device 970. - At least a portion of the search history can be shared with the
server 980 from thecomputing device 970. At least a portion of the search history can be stored in amemory 982 of theserver 980.

FIG. 10 is a diagram that illustrates indicators of areas that can be selected for a search query. An indicator of an area that can be searched can be referred to as a search area indicator. The search area indicators can be applied to any of the implementations described herein. The search area indicators can be produced and rendered for a user so that a user can be guided to and/or alerted to areas that can be selected to trigger a search query. In some implementations, the search area indicators can be rendered and/or managed by thedisplay area manager 724. - The search area indicators, in this implementation, are illustrated as sets of circles overlayed over one or more portion of the webpage W1 and/or one or more portion of the objects I1, I2, T1 included in the webpage W1. The sets of circles are grouped as illustrated by the dashed lines of search area indicators G1 through G5. In some implementations, one or more of the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be different than shown in
FIG. 10 . One or more of the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be a different type of affordance, icon, and/or so forth. - In some implementations, the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be surfaced for areas that are high probability for searching. The probability of searching can be based on historical data related to the content on the webpage W1. The probability of searching can be based on historical data collected from many users (using anonymized data) who accessed the webpage W1 or a webpage similar to webpage W1.
- In some implementations, the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be surfaced for areas that are not already linked within the webpage W1. For example, one or more of the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be associated with an image, text, and/or so forth embedded within the webpage W1. In some implementations, one or more of the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be associated with text that can be translated.
- In some implementations, one or more of the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be surfaced based on an initial analysis of the webpage W1 without contacting a search server. For example, one or more of the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be defined in response to a local search performed on a computing device rendering the webpage W1.
- In some implementations, one or more the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be associated with a shoppable object (e.g., an object associated with commerce). In some implementations, one or more the search area indicators G1 through G5 can be associated with an object that is publicly available.
- In some implementations, search area indicators G1 through G5 can be illustrated in response to a webpage W1 being loaded. After at least one of search area indicators G1 through G5 is selected, the search area associated with the search area indicator can be searched. In other words, a search query can be triggered in response to the search area indicator being triggered (search query can be triggered as shown in, for example,
FIG. 1B ). As a specific example, the search area indicator G2 associated with image I2 can be selected (instead of selection of the search area SA as shown and described inFIG. 1A ). The selection of the search area indicator G2 associated with image I2 can result in searching of at least a portion of the image I2 (e.g., search area SA) as shown inFIG. 1B . - In some implementations, the search area indicators indicating areas that can be searched may be shown in response to a user interface for searching being activated.
FIG. 11A illustrates activation of a search input area 136 (e.g., activated by a user) that can be used to define (e.g., trigger a search query). Thesearch input area 136 can include a text and/or image input area (not shown) where a user can input, for example, text and/or images to trigger searching (e.g., one or more search queries) by a search server. In response to thesearch input area 136 being activated, search area indicators G1 through G5 are triggered (e.g., rendered) as shown inFIG. 11B . -
