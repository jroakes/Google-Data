Embodiment
In the following description, discontinuous transmission and/or receive the expression communication equipment and need not being that decoded information for its appointment keeps activating, and can suspend for the nonactivated cycle and can wake up for the cycle of activating by effective means.Communication network seldom has this chance, but for discontinuous transmission and the receiver meeting of consulting and arrange to be used for communication equipment, communication network is played an important role.
Embodiments of the invention can be combined in the communication media of sharing in the set of communication devices and use.For example, the shared channel in the communication system can use embodiments of the invention, and wherein, other channel adopts different allocative decisions.As second example, can be with all Information Transmission Design in the communication system for operating according to embodiments of the invention.
Fig. 1 illustrate can use the embodiment of the invention communication system 100 as example.Communication system 100 comprises a plurality of transceiver network element 110a, 110b and 110c, and in some communication system, these transceiver network element can be called as base station or access point.Each base station can comprise one or more sectors, and each sector forms communication cell.Communication system 100 may further include controller network element 120, and controller network element 120 is responsible for the control transmission resource.As an alternative, in transceiver network element 110, can realize described controlled function in distributed mode.Described communication system may further include router one 30, and router one 30 is responsible for the packet switching transmitting function.Router one 30 typically provides the access to other router and packet data network.
Communication equipment 101 is communicated by letter with communication system 100 in the following manner: receive by one or the information that sends more than one transceiver network element 110 and with information and send to described communication system.One or more transceiver network element 110 can receive and handle the signal that communication equipment 101 is sent.One or more communication equipments 101 also can the received communication system the signal that sent of transceiver 110.
Embodiments of the invention are not provided with the multiplex technique that uses in the communication system 100 or any real needs of modulation technique.Communication system 100 can adopt the combination of any appropriate of multiplex technique.Term in specification " transfer resource " refers to any sets of transmission resources that can be divided between set of communication devices.For example, can use frequency division technique and/or time division technique and/or sign indicating number branch technology to come multiplexing communication equipment 101.Communication equipment can frequency division technique or the arbitrary collection of time division technique or sign indicating number branch technology or these technical combinations.Can also use nonopiate multiplexingly, wherein, a plurality of users share identical orthogonal transmission resource, for example empty branch technology or dirty paper code (dirty paper coding) technology.Communication system 100 can adopt with communication system 100 in any modulation technique of employed multiplex technique compatibility, comprise multi-carrier modulation.
In an embodiment of the present invention, use a series of sets of transmission resources to come transmission information.Sets of transmission resources can be the data block on synthetic (superframe), the time slot in the frame or the code element set or the shared medium of for example radio frame, frame.Distribution of transmission resource in sets of transmission resources is defined by the assignment information related with described sets of transmission resources.This assignment information is commonly called allocation table, below in conjunction with second embodiment assignment information is being called allocation table.The assignment information of sets of transmission resources comprises the identifier that is associated with the communication equipment that transfer resource is assigned in described set at least.By monitoring described assignment information, communication equipment can determine whether sets of transmission resources is included as the resource that described communication equipment distributes.Typically, assignment information also comprises indication which of sets of transmission resources is partly distributed to the communication equipment of indicating in the described assignment information.Perhaps, for example, based on the order of the identifier in the described assignment information, described information can imply.For example, if come the allocation of transmission resources set with the piecemeal of giving sizing, then the order of described identifier defines the resource allocation of sets of transmission resources clearly.Assignment information can further comprise each other details, the order and the size of institute for example discussed below Resources allocation.Sets of transmission resources can be assigned to single communication equipment, and perhaps, sets of transmission resources can be assigned with in the middle of a plurality of communication equipments.
Should be understood that as the replacement related with single communication equipment, the identifier in the allocation table can with the communication equipment group associations.Group allocation allows once for the common indication of resource allocation more than one communication equipment.Described communication equipment group is provided identical group allocation rule, and the identical assignment information and identical sets of transmission resources of the communications device monitors of this group.Communication equipment can have the allocation rule related with its unique identifier and/or with the related group allocation rule of group identifier.Possible, especially make progress at downlink side, the transfer resource related with group allocation identifier is shared by this group; In other words, all communication equipments of described group all receive identical information.Perhaps, (for example, when distribution group is set), the described communication equipment that can notify described group dividually Resources allocation how in the middle of described communication equipment group, the distribution of described resource is circulated a notice of by group identifier.Described group allocation identifier is favourable for the transmission of a small amount of rare data for example, and described a small amount of rare data are similarly calibrated described communication equipment group easily.Such example can be to pay or personalization message for the data broadcast of the similar data of groups of users, personalized group message, customized information.
Should be understood that an assignment information related with set of downlink transmission resources can stipulate the only distribution of described set of downlink transmission resources.
Should be understood that an assignment information related with set of uplink transmission resources can stipulate the only distribution of described set of uplink transmission resources.
Perhaps, related with a set of downlink transmission resources assignment information can be stipulated the distribution of described set of downlink transmission resources and the distribution of set of uplink transmission resources.If the distribution of uplink transmission resource and downlink transmission resources is identical, then described assignment information need not the direction of the transfer resource that regulation distributes.If the distribution of uplink transmission resource and downlink transmission resources is independently, then described assignment information is stipulated the distribution of described downlink transmission resources and described uplink transmission resource separately.For example, can be by having two independent allocation tables--one is used for down link and another is used for up link, or finishes this operation by have the link direction designator in single allocation table.
In an embodiment of the present invention, define at least one allocation rule for expectation with the communication equipment that discontinuous mode sent or received information.Described allocation rule typically defines the sequence of sets of transmission resources, and it can be included as the transfer resource that given communication equipment distributes.Therefore, described communication equipment only needs to monitor the assignment information by the sets of transmission resources of its allocation rule definition, and described communication equipment need not respectively plan to be supplied with the resource allocation information decoding of all sets of transmission resources of other communication equipment.If the assignment information of given sets of transmission resources indicates described set to be included as the transfer resource that described communication equipment distributes, then described communication equipment typically uses the transfer resource of described distribution to receive and/or transmission information.
Be used at least one allocation rule of communication equipment by definition, and by distributing described transfer resource according to described allocation rule, communication equipment know when be its can receive/send information in discontinuous mode next constantly.Described communication equipment does not need continuously, and when next monitor allocation be assigned to it to find out described transfer resource.Reduced power consumption like this.Depend on that information transmits needs, can define different allocation rule.Some examples of described allocation rule are discussed in more detail below.
On the other hand, described communication system can decide the distribution of real resource based on described allocation rule and each other factors.There is specific sets of transmission resources in this explanation for each communication equipment, and described sets of transmission resources comprises the transfer resource that is assigned to described communication equipment potentially.For example, depend on needs and traffic load, so described communication system is described communication equipment allocation of transmission resources in the middle of the sets of transmission resources that comprises the transfer resource that is used for communication equipment potentially to described communication equipment allocation of transmission resources.
Even should be understood that each resource allocation in the subsequent sets of transmission resources all is independently, described assignment information also occurs not according to mode independently, but by defined allocation rule described assignment information advantageously is linked to consequent distribution indication.From the viewpoint of system, advantageously, configuration of communications device, thus make each communication equipment follow of the potential decoding of its favourable allocation rule to be used for indicating to distributing, rather than all are distributed instruction decoding.Discuss in more detail in conjunction with Fig. 5 a to Fig. 5 e after a while.
Fig. 2 a illustrates the flow chart according to the method 200 of first embodiment of the invention.Method 200 relates to be distributed to communication equipment with transfer resource and how to indicate described transfer resource is distributed to described communication equipment.As mentioned above, come to indicate the distribution (step 201) of sets of transmission resources to communication equipment with the assignment information that is associated with sets of transmission resources.Described assignment information can be for example at the allocation table that beginning sent of frame.Typically, the assignment information of the sets of transmission resources that makes progress at downlink side sends together with described sets of transmission resources institute loaded information.The sets of transmission resources of the correspondence that can be for example makes progress in conjunction with downlink side, or be the defined moment of set of uplink transmission resources individually, the assignment information of set of uplink transmission resources sent.In step 202, for communication equipment defines at least one allocation rule.Described allocation rule is typically related with described communication equipment with the sequence of described sets of transmission resources.The sequence of described sets of transmission resources can be included as the transfer resource that described communication equipment distributes.As mentioned above, communications device monitors is by the assignment information of defined those sets of transmission resources of its allocation rule.In step 203, notify its allocation rule separately to described communication equipment.Communication equipment need not to know the allocation rule of other communication equipment.Communication equipment can receive the information of explicitly definition allocation rule.As further example, can have the set of default allocation rule, and communication equipment receives the identifier related with described default allocation rule.In step 204, transfer resource is distributed to described communication equipment based in the allocation rule of communication equipment at least one.
Fig. 2 b illustrates the flow chart according to the method 210 of the apparatus for operating communication of first embodiment of the invention.In step 211, determine at least one allocation rule, the sequence of the sets of transmission resources that described at least one allocation rule definition is related with described communication equipment.Typically, described communication system will send to described communication equipment about the information of the allocation rule of described communication equipment.Described communication equipment can be for himself proposing suitable set of allocation rules, so and described communication system can confirm to use which set of allocation rules.As second example, described communication system can be proposed some regular collections to described communication equipment, so described communication equipment is selected only rule.Below discuss second embodiment in more detail.In step 212, described communications device monitors is by the assignment information of defined at least one sets of transmission resources of its allocation rule.In step 213, described communication equipment determines based on the assignment information of being monitored whether the sequence of described sets of transmission resources is included as the transfer resource that described communication equipment distributes.
Fig. 3 a, Fig. 3 b and Fig. 3 c schematically show some examples of using the allocation rule of radio frame as example.In Fig. 3 a, communication equipment 101 has the periodically allocation rule of the assignment information in the supervisory frame of definition communication equipment 101.The described cycle can be defined as once relatively more suitable number of frames or time cycle.In Fig. 3 a, for example, communication equipment 101 monitoring are every the assignment information of a frame 301,303,305.Because communication equipment 101 is known frame 302, frame 304 and frame 306 and can be included as the transfer resource of its distribution, communication equipment 101 can be ignored the assignment information in these frames fully.In Fig. 3 a, the identifier that the assignment information of frame 301 and frame 305 indication and communication equipment 101 are related.Assignment information in these frames also tells which transfer resource in communication equipment 101 these frames to distribute (dash area of frame 301 and frame 305) for communication equipment 101.In view of the above, communication equipment 101 can correctly receive information.In Fig. 3 a, the assignment information in the frame 303 does not comprise the identifier related with communication equipment 101, and this explanation does not exist for the real resource that communication equipment 101 distributes in this frame.
Should be understood that described assignment information can be alternatively or additionally relevant with uplink frame.In the case, communication equipment 101 comes transmission information with the transfer resource that use is assigned to it.
The sequence that aperiodic allocation rale can cycle service time or for example the quantity of sets of transmission resources defines sets of transmission resources.When sets of transmission resources was frame, aperiodic allocation rale can using system frame number (SFN).Communication equipment can typically be careful system frame number, and need not to receive all frames, and therefore, SFN is very suitable for discerning uniquely frame.Aperiodic allocation rale can for example define the individual frame every n-1 by definition integer value n and deviant 0...n-1.Can be for example by the arithmetic module computing define be used for first communication equipment every n-1 frame, notation is as follows: offset{0}SFN mod n, wherein, mod represents modulus operator.For second communication equipment, for example, the frame period every n-1 with different frequency displacements can be defined as: offset{1}SFN mod n.
For different communication equipments, can depend on the type of service and/or the quality requirement of for example its communication needs, its activation, and be set up different moulds and deviant.Details will be discussed in conjunction with Fig. 5 a to Fig. 5 e.When the traffic load in the described communication system changes, can adjust the mould value.(those skilled in the art also understand need correspondingly adjust described deviant).In heavy duty sub-district, dispenser can may occur more rarely, and in underloaded sub-district, described dispenser can may occur more frequently; At least be such for the Business Stream that allows such adjustment.If there is the situation of overload, then can adjust described allocation rule by the value that increases mould.For example, the mould value n of all allocation rule can be multiply by 2.The result is, but the energy of the transfer resource that is distributed for each communication equipment per time unit reduces half, and therefore load reduces.Might within the delay requirement of Business Stream, regulate described mould value, and such adjusting is particularly suitable for the not free data flow of limitting and can wait for the long period in buffer.It should be noted that upwards relaxing overload situations at downlink side is not that the mould value is adjusted in absolute demand.If load is very heavy, all in the sets of transmission resources that then described communication system just can be not should not used user's basic of distribution user's allocation rule user.If the resource allocation that expectation will lack is converted to the power-saving of described communication equipment, then can change described allocation rule.
Each n value of in described communication equipment, using can be for example 2 exponential depth (be n=1,2,4,8 ...).But this may select the only of n value anything but.
If each superframe sends primary distribution information, it is that assignment information is monitored which frame in the superframe that then described allocation rule typically defines communication equipment.If described sets of transmission resources comprises minor structure--its reservation declared individually, then can be for example identifier and separator by sets of transmission resources identify described minor structure.For example, the minor structure time slot in the frame can be identified by system frame number and separator.Described separator can be that the son field of adding or its can be the bit range expansions for the primal system frame number.Therefore, even allocation space also can be used embodiments of the invention once more than a frame or once be shorter than a frame.
For the traditional business type,, also typically the transfer resource in up link and the down link is distributed to communication equipment based on identical set of allocation rules even can occur independently for relative link direction actual allocated.For example, for the transfer of data in the down link, when existence sends to the data of communication equipment, allocation of transmission resources in defined sets of transmission resources by periodic allocation rule.Similarly, in up link, can will distribute to described communication equipment by the defined sets of transmission opportunities of described periodic allocation rule.Like this, described communication equipment can indicate it to have more data that will send to described communication system.After receiving first indication, so therefore described communication system can allow described communication equipment to send its data giving described communication equipment with more accurate resource allocation in the sets of transmission resources continuously.
Fig. 3 a illustrates uplink frame 301a, 302a, 303a, 304a, 305a and the 306a example as set of uplink transmission resources further.Uplink frame among Fig. 3 a illustrates the function of Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) (FDD), and in FDD, the transmission of up link and down link and reception appear at the different frequency place.Whether the assignment information notifying communication equipment 101 in the descending chain circuit frame 301,303 and 305 distributes to described communication equipment with described transfer resource in uplink frame 301a, 303a and 305a.DL frame and the timing slip between the UL frame among Fig. 3 a only are exemplary.Described UL frame and DL frame can be calibrated or be offset, or they can or even different length and size.The replacement that is used for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) (FDD) scheme can be time division duplex (TDD) scheme, and in the TDD scheme, down link operates on the identical carrier frequency with up link.
Fig. 3 b schematically shows first allocation rule (the regular #1 among Fig. 3 b) with longer cycle and has the example of more short-period second allocation rule (the regular #2 among Fig. 3 b).First allocation rule can be called as long-term allocation rule, and second allocation rule can be called as short-term allocation rale.Consider that communication equipment 101 is sending and receiving the example of speech data.Typically, audio coder ﹠ decoder (codec) is periodically exported packets of voice, and therefore, described communication equipment expectational cycle ground sends packets of voice.In order to support the voice data transmission from communication equipment, delimiting period allocation rule (regular #1) is just enough.So, communication system as according to as described in distribution that periodic allocation rule proposed indication defined, be distributed in the transfer resource in all descending chain circuit frames and/or the uplink frame.
May there be the transmission delay jitter that causes owing to network self in codec speech frame that receive and that send to communication equipment for the other end that connects from voice on network.Especially can be like this for packet switching network, routing queue and routing algorithm will cause indefinite packetization delay in packet switching network.Consider the example among Fig. 3 b, wherein said long-term rule (regular #1) definition frame 311 is supposed to comprise the packets of voice to communication equipment 101.If packets of voice can not be obtained to be transferred to communication equipment 101 in frame 311, then typically can not postpone the transmission of described packets of voice, up to by the long-term defined next frame 319 of (every seven frames) allocation rule.Therefore, if when communication equipment 101 is not included as the transfer resource that communication equipment 101 distributes by the defined frame 311 of described long-term allocation rule, communication equipment 101 is brought into use short-term allocation rale (regular #2).Described short-term allocation rale can also be a periodic regular.In Fig. 3 b, the assignment information of described short-term allocation rale (regular #2) definition communication equipment 101 each successive frame of monitoring.Communication equipment 101 notices that frame 312 is not included as the transfer resource that described communication equipment distributes.On the other hand, frame 313 has the transfer resource that distributes for described communication equipment.Find the transfer resource (and correctly receiving by the transfer resource loaded information of being distributed) that distributes for self afterwards in the defined descending chain circuit frame by short-term allocation rale, communication equipment 101 returns to use long-term allocation rule.By this mode, described long-term allocation rule and described short-term allocation rale can change on order.Because frame 319 and 327 is included as the transfer resource that communication equipment 101 distributes, therefore after these frames, do not adopt described short-term allocation rale.
Should be understood that the distribution of uplink frame and descending chain circuit frame need be based on the resource of long-term allocation rule for speech data (or having other data flow of the Transmission Time Interval of expectation).For the data flow of association, except described long-term allocation rule, typically also need short-term allocation rale with good conditionsi.Be possible communication equipment 101 and stipulate long-term allocation rule and short-term allocation rale independently independently.Related data flow is tightly related to reverse flow in this expression forward-flow, and vice versa.The example of this situation is TCP acknowledgment, and TCP acknowledgment is always adopted segmentation is delivered to another link direction.Other example is mutual or transaction traffic-flows, and wherein, the response action to another link direction is determined in given initiation action.Therefore, the service feature of forward link and reverse link and transmission demand interrelate.
As second example of the use of short-term allocation rale with good conditionsi, consideration is data retransmission when Data Receiving failure for some reason.If described communication system does not receive data from communication equipment 101, or confirmation of receipt is lost, or when communication equipment 101 sent the Negative Acknowledgement that receives, described communication system was typically according to the short-term allocation rale retransmission information, up to receiving positive acknowledgement from communication equipment 101.Communication equipment 101 can be triggered in response to successful certain bar information that receives, and uses described short-term allocation rale to monitor to carry out assignment information, and described communication system is divided the resource that is used in re-transmission based on described short-term allocation rale.Similarly, when if communication equipment 101 does not receive in response to the positive acknowledgement of the data that are sent to described communication system, this situation can be indicated to described communication system, described communication system can begin to be used in based on the short-term allocation rale branch transfer resource of uplink retransmission.Communication equipment 101 is according to described short-term allocation rale monitor allocation, and when having been found that on uplink direction to the transfer resource that himself distributes retransmission information.
Fig. 3 c wherein, is used in combination two periodic allocation rule with reference to the 3rd example.At this, period 1 property allocation rule is used for allowing communication equipment 101 (for example at frame 330,360 and 390) inspection assignment information only very infrequently.If described communication system has the data that send to communication equipment 101, then described communication system can one by in the defined sets of transmission resources of described period 1 property allocation rule in the beginning of declaration transmission, indicate.In Fig. 3 c, the beginning of declaration transmission in frame 360.This declaration can be in described allocation table, or in by the payload that described frame carried.Thereafter, communication equipment 101 switches to and uses short-term rale and come monitor allocation.In the example in Fig. 3 c, short-term rale definition communication equipment 101 each successive frame 361,362 of monitoring ..., 371 distribution.In frame 371, described assignment information no longer is designated as the resource that communication equipment 101 is distributed, and therefore communication equipment knows that switch to the described long-term allocation rule of application once more monitors.According to described long-term allocation rule, the next frame of communication equipment 101 monitor allocation is frames 390.
For the communication equipment that can send information on up link, described communication system can be based on the long-term rule allocation of transmission resources.In case distributed transfer resource on described up link, described communication equipment just can be indicated to described communication system: it has data to be sent.Described indication can be a transfer of data that for example waits resource of distributing based on described long-term rule to be used to transmit.Perhaps, described communication equipment can indicate that it has can be used for data quantity transmitted (together with the actual transmission of first's data).Thereafter, described communication equipment can begin to notice on uplink direction transmission information when having the transfer resource of distributing to it according to the short-term rale monitor allocation and when it.In case in described communication equipment, no longer include data to be sent (or described communication equipment has sent the quantity data of current desired transmission), described communication equipment just can be stopped using the transfer resource that is dispensed to it simply, or described communication equipment can indicate it to no longer include data.In response to the untapped institute of announcement Resources allocation, described communication system can begin based on long-term rule allocation of transmission resources on up link, and described communication equipment can begin to come monitor allocation according to described long-term rule.The equipment that sends every now and then postponing insensitive data can use this transmission plan.
The other example of allocation rule is such rule, and it is quoted from the sets of transmission resources sequence of given set beginning in future.This sequence of sets that begins from given following sets of transmission resources can be called as non-individual body.The following sets of transmission resources that next non-individual body began can be for example discerned by the moment of described sequences of sets number or the described following sets of transmission resources of transmission/reception.Described communication equipment is in set beginning in given future monitor allocation, and (might according to short-term rale) continue this monitoring, informs up to other.For example, by in the payload of one of sets of transmission resources of current non-individual body, providing the pointer of next following sets of transmission resources of pointing to next non-individual body, inform that described communication equipment stops using short-term allocation rale.The sets of transmission resources that comprises the pointer that points to next non-individual body typically is defined as the last sets of transmission resources in the current non-individual body.
Can be known impliedly that described communication equipment is used to monitor the short-term allocation rale of the assignment information that begins from given sets of transmission resources, or the short-term allocation rale that is used for next non-individual body can be stipulated together with the pointer that points to described next non-individual body by explicitly.
Except the payload that comprises the pointer that points to next non-individual body, might in existing non-individual body, not exist for other transfer resource that described communication equipment distributes.As the replacement to the payload that distributed, the pointer that points to described next non-individual body can be in an assignment information.
Can define the set of allocation rules that is used for each connection.At this, set of allocation rules refers to the combination of an allocation rule or a plurality of allocation rule.As the example of the combination of a plurality of allocation rule, connect for each, consider above-mentioned two combinations with periodic allocation rule of different cycles.In the case, communication equipment 101 should comprise and be used for the function that monitoring allocation rule specific by stream or that connect specific (typically being defined uniquely by Internet protocol address and port numbers) is united the assignment information of definition.Perhaps, can define the set of allocation rules that is used for communication equipment.The specific set of allocation rules of communication equipment should satisfy the transmission demand of all streams (connection) of communication equipment.Described communication system can comprise the function that is used for determining based on the demand that connects the allocation rule that equipment is specific.Described communication system can comprise the function that is used for determining based on the ability of described communication equipment the allocation rule that equipment is specific.How can keep information below in conjunction with concrete described communication system and the described communication equipment discussed of second embodiment of the invention about allocation rule.
Should understand, communication equipment needs the time to handle assignment information, if and given described communication equipment with allocation of uplink transmission resources, then communication equipment would need the time to use the uplink transmission resource of being distributed to come deal with data and send data on uplink direction.In the transmission of down link direction and the assignment information indication allocation of uplink transmission resources, therefore should refer to the uplink transmission resource that after the sufficiently long time interval, occurs.Communication equipment can have different abilities and handle information and the transmission information that is received.Therefore, might be in response to the distribution of noticing uplink resource, first communication equipment sends data soon on uplink direction after second communication equipment.Might be for described first communication equipment, assignment information has been indicated the uplink transmission resource in next sets of transmission resources.For described second equipment, an identical assignment information can be quoted the uplink transmission resource in the set of uplink transmission resources that occurs constantly after a while.In other words, an assignment information can be quoted a plurality of set of uplink transmission resources.
Figure 10 a illustrates and an example that assignment information is relevant of quoting more than one set of uplink transmission resources.In Figure 10 a, by example, assignment information 1000 is sent out together with set of downlink transmission resources.Article one, assignment information 1000 is by at least three communication equipment UE1, UE2 and UE3 monitoring.As example, UE1 has similar disposal ability with UE2, and UE3 has relatively poor disposal ability.Article one, assignment information 1000 indications are for the allocation of uplink transmission resources of at least three communication equipment UE1, UE2, UE3.First distributes indication 1001 indications in next set of uplink transmission resources 1020 uplink transmission resource 1021 to be distributed to UE1.Second distributes indication 1022 indications in identical set of uplink transmission resources 1020 uplink transmission resource 1022 to be distributed to UE2.The 3rd distributes indication 1003 indications in set of uplink transmission resources 1030 after a while uplink transmission resource 1031 to be distributed to UE3.Therefore, communication equipment UE3 can handle assignment information 1000, and serves as that corresponding the preparation done in transmission with the time cycle of being longer than UE1 and UE2.
Perhaps, an assignment information can be quoted single set of uplink transmission resources.If described communication equipment has different disposal abilities, then described single set of uplink transmission resources should occur after the fully long time interval.In other words, in Figure 10 a, distribute indication 1001,1002 and 1003 transfer resources that can all quote in set of uplink transmission resources 1030.
About downlink allocation, an assignment information is typically quoted single set of downlink transmission resources.Downlink allocation information can be sent out in conjunction with relevant downlink transmission resources.Described sets of transmission resources can be from wherein having provided the same number of frames SFN of downlink allocation information, or (for example SFN+1) beginning after the processing time.Therefore, only when described downlink allocation information had been indicated the transfer resource that is assigned to described communication equipment, communication equipment just can continue to receive described down link signal simply, and handled the signal that is received suitably.With reference to Figure 10 a, assignment information 1000 typically also is included in the distribution of transmission resource information 1010 in the set.Perhaps, for example, can send downlink allocation information with previous set of downlink transmission resources.This operation can be the specific embodiment of pointer mechanism, wherein, and the sets of transmission resources in pointer positive sense future of having utilized before that set of downlink transmission resources provides.
Described assignment information need not typically to stipulate which set of uplink transmission resources is described assignment information quote.Typically, each communication equipment and described communication system have been known in advance.In this respect, communication equipment can for example be grouped into the class of the disposal ability of regulation communication equipment.When distributing uplink resource and when making up assignment information to be sent, described communication system need be considered the different abilities of communication equipment.
Figure 10 b illustrates an assignment information can quote second example more than one set of uplink transmission resources.Communication equipment UE1-UE3 has similar ability, and communication equipment UE4 has lower ability.Therefore, quote the allocation table entries of UE1-UE3 and in uplink frame i+1, indicate the distribution of uplink resource, and the allocation table entries of quoting UE4 is indicated the distribution of uplink resource in uplink frame i+2.In Figure 10 b, represent such situation with dotted line.Discuss Figure 10 b in more detail below in conjunction with second embodiment of the invention.
Should be understood that and to send to communication equipment according to the affirmation information that the allocation rule related with ul transmissions will be used for described ul transmissions.In other words, the communication equipment of monitoring the assignment information of described uplink transmission resource is monitored uplink acknowledgement information simultaneously.
Figure 11 illustrates the example that sends uplink acknowledgement information according to the allocation rule related with ul transmissions.Figure 11 illustrates the set of uplink transmission resources 1101a-1109a of set of downlink transmission resources 1101-1109 and correspondence as example.For example, send the assignment information of set of uplink transmission resources 1101a-1109a in conjunction with corresponding set of downlink transmission resources 1101-1109.In the example depicted in fig. 11, per four set of uplink transmission resources monitoring of communication equipment primary distribution information is promptly together with set of uplink transmission resources 1101,1105 and 1109 assignment information that send.Assignment information indication in conjunction with set of downlink transmission resources 1101 has distributed transfer resource (indication 1121) for described communication equipment in set 1101a.Described communication equipment uses the transfer resource that is distributed among the set 1101a to send up-link information.Described communication system comes (positive or negative ground) to confirm described ul transmissions by sending uplink acknowledgement information 1135 in conjunction with set of downlink transmission resources 1105.In other words, described uplink acknowledgement information is to send according to the allocation rule that defines which assignment information of described communications device monitors.As mentioned above, described communication equipment can be ignored described assignment information, and (if there is no related with the communication equipment described communication equipment of definition should also be monitored other allocation rule of those set 1102,1103 and 1104) therefore also ignores the affirmation information that sends in conjunction with set 1102,1103 and 1104.
Should be understood that in the example depicted in fig. 11 described communication system can be early than be ready for sending uplink acknowledgement information in conjunction with set 1105.Yet described communication equipment can use set 1105 to send other up-link information at first.Therefore, send uplink acknowledgment according to described allocation rule and do not cause extra delay ul transmissions.
Typically, uplink acknowledgment 1135 is sent out together with the indication 1125 of the uplink transmission resource of being distributed.If in set 1105a, do not have the uplink resource that is assigned to communication equipment, then described communication equipment can postpone the transmission of described uplink acknowledgement information, thereby makes described uplink acknowledgement information be sent out together with the assignment information of indication to the uplink resource allocation of described communication equipment.Yet, even when (promptly in set 1105a) do not exist for the uplink transmission resource that described communication equipment distributes in relevant set of uplink transmission resources, also might send described uplink acknowledgment with the earliest an assignment information (being the set 1105 among Figure 11) according to described allocation rule.For example, when described communication equipment when no longer to have asked uplink resource and described uplink acknowledgment be sure, can be like this.Figure 11 illustrates the example that sends positive acknowledgement 1139 in conjunction with set of downlink transmission resources 1109.
Because a plurality of communication equipments are typically monitored distribution and the confirmation that is sent by communication system, therefore need uplink acknowledgment is related with particular communication devices.A possibility is: the order of affirmation is according to the order of the distribution indication that sends together with described affirmation.Because described distribution indication is related with communication device identifier (for example radio link identifier), therefore, described uplink acknowledgment is related with communication device identifier.Other possibility is: send communication device identifier with the uplink acknowledgment explicitly.When sending uplink acknowledgment by communication equipment and not sending indication for institute's distribution uplink transmission resource of described communication equipment simultaneously, the possibility that needs are such.Figure 12 a and Figure 12 b are described in further detail in conjunction with uplink allocation information and send uplink acknowledgment.
Send uplink acknowledgment according to allocation rule following advantage is provided: described communication equipment can adopt the discontinuous transmission/reception by described allocation rule definition.Further, for example send uplink acknowledgment discretely following advantage is provided: can use strong chnnel coding to protect described uplink acknowledgment to avoid transmission error with downlink user data.Typically, send uplink acknowledgement information and uplink allocation information together according to the allocation rule related with ul transmissions.By sending described uplink acknowledgment, can save transport overhead according to order according to uplink allocation indication order.This is because for each set of uplink transmission resources, only needs the identifier related with described communication equipment sent once.
Below, the second embodiment of the present invention is described.In described second embodiment, sets of transmission resources is a radio frame, is the specific example of assignment information at the allocation table of the beginning of downlink radio frame.Other example of allocation table placement in the frame is the centre of frame, and the particular orientation in the described frame approaches pilot frequency code element or training sequence.Described allocation table can be quoted the transfer resource in the same downlink frame that it is placed and/or quote any subsequent frame.Similarly, described allocation table can be quoted the transfer resource in the uplink frame that arrives arbitrarily.Further, the communication device identifier in the described allocation table is radio link identifier (RLID) or group allocation identifier.Be apparent that,, be not only applicable to the allocation table that begins to locate or the radio identifiers of radio frame, downlink radio frame, also on more general rank, be suitable in conjunction with the arbitrary characteristics that described second embodiment discusses.Further, in conjunction with described second embodiment, communication equipment is called as terminal, and transceiver network element is called as the base station.
Ideal situation among described second embodiment is the allocation table that forms parameterisable, and described allocation table is separated from one another.Because radio link identifier (RLID) all is unique to any terminal in arbitrary cells, so the RLID sign is used for the distribution of each terminal.Because business demand (buffer state and delay) can change to another allocation table from an allocation table, can not be the priori order so also suppose allocation identification.For each moment of allocation table, need comprise the RL ID of the terminal that all will obtain distributing, and need signal its allocation order, if unconspicuous words.The order of listed RL ID is a kind of mode of the order of declaration distribution in allocation table entries.If the order of described distribution and size are not connected, then need the added bit field to declare allocation order and size in Resource Unit.
In a second embodiment, can be the allocation table assign identifiers, thereby described terminal is known which allocation table of monitoring.A rational branch symbol that is used for allocation table is system frame number (SFN), and described SFN is long unique sequence, uniquely identification frames and available jointly with all communication equipments that operate in wherein for described communication system.Allocationtable identifiers can implicitly be calculated, and they need not to be transmitted by signal continually.Can need some initialization signalings to consult between described base station and described terminal: described terminal adopts which allocation table that forms allocation rule.For example, this depends on the traffic flow types of activation of terminal and the load condition of network.As mentioned above, the uplink allocation table can separate with the downlink allocation table, and they can adopt the allocation rule of separation.Yet, these tables can be united, and only need distribute and indicate link direction for each.Change if be used for the rule of the allocation table of given terminal, then must pass and notify described terminal with signal.For example, when Business Stream is activated, revises or stops, this situation may appear.
Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4 b schematically show the process of consulting and dividing the allocation rule that is used in down link and uplink direction respectively.In down link, the allocation rule that is used for terminal can be assigned about for example following knowledge based on it in the base station:
● terminal capabilities
Zero full-duplex/half-duplex
● the Business Stream in down link and the up link activates
The zero down link criterion of separating with the up link criterion
Zero satisfies the down link criterion of uplink traffic criterion
● traffic characteristics
Zero Business Stream postpones or bit-rate requirements
● professional buffer status
The base station is notified to terminal by sending allocation rule assign message 401 with allocation rule.Terminal will be verified described allocation rule, and check whether demand and described allocation rule that whether described allocation rule can satisfy with regard to ability will satisfy its expectation for downlink traffic.If terminal is accepted and can be satisfied described rule, then it will send to the base station to acknowledge message 402.Otherwise terminal will not confirmed described rule, but will propose the modification to described rule.If terminal needs allocation rule more closely, then it can propose to give the base station separately with this situation.On the other hand, if terminal is wanted looser allocation rule, for example, want to have long DTX or DRX cycle, then it also can be proposed this situation to the base station.Perhaps, might will assign one group of possible allocation rule in the base station in allocation rule assign message, terminal must be from wherein selecting one, and with allocation rule confirm message this selection is responded.
In up link, terminal will be undertaken obtaining the request of uplink allocation by sending allocation rule request message 403.This request can comprise the proposal to described allocation rule.The base station will verify and check whether it can satisfy the set demand of described proposal (for example with regard to available channel and load), and whether described rule will satisfy its expectation to uplink service.If described rule can be satisfied in the base station, then it will send to terminal to acknowledge message 402.If these rules are wanted maybe to need to revise in the base station, then it also will come response terminal with allocation rule assign message 401 except negative acknowledgement message 402.The uplink allocation rule can be based on about for example following knowledge:
● terminal capabilities
Zero full-duplex/half-duplex
● the Business Stream in down link and the up link activates
The zero up link criterion of separating with the down link criterion
Zero satisfies the up link criterion of downlink traffic criterion
● traffic characteristics
Zero Business Stream postpones or bit-rate requirements
● professional buffer status
● measured pilot signal strength
Consult the required message of allocation rule and can belong to the unit process, or the information content of these message can be used as information element and be embedded in some other suitable process, or be embedded in the message of described other process.These message can be placed in the access channel, for example Random Access Channel, direct access channel or forward channel or dedicated channel or shared channel.
Fig. 4 c illustrates and is used to carry the protocol message of allocation rule negotiation and appointment as example.Fig. 4 c illustrates the possible protocol message structure that is used to carry allocation rule request message 403, allocation rule assign message 401 and allocation rule confirm message 402.In addition, protocol header comprises control/business (C/T) mark 411, and it is described payload and comprises still user-plane traffic (C/T=T) of signaling message (C/T=C).For control messages and for the payload of user-plane traffic, fragment size can be different.When once control protocol data cell (Pdu) being set to given Resource Unit, optionally, be during the identical traffic time interval (TTI), in same resource units, to continue user traffic payload Pdu, still they must be multiplexed into independent TTI.
Fig. 5 a to Fig. 5 e illustrates the different possible mode of using allocation rule.System frame number SFN can be used among described second embodiment, and can serve as the time descriptor of described allocation table.SFN allows for each frame and different allocation tables occurs, and allows to occur different allocation table in unique mode for each frame in the very long time cycle.That is to say that if the set user's who identifies optimum maximum number is 8, and exists and to reach 8 excited users, then any distribution of these 8 users can occur at any time, sees Fig. 5 a in allocation table.If there is the excited users between 8 to 16, then their distribution can be divided into traditionally two allocation tables, see Fig. 5 b.Respectively, for 32 users, described distribution can be divided into four tables, sees Fig. 5 c.If whole 16 users among Fig. 5 d have frequent data, 8 then given users set can occur every a frame ground, offset{0}SFN%2 (mould), and be offset{1}SFN%2 every other 8 users of frame ground set.Allow each terminal to be informed in like this and can declare in which allocation table that it distributes, and therefore will only need to follow allocation table every one.Further, terminal is known the RL ID of this terminal in this allocation table.Between several allocation tables, divide terminal and do not have a lot of unfavorable results.On the other hand, add small delay like this, but saved signaling like this, and allowed discontinuous reception (DRX) and/or discontinuous transmission (DTX).In typical case many, described distribution need not so frequent.
As the function of the quantity of the activated terminals in the sector, described terminal can be divided into the allocation table of any selected quantity, and described allocation table is declared to be the SFN%n allocation table.The allocation table that separates is adopted in the set of each 2,4 or 8 terminal, and first set has that offset{0}, second set have offset{1}, the 3rd set has offset{2}, so so that offset{ (n-1) }.Fig. 5 d illustrates this situation, and Fig. 5 d illustrates the distribution for 20 excited users.Each user adopts the allocation table according to the SFN%4 rule; Terminal #1 to #2 adopts offset{0}, and terminal #3 to #10 adopts offset{1}, and terminal #11 to #14 adopts offset{2}, and terminal #15 to #20 adopts offset{3}.
If traffic carrying capacity does not wait, then resource allocation need not to be equal to for different terminals, and further, the allocation table rule need not to be equal to for different terminals.Terminal with heavy traffic can be assigned with SFN%1 allocation table or SFN%2 allocation table rule.This illustrates that this terminal can receive data or the data in a frame in each frame respectively.Other terminal still can adopt other SFN%n allocation rule arbitrarily.Demand only is: base station and terminal both know which allocation rule allocation table can follow.Fig. 5 e illustrates this situation, and wherein, terminal #1 adopts the SFN%1 allocation table, and terminal #2 adopts the SFN%2 allocation table, and terminal #3 adopts the SFN%4 allocation table, and all other terminals adopt some other allocation table rules.Possible is, some terminals do not have allocation rule, but they adopt all allocation rule.Yet this expends terminal power.
Should be understood that another variance factor for the allocation table rule of different terminals is the lag characteristic of terminal activating service stream.Terminal with latency sensitive services can be assigned SFN%1 allocation table or SFN%2 allocation table.Can adopt more not frequent SFN%n allocation table rule so have other terminal of low delay-sensitive traffic stream.
Fig. 5 f schematically shows the quantity relevant with the use of group allocation identifier.Can give the single common group distribution markers of a plurality of terminal distribution (Alloc_ID), described Alloc_ID can be used for the distribution of uniting of described a plurality of terminals and quote.The signaling space in the allocation table has been saved in the use of Alloc_ID, and for uniting distribution, the signaling of single Alloc_ID is just enough, and need not a plurality of RL_ID.Described group allocation identifier is provided with following demand: the distribution of the connection under Alloc_ID and DTX/DRX pattern adopt same pace, pattern and resource-sharing fully.Certainly, any connection in the described connection still can have them and independently distributes DTX/DRX rule with they independent RL_ID institute signalisations.As mentioned above, can define the independent information that is used to stipulate the resource allocation related with group allocation identifier.No matter when declare described distribution by Alloc_ID, these group rules are effective for those assignment periods.In group allocation, distributing content still can be unique for each user, but in the case, must have the priori configuration (in other words, group rules) in those distribution of the pointed inside, common source unit of Alloc_ID.For example, four users can receive the data of many personalizations.In the case, their distribution is shared, but for each dispense event, described resource is shared between these four users, shown in Fig. 5 f.
Fig. 5 f relates to the situation that terminal UE #7, UE#15, UE#39 and UE#45 are confirmed as adopting shared allocation rule.Therefore, with in these terminals of signalisation each: except their the RL_ID indication that is used for each distribution, they must be followed by Alloc_ID--and be given as the group allocation of #158--declaration at this.When declaring timing in described minute by Alloc_ID#158, terminal will always obtain having the shared distribution of common DRX cycle.In such distribution, respectively, terminal UE #7 will obtain first share of 1/5 size of the resource units that distributed, terminal UE #15 will obtain second share of 2/5 size of the resource units that distributed, terminal UE #39 will obtain the 3rd share of 1/5 size of the resource units that distributed, and terminal UE #45 will obtain the 4th share of 1/5 size of the resource units that distributed.
Use the allocation rule of which allocation table of definition terminal monitoring all to provide benefit, because will reduce the signaling consumption in the allocation table as base station and terminal.Be apparent that with the many more distribution of signalisation, this signaling just consumes many more bits in single table.If each allocation table comprises the few more distribution with signalisation, then need few more signaling bit.This does not influence each and connects available in time real resource amount.This also will provide major benefit for terminal, because its rule that can know according to it, frequency and must decode to allocation table at which frame are used discontinuous transmission and/or receiving mode (DTX/DRX).As previously mentioned, the actual allocated by described specific allocationtable sign still can become greatly different.To each allocation table, might terminal do not distributed arbitrarily at all.If obtain distributing, then its allocation order can be variable in frame, and the quantity of the resource units that is distributed can be variable, and transformat (link adaptation) can be variable by the transmission format set definition that is allowed.Described transformat comprises for example modulation, chnnel coding, spread spectrum, multi-antenna diversity or MIMO transport-type.Described transformat can be instructed in allocation table.For group allocation, the transformat of the described whole users in the group can be identical, or can indicate individually.At least do not divide timing arbitrarily when terminal need not to receive any allocation table and when terminal, the benefit of allocation table rule represents at least along with it and becomes obvious.The feasible like this DTX/DRX as high-power circuit can be cut off during DTX/DRX, allows to save energy greatly in terminal.
Radio channel condition is noted.Next DTX/DRX activates and can appear at than channel coherence time in more Zao future.This does not instruct to distribute after the DTX/DRX quietness and how long will continue, and does not instruct the link adaptation format between next active period yet.Between next active period, after the DTX/DRX silent period, even radio channel from previous cyclomorphosis, if channel feedback message is available, then arbitrarily link adaptation, MIMO and such scheme also are available.In addition, if channel feedback message is available, then scheduling, packet scheduling or the like allow between active period payload is placed into constructive channel condition.
It is for example following that allocation rule can depend on: the bit-rate requirements of the type of the quantity of activating service stream, activating service stream, the delay requirement of activating service stream, activating service stream, as full duplex or semiduplex terminal capability, the load of network and the data volume in the buffer.
As mentioned above, for up link and down link, distribution can be independently, can be for up link and down link and coordinate, or can tightly interrelate, that is, determine the up link reverse flow by each forward direction downlink traffic stream, or determine the down link reverse flow by each forward direction uplink service flows.Allocation table can comprise the independent allocation table instances that is used for up link and down link, maybe can utilize the link direction designator in single allocation table up link and down link to be declared.
In described specific second embodiment, therefore described allocation table comprises:
●RL_ID
● allocation order (optional)
● the quantity of the resource units that is distributed (or distribution designator of other kind)
● link direction
● transformat
Zero chnnel coding
Zero modulation
Zero re-transmission form (IR, HARQ)
Zero SISO/ diversity/MIMO transmission
Any clauses and subclauses of described allocation table can followingly provide:
AllocationTabel_SFN.RL_ID.allocation_order.#Resource_units.link_direction.Transport_Format
As the example of described group allocation, the clauses and subclauses of described allocation table can followingly provide:
AllocationTabel_SFN.Alloc_ID.order?in?Alloc_ID?list.share?of?thecommon?ResourceUnit.link_direction.Transport_Format
For the assignment information of handling in the allocation table, typically the time of implementation synchronously and Frequency Synchronization, filtering, frame structure are caught for terminal, the error detection of channel estimating, demodulation, channel-decoding, allocation table and read and explain bit field in the described allocation table.Thereafter, terminal can judge whether its RL ID and/or AllocID appear in the described allocation table.Under the situation of an identifier or two identifier appearance, described terminal correspondingly sends and/or receives the actual payload in the described sets of transmission resources.
Next, the long-term allocation of the type of service be used to have known expectation Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is discussed.Carry out above-mentioned quoting for long-term allocation rule, and can use the TTI of expectation to determine the monitoring period of these long-term allocation rule.As example, below go through voice, Voice ﹠ Video.Might be for example by finding out the data that send which kind of type and/or using which codec that data are decoded to determine desirable T TI.Should be understood that details how to determine desirable T TI is outside scope of the present invention.The present invention pays close attention to and uses known TTI to determine allocation rule.Can allow any TTI value, for example, the value 1ms that knows, 2ms, 10ms, 20ms, 40ms, 80ms up to 100 or 200ms be typical.
In the middle of terminal, can exist service source to start, known its adopts specific natural arrival interval process.Example is voice service, and wherein, if AMR (adaptive multi-rate) or AMR-WB (AMR-WB), then audio coder ﹠ decoder (codec) provides speech frame one time every 20ms as can be known, and 20ms is the duration of phoneme.Therefore, with the quantification and the coding of 20ms cycle processed voice, it is formed on the speech frame that has zoom factor and frequency sub-band sampling in the frame.In case created speech frame, just it be embedded into the real-time transport protocol (rtp) grouping.Next speech frame and next RTP grouping will occur after 20ms.There is similar natural arrival interval process for audio signal.For video, natural arrival interval process also exists, and wherein, very typically per second is created 25 picture frames, and the image update grouping occurs at interval with 40ms.
According to setting, audio coder ﹠ decoder (codec) will provide a grouping, and its length depends on amount of information that described codec generates and variable.Typically, for given audio quality setting, described voice frame size is constant, and in other words, the audio quality setting for given provides constant bit rate.For adaptive bitrate, the variable size of payload, but create constant at interval.
About voice, preferably divide into groups to pay a speech frame and a RTP/UDP grouping, and allow the interarrival time of about 20ms with single IP.Yet, optionally, can will be polymerized to single IP grouping more than one speech frame (i.e. two or four even reach eight speech frames).Yet, to compare with every IP transmitted in packets individual voice frame, such polymerization makes the easier packet loss that suffers of payload, and more responsive to postponing.
Except speech frame length, each packets of voice requires the size of (by air interface) distribution of every 20ms due in to depend on length, an IP compression scheme and its compressive state of IP, UDP, RTP and their head.If there is not applied compression, then expense is every speech frame tens bytes, therefore too much.The head compression will reduce to minimum possibility to expense constantly at each.Compression result also depends on the applied checksum field of different agreement layer, because verification and not compressing.Further, at some transmission example, some reverse flow header compression ACK can be added to compressed forward-flow head.Described compression can process IP v4 and IPv6 and further UDP and Real-time Transport Protocol.Compression set is stipulated in RFC3095 (ROHC) and RFC2057.
In the Internet, there is the general realization of audio coder ﹠ decoder (codec), this may provide incompatible form and frame structure.Such codec voice quality on communication link typically is lower than the voice quality of AMR and AMR-WB codec.Allocation table is by allowing to distribute variable payload length to allow to pay any phonetic matrix.
About audio coding, there are a plurality of codecs and codec setting.There are mpeg player (for example MPEG2 layer II, MPEG2 layer III and MPEG4), media player, MP3 player etc.They are listened the frame sampling of frequency range and create frame reaching the whole of 64kHz, and audio coder ﹠ decoder (codec) is usually only to reaching the voice band coding of 4kHz or 8kHz.Audio frame length is stipulated by the audio codec standard.Typically, each audio frame comprises the sampling of constant number.To obtain audio frame creation interval like this, typically the magnitude (depending on audio codec) of about 20ms.Typically an audio frame is inserted into a RTP grouping.If amount of audio frame information surpasses maximum transfer unit (MTU) grouping size, then will create a plurality of RTP groupings.The RTP timestamp is the timing of description audio frame uniquely.Under the situation of some exceptions, for example,, then can will divide into groups to identical RTP from sample collection more than a timestamp if the payload of each frame is very little.For this situation, exist special time to stab and create rule.For audio decoder, there be the bit buffer unit and broadcast (play-out) buffer that carries out some traffic smoothing of decoder input.
For video transmission, a plurality of codecs and encoding setting are effective.Very be typically, create single image at interval, because 25 images of per second are enough to hide to the user discontinuity of sport video with 40ms.For the establishment of video transmission picture frame, there is polytype encryption algorithm.Sometimes pay image, form sometimes and pay different images with full detail.Therefore, amount of information is very big to another interval variation at interval from an image encoding.Quantity with every image encoding variable-length packets is at interval paid described image.For Video Decoder, there be the bit buffer unit and broadcast (play-out) buffer that carries out some traffic smoothing of decoder input.
Because the frame of video of being created typically is carried in the IP grouping, therefore on network, there are each routed path and loading condition, this will cause at the base station buffer place that is used for downlink traffic for the delay and the delay jitter of grouping arrival process.In terminal, packet creation process has considerably less delay jitter to transmitter buffer, and this is because the network that divided into groups not pass before obtaining uplink allocation.In down link, described buffer state is known in described base station, and can be at each frame time with the allocation optimized of resource units be accurate in the described allocation table.In up link, described buffer state is not known in the base station that declaration distributes.At this, terminal must be with its buffer state of signalisation, the request sendout, and how many subsequent allocations are the maybe necessary resource units amount that allows a certain nominal of base station assigns need so terminal can be used described resource units and further indicate.
For this distribution method, the known features of Business Stream is that terminal has provided in the moment that allocation table occurs and need not chance to its decoding.If terminal has the service source of the activation of voice/audio/video/data, then it can be reserved the distribution of the time that is similar to each interarrival time cycle.That is, allocation table declares that described terminal has packets of voice to be received, and described terminal will receive grouping to decode.Like this, if be at SFN previous the distribution, next distribution then to be decoded will appear at SFN+ Transmission Time Interval (TTI) definitely, and terminal is known for this voice service traffic flow, it need not any allocation table decoding is passed up to TTI, and this is at allocation table SFN+TTL.RLID.
As mentioned above, because delay jitter, so grouping has arrived base station buffer or no show still before may appearing at interarrival time.Under first kind of situation, the base station will only postpone grouping a little, and will create allocation table SFN+TTL.RL ID in the suitable moment and distribute designator, and divide the resource that is used in described grouping respectively.It is little to postpone this cost that early arrives grouping, and does not have too macrolesion.Under second kind of situation, the not grouping that will pay, and base station need not to make described RL ID to appear in the allocation table.Yet because described grouping can arrive after interarrival time passes at any time, therefore described terminal need be carried out more frequent allocation table reception.If in the case, then terminal will be waited for another TTI, and the grouping that arrives soon after a described TTI passes will be postponed for a long time, and the arrival interval process is with disturbed.
After skipping a TTI, if there is not down link data to be allocated, then the base station can notify terminal it must how allocation table be decoded.Exist some to realize the mode of this process.Terminal can be known a prior interval that will follow after TTI passes, promptly per 4 or 8 allocation tables.So, determine that resource allocation will appear in any allocation table in the described sequence as early as possible.After allocation table activates, will activate the new arrival interval stand-by period for next grouping arrives.At this, the interarrival time that interarrival time is based on expectation is activated, if, then add the previous arrival interval of expectation and activate each new TTI stand-by period, to compensate the delay jitter in the desired value as much as possible based on interarrival time so there is shake.(can use the random desired value technology).
Should be understood that some variations can be suitable for sending data based on TTI.Described natural interarrival time can be reduced a little, to begin to be possible distribution decoding allocation table under situation about arriving ahead of time.Another variation is, reserves the allocation table allocation chance with the frequency that for example doubles or be four times in desired interarrival time.Allow so still in regularly requiring, to pay the grouping that is delayed.So also allow to be used for the time of physical layer retransmission, physical layer retransmission is recovered ruined grouping between first transmission period by incremental redundancy, re-transmission copy or soft combination, thereby increases the probability that is correctly decoded, and this is very important.
Fig. 6 relates to the short-term allocation rale that is used for three terminals and the combination of long-term allocation rule.Allocation rule can comprise definition that is used for short-term allocation and the definition that is used for long-term allocation separately.Long-term allocation rule can depend on desirable T TI, and described desirable T TI compares the very long typically cycle with described frame.In the allocation table after TTI, if be assigned as sky (promptly data are not useable for transmission in buffer), then terminal and base station will begin to follow short-term rale.This can mean that dispenser can be with appearance, promptly according to each SFN%4 allocation table of offset{x} skew.Therefore terminal will continue the allocation table decoding is received grouping up to it.If in described grouping, do not declare non-individual body, and if described terminal to this grouping correctly the decoding, then this terminal can switch to long-term allocation rule once more.This explanation, it will be decoded to next allocation table at the desirable T TI by the long-term allocation rule declaration.Long-term allocation rule shown in Fig. 6.In short-term allocation shown in the identical figure.For first terminal (with white piece mark), there is long-term allocation interval T TI, be attended by the short-term allocation that is used for excessive data and re-transmission.For second terminal (with the piece mark of light shading), only there is short-term allocation, regularly every a frame with grey.For the 3rd terminal (with marked. with dark gray blocks), also only there is short-term allocation, regularly every three frames.
After distributing arbitrarily and receiving grouping, can there be the non-individual body of being declared.In other words, described distribution is declared as continuation, is cleared up to for example whole transmission buffers.Described non-individual body can be indicated as and adopt direct rule frame by frame, or adopts short-term allocation rale.Another embodiment postpones described non-individual body, and points out that with dedicated signaling the position (in which SFN) that described non-individual body begins (sees Fig. 7 a).Therefore described non-individual body can be expanded well by the special use indication, and described special-purpose indication always illustrates the beginning of next non-individual body.Fig. 7 b illustrates the frame of use non-individual body allocation rule distribution as example.In first non-individual body shown in Fig. 7 b, terminal monitoring is every the assignment information of one frame.In frame SFN+4, there is the pointer of frame SFN+24, alternatively, short-term rale is defined in the frame of monitoring in described next non-individual body every.Identical short-term rale has announcement up to other if terminal is known its application, then short-term rale and optional is appearred in next non-individual body.In frame SFN+27, exist again the pointer of frame SFN+44 and definition every the assignment information of three frame with monitored new short-term rale.
If distributed the grouping but described grouping is not correctly decoded, then will retransmit described grouping.This may by the copy that adds incremental redundancy or retransmit this grouping maybe the part of this grouping carry out.The base station will be known the re-transmission needs of downlink packets by terminal check.Described re-transmission will be indicated by short-term allocation rale.So, for each TTI, adopt long-term allocation rule, and after each TTI, adopt short-term allocation rale, up to correctly receiving data.After this cycle, consider described long-term allocation rule once more, thereby make under the situation of not shaking, not having at least one non-individual body and do not have to retransmit, calculate desired TTI.Certainly, base station and terminal both need calculate or know TTI by identical mode.
The criterion that is used to assign allocation rule is discussed below.Terminal can have several layers 2 service that activate simultaneously arbitrarily, and must receive the dissimilar packet traffic flows with different qualities.Therefore, when so determining any traffic flow requirements of terminal, terminal should obtain activating at any time.Owing to there is flexibility in some Business Streams,, therefore might coordinates their distribution for single terminal for example to postponing insensitive data, services.Best timing constraint can be arranged for the Business Stream of terminal in the base station, thereby makes it closely receiving grouping as burst in (continuously or very frequent) distribution, and then with dormancy, occurs up to next burst.Sometimes, the type of Business Stream does not allow such coordination, and each Business Stream must be used at the interarrival time that intersects.
The base station can have each optimization criterion that is used to assign allocation rule.The buffer state for each Business Stream of each terminal can be monitored in the base station, and adjusts allocation rule.If exist postponing insensitive stream of packets, then they can be used for smooth cell load.The base station will at first be noted satisfying to postponing very responsive business and real time business rule.Non-real-time service is more flexible aspect distributing regularly.If there is less load in system, then the base station can be divided postponing insensitive traffic packets for any given allocation table divides, and for example is used for SFN%4 equably and distributes.If load or disturbed condition become more abominable, then allocation rule can easily be revised to postponing insensitive business load for this in the base station, to adopt for example SFN%8, SFN%16, SFN%32 or SFN%64 rule etc.Can carry out all these, and not revise the allocation rule that is used for delay-sensitive or real time business stream.Change any regular and can control (RRC) signaling according to radio resource and carry out, as described in part 2.Because transmitting such activation rule is not to be too much bit load, the therefore modification that in fact also can use short-term allocation rale by allocation table.
Fig. 8 a to Fig. 8 e is illustrated in each relevant with being careful allocation rule in base station and terminal table as example.Terminal can have the short-term that is dispensed to it and the combination in any of long-term rule.As mentioned above, allocation rule (combination) can be that terminal is specific or to connect (Business Stream) specific.Can in identical table, keep information respectively about next non-individual body.
Table 1 among Fig. 8 a is the example of the base station table that is used to distribute.In table 1, base station and UE1 have a Business Stream, and described Business Stream adopts short-term rale (one-period that promptly is used for monitor allocation).Base station and UE2 adopt a short-term rale and a long-term rule, and do not use the information about desired TTI.In the case, can after finding, activate described short-term rale by the actual allocated in the frame of described long-term allocation rule definition.By this mode, in case the base station decision sends data, and by distributing a part of frame that is defined by described long-term rule to indicate the transmission beginning, the base station just can use the distribution by the short-term rale definition to send the data to terminal UE 2.The base station is adopted different long-term rule for Business Stream 1 with Business Stream 2 with UE3, but they adopt single common short-term rale.Owing to be two long-term rule definition of T TI, therefore,, then activate described short-term rale if in frame, do not find distribution by described long-term allocation rule definition, shake with processing delay.
Table 2 among Fig. 8 b is another examples of the base station table that is used to distribute.Table 2 illustrates the numerical example relevant with allocation rule.According to long-term rule, first terminal monitoring with RL_ID 102 has 20ms and (when frame length is 2/3ms, equals 30 SFN; This example is widely used in the numerical example in this description) frame in cycle; If correctly receive information and to its decoding, then described terminal continues with described long-term rule.If the information of receiving but decode incorrectly then needs to retransmit, and described terminal is therefore according to the frame of described short-term rale monitoring every three, typically up to correctly receiving described information and it being decoded.
As shown in table 2, second terminal with RL_ID 41 has the 40ms frame in (60 SFN) cycle according to its long-term rule monitoring.Described second terminal is also according to the frame of its short-term rale monitoring every 15.Conditionally, if the received information decoding failure relevant, the then further short-term monitoring period of (every four frames) definition with the frame of described long-term rule definition.
As shown in table 2, the 4th terminal with RL_ID 743 uses the non-individual body allocation rule to be used for monitor allocation.Symbol SFN+100 represents that the last frame of previous non-individual body comprises the pointer that is used to skip 100 frames.Therefore the described allocation rule of described the 3rd terminal identifies a specific future frame.
Table 3 and table 4 relate to table 2.Table 3 among Fig. 8 c is the allocation tables with first terminal of RL_ID 102.Table 4 among Fig. 8 d is the allocation tables with second terminal of RL_ID 41.Table 5 among Fig. 8 e is the allocation table that has to more than the terminal of the connection of a base station successively.Table 5 is listed the connection of first base station, and wherein said terminal is related with RL_ID 41, and to the connection of second base station, wherein said terminal is related with RL_ID 657.Long-term rule relevant with these base stations and short-term rale are identical in this example.For example refer to switching, quick direct-cut operation, soft handover etc. with this relation more than a base station (sector, sub-district).
About switching, if terminal moves to another new sub-district, then the base station knows that described terminal no longer intercepts the allocation table in the old sub-district.The base station will discharge this allocation rule commitment, and assign the space that is used for another terminal.If described switching appears between the sector of same base, then described base station can also keep (switching) to be used for the preferred agreement of signaling event of the allocation table of new Serving cell.Distribution in described new sector will not guaranteed.In any case RL_ID will change, even SFN may change between transfer period.
Allocation rule discussed above can be called as activation DRX rule and/or activate DTX rule and/or DTX/DRX rule.After activation of service finishes, still can there be another exponential depth DRX rule, to be used for the change from the state of activation to the idle condition.Described idle condition can be therefore different with state of activation DRX mechanism.Described idle condition DRX rule can adopt known exponential depth deep-sleep algorithm.Status transition between state of activation DTX/DRX and the idle condition DRX is below described.
State of activation DTX/DRX occurs based on the discontinuity of known or supposition, for example based on TTI and long-term sensing ability.In idle condition DRX, can exponential power rule.As long as DTX/DRX adopts some business models or discontinuity to arrive the longest TTI that is supported, for example 40ms or 80ms (or even arrive 100 or 200ms), just can application activating state DTX/DRX.In addition, any sensing to described next non-individual body will remain on state of activation to described terminal.If do not activate within this time cycle, then UE enters the exponential sleep of described idle condition.In other words, the chance of paging receiving is configured to make UE to decode to allocation table afterwards at 80ms, 160ms, 320ms, 640ms, 1280ms, 2560ms, 5120ms (up to long idle state DRX).Like this, index is applied to the status transition of described idle condition.
Fig. 9 a, Fig. 9 b and Fig. 9 c relate to the transition from state of activation DTX/DRX to idle condition DRX.Fig. 9 a illustrates the state diagram that shows idle condition and state of activation and some other possible state.Idle condition DRX rule is different from state of activation DTX/DRX rule.
Fig. 9 b is the state diagram that is used for the state of activation allocation rule in communication equipment.In step 901, set up session or activation data stream.In step 902, check that described communication equipment is in idle condition or state of activation.If described communication equipment is in state of activation, then upgrade DTX/DRX state of activation allocation rule in step 903 according to new session or the new data flow that activates.If described communication equipment is in idle condition, then it will self switch to state of activation in step 904, and creates state of activation DTX/DRX rule in step 905.Thereafter, described communication equipment repeating step 906 to 912 does not have transfer of data (step 913) in predetermined time cycle.In step 906, described communication equipment determines that it need adopt still long-term allocation rule (step 908) of short-term allocation rale (step 907).Described communication equipment is correspondingly determined the length of next DTX/DRX assignment period after present frame.In step 909, described communications device monitors assignment information is to be used for determining whether it needs to receive the data of present frame.Described communication equipment also determines in step 909 whether it needs to send data and indicate such needs.In step 910, if then described communication equipment is encoded to the payload that will send and/or the payload that is dispensed to it is decoded.In step 911, described communication equipment allows all the other duration of described DTX/DRX assignment period to pass through.Refer to the to be sent and/or data that receive in the cycle in next activation of step 912 at next DTX/DRX.If do not activate during the longest addressable state of activation DTX/DRX, then described communication equipment switches to idle condition in step 914.In step 915, described communication equipment begins to use idle state allocation rules.In step 916, if do not activate, then described communication equipment uses the longest idle state period.When having activation after step 914, described communication equipment continues from step 901.
Fig. 9 c upgrades or to the diagrammatic sketch that may trigger of DTX/DRX Policy Updates allocation rule.These triggerings can be applied to for given terminal or more generally for the base station of multiple terminals more, or these triggerings can be applied to terminal.Load triggers is network originated typically, other triggering can be network originated or terminal rise.Described rule self will be applied in in the base station of given terminal or in described terminal with being equal to respectively.
Figure 10 b illustrates an assignment information can quote example more than one set of uplink transmission resources.Top line among Figure 10 b illustrates down link DL frame and system frame number SFN thereof.Following four lines illustrates the uplink frame of four terminal UE 1, UE2, UE3 and UE4.In this example, send described allocation table in conjunction with described descending chain circuit frame.Terminal UE 1, UE2 and UE3 come the monitor allocation table according to the allocation rule of SFNmod 4.In Figure 10 b, illustrate by the time cycle between two continuous dispensing tables of UE1, UE2 and UE3 monitoring with arrow k1.Terminal UE 4 is according to the allocation rule monitor allocation table of SFNmod 6; With arrow k2 in each time cycle shown in Figure 10 b.
In the example of Figure 10 b, terminal UE 1, UE2 and UE3 have enough disposal abilities and use uplink frame i+1 to allow them when sending allocation table in descending chain circuit frame i.For example, consider the allocation table of descending chain circuit frame SFN+4.This allocation table is quoted uplink frame SFN+5; With dotted line in this situation shown in Figure 10 b.Terminal UE 4 has relatively poor disposal ability, and the allocation table entries related with UE4 quoted uplink frame i+2.For example, the allocation table entries among the descending chain circuit frame SFN+5 is quoted uplink frame SFN+7.
All be included as the transfer resource that terminal UE 1-UE4 distributes though should be understood that all uplink frame that Figure 10 b shows according to allocation rule SFN mod 4 (UE1-UE3) and SFN mod 6 (UE4), this only is an example.Some uplink frame according to each allocation rule can not comprise the resource that is assigned to terminal UE 1-UE4.Figure 10 b does not provide the details about the downlink transmission resources of distributing to UE1-UE4 in downlink transmission frames.
Resource allocator in the communication system should be considered different terminal capabilities.For example, consider Figure 10 b.In frame SFN+4, the distribution of UE1-UE3 is decided simultaneously for UL frame SFN+5.In frame SFN+5, the distribution of UE4 is decided to be UL frame SFN+7.Yet the branch timing in allocation rule permission same number of frames for example in frame SFN+13, has been indicated the distribution of UE4 in descending chain circuit frame SFN+11, and the distribution of in SFN+12, having indicated the frame SFN+13 that is used for UE1-UE3.Therefore, resource allocator should be noted that all distribution of given uplink frame all are best, even for the slow UE of disposal ability, the signaling of this distribution occurs early than the fast UE of disposal ability.
Figure 12 schematically shows the example of allocation table 1210,1220, and it also comprises uplink acknowledgment.Allocation table 1210,1220 relates to two the continuous uplink frame related with specific allocation rule (being frame 1 and frame i).In the example of Figure 12 a, terminal UE 1-UE4 is according to described specific allocation rule monitor allocation table and uplink acknowledgment.The allocation table 1210 relevant with uplink frame 1 illustrates the clauses and subclauses relevant with terminal UE 1-UE4, and indication is to the allocation of uplink transmission resources of these terminals.The allocation table 1220 relevant with uplink frame i illustrates clauses and subclauses relevant with terminal UE 1-UE4 and the uplink acknowledgment that is used for terminal UE 1-UE4.Uplink acknowledgment in the allocation table 1220 is relevant with uplink frame 1.Shown in Figure 12 a, the order of described uplink acknowledgment is identical with described allocation table entries.Can determine that described uplink acknowledgment is relevant with which terminal based on the information in the described allocation table.Should be understood that typically the information that allocation table 1210,1220 also comprises about downlink allocation.As example, allocation table 1220 also comprises the uplink acknowledgment that is used for terminal UE 5, for terminal UE 5, does not have uplink entries in allocation table 1220.Yet terminal UE 5 is come monitor allocation table 1220 according to the allocation rule related with UE5.Radio link identifier RL ID (UE5) or other identifier related with terminal UE 5 are sent out together with described uplink acknowledgment.
Figure 12 b schematically shows the further example of the allocation table 1230,1240 that comprises the uplink acknowledgment relevant with Figure 10.In the example shown in Figure 10 b, terminal has different abilities, and the uplink entries in the described allocation table can be quoted the uplink frame more than.In Figure 10 b, send allocation table 1230 in conjunction with descending chain circuit frame SFN+4.Among the allocation table 1230 uplink frame SFN+5 of indication in Figure 10 b, give terminal UE 1-UE3 (seeing the dotted line among Figure 10) with allocation of uplink transmission resources.Allocation table 1230 also comprises the clauses and subclauses that indication is used for the uplink allocation of terminal UE 5.Described uplink allocation can be relevant with uplink frame SFN+5 or another uplink frame, and this depends on the ability of terminal UE 5.Allocation table 1230 also comprises for the uplink acknowledgment of the up-link information that is sent in uplink frame SFN+1 by terminal UE 1-UE3 in Figure 10 b (still seeing the dotted line among Figure 10 b).Allocation table 1230 can further comprise clauses and subclauses and affirmation.
Allocation table 1240 is sent out in conjunction with the descending chain circuit frame SFN+5 among Figure 10 b.Allocation table 1240 comprises and terminal UE 6-UE8 and the relevant uplink entries of UE4.The uplink resource that distributes for terminal UE 4 is arranged in uplink frame SFN+7.The uplink resource that distributes for terminal UE 6-UE8 can be arranged in other uplink frame except SFN+7, and this depends on the ability of these terminal UE 6-UE8.Allocation table 1240 also comprises the uplink acknowledgment that is used for (relevant with the ul transmissions that terminal UE 6-UE8 is previous) terminal UE 6-UE8, and is used for terminal UE 4 uplink acknowledgments.The uplink acknowledgment that is used for terminal UE 4 in the allocation table 1240 is relevant with the ul transmissions among the uplink frame SFN+1 of Figure 10 b, shown in the solid line among the figure.
About descending chain circuit frame SFN+8 and the SFN+12 among Figure 10 b, just relevant with terminal UE 1-UE3 clauses and subclauses send the allocation table similar to allocation table 1230 with affirmation in these descending chain circuit frames.In descending chain circuit frame SFN+8 or SFN+12, described allocation table need not to comprise clauses and subclauses or the affirmation relevant with terminal UE 5.About the descending chain circuit frame SFN+11 among Figure 10 b, the allocation table in this descending chain circuit frame comprises clauses and subclauses and the affirmation that is used for terminal UE 4, and is similar to allocation table 1240.
When being identified for the cycle of discontinuous transmission/reception, need the processing time in consideration terminal and the network element.Figure 13 and Figure 14 illustrate about the example of this situation and details.Figure 13 schematically shows the two-dimensional plot of the transmission that down link rose with uplink response, and wherein, uplink acknowledgment is placed in the allocation table.In the example depicted in fig. 13, for example, send the allocation table that comprises up link and downlink allocation information at the place that begins of descending chain circuit frame.Similar to Figure 10 b, frame can be related with frame number SFN.The top row of Figure 13 illustrates descending chain circuit frame, and the following row of Figure 13 illustrates the uplink frame of terminal.Terminal UE adopts the allocation table 1310,1320,1330,1340,1350 every five.Suppose and in five uplink frame, giving terminal UE uplink resource allocation.
In the upper left corner of Figure 13, the base station BS that shows communication system receives grouping 1301 to be sent.At processing time T
TxBsAfterwards, the base station is to described block encoding, and is described packet allocation resource.Therefore described base station can send the grouping 1302a that is encoded in first descending chain circuit frame, wherein terminal UE is monitored the assignment information of this first descending chain circuit frame.Described terminal monitoring allocation table 1310, and note distributing to its other resources at described down link and in described up link.Described terminal needs T
TxUETime cycle handle down link signal and prepare to confirm.In Figure 13, T
TxUECorresponding with the duration of two frames.Therefore, in allocation table 1310 (descending chain circuit frame SFN i), can quote uplink frame i+3 the earliest, because UL and DL frame are calibrated in Figure 13 for the uplink allocation of terminal UE.In the example of Figure 13, the grouping 1303 that is received makes mistakes.It negates downlink acknowledgments 1311 that terminal UE uses the uplink resource that is distributed to send.Base station BS receiving uplink signal is also handled it.In response to negative downlink acknowledgement 1311, described base station resends the grouping 1302b of coding.Grouping 1302b can be actually copy or its incremental redundancy version of original transmitted 1302a.The current grouping 1304 that is received does not comprise error code.Terminal UE is used the uplink transmission resource of distributing to it in allocation table 1320, sends sure downlink acknowledgments 1312.At T
TxBSAfterwards, described base station this certainly downlink acknowledgments that received and decoded, T
TxBSBe that BS creates next required time of transmission, for example next grouping of preparing for transmission is Already in the BS buffer.Figure 13 illustrates next grouping, but not shown next the transmitted in packets details of Figure 13.Can use the resource of for example in allocation table 1310, being distributed to send next grouping.
After correctly receiving described grouping, UE will prepare response 1305.This T that will expend time in
ResponseAfter this operation, described UE will be to described response coding.In duration T
TxUEAfterwards, described UE is ready to send the response 1306 that is encoded.After described UE is to step response 1305 codings, its monitor allocation table 1330.When the resource that is assigned to it in the described UE use allocation table 1330 sends the grouping 1306a that is encoded, after the end of uplink frame, expend duration T
TxBs, to be used for that described uplink signal is handled in described base station and to described packet decoding.The grouping 1307 that is received goes wrong, so described base station sends negative downlink acknowledgement in allocation table 1340.Described terminal UE is also given with uplink resource allocation in described base station, and after to allocation table 1340 decodings, described terminal UE can begin to prepare to resend the incremental redundancy version of the grouping, copy or the described grouping that are encoded immediately.In Figure 13, come the described re-transmission of mark with label 1306a.After receiving described uplink signal, described signal is handled in described base station, and at processing time T
TxBSThe grouping 1308 that correctly receives can be forwarded to other network element afterwards.Be included in the allocation table 1350 for the sure uplink acknowledgment 1306b that retransmits.
In Figure 13,, related every the terminal periodic allocation rules of N frame with definition with the processing time of considering in described base station and the described terminal--wherein N is equal to or greater than 6, seems reasonable.Should be understood that if like this definition described allocation rule related then terminal UE can also be monitored other allocation table the allocation table 1310,1320,1330,1340 and 1350 in Figure 13 with terminal UE.
Figure 14 schematically shows the two-dimensional plot of the transmission that up link rose with downlink response, and wherein, described uplink acknowledgment is placed in the allocation table.Similar to Figure 13, Figure 14 is illustrated in the once re-transmission on down link direction and the uplink direction.In the allocation table 1410 in Figure 14, the UL resource is the distribution that is used for UE.With T
TxUEAfter the delay of mark, UE is ready for sending the grouping that is encoded.In Figure 14, the UL that is used for UE in allocation table 1410 distributes the frame that will send described grouping shown in quoting.Therefore, 3 frames are the preceding quoted in the UL of this UE distribution in Figure 14.These 3 frames are to have two frame duration T
TxUEThe minimum time of UE.UL for the UL transmission confirms to be arranged in allocation table 1420.In the example of Figure 14, the UL in the allocation table 1420 is confirmed to be negative, and allocation table 1420 is indicated the UL resource that is used to retransmit.After the UL of success retransmitted, sending certainly in allocation table 1430, UL confirmed.In this example, UE is not distributed further UL transfer resource.In response to the data that successfully receive, described base station is come to send data to UE by divide DL resource that is used in the DL transmission and the UL resource that is used for the DL confirmation in allocation table 1440.Not success of DL transmission among Figure 14, it negates that DL confirms that UE uses the UL resource of being distributed to send.By use allocation table 1450 distribute DL resource and UL resource carry out DL retransmit, in allocation table 1440 similar thereafter.
To be taken in, suppose to have the one-period allocation rule with reference to figure 13 and 14 o'clock.Perhaps, Figure 13 can be counted as illustrating the example relevant with the combination of long-term rule and short-term rale with Figure 14.The allocation table relevant with described long-term rule is 1310,1330 and 1350 and 1410 and 1440.Allocation table 1320 is because short-term allocation rale and monitored, and this short-term allocation rale is that the DL by the allocation table 1310 that is used for retransmission packet 1302a distributes and triggers.Allocation table 1340 is monitored owing to the UL distribution of the allocation table 1330 that is used for retransmission packet 1306a.Allocation table 1420 and 1430 is in response to that UL in the allocation table 1410 distributes and monitored.Allocation table 1450 is in response to that DL in the allocation table 1440 distributes and monitored.
To similar for the DL transmission, the long-term rule that therefore can be used in the UL distribution is used for new transmission, and adopts short-term rale in response to the UL transmission.(when UE when 16 SFN intercept) adopt UL to distribute according to long-term allocation rule, and use this UL to distribute transmission, short-term allocation rale commences work without delay.Therefore, UE begins than intercepting allocation table in the past more frequently.Short-term allocation can be SFN+4 for example.Therefore, UL in SFN distributes, and after the UL that is undertaken by the UEx among the SFN transmission, UE intercepts the allocation table among the SFN+4, wherein, distribute together with the possible new UL that is used to retransmit, in SFN, send affirmation for the UL transmission (retransmit at this and also refer to the re-transmission copy of original transmitted or the incremental redundancy version of original transmitted).
If, then can adopt further simplification for independent short-term allocation rale of all UE regulations.In other words, for UE, suppose only terminal capability.So all affirmations of the UL transmission in specific SFN will for example be come at DL frame SFN+m, wherein, m is the cycle related with described short-term allocation rale.By this mode, UL confirms and will not need to be used to indicate their set arbitrarily relevant with which UE.The order that UL confirms in the allocation table of SFN+m will directly be followed the order of giving the UL resource of UE in the allocation table of SFN.
If when being used for short-term allocation rale that DL retransmits and to be used for short-term allocation rale that UL UL that confirm and that may be used to retransmit distributes being identical, certain, this will be responsive.This need indicated UL distribution be used to such UL resource in SFN, this UL resource exists grace time to be used for UE the possible DL transmission of SFN to be decoded.So operation will be carried out as follows: in SFN, DL transmission and possible SFN+UL among the indication SFN
DelayIn UL distribute.For example, allocation table 1410 can be indicated the DL transmission except described UL distributes.At SFN+UL
DelayIn in the UL resource of being distributed, UE sends possible UL data, with the possible affirmation for described DL grouping.Referring again to Figure 14, this is first transmission from UE.In SFN+m (allocation table 1420 among Figure 14), (if UE is at SFN+UL
DelayThe middle Negative Acknowledgement that sends) re-transmission of the described DL grouping that base station assigns is possible (is used for SFN+UL if exist in SFN
DelayUL distribute) affirmation of the described UL grouping that then described base station assigns is possible, (negates that UL confirms if exist) then described base station assigns are possible is used for the distribution that UL retransmits.At SFN+m+UL
DelayIn the distribution, UE sends possible DL affirmation once more and possible UL retransmits (the 2nd UL transmission among Figure 14).At SFN+2m (allocation table 1430 among Figure 14), BS sends possible DL transmission once more, possible UL confirms and possible be used for that UL retransmits to distributing.This situation continued is confirmed for certain that up to UL grouping and DL grouping both after this, UE enters dormancy, and is in time waken up to intercept distribution according to described long-term allocation rule.
Figure 15 schematically shows the further example relevant with the combination of long-term allocation rule and short-term allocation rale.In Figure 15, come the cycle of mark DL and UL long-term allocation rule with TTI.The top of Figure 15 is relevant with downlink transmission, and the bottom of Figure 15 is relevant with ul transmissions.
