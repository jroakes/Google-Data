Definitions
- the present invention relates to an electronic device for controlling a television, video cassette recorder, home stereo system or the like.
- the device relates to a set-top decoder box which provides unified control of the above devices through infrared signals.
- TV set-top decoder boxes have become more prevalent with the increased popularity among consumers of subscription television programs.
- cable television (CATV) and more recently, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) programs are commonly received by individual households.
- Other possible transmission methods include microwave broadcast television, cellular television ("wireless cable”), and television delivered via digital telephone phone lines. See, generally, Inside the Set-Top Box, by Walter S. Ciciora, IEEE Spectrum, April 1995, p.70-75.
- Such transmission methods allow consumers to receive a variety of entertainment and information services. For example, a consumer may receive a basic selection of programs, or special premium channel programs may be chosen for an additional charge. Information services such as stock prices, teletext for the hearing impaired and others, or weather forecasts may also be received. Digital audio is also available which provides high-fidelity music or other programming.
- the first television set-top boxes added new capability to the standard television by allowing it to tune channels beyond the range of the broadcast spectrum.
- Cable transmissions are usually at a higher frequency range than a standard television can receive.
- the set-top box heterodynes or down converts the cable signal so that it may be displayed on the television.
- More modern "cable-ready"televisions can receive an increased range of the cable spectrum, but a set-top box is required to provide an optimum picture and to decode scrambled channels such as the premium channels.
- addressable set-top boxes can be controlled by a headend controller, thereby allowing consumers to purchase pay-per-view programming.
- Set-top boxes must be compatible with new digital technology such as high definition television (HDTV).
- the boxes will perform digital processing of compressed signals and will have interactive electronics and multimedia capabilities. Additional functions such as on-screen displays for control information, timer functions, freeze frame, and slow and fast motion are provided. Operability with other functions such as home shopping, video on demand, electronic games, educational programs, electronic publishing and other telecommunications services is also desirable.
- EPGs electronic program guides
- EPGs will help direct the user through the myriad of different channels available through on-screen displays and a user interface such as a hand held remote controller.
- Information such as program listings, reviews and ratings can be provided.
- a viewer may receive information, for example, on the violence content of a program. Provision can be made to password protect specific programs or channels at specific times.
- video-on-demand a viewer may select a program and a start time. In this way, program delivery is customized to best serve the consumer's needs.
- the set-top box can interface with other electronic components.
- the set-top box interfaces with the television by receiving a transmitted signal, decoding and descrambling as required, heterodyning the signal for compatibility with the particular model of television used, tuning a selected or default channel, and performing other functions such as image enhancement.
- the set-top box can also interface with a video cassette recorder (VCR) to record a selected program, or with a consumer's high-fidelity home stereo system, for instance, by powering the device and choosing specific volume and tone settings. Interoperability with other recording and play devices such as video laser disks or digital audio/video tape recorders is also envisioned.
- the set-top box can interface further with a personal computer (PC), printer or telephone, for example, to provide facsimile (fax) machine and other capabilities. Provision can also be made for the box to interface with a "smart card" which provides authorization for specific programming
- the various functions of the set-top box can be controlled by one or more microcomputers.
- Software can be downloaded to a memory in the box via the received signal or via the aforementioned smart card. In this way, service providers can provide new and updated functions or fix software glitches that are subsequently discovered.
- the consumer is thus faced with the problem of organizing and controlling the various capabilities provided by the television set-top decoder box.
- a home entertainment/information center that includes a set-top decoder box, a television, a VCR, and a high-fidelity audio system.
- Each of these electronic devices is typically controlled by a separate hand-held infrared remote controller that the consumer operates to select a desired action. For example, to view a television program, the viewer must first power the set-top box and television using their respective remote controls. Then, depending on the television model, it is necessary to tune the television to a particular channel (typically channel 3 or 4) in order to display a program from the set-top box.
- a particular channel typically channel 3 or 4
- the set-top box is then tuned to a desired channel and the program is displayed on the television.
- the viewer may want to tune to a channel that provides an EPG, such as an on-screen display of currently available programming.
- the viewer will command the television to set a desired volume level and perhaps adjust other parameters such as picture intensity, contrast, or color tone.
- Other parameters may be set by the viewer, such as screen display format. For example, depending on the equipment used, split-screen, picture-in-picture, zoom, aspect ratio, and display of teletext may be controlled. For instance, one may wish to combine teletext of a weather report while watching a news channel, or one may wish to combine teletext of stock market data while watching a business news channel. Likewise, one may combine teletext of sports scores while watching a sports program. Or, one may choose a combinations of settings depending upon the time of day or some other factor. The viewer may also need to address the set-top box to enter an authorization code as discussed above.
- the viewer may wish to control the high-fidelity audio system to receive either an audio-only channel or to receive the audio signal which accompanies a video program being viewed concurrently on the television.
- stereo audio signals which accompany video programming are available on many broadcasts, but many televisions do not have a stereo receiver or stereo speakers built in.
- the user may enjoy this feature through the use of a set-top box which routes the audio to the separate audio system.
- most high-fidelity stereo systems offer far greater performance and features than any system built in to a television.
- Features such as "surround sound" employ multiple speakers located in a room. Additionally, special speakers, amplifiers, and audio imaging circuitry can create a home theater environment.
- the viewer must first power the stereo system via the remote control and then set the desired volume and other parameters, such as surround sound, tone, balance, fade and so forth.
- desired volume and other parameters such as surround sound, tone, balance, fade and so forth.
- many of these settings may remain the same from day to day.
- the optimum settings may vary depending upon the type of programming selected. It is known among audiophiles, for instance, that classical music and jazz sound best at different frequency response profiles.
- one may select the full home theater effect mentioned above while viewing a movie channel in the evening, but may only desire a more modest setting while viewing the morning news. In any event, it is incumbent upon the viewer to command the system via the provided remote controller.
- the viewer may wish to control a peripheral device such as a VCR or audio tape recorder.
- a peripheral device such as a VCR or audio tape recorder.
- VCR video recorder
- the user may wish to have a computer video game displayed on the television screen. This will require the user to manually provide yet another sequence of control commands to the components involved.
- the set-top box provides only a video display signal to the television after the viewer has selected the proper channel on the television and set-top box.
- This signal is provided via a cable which is affixed at one end to the set-top box and at the other end to a port usually located at the rear of the television. Alternately, the cable may be routed through a VCR and then to the television port. In either case, the signal provided includes only the video image which is to be displayed and an accompanying audio signal.
- the set-top box does not have the capability, for example, to adjust the volume of the television. Nor does the set-top box have the capability to control other peripheral components.
- the necessary control signals are conventionally provided by the user with one or more hand held remote controllers.
- the set-top box In the case of digital audio received via a set-top box, the set-top box only decodes and descrambles the signal and passes it along to the user's separate audio system for further processing (e.g., amplification and filtering) and use. In this conventional arrangement, the set-top box cannot, for example, adjust the volume or select a custom frequency response profile desired by the user.
- the components are susceptible to receiving stray infrared signals directed toward another device. Stray signals may be picked up, for example, from a separate infrared remote controller located in an adjacent room. This is particularly a problem when components produced by the same manufacturer are used. The problem is compounded as increasing numbers of remotely-controlled devices are used in the home. Many homes have more than one remotely-controlled television or audio system and other devices, such as telephone jack or audio relay devices have also become more prevalent. Moreover, infrared signal boosters which allow one to command a device from across a large room are also increasingly popular. With a limited infrared bandwidth, these devices all pose an increasing threat of detection of stray infrared signals by the aforementioned components.
- the set-top box must be positioned in the line-of-sight of the infrared remote control.
- the box thus takes up valuable space and may be aesthetically unpleasing.
- the apparatus should simplify use of the components while allowing customized options to suit the needs of individual users.
- the apparatus is preferably operable with a single hand held infrared remote controller.
- the apparatus should eliminate the possibility of reception of stray signals. Furthermore, the apparatus should be easily installed and compatible with existing components and services along with planned future components and services. Additionally, the apparatus should be cost-effective to allow widespread use by consumers. The apparatus should also allow positioning of the set-top box in an inconspicuous place. The present invention provides such an apparatus.

- the control action signal is subsequently provided to one or more of the infrared transmitters at the interface modules.
- the module infrared transmitter transmits an infrared signal in accordance with the control action signal.
- the infrared transmission is received by the built-in infrared receiver located at the peripheral component to which the infrared interface module is attached, thereby producing the desired control action in the component.
- the set-top box need not be located within line of sight of the user's hand held controller.
- the set-top box may be located, for example, behind the television or in any other convenient location near the peripheral components.
- the set-top box communicates with the interface modules via a thin wire that can be unobtrusively routed.
- all of the interface modules receive the same infrared transmission from the hand held controller, only one of the interface devices need be equipped with an infrared receiver.
- the receiver portion of the module need not be collocated with the transmitter portion of the module.
- the apparatus allows a user to conveniently and simply control a number of peripheral components. Additionally, control functions are provided which are not available using the one or more conventional hand held remote controllers. Furthermore, the apparatus reduces the possibility of reception of stray signals.
