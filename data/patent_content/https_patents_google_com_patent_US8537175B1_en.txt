Definitions
- This invention generally relates to processing video and more specifically to enhancing video.
- Uploaded videos are often of poor visual quality because many videos are captured under poor lighting conditions or using inexpensive cameras. Particularly, the contrast of uploaded videos is often low, making foreground objects difficult to distinguish from other objects and from the background. Thus, there is a need to process the uploaded videos to enhance contrast and make the videos more visually appealing.
- Conventional image enhancement techniques such as histogram stretching or histogram equalization improve image quality by determining a histogram of pixel luminance values for an individual image frame, and stretching the histogram over an increased range of luminance values.
- These conventional image enhancement techniques can be extended to video by applying image enhancement independently to each individual frame of the video.
- conventional video enhancement techniques often corrupt video transition effects and introduces unwanted artifacts into the video.
- conventional video enhancement techniques are not well-suited for large scale applications such as video sharing, because of the substantial computational burden involved in processing every frame of video individually. Therefore, there is a need for a video enhancement technique that is well suited for large scale applications.
- a method for enhancing a video A scene of video having a plurality of frames is identified. A global distribution of luminance values of pixels in the scene is determined. Pixels in a frame within the scene are enhanced based at least in part on the global distribution of luminance values for pixels in the scene and a local distribution of luminance values for pixels in the frame. The enhanced video having the enhanced pixel luminance values is outputted.
- the step of enhancing the pixels comprises determining a local white level and local black level from the local distribution of pixel luminance values in the frame.
- a weighted white level is determined as a weighted combination of a global white level from the global distribution of pixel luminance values in the scene and the local white level from the local distribution of pixel luminance values in the frame.
- a weighted black level is determined as a weighted combination of the global black level from the global distribution of pixel luminance values in the scene and the local black level from the local distribution of pixel luminance values in the frame.
- the luminance values are enhanced using the weighted white levels and weighted black levels.
- a second embodiment comprises a computer-readable storage medium storing computer executable computer program instructions for enhancing video using the steps described above.
- a third embodiment comprises a computer system for enhancing video.
- the computer system includes a computer-readable storage medium storing executable computer program instructions for enhancing video using the steps described above.

- FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of a process for video enhancement performed by the enhancement server 112 .
- the enhancement server 112 receives 402 a video and determines 404 whether or not the video meets criteria for enhancement. For example, in one embodiment, the enhancement server 112 determines not to apply enhancement to a video if the enhancement process would not actually improve the video quality in a visually perceivable manner. In one embodiment, the video enhancement server 112 determines the difference between the maximum and minimum luminance values of the pixels in the video (i.e. a dynamic range of the luminance values). If the difference is large enough that video enhancement would not be able to substantially increase contrast of the video, then the enhancement server 112 determines not to enhance the video and outputs 406 an un-enhanced video.
- the enhancement server 112 determines not to enhance the video and outputs 406 an un-enhanced video.
- the enhancement server 112 improves its computational efficiency by skipping over videos that cannot be substantially enhanced.
- the decision 402 of whether or not to continue with the enhancement occurs at a different point in the process.
- the enhancement server 112 may analyze information determined during subsequent processing steps described below and end the enhancement process if it decides that continuing will not substantially improve the video quality.
- the scene segmentation module 314 determines 408 scene boundaries for the received video.
- the scene segmentation module 314 may not be 100% accurate and may produce either an over-segmentation or an under-segmentation of the video.
- the scene segmentation module 314 is tuned to err on the side of over-segmentation rather than under-segmentation.
- the level estimator 316 determines 410 an estimated white level and an estimated black level for each frame of video within a scene.
- each frame of video comprises a two-dimensional grid of pixels having a height and a width.
- Each pixel is identified by its x,y coordinates in the grid where x ⁇ 0, . . . , width ⁇ and y ⁇ 0, . . . , height ⁇ .
- the visual characteristics of a given pixel are represented by a one or more values dependent on the color space being utilized. For example, in a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space, a pixel, I(x, y), is defined by a triplet representing the red, green, and blue components of the pixel's color.
- RGB Red-Green-Blue
- each pixel I(x, y) is instead represented by a triplet corresponding to the hue, saturation, and value components of the pixel's color.
- Other color space representations are also possible such as, for example, YUV, HSL, La*b*, and so on. Conversion between color space representations are possible by applying various transformations to the pixel representation. For the purpose of the disclosure herein, it is assumed that the pixels are represented in the HSV color space. However, the techniques can also apply to other color space representations, or videos can be converted from their native representation to the HSV color space for processing.
- the probably mass function P(k) represents the probability that the V component of a randomly selected pixel I(x, y) in a given image frame will be a particular value k. This probability is determined from the actual distribution of pixel values within the image frame.
- the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of V is:
- the cumulative distribution function C(k) represents the probability that the V component of a randomly selected pixel I(x, y) will be equal to or less than a particular value k, according to the actual statistics of pixel values within the image frame.
- a local black level b frame is chosen such that 0.5% of pixels in the image frame have a value V equal to or less than b frame , based on the local distribution of pixel luminance values in the frame.
- different values are used to set the local white level w frame and local black level b frame .
- the local black level b frame and local white level w frame are normalized to the interval [0 . . . 1] instead of [0 . . . N].
- b frame 0.005
- w frame 0.995.
- other variables discussed below are also normalized from the interval [0 . . . N] to the interval [0 . . . 1].
- the level estimator 316 also determines 410 global white levels and black levels for each scene, denoted by w scene and b scene respectively.
- the global black level b scene for a given scene represents a value of V normalized to the interval [0 . . . 1] such that a first predefined percentage (e.g., 0.5%) of the normalized V components for all the pixels in the scene are less than or equal to b scene , based on the global distribution of pixel luminance values in the scene.
- the global black level b scene for the scene can be determined by computing an average of the local black levels for each frame in the scene.
- the global black level b scene for a given scene is computed as:
- I start and I end are frame indices corresponding to the scene boundaries (starting frame and ending frame) of the scene
- b_frame i is the local black level of a frame i within the scene.
- the black level for a scene b scene can be computed directly from the statistics of pixel values across the entire scene using equations (1) and (2) above.
- the global white level w scene for a scene is computed similarly.
- the global white level w scene represents a value of V normalized to the interval [0 . . . 1] such that a second predefined percentage (e.g., 99.5%) of the normalized V components for all the pixels in the scene are less than or equal to w scene , based on the global distribution of pixel luminance values in the scene.
- the global white level w scene for the scene can be determined by computing an average of the estimated white levels for each frame in the scene.
- the global white level w scene for a given scene is given by:
- the global white level for a scene w scene can be computed directly from the statistics across the entire scene using equations (1) and (2) above.
- the level estimator 316 determines 410 a weighted black level estimate b est and a weighted white level estimate W est as a compromise between the local levels for each frame and the global level for the scene.
- parameter ⁇ frame determines how much influence the local frame-level estimate b frame has over the global scene-level estimate b scene .
- ⁇ frame is set to 0.5.
- ] ⁇ frame (7) w est ⁇ w w frame +(1 ⁇ w ) w scene (8)
- the pixel luminance calculator 318 determines 414 an output luminance value l out for each pixel. For example, in one embodiment, the pixel luminance calculator 318 applies a histogram stretching to the original input pixel values l in such that a stretched distribution of the output luminance values l out in the frame have a desired white level w d higher in luminance than the weighted white level w est , and a desired black level b d lower in luminance than the weighted black level b est .
- an output pixel luminance is computed as:
- equation (9) is color-space independent and is very fast because it is a linear transform. If, for example, the pixel values are defined in the HSV color space as discussed above, then input luminance value l in corresponds to the V component of the original pixel, and the output luminance value l out corresponds to the V component of the output pixel.
- the enhancement server 112 adjusts 416 the output luminance l out in order to improve frames in which there is a high contrast between the foreground and the background, and the foreground object is dark relative to the background. Without this adjustment, the enhancement process may make a dark foreground object darker due to the increased contrast. The human eye perceives this change as a decrease in image quality because features of the dark object become harder to distinguish.
- an adjusted output luminance value l′ out is computed to raise the luminance value as follows:
- the adjusted luminance value l′ out is also clipped 418 between a lower threshold (e.g., 0) and an upper threshold (e.g., 1) by applying a clipping function to l′ out .
- a clipping function ⁇ (v) is defined as:
- the pixel saturation calculator 320 adjusts 420 the saturation component s of the pixel based on the output luminance value l out .
- This saturation adjustment compensates for a perceived decrease in saturation that results from an increase in luminance.
- s in is the saturation component of the original input pixel
- ⁇ is the clipping function described above in equation (11)
- ⁇ l l out ⁇ l in
- the enhancement server 112 then outputs 422 the enhanced video.
- the disclosed system and process can enhance the quality of a large number of videos, while not decreasing the quality of any processed videos.
- the method can be directly applied on a large scale for mass-processing of videos suitable for applications such as video hosting sites.
