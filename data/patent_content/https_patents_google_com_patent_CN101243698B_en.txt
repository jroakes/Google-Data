Be to be understood that; The embodiment of the invention described herein can comprise one or more traditional processors or unique stored program instructions; As described herein; This program command is controlled one or more processors, with some non-processor circuit combination, realize improving move from serving BS to the handoff procedure of target BS some, most or all functions.This non-processor circuit can include but not limited to, radio receiver, radio transmitter, signal driver, clock circuit, power circuit and user input device.Like this, these functions can be interpreted as the method step that is used to carry out described handoff procedure.Replacedly, state machine that can be through no stored program instruction, or realize some or all function at one or more application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)s (ASIC), wherein the combination of each function or some specific function can be implemented as the customized logic circuit.Certainly, can use the combination of this dual mode.Therefore, the method and apparatus that is used for these functions has been described here.In addition; Those of ordinary skills can predict; Although the remarkable effort that possibly produce and a lot of design alternative by for example up duration, current techniques and economic consideration,, when disclosed notion and principle are guided from here; Can easily generate this software instruction and program through minimum experiment, and IC.
The invention provides a kind of method and apparatus, be used to improve between MS and serving BS broadcasts and perhaps call out the shared time to target BS switching session.Like what set forth, MS needn't be in time or is received the recognition data about target BS in a suitable manner.In addition, since last time after MS has notified these parameters, the recognition data of target BS (such as uplink channel descriptor and downlink channel descriptor) can change.In order to increase the efficient of handover process, the present invention provided UCD and DCD before the actual process that MS is switched to target BS begins, and other recognition data.Should be noted that MS needs above-mentioned recognition data (comprising DCD, UCD) to carry out the communication with any kind of neighbour BS.This communication can relate to scanning with related, and the switching of neighbour BS combines in the same way.Those skilled in the art will recognize that the process of describing among the present invention also can be used to quicken the communication between MS and the neighbour BS, and will this communication not interrelate with switching.
Especially, the present invention adds UCD and DCD data between MS and serving BS broadcasts, send during the startup handover process request and response message.This message can be included in scan request message, BS switching response message or the BS handoff request message of sending between serving BS broadcasts and the MS.Those skilled in the art can find out, for obtaining benefit of the present invention, needn't modifying target BS and serving BS broadcasts or target BS and MS between communication.In one embodiment of the invention, up-to-date UCD from serving BS to the MS notice and the DCD data handled by.In other embodiments, target BS is to the change of serving BS broadcasts notice UCD and DCD, and these changes are sent to MS then.
Serving BS broadcasts can utilize switching response message (for MS that start with network-assisted switching) or handoff request message (for network startup or directed switching); Send unicast messages to MS; This unicast messages comprises the data of the specific objective BS that is used to switch, and these data comprise channel descriptor.In 802.16 environment, the MOB-NBR_ADV MAC administrative messag that this can additional object BS is together with MOB_BSHO_REQ or MOB_BSHO_RSP MAC administrative messag.
In another embodiment, serving BS broadcasts is coordinated the switching timing (or any kind communication) with target BS, thereby MS just provides recognition data (comprising DCD, UCD) by target BS with target BS communication at the beginning.When their channel descriptor (for example UCD and DCD) is launched in candidate target BS set, the sweep spacing that serving BS broadcasts is specific for the user sets up, it combines with frame.This relates to the communication between BS, thereby BS has their neighbours' timing data.This can carry out with the form of request-response.
For target BS, the keynote system and the encoding scheme that are used for system broadcast message are sent downlink map, uplink map and channel descriptor.In 802.16, downlink map is a system broadcast message.Carry out the position during the entering again of this permission MS after switching and upgrade, and during initial the entering, decode UCD and uplink map, and the DCD that do not decode.In this way, MS can get into the random access part with the minimum delay.In addition, with identical periodicity transmitting channel descriptor, but can in different frame, send.In 802.16 systems, UCD should quite closely follow DCD, thereby has considered the time of MS decoding DCD and UCD.
For MS, perhaps store and obtain channel descriptor through intelligent scanning through unicast messages.In 802.16 systems, need UCD to confirm random access procedure and uplink map.These data have been pointed out some following transmission ranges.Based on the applicability of following uplink map, the uplink map of storage few frames when predicting decoding UCD, thus when receiving DCD, again the UCD that stores is decoded, and can start random access procedure.
Based on above content, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that channel descriptor earlier can be used for MS.This has improved with channel descriptor and has obtained the delay that is associated., serving BS broadcasts when MS sends these, during switching itself, need not wait channel descriptor before switching.When the communication between MS and the target BS regularly is set to can realize identical effect in time that MS at first is transferred to target BS during the broadcast channel descriptor.For 802.16 systems, can under the situation that does not wait DCD, carry out random access procedure as early as possible.
Forward accompanying drawing to, and begin, show the simplified block diagram of wireless communication system 100, wherein show for the element of explaining the system 100 that the present invention is necessary, and do not illustrate for understanding the optional element of the present invention from Fig. 1.Wireless communication system 100 of the present invention relates to by IEEE to be supported and standardized ofdm communication system, such as 802.xx, and especially, relate to 802.16 with the 802.16e system.Yet the principle of the invention goes for any wireless communication system, comprises global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), general mobile technology system (UMTS) and other this systems.
As known, system 100 is divided into a plurality of sub-district 102a-102g.Each sub-district 102a-102g given area in system provides by the radio communication service that any known protocol provided that comprises 802.16.Each sub-district 102a-102g comprises base station (BS) 104a-104g, and it provides known service and ability to system 100, and in particular to sub-district that BS 104-104g is served.Each BS 104a-104g has many assemblies, such as transmitter 108, receiver 110, antenna 112 be used to provide other assemblies of 802.16 system communication abilities.Other BS communications in each BS 104a-104g homologous ray 100.Although BS any other BS communication in can homologous ray 100.But the present invention relates to handoff procedure, and therefore relate to the ability of BS with neighbour's base station communication.
In handoff procedure, the mobile radio station (MS) 106 that is connected to system through session or calling moves to neighbor cell 102b from a sub-district 102a.Other similar with BS, that MS also comprises transmitter 114, receiver 116 and antenna 118 and is used to provide MS communication capacity in the system 100 assemblies.Yet in the 102a of sub-district, BS 104a provides MS106 to get into the link of system, communicates by letter with non-voice thereby MS106 can utilize wireless communication system 106 to be used for voice in known manner.With regard to its character, MS106 is a mobile device, and can move to neighbor cell 102b-102g by 102a from the sub-district.As known; When MS106 from a sub-district during to the motion of another sub-district; Carry out handoff procedure, MS106 is shifted from the BS (in environment of the present disclosure, being known as target BS 104b) of BS (environment of the present disclosure, being known as serving BS broadcasts 104a) in Target cell 102b that is currently serviced in MS106.Equally, in environment of the present disclosure, the BS that serves neighbor cell will be called as neighbour BS.
Fig. 2 has explained the part known, MS106 switched to the prior art call flow process 200 of target BS 104b from serving BS broadcasts 104a like 802.16 signal posts.Predicting from serving BS broadcasts 104a when target BS 104b switches, carrying out from serving BS broadcasts 104a before the actual switching of target BS 104b, the assembly in the system transmits and receives a series of handover process message.These handover process message provide data between BS and MS, thereby each station has the required data that are used to carry out switching.As the part of handover process message, serving BS broadcasts 104a can send 202 switchings and prenotice/related rank 2 request messages.In response to this request, target BS 104b through switching prenotice/related rank 2 replys 204.This is replied and comprises that multiple parameter, this parameter comprise related rank 2 parameters of target BS 104b.Between MS106 and serving BS broadcasts 104a, MS106 can send 206 a series of mobility scan request message.Send 206 these mobility scan request message by MS with known given interval; And these mobility scan request message are used as the part of the notice of MS106, and this notice is that MS106 is moving to more near position from neighbor cell to BS 104a-104g notice MS106 and MS.
As shown in Figure 2, can after request of prenoticing of the switching between serving BS broadcasts 104a and the target BS 104b and response message, send mobility scan request message.When serving BS broadcasts 104b knew that target BS 104a prepares to switch, serving BS broadcasts 104b utilized the mobility scanning response message that sends to MS106, and scan request is responded 208.Mobility scanning response message comprises that serving BS broadcasts 104b is from receiving related rank 2 parameters that BS 104b receives.Through these data, MS106 sends 210 message to target BS 104b, to carry out related rank 2 operations.In 2 operating periods of related rank (association level), MS106 and target BS 104b are synchronous in known manner.Especially, MS must at first be synchronized with the frame structure of target BS, and checks whether its available channel descriptor is still used by this BS.If not, then before MS can launch or receive any message, it need wait target BS broadcast channel descriptor (UCD/DCD).When obtaining correct channel descriptor, MS sends association messages to target BS.
After target BS 104b received related 2 message, it sent 212 related rank 2 responses to serving BS broadcasts 104a, points out that target BS 104b prepares to switch.Serving BS broadcasts 104a sends 214 mobility base station handoff request message to MS 106 then, and this message points out that to MS106 serving BS broadcasts 104a and target BS 104b prepare to switch.As response; MS106 sends 216 switch indicating information to serving BS broadcasts 104a; And MS106 and target BS 104b carry out 218 switchings then; Thereby now carry out the communication between MS106 and the system 100, thereby BS 104b serves system 100 now through target BS 104b rather than serving BS broadcasts 104a.Handover process 218 also requires MS to have available up-to-date channel and describes (comprising DCD/UCD).If it is outmoded (that is, no longer being used by target BS) channel descriptor that MS has, then MS can to/before any message of its transmission/receptions, it must wait target BS once more and broadcast these data.
Can find out that the process of more than describing is not provided for the channel descriptor of target BS 104b is offered in time the mechanism of MS106.Even now, MS106 can decode rule downlink transmission with can in up link, launch before, need the decode channel descriptor of downlink map and uplink map of target BS of MS106.The down link and the uplink channel descriptor of target BS are periodically launched by target BS, and are also launched in particular type MAC administrative messag (being called as mobility neighbour notice message) by serving BS broadcasts, yet this cycle can be the magnitude of second.As described, between transfer period, MS106 must wait these descriptors, and this waits and can cause interrupting (outage).
As known, can start in the different location of any number the system 100 to the switching of another BS from a BS, include but not limited to serving BS broadcasts 104a or MS106.Forward Fig. 3 to, show handoff procedure of the present invention from the angle of serving BS broadcasts.The present invention relates to such notion, promptly, they are provided, thereby reduced the chance of stand-by period and delay and interruption to MS106 at the correct time of downlink channel descriptor that needs target BS 104b and uplink channel descriptor.This realizes through following manner: in the message of between the multiple systems assembly that receives the handoff procedure influence, sending, downlink channel descriptor and uplink channel descriptor are provided.Through UCD and DCD are provided, MS need not wait up to by target BS broadcasting or by target BS 104b to serving BS broadcasts 104a and send periodic up link and downlink channel descriptor to MS106 subsequently.Therefore, will be in time to MS106 notice UCD and DCD, and upgrade when changing from cycle last time in these parameters, to MS106 the data of change are provided, thereby avoid possible interruption.
Handoff procedure 300 of the present invention starts from switching is prenoticed/and related rank 2 requests send 302 to target BS 104b from serving BS broadcasts 104a.This points out that serving BS broadcasts 104a need switch to neighbour MS with MS106, because serving BS broadcasts 104a no longer can or no longer be willing to mean the connection that MS106 keeps homologous ray 100.The request of prenoticing is sent to the neighbour BS 104b-104g of any number.As response, the target BS 104b among the neighbour BS 104b-104g sends 304 switchings to serving BS broadcasts 104a and prenotices response.In one embodiment of the invention, this response is sent out together with many parameters of target BS 104b, and adds uplink map and downlink map specifically.In another embodiment of the present invention, this response is sent out together with UCD and the DCD of the target BS 104b that adds message to, effectively switches at least one fraction of required channel descriptor because these data are MS106.In the third embodiment of the present invention, mobility neighbour notice message added to prenotice response.In the fourth embodiment of the present invention, target BS comprises that in prenoticing response message this target BS will be to the indication of next time of whole MS broadcasting DCD that are attached thereto and UCD message.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that to the invention is not restricted to add UCD and DCD, but can be used as the part with association messages of prenoticing in other ranks of system protocol to rank 2 association messages.
As described above, MS106 periodically sends mobility scan request message to serving BS broadcasts 104a.Can send these message at any time, thereby they can take place before or after serving BS broadcasts 104a and target BS 104b transmission switching request of prenoticing and response message.When serving BS broadcasts 104a had target BS 104b association rank 2 parameters, serving BS broadcasts 104a added these parameters to service MS 104a and sends 306 mobility scanning response message to MS106.In one embodiment of the invention, serving BS broadcasts 104a carries out switching to UCD and DCD that MS106 sends target BS 104b so that have these parameters.Should be appreciated that the mobility neighbour announces the MAC administrative messag and can be used to comprise UCD and DCD.
Utilize mobility scanning response, MS knows that it is experiencing switching.Therefore, owing to obtained the channel descriptor data through mobility scanning response message, MS can directly send 308 to target BS 104b and carry out related rank 2 message now.Utilization is included in the data of carrying out in related rank 2 message, and target BS 104b sends 310 related rank 2 response messages to serving BS broadcasts 104a, comprises the ranging parameters (ranging parameters) of target BS 104b.Upgrade if desired; Then these ranging parameters are added to message with other data (such as UCD and DCD message) and are sent out, and come update service BS 104a to have utilized any change in these parameters since last time data being offered serving BS broadcasts 104a.Mobility neighbour announces the MAC administrative messag and can be used for adding UCD and DCD to response message.If do not change in these data, can send related rank 2 responses that do not comprise any channel descriptor (such as UCD/DCD) data.
It should be understood by one skilled in the art that serving BS broadcasts 104a has the latest data about target BS 104b, comprises UCD and DCD.Because this is by base station initiated switching, therefore mobility base station handoff request is sent 312 to MS106 from serving BS broadcasts 104a.In one embodiment of the invention, handoff request message is drawn together UCD and the DCD of target BS 104b, and it can be realized through adding mobility neighbour notice message.As response; MS106 sends 314 switch indicating information to serving BS broadcasts 104a; And MS106 and target BS 104b carry out 316 switchings then; Thereby now carry out the communication between MS106 and the system 100, thereby BS 104b serves system 100 now through target BS 104b rather than serving BS broadcasts 104a.Again, because MS has obtained up-to-date channel descriptor data, so it can begin handover process, and not have further channel descriptor to obtain delay through sending message to target BS immediately.
Can also start handover process 400 by mobile radio station, as shown in Figure 4.In this case, MS starts 402 these processes through send mobility mobile radio station handoff request message to BS 104a.This message points out switching to serving BS broadcasts 104a, and switch prenotice/related rank 2 requests are sent out 404 to neighbour BS 104b-104g.In these neighbour BS, target BS will be the BS that service can be provided to MS106, comprising target BS 106.Target BS 104b utilize to switch prenotice response come to serving BS broadcasts 104a notify 406 it can switch.When periodically the transmitting channel descriptor was with other recognition data between neighbour BS 104b-104g, target BS 104b added its UCD and DCD to related rank 2 parameters that are sent to serving BS broadcasts 104a.Like what set forth, UCD and DCD can be parts that is added to mobility neighbour's notice message of prenoticing response.As a part that is scanned response message by the mobility from serving BS broadcasts 104a transmission 408 to MS106, UCD is comprised together with related rank 2 parameters with the DCD parameter, thereby MS has the up-to-date recognition data of target BS 104b.Then, MS can send 410 to target BS 104b immediately and carry out related rank 2 message.As response, target BS 104b sends related rank 2 responses to serving BS broadcasts 104a, upgrades if desired, then adds ranging parameters, UCD, DCD and other recognition data of target BS 104b.
Because this is that therefore, serving BS broadcasts is utilized mobility base station handoff response now, responds 414 to MS106 by the switching of MS106 request.In one embodiment of the invention, serving BS broadcasts 104a sends the recognition data of the target BS 104b that is added to mobility base station switching response message.In another embodiment, serving BS broadcasts 104a adds UCD and DCD data to response message, and MS106 will can not receive, when more evening of this process.In another embodiment, comprise UCD and DCD, as a part that is added to the mobility neighbour's notice message in the response.Therefore, MS106 has enough data and comes under the situation that not have interruption or other delays, to accomplish handover process.Utilize this data, MS106 sends 416 switch indicating information to serving BS broadcasts 104a.Then, MS106 and target BS 104b carry out 418 and switch, thereby now carry out the communication between MS106 and the system 100 through target BS 104b rather than serving BS broadcasts 104a, thereby BS 104b serves system 100 now.
The method of more than describing has been described from target BS 104b and has been transmitted into serving BS broadcasts 104a and is transmitted into the channel descriptor of MS106 then.In further embodiment of this invention, and referring to Fig. 5, MS106 and serving BS broadcasts 104a can will broadcast next time of its channel descriptor to target BS 104b request target BS.Utilize this information, BS 104a can carry out timing to switching or association request, to aim at the airtime.In other words, timing is carried out in related or switching, thereby MS106 will receive data from target BS 104b when target BS 104b broadcasts, and MS can receive it.The timing 500 of present embodiment starts from switching is prenoticed/and related level request sends 502 to target BS 104b from serving BS broadcasts 104a.This points out that serving BS broadcasts 104a need switch to neighbour MS with MS106, because serving BS broadcasts 104a no longer can or no longer be willing to mean the connection that MS106 keeps homologous ray 100.The request of prenoticing is sent to the neighbour BS 104b-104g of any number.As response, the target BS 104b among the neighbour BS 104b-104g sends 504 switchings to serving BS broadcasts 104a and prenotices response, and it can comprise the timing of UCD/DCD broadcasting.
MS106 periodically sends mobility scan request message to serving BS broadcasts 104a.Can send these message at any time, thereby they can take place before or after serving BS broadcasts 104a and MS106 transmission switching request of prenoticing and response message.Have as serving BS broadcasts 104a under the UCD/DCD broadcasting situation regularly of target BS 104b, serving BS broadcasts 104a dispatches the scanning that will take place, thereby MS106 receives the UCD/DCD of broadcasting in the correct time.When MS was transferred to the target BS of the scanning (or related or switching) of being dispatched, according to the timing that is provided by serving BS broadcasts, target BS 104b sent 508 broadcasts to MS106, comprises channel descriptor, such as UCD and DCD.MS106 will receive this broadcast in the known time, and therefore required UCD and DCD effectively switched in reception.
Owing to obtained the channel descriptor data through broadcast, MS can directly send 510 to target BS 104b and carry out related rank 2 message now.Utilization is included in the data of carrying out in related rank 2 message, and target BS 104b sends 512 level of association to serving BS broadcasts 104a and holds your noise and answer message, can comprise the ranging parameters of target BS 104b.These ranging parameters and other data can be added a message and be sent out, and have come update service BS 104a with the change of these parameters since utilizing when offered serving BS broadcasts 104a with data last time.
Because this is by base station initiated switching, therefore mobility base station handoff request is sent 514 to MS106 from serving BS broadcasts 104a.As response, MS106 sends 516 switch indicating information to serving BS broadcasts 104a.In described embodiment, switch the next time of broadcasting 518 channel descriptors by target BS 104b that is timed to.Therefore, MS106 one is transferred to target BS 104b, and it is the broadcast that has channel descriptor of receiving target BS immediately just.After the broadcast with channel descriptor is sent out; MS106 and target BS 104b carry out 520 and switch; Thereby now carry out the communication between MS106 and the system 100, thereby BS 104b serves system 100 now through target BS 104b rather than serving BS broadcasts 104a.Again, because MS has easily obtained up-to-date channel descriptor data, so it can begin handoff procedure, and not have further channel descriptor to obtain delay through sending message to target BS immediately.
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that above description is to be handled by unicast messages to the switching of base station and mobile radio station startup, this unicast messages sends between MS106, serving BS broadcasts 104a and target BS 104b.Also can realize principle of the present invention through between the base station of system 100 and mobile radio station, using broadcast.Fig. 6 has explained process 600, the broadcast of wherein between target BS 104b and serving BS broadcasts 104a and serving BS broadcasts 104a and MS106, periodically sending.Principle of the present invention is; Add the necessary recognition data of target BS 104b to serving BS broadcasts 104a; Such as UCD and DCD; Thereby these data can be used as the part of handoff procedure and are sent to MS106, rather than between sync period, wait the data of directly sending to MS from target BS, and it can cause delay and interrupt.Therefore, recognition data is added to from target BS 104b transmission 602 message to serving BS broadcasts 104a.Utilize the recognition data that upgrades, can add current UCD and DCD details to mobility neighbour's notice message by serving BS broadcasts 104a transmission 604 to MS106.By this way, through during handover process, using this mode of notice message, MS106 has current recognition data, this handover process such as described above and be known 802.16 communications that are used for.
As described, UCD and DCD are added and comprise multiple message, and these message are sent between target BS 104b and serving BS broadcasts 104a and serving BS broadcasts 104a and MS106.In the multiple message of above-mentioned expression, the message of sending to MS106 that reaches of sending between BS 104a and the 104b is made amendment.At first add additional data, be used to indicate for this message whether comprise UCD and DCD.If do not comprise data, then in this message, comprise particular value, for example 00.If only comprise UCD and DCD, then in this message, comprise other values, for example 01.If this message comprises mobility neighbour notice message, then send different value in addition, for example 10.If sent the mobility neighbour, then also comprise type lengths values (tlv), thereby this message can be read in the station that receives this message.
Only comprise in this message under the situation of UCD and DCD that this message comprises UCD configuration change counting and DCD configuration change counting.These change the minimum effective bit that counting can be represented the neighbour BS of current UCD or DCD configuration change counting.This message can also comprise that DCD sets, and it can be adjustable length.It is compound (compound) TLV value that DCD sets, the DCD message that its encapsulation can be launched in the BS downlink channel.This data expectation permission MS is synchronous fast with the BS down link of being announced.DCD sets the DCDTLV value that field will comprise the neighbour, and it is different from the respective value of serving BS broadcasts.For the value that is not comprised, receiving station can suppose that they are identical with the respective value of serving BS broadcasts.Duplicating the BS coding parameter and can be not included in during DCD sets among the neighbour BS.Similarly form will be used for UCD setting TLV.
Comprise in this message under the situation of mobility neighbour announcement, will comprise TLV, thereby the length of this message will be known by receiving station.In addition, mobility neighbour's notice message will be used for target BS, and will comprise UCD at least and the DCD of this BS.It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the modification to institute's describing message can be to mobility scanning response message, mobility base station handoff request message and mobility base station switching response message, thereby MS receives the necessary data about target BS.
It should be noted that; As a part of the present invention; Serving BS broadcasts has following option: promptly; Message (for example the mobility neighbour announces the MAC administrative messag) through (being in a preferred embodiment in same number of frames) of closely closely launching with corresponding message (mobility scanning response message, mobility base station handoff request message and mobility base station switching response message) separates is sent to MS with above-mentioned (about neighbour BS's) data.It should be noted that; As a part of the present invention; Serving BS broadcasts does not need directly to intercom mutually with target BS; And system 100 can have other assembly (not shown), and these other assemblies are as a communication part between the multiple BS and carry out optional a part of handover process for understanding the present invention.Should be noted that in above description, related rank 2 has been carried out specific quoting with related rank 2 message.Those skilled in the art will recognize that identical process can be applied to other association messages of any kind, comprise those message that relate to more than a message.
