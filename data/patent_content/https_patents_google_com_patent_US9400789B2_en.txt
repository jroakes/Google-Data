- the example method 300 will be described in reference to a system that performs method 300 .
- the system can be, for example, the search system 112 described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the system clusters a plurality of resources into one or more resource groups ( 302 ).
- Each of the one or more resource groups is associated with a proper name of an entity.
- the resource groups are clustered on the features of the resources.
- scholarly articles can be clustered based on features that include the titles of the scholarly articles, the places of publication for the scholarly articles, and proper names of the authors of the scholarly articles. Other features can be used. For example, email addresses associated with the authors and affiliations of the authors can help cluster resources into resource groups.
- scholarly articles can be clustered based on the other documents referenced by the scholarly articles and other documents that reference the scholarly articles. References can be links between the scholarly articles and documents.
- Affiliations can be any entity that the author is associated with, e.g., companies, universities, and organizations.
- the features of the first resources are analyzed to determine associations between the resources.
- the resources can be clustered into resource groups based on the determined associations between the resources. For example, resources with similar or identical features are clustered into the same resource groups. Resources with different features are clustered into different resource groups.
- code implementing a conventional clustering algorithm analyzes the features of the resources to determine which resources to cluster into groups.
- clustering algorithms well known and currently available would be suitable.
- Clustering algorithms are available that assigns resources to groups based on a degree of association between the resource and groups.
- the features for resources can be provided to a clustering algorithm.
- the clustering algorithm compares the features for the resources and applies the appropriate learned weights to the features.
- the resulting values are used to calculate association scores between the resources.
- the resulting values can be combined according to a combination function, for example, the values can be added or multiplied together. Resources with association scores above a predetermined threshold are clustered into the same resource groups.
- the system receives an entity query ( 304 ), as described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the system receives an entity query that includes the proper name of a user submitting the entity query.
- the entity query can include the proper name of any natural person.
- the system identifies and ranks one or more resources that satisfy the entity query ( 306 ), as described above with reference to FIG. 1 , and generates a result list of the resources.
- resources can be ordered according to their respective ranks.
- the system ranks the resource groups based on the result list of the one or more resources that satisfy the entity query ( 308 ).
- the system obtains information describing the one or more resources that satisfy the entity query to rank the resource groups.
- the system maps the resources that satisfy the entity query (i.e., resources referenced in the list) to resources in the resource groups.
- the mapping can include matching resources that satisfy the entity query to resources in the resource groups to determine the number of matching resources in each of the resource groups.
- the mapping can be based on different identifiers for the resources, e.g., title, URL, tokens, identification numbers, etc.
- the number of matching resources can be used to determine the ranking for a particular resource group.
- a resource group of scholarly articles that contains ten scholarly articles that are also referenced in the result list is ranked higher than a resource group that contains only eight matching scholarly articles.
- the ranking of the resource groups can be additionally dependent on a responsiveness of the matching resources to the entity query.
- the system can obtain a responsiveness level for the matching resource by identifying the ranks or ranking scores calculated by a ranking engine for each of the matched resources in response to the entity query.
- the number of resources in a particular resource group that match resources that satisfy the entity query can be weighted by the ranks or ranking scores of the matched resources.
- the ranks or ranking scores of the matched resources can be averaged and weighted against the number of matched resources. For example, a resource group of scholarly articles that contains ten matched scholarly articles with an average ranking score of 0.8 is ranked higher than another resource group that also contains ten matched scholarly articles but with a lower average ranking score for the matched articles.
- the ranking of the resource groups can be based on a matching of the proper names of the entities associated with the resource groups and the proper name of the entity that is included in the entity query. Because there are different ways to partition and structure the same proper name, different heuristics are used to restructure the different forms of the same proper name to first identify the closest match for the proper names. For example, in English naming convention, American inventor Thomas Alva Edison can be referred to as “Thomas Edison” or “Edison, T. A.” To determine the best match, the proper names are restructured in different variations until the closet match for the proper names is found.
- Some heuristics include matching the full names as is, matching the names after the different parts in the name have been exchanged, matching the last names and a prefix or abbreviation for the other names, matching a prefix for the last name and an exact or prefix or abbreviated match for the other names.
- Other heuristics can be used. For example, the above heuristics can be repeated for different partitions of the names or a combination of the described heuristics can be used. In the above example, exchanging the placement of “Thomas” and “Edison.” and using an abbreviation for “Thomas” in “Thomas Edison” produces “Edison T,” the most similar match to “Edison, T. A.”
- an entity matching score can be calculated for each resource group.
- the entity matching score is a measure of how similar the matched proper names are. In some implementations, the entity matching score is proportional to the number of characters that match between the two names. Punctuation marks, e.g., periods, commas, can be ignored. Other methods for calculating the entity matching score can be used. For example, the proper name of an entity associated with a resource group and the entity included in the entity query can be partitioned into different components, e.g., last name, first name, and suffix.
- the partitions for the proper name of the group are matched with the respective partitions for the proper name of the entity query.
- a partition matching score is calculated for each of the matched partition pairs.
- the partition matching score for a matched partition pair can be a weighted combination of the length of the partition and the number of characters that match in the partition pair.
- the entity matching score for the resource group is a weighted sum of the individual partition matching scores.
- Resource groups can be ranked accordingly to their entity matching scores. For example, resource groups with greater entity matching scores are ranked higher than resource groups with lower entity matching scores.
- the ranking of the resource groups is based on the number of matching resources, rank or ranking score for each of the matching resources, and the entity matching score for the respective resource groups.
- Ranking scores for the resource groups can be calculated using a combination function, e.g., a weighted sum, of the number of matching resources, sum of the ranks or ranking scores for each of the matching resources, and the entity matching score for the respective first resource group.
- the resource groups can then be ranked according to their respective ranking scores.
- additional signals can be used to rank the resource groups. For example, the different signals used to rank the resources in response to the entity query can be used.
- the system provides the one or more resource groups ( 310 ), as described in more detail above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the one or more resource groups can be provided to a client device, which can then display the resource groups to a user.
- the resource groups can be displayed in an order based the rankings for the resource groups. For example, resource groups with greater rankings are displayed before the resource groups with lower rankings.
- the system can generate profiles that include the resources from the selected resource groups.
- the system receives a user selection of one or more of the provided resource groups. The selection can be effected, for example, by presenting resource groups in a graphical user interface to the user and prompting selection of resources by the user.
- the system In response to receiving the selections, the system generates a profile that includes the resources that are in the selected resource groups.
- the user can select specific resources in the provided resource groups.
- the system In response to receiving the specific resource selections, the system generates a profile that includes the specific selected resources. In other implementations, the system automatically generates a profile without receiving selections from the user.
- the system can automatically generate a profile with resources from the top n-ranked resource groups, where n is a predetermined integer. For example, the system automatically generates a profile including resources from the three highest ranked resource groups.
- the generated profiles can be associated with the entity identified in the entity query.
- the generated profile can be associated with the user, whose proper name is identified in the entity query, that submitted the entity query and selected the resources.
- the generated profile can be associated with any natural person whose proper name was specified in the entity query.
- the system can automatically generate profiles for a list of received proper names. For example, instead of providing the system with an entity query, a user can provide the system with a list of proper names. The system can treat each provided proper name as an individual entity query. The system identifies and ranks resource groups for each of the proper names, as described above. The system can then automatically generate a profile for each of the proper names, using the ranked resource groups for the respective proper names. For example, a profile can be automatically generated for a proper name with resources from the top n-ranked resource groups for the proper name, where n is a predetermined integer.
- the user can manually remove resources that the system added to the user's profile.
- the user can also manually add resources that the system did not include in the user's profile.
- These removals and additions are feedback signals that suggest that the clustering algorithm used to generate the resource groups selected by the user was inaccurate in the clustering of resources into resource groups. If the user is removing resources, then the statistical model is over-inclusive and associating resources that should not be associated in resource groups. On the other hand, if the user is adding resources, then the statistical model is under-inclusive and not associating resources that should be associated in resource groups.
- the clustering algorithm can be modified based on these feedback signals. For example, the removed or added resources can be analyzed to determine common features in the removed or added resources.
- the clustering algorithm can modify the weights applied to the determined common features. For example, the weights for common features in removed resources can be decreased. Alternatively, the weights for common features in added resources can be increased.
- the modified statistical model can be used to generate new resource groups for just the user that generated the feedback signals. In other implementations, the modified statistical model can be used to generate new resource groups for a population of users.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example graphical user interface for generating profiles from resource groups.
- a search engine clusters documents in an index database of scholarly articles into document groups.
- the documents are clustered according to similarities in scholarly articles features, e.g., titles, places of publication, and proper names of authors.
- Each document group is also associated with an entity associated with the document group, for example, the author of the scholarly articles in the document group.
- entity queries can consist of an author's proper name, and other information associated with an author, for example, an author's affiliations and email address.
- the search engine identifies documents that satisfy the entity query from the term index database of scholarly articles.
- the identified documents are used to rank the document groups.
- a combination function is used to generate a ranking score for each of the document groups.
- the combination function combines the number of matching documents, the rank or ranking score for each of the matching documents, and the entity matching score for the respective document groups.
- the document groups are ranked according to their ranking scores and presented in order of the ranking to the author.
- Document groups 404 , 406 , 408 , and 410 are presented to the author in response to the query “Stephen Hawking” 402 .
- the document groups 404 , 406 , 408 , and 410 are presented in order of their rankings
- Document group 404 is the top ranked document group and document group 408 is the lowest ranked document group.
- Each document group is represented in the graphical user interface.
- Each group can be represented by the entity the document group is associated with, by example documents from the document group, or both.
- the displayed associated entity is “Stephen W Hawking” 410
- text describing example documents in document group 404 “The large scale structure of space-time” 412 and “Particle creation by black holes” 414 is displayed.
- example documents 412 and 414 are presented with additional information, for example, an author list, date of publication, and publication source for the documents.
- the author can identify and select the document groups that the author believes should be associated with him.
- the system In response to the selection, the system generates a profile for the author, where the profile includes scholarly articles in the selected document groups. For example, the author can identify that document group 404 should be associated with him. The author can select “Add all 427 articles” button 416 . In response, all scholarly articles in document group 404 are added to a profile that is generated for the author.
- a search engine clusters resources that are found on one or more social networks or one or more networks, e.g., the Internet.
- the resources can include photos, videos, songs, news articles, messages, postings, or any other kind of resource that is shared or interacted with on one or more social networks or on the Internet.
- Resources that are associated with a person are clustered into a resource group.
- the resource group is further associated with a proper name of the person that is associated with the resources in the resource group.
- Associations with resources can also include any type of interaction with the resources.
- Example associations with resources include the uploading, sharing, posting, viewing, listening, and expressing approval of resources.
- videos that have been watched, songs that have been liked, and messages that have been sent by a person can be clustered into a resource group for the person.
- photos tagged with the person can also be clustered into the resource group for the person.
- a user can perform a search for a person of interest.
- the query can include the proper name of the person of interest.
- a search engine performs a search for the proper name and identifies resources that satisfy the search query.
- the identified resources are used to rank the resource groups.
- a combination function is used to generate a ranking score for each of the document groups.
- the combination function combines the number of matching resources, the rank or ranking score for each of the matching resources, and the entity matching score for the respective resource groups.
- the resource groups are ranked according to their ranking scores.
- the resources in the top ranked resource group are presented to the user. For example, the user is presented with pictures that the person of interested is tagged in, media that the person of interest has viewed, and messages that the person of interest has posted.
- the resources in the top n-ranked resource groups are presented to the user, where n is a non-negative integer.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example method for updating resources associated with an entity.
- the example method 500 will be described in reference to a system that performs method 500 .
- the system can be, for example, the search system 112 described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the system clusters a plurality of resources into one or more resource groups ( 502 ).
- a clustering algorithm can analyze the features of the resources to determine which resources to cluster into groups, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system identifies a profile ( 504 ).
- the profile can be associated with an entity that represents a particular natural person.
- the profile contains one or more resources that are already associated with the entity.
- the system calculates a correspondence score for each of the resource groups ( 506 ).
- the system determines a correspondence score between each of the resource groups and the identified profile.
- the correspondence score for a particular resource group represents a level of correspondence between the resources in the particular resource group and the resources included in the profile.
- the system determines different signals that the correspondence score for the particular resource group can be derived from. For example, the system can determine the number of resources, X 1 , that are both in the particular resource group and in the profile. Additionally, the system can determine the number of resources, X 2 , that are in the particular resource group that have been removed from the profile. Additionally, the system can determine the number of resources, X 3 , that are in the particular resource group that have never been associated with the profile.
- the system can determine an entity matching score, X 4 , which represents a level of matching between the proper name of the entity associated with the particular resource group and a proper name of the entity associated with the profile.
- entity matching score X 4
- the method of calculating the entity matching score is described above in reference to FIG. 3 .
- the correspondence score, CS can be calculated as a function of these different variables.
- Resources that are already included in the profile can be found in multiple resource groups.
- these resources are assigned to one specific resource group when determining the correspondence scores for the different resource groups.
- these resources are assigned to the specific resource group that maximizes a resource group assignment score.
- the assignment score, AS can be calculated as a function of the same above variables.
- the system adds the resources in the particular resource group to the profile ( 510 ).
- a subset of the resources in the particular resource group may already be associated with the profile. In some implementations, only those resources that are not already in the profile are added to the profile.
- entity user can choose to receive profile update notifications. For example, when a profile is updated with new resources, the user interested in the profile, which can be the natural person the entity represents, can be notified of the changes.
- An example implementation of method 500 is the addition of scholarly articles to a profile of an author of the scholarly articles.
- a search engine clusters documents in an index database of scholarly articles into document groups, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- Each document group is also associated with an entity associated with the document group, for example, the author of the scholarly articles in the document group.
- the system then identifies different profiles for different authors. Each profile contains scholarly articles authored by the author that the profile is for. The system determines a correspondence between each of the different profiles and document groups. A correspondence score is calculated for each profile and document group pair. The correspondence score represents a correspondence level between the scholarly articles in the profile and document group. For example, the correspondence score for a profile and document group pair can be calculated from the number of scholarly articles that are in both the document group and profile, the number of scholarly articles that are in the document group but have never been in the profile, and the number of scholarly articles that are in the document group but have been removed from the profile.
- Document groups and profiles with correspondence scores that satisfy a threshold are determined to correspond.
- the scholarly articles in the document groups that correspond to a profile are added to the profile, thereby associating the author associated with the profile with the additional scholarly articles.
- An electronic document which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document, may, but need not, correspond to a file.
