DETAILED DESCRIPTION
A user using an Internet search engine to search for resources generally has social interests (e.g., interests in the resources about or generated by other people, or otherwise associated with other people) that are different from the social interests of a general population of users. For example, the user can have an interest in resources that are associated with people having a relationship to the user that is reflected in an online social network such people will be referred to collectively as the user's social affinity group. A picture of people is presumably more interesting to a user if the picture is of the members than if it is of people who have no relationship with the user.
A user can also have a social interest in resources endorsed by a member of the user's
3 social affinity group. For example, a user is more likely to be interested in an article endorsed by a member of the user's social affinity group than an article that was not.
To reflect this social interest, a search result that includes the picture can be ranked higher for the user than for the general population of users. A social search engine is capable of identifying resources that are likely to be of social interest to the user (social search results) in addition to search results of general interest (general search results).
Generally, a resource may, but need not, correspond to a file. A resource may be stored in a portion of a file that holds other resources, in a single file dedicated to the resource in question, or in multiple coordinated files. A user can grant permission (opt-in) and allow a system to identify associations between the user and resources. For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in or opt out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's contributions to social content providers). User may also be informed of the accompanying limitations on the functionality of a service that may result from limiting access to such personal information. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user and so that any identified user preferences or user interactions are generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user.
A social network site is an online service or platform on the World Wide Web that enables users to build social networks with other users. These social networks can be based on personal or professional relationships, for example. Users of social network sites can post updates and communicate with each other through the site.
Social network sites generally include resources, e.g., web pages, that are crawled and indexed by Internet search engines. Such resources, having a uniform resource locator (URL) that includes, as the host name, a domain name associated with the social network site, will be referred to as being located on the social network site.
A user searching for a social network site on a search engine is likely to be interested in resources relating to members of the users social affinity group found on the social network site
To reflect this social interest, a search result that includes the picture can be ranked higher for the user than for the general population of users. A social search engine is capable of identifying resources that are likely to be of social interest to the user (social search results) in addition to search results of general interest (general search results).

A social network site is an online service or platform on the World Wide Web that enables users to build social networks with other users. These social networks can be based on personal or professional relationships, for example. Users of social network sites can post updates and communicate with each other through the site.
Social network sites generally include resources, e.g., web pages, that are crawled and indexed by Internet search engines. Such resources, having a uniform resource locator (URL) that includes, as the host name, a domain name associated with the social network site, will be referred to as being located on the social network site.
A user searching for a social network site on a search engine is likely to be interested in resources relating to members of the users social affinity group found on the social network site
4 FIG. 1 illustrates an example social affinity group 100 of a user 102.
Generally, a social affinity group is a group of other users with whom the user has a relationships known by the social search system. As used in this specification, the term "member"
refers to a member of the user's social affinity group. The social affinity group of the user includes a first member 104 identified by the user 102. The user 102 can identify the first member 104 in, for example, a user profile. A user profile can include, for example, a list of members of the user's social affinity group. The user profile can also include information that identifies social network sites in which the user participates.
The social affinity group 100 of the user 102 also includes a group of members 108 related to the user 102 according to a social network site. In some implementations the user 102 identifies himself as a member of a social network site. With permission from the user 102, the social network site can be examined to identify the members on the social network site (e.g., the members 110a, 110b, 110c, 110d).
The social affinity group 100 of the user 102 can also include others indirectly related to the user 102. For example, the social affinity group 100 of the user 102 includes an individual 106 who is indirectly related to the user 102 through the first member 104 of the user. In this example, the both the user 102 and the first member 104 have provided social affinity group information and granted permission for the social affinity group information to be used. Generally, users can select whether or not to establish a social affinity group. Users can also either opt in or opt out of having the social affinity information used.
The social affinity group of the user can also include groups of members. For example, the social affinity group of the user can include a group of co-workers. The group can be defined in the user's user profile based on a place of employment. In some implementations, the user identifies himself as an employee of a company;
the user can then be identified with a group of others employed by the same company. In other implementations, the user can identify the co-workers as being members of a group in the user profile. Other groups can also be identified, for example, class mates, fraternity / sorority members, club memberships, professional organizations, social clubs, or fan clubs. In general, a user can select which personal information he or she wishes to be used to establish social affinity groups. For example, one user may elect to use high school as a membership criterion for social affinity groups and another user may elect not to use high school as a membership criterion for a social affinity groups.
Generally, a social affinity group is a group of other users with whom the user has a relationships known by the social search system. As used in this specification, the term "member"
refers to a member of the user's social affinity group. The social affinity group of the user includes a first member 104 identified by the user 102. The user 102 can identify the first member 104 in, for example, a user profile. A user profile can include, for example, a list of members of the user's social affinity group. The user profile can also include information that identifies social network sites in which the user participates.
The social affinity group 100 of the user 102 also includes a group of members 108 related to the user 102 according to a social network site. In some implementations the user 102 identifies himself as a member of a social network site. With permission from the user 102, the social network site can be examined to identify the members on the social network site (e.g., the members 110a, 110b, 110c, 110d).
The social affinity group 100 of the user 102 can also include others indirectly related to the user 102. For example, the social affinity group 100 of the user 102 includes an individual 106 who is indirectly related to the user 102 through the first member 104 of the user. In this example, the both the user 102 and the first member 104 have provided social affinity group information and granted permission for the social affinity group information to be used. Generally, users can select whether or not to establish a social affinity group. Users can also either opt in or opt out of having the social affinity information used.
The social affinity group of the user can also include groups of members. For example, the social affinity group of the user can include a group of co-workers. The group can be defined in the user's user profile based on a place of employment. In some implementations, the user identifies himself as an employee of a company;
the user can then be identified with a group of others employed by the same company. In other implementations, the user can identify the co-workers as being members of a group in the user profile. Other groups can also be identified, for example, class mates, fraternity / sorority members, club memberships, professional organizations, social clubs, or fan clubs. In general, a user can select which personal information he or she wishes to be used to establish social affinity groups. For example, one user may elect to use high school as a membership criterion for social affinity groups and another user may elect not to use high school as a membership criterion for a social affinity groups.
5 In this example, the first user may be associated with other users who attended the same high school and also selected to use high school as a membership criterion.
The social affinity group can also include others who have other relationships with the user. For example, in some implementations, a social affinity group of the user can include the contributors to blogs or micro-blogs to which the user subscribes.
In some implementations, a social affinity group of the user can include others with whom the user has had email correspondence, others identified in the users address book, and others in an instant messaging contact list.
FIG. 2 illustrates an example system 200 for the presentation of social search results. A client device 202, for example, a personal computer executing a web browser, sends a query 204 to a search system 206. The search system 206 can include multiple computers in multiple locations. The query can be sent over a network, for example, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.
The query can be sent using conventional network communication protocols, for example, as a Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) request.
A query processor 208 on the search system 206 receives the query 204. The query processor 208 sends the query to a social network site identifier 212.
The social network site identifier is a component of the search system 206 that determines if the query 204 corresponds to a known social network site. In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 compares the query 204 to a social network site data source 214. The social network site data source 214 can be, for example, a white list that includes names of social network sites, in another example the white list may also contain commonly used abbreviations of social network sites. In general, a white list is a list of entities that are recognized as being members of a particular class, in this example, the white list is a list of known social network sites. The social network site data source 214 can also be other data structures, for example, a table in a relational database.
In some implementations, the social network site data source 214 can include a table that maps the query 204 or individual query terms within the query 204 to a social network site. In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 only compares the query 204 to the social network site data source 214 if the query meets threshold criteria, for example, if the query is short (e.g., one word).
The social affinity group can also include others who have other relationships with the user. For example, in some implementations, a social affinity group of the user can include the contributors to blogs or micro-blogs to which the user subscribes.
In some implementations, a social affinity group of the user can include others with whom the user has had email correspondence, others identified in the users address book, and others in an instant messaging contact list.

In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 only compares the query 204 to the social network site data source 214 if the query meets threshold criteria, for example, if the query is short (e.g., one word).
6 In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 can identify social network sites based on an analysis of historic user activity. Social network sites can be identified as domains or webs ites that produce a relatively high number of social search results. For example, if, historically, the domain www.socialsite.com appears frequently in social search results, then the social network site identifier 212 can determine that www.socialsite.com is a social network site. Generally, users can grant permission to the search system to identify social site results. Social site results can also be identified anonymously (e.g. without reference to the user who executed the query). In some implementations, a count of social search results associated with a web site can be tallied. If the number of social search results exceeds a threshold then the web site is considered a social network site.
In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 generates a list of social network sites periodically. For example, the social network site identifier may generate the content of the social network site data source 214 daily, weekly, or monthly.
In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 identifies queries that correspond to social network sites based on an analysis of historic user activity. If a statistically significant number of users select a known social network site after submitting a particular query, then that particular query is determined to correspond to the social network site. In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 stores the particular query and an indication of the social network site to which it corresponds in the social network site data source 214.
In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 identifies social network sites based on an analysis of the resources found on the site. For example, web sites that contain a large number of resources that are tagged as belonging to a member of the site can be identified as social network sites. Similarly, web sites where a large percentage of the resource found on the site are tagged as belonging to a member of the site can be identified as social network sites.
The social network site identifier 212 can also determine that the query 204 corresponds to a known social network site in other ways. In some implementations, with the user's permission, the social network site identifier 212 analyzes a user's history (e.g., as reflected in a session log) to determine that the current query is likely related to a social network site. For example, if the user has recently searched for a
In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 generates a list of social network sites periodically. For example, the social network site identifier may generate the content of the social network site data source 214 daily, weekly, or monthly.
In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 identifies queries that correspond to social network sites based on an analysis of historic user activity. If a statistically significant number of users select a known social network site after submitting a particular query, then that particular query is determined to correspond to the social network site. In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 stores the particular query and an indication of the social network site to which it corresponds in the social network site data source 214.
In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 identifies social network sites based on an analysis of the resources found on the site. For example, web sites that contain a large number of resources that are tagged as belonging to a member of the site can be identified as social network sites. Similarly, web sites where a large percentage of the resource found on the site are tagged as belonging to a member of the site can be identified as social network sites.
The social network site identifier 212 can also determine that the query 204 corresponds to a known social network site in other ways. In some implementations, with the user's permission, the social network site identifier 212 analyzes a user's history (e.g., as reflected in a session log) to determine that the current query is likely related to a social network site. For example, if the user has recently searched for a
7 social network site then the current query may also be determined to be about a social network site. In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 may apply conventional spelling correction algorithms to the query to determine if the query is likely a misspelling of a name or abbreviation of a social network site. In another implementation, the social network site data source 214 can include common misspellings of the names and abbreviations of social network sites. In some implementations, the social network site identifier 212 can determine that the query 204 corresponds to a known social network site based on an analysis of prior user activity.
For example, if a significant number of prior users (e.g. greater than a threshold number) selected search results that reference resources on a social network site after submitting the query 204, then the query is determined to correspond to that social network site. For example, if social site www.socialnetworksite. com is among the result shown for the query "friends of the social network" and users consistently selects the www.socialnetworksite.com result, then one may infer that the query is corresponds to www.socialnetworksite.com. In some implementations, users can opt in or opt out from having search history used to identify social network sites. In other implementations the search history is anonymized such that individual user activity is not identifiable.
In some implementations, the query processor 208 can interact with a login service 210. The login service provides an identifier describing the user of the client device 202. In other implementations, the user of the client device 202 is identified by a conventional social search engine, for example the social search engine 218.
In response to determining that the social network site identifier 212 identified a social network site associated with the query 204, the query processor 208 creates a social query 216 based on the query 204 and sends the social query 216 to the social search engine 218. In some implementations, the social query 216 is also based on the user identified by the login service 210. For example, the query processor can create the social query 216 by appending a parameter to the query 204. The parameter instructs the social search engine 218 to perform a search that includes social search results.
In other implementations, the query processor 208 can send multiple requests to the social search engine. The first request requests general search results responsive to
For example, if a significant number of prior users (e.g. greater than a threshold number) selected search results that reference resources on a social network site after submitting the query 204, then the query is determined to correspond to that social network site. For example, if social site www.socialnetworksite. com is among the result shown for the query "friends of the social network" and users consistently selects the www.socialnetworksite.com result, then one may infer that the query is corresponds to www.socialnetworksite.com.

In other implementations, the user of the client device 202 is identified by a conventional social search engine, for example the social search engine 218.
In response to determining that the social network site identifier 212 identified a social network site associated with the query 204, the query processor 208 creates a social query 216 based on the query 204 and sends the social query 216 to the social search engine 218. In some implementations, the social query 216 is also based on the user identified by the login service 210. For example, the query processor can create the social query 216 by appending a parameter to the query 204. The parameter instructs the social search engine 218 to perform a search that includes social search results.
In other implementations, the query processor 208 can send multiple requests to the social search engine. The first request requests general search results responsive to
8 the query 204. The second request requests social search results responsive to the query 204.
The social search engine 218 produces a set of search results 220 responsive to the query 204 using conventional means. Each of the search results references a resource. In some implementations, each search result is associated with a score, which is a measure of the quality of the resource and the responsiveness of the resource to the query. In some implementations, social search results include tags or attributes that identify the social search results as social search results and that identify the social relationship between the user and the resource referenced by the search result.
An output packager 222 receives the search results 220. The output packager 222 is a component of the search system 206 that orders and formats the search results producing formatted search results 224 for presentation to the user. For example, the output packager can place social search results that reference resources on the social network site that corresponds to the query 204 in proximity to a search result that references a home page of that social network site. In some implementations, the social search results are placed immediately after the social network search result.
In some implementations, the social search results are nested underneath the social network search result. In some implementations, the social search results are presented in line with the social network search result.
In some implementations, the output packager 222 examines the social search result and determines a category for the resource referenced by the examined social search result. Based on the determined category, the output packager 222 can place the social search result. For example, a social search result that references a user profile can be placed in line with the social network search result and a social search result that references a user post can be nested under the social network search result.
Generally, a user profile is a user's primary page on the social network site. The user profile can include user posts or references to user posts. A user post is a resource created by the user (e.g., a blog entry, a micro-blog entry, or a status update).
In some implementations, a maximum number of social search results are formatted for presentation. For example, the output packager 222 can place up to a maximum threshold number of social search results in line with the social network search result (e.g., two, four, or six social search results). Similarly, the output packager 222 can place up to a second maximum threshold of social search results
The social search engine 218 produces a set of search results 220 responsive to the query 204 using conventional means. Each of the search results references a resource. In some implementations, each search result is associated with a score, which is a measure of the quality of the resource and the responsiveness of the resource to the query. In some implementations, social search results include tags or attributes that identify the social search results as social search results and that identify the social relationship between the user and the resource referenced by the search result.
An output packager 222 receives the search results 220. The output packager 222 is a component of the search system 206 that orders and formats the search results producing formatted search results 224 for presentation to the user. For example, the output packager can place social search results that reference resources on the social network site that corresponds to the query 204 in proximity to a search result that references a home page of that social network site. In some implementations, the social search results are placed immediately after the social network search result.
In some implementations, the social search results are nested underneath the social network search result. In some implementations, the social search results are presented in line with the social network search result.
In some implementations, the output packager 222 examines the social search result and determines a category for the resource referenced by the examined social search result. Based on the determined category, the output packager 222 can place the social search result. For example, a social search result that references a user profile can be placed in line with the social network search result and a social search result that references a user post can be nested under the social network search result.
Generally, a user profile is a user's primary page on the social network site. The user profile can include user posts or references to user posts. A user post is a resource created by the user (e.g., a blog entry, a micro-blog entry, or a status update).
In some implementations, a maximum number of social search results are formatted for presentation. For example, the output packager 222 can place up to a maximum threshold number of social search results in line with the social network search result (e.g., two, four, or six social search results). Similarly, the output packager 222 can place up to a second maximum threshold of social search results
9 nested under the social network search result (e.g., two, four, six, eight, or ten search results). In some implementations, social search results that are not placed in proximity to the social network search result (e.g., nested under or inline) are discarded and not presented to the user.
In some implementations, social search results can be placed in proximity to the social network search result whenever a social network search result appears in a set of search results. For example, anytime a query returns a search result that reference www.socialnetworksite.com social search results referencing resources on www.socialnetworksite.com can be placed in proximity to the social network search result.
In some implementations, social search results that reference user posts can be excluded from presentation by the output packager 222 based on the age of the user post. For example, the output packager 222 can exclude social search results that reference user posts if the user posts are older than a threshold age (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 7 days). In some implementations, the output packager 222 can exclude search results that reference user posts based on the type of user post and a threshold specific to that type. For example, the output packager 222 can exclude social search results that reference micro-blog posts created 2 days ago, status updates created 1 day ago, blog posts created 7 days ago, and so on.
In some implementations, the threshold age can be based on a measure of the affinity between the user and the creator of the user post. Generally, the greater the affinity between the user and the creator the longer the threshold period (e.g., a blog post may have a threshold of 3 days for most user posts, but the threshold may be increased to 7 days for user posts by creators with a high affinity with the user.
The formatted search results 224 are sent to the client device 202 for presentation to the user.
In some implementations, the determination to add social search results can be based on the generated search results. For example, the output packager 222 may compares search results to a list of known social network sites. The list of social network sites may be a determined by an analysis of user history as discussed above.
For any search result that references a known social network site, the output packager can request social search results. The obtained social search results are integrated with the search results as described above.
FIG. 3 illustrates an example search page presenting links related to a user's social affinity group. A search page 300 can present in a user interface on a client device, for example in a web browser. The search page 300 includes a text input area 302. The user enters a query 308 in the text input area 302 and selects (clicks) a search button 304. The search page sends a request to a search engine as described above). In this example, the server determines that the query 308 corresponds to a social network site, and therefore generates general search results and social search results.
Search results responsive to the query are presented in a separate area 310 of the search page 300. The search results include a social network search result 312 that references the social network site corresponding to the query 308.
Displayed in line with the social network search result 312, the search results include four social search results that reference user profiles on the social network site (Member A's user profile 314, Member B's user profile 318, Member C's user profile 316, and Member D's user profile 320). In this example, the user profile search results are presented in line with the social network search result 312. In some implementations, the social search results are accompanied by a picture of the user whose user profile is identified in the social search result.
In some implementations, search results referencing user profiles are identified based on the URLs associated with the search result. For example, for a social network site "socialnetworksite.com," user profiles can be located in a user profile directory "socialnetworksite.com/userprofile/Member_A.htm." User profiles can also be identified based on the content of the resources referenced by the search result. For example, each user profile page on a social network site may include phrases such as "View Photos of Member" and "Sent Member a Message". Profile pages may also include formatted sections of text, for example an "Information Section" which includes a birthday, a current city or location, or biography.
Nested beneath the social network search result 312 are two search results referencing user posts on the social network site (Member B's journal entry 322 and Member C's journal entry 324). In some implementations, the social search results are accompanied by a picture of the user whose user post is identified in the social search result.
Beneath the two search results referencing user posts are general search results responsive to the query 308 (a social network site ¨ encyclopedia entry 326 and a social network site ¨ stock quote 328.) In some scenarios, user posts can be found on the user profile page and may also be identifiable as distinct resources. For example, the user's profile page may include blog posts, micro-blog posts, and status updates that are all identifiable as distinct resources.
In some implementations, the general search results are examined to ensure that they do not duplicate the social search results. If a general search result references the same resource as a social search result then the general search result is removed from the general search results.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of formatting search results for display. In this example, the social search engine produces a list of search results 400. The list of search results 400 includes a social network search result 402, general search results 406, 410, 412, 414, 416, and social search results including user profile search results 404a, 404b, 404c, 404d, 404e and user post search results 408a, 408b. The search results are listed in an order based on an initial determination of the relevancy of the search result to the query (e.g. sorted based on a score).
Illustrated by process arrow 418, the ranking of the search results 404 is adjusted so that social search results are at the top of the list of search results (e.g. the user profile search results 404a, 404b, 404c, 404d, and 404e and the user post search results 408a, 408b). This may be accomplished, for example, by applying a very large boost to the score associated with the social search result and sorting based on the score. In some implementations, the score for each social search results is given the same boost to maintain the relative order within the social search results.
Illustrated by process arrow 422, the sorted search results 420 are formatted.
The social network search result 402 is identified. The user profiles search results 404a, 404b, 404c, and 404d are in line with the social network search result 402. In this example, the "Member E User Profile" search result 404e is discarded because the system only accepts the first four user profiles. The user post search results 408a and 408b are presented nested under the social search result 402. The remaining general search results are presented subsequently based on the original ordering.
FIG. 5 illustrates an example process for presenting social search results associated with a social network site. For convenience, the process will be described in relation to a search system performing the process.
The process receives a query from a user (502). The query can be sent from a client device being operated by the user (e.g., a personal computer or a smart phone running a suitable web browser). The query can be sent over a network (e.g. a LAN, WAN, or the Internet) using a conventional protocol (e.g., HTTP).
The process determines that the query references a social network site. In some implementations, the query is compared (or substrings of the query are compared) to a white list that contains a list of social network sites. If the query matches an entry in the white list, then the query is determined to reference a social network site.
The process receives search results (506) from a search engine, the search results including general search results that reference resources responsive to the query and social search results that reference resources that are both responsive to the query and associated with other users that are in the social affinity group of the user.
The process identifies a first search result that references the social network site (508). The first search result is identified from among the search results.
The process identifies a second search result that references a resource that is located on the social network site (510).
The process generates a response to the query (512). The response may be, for example, a HTTP Response message. In some implementations, the response can include formatting information to present the first social search result in proximity to the first general search result. As discussed above, in some implementations, the formatting information can include information to present the first social search result can be nested under the first general search result. In some implementations, the formatting information includes information to present first social search result can be in line with the general search result. In some implementations, the response is sent to the client device for presentation to the user.

Thus, particular embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
What is claimed is:
In some implementations, social search results can be placed in proximity to the social network search result whenever a social network search result appears in a set of search results. For example, anytime a query returns a search result that reference www.socialnetworksite.com social search results referencing resources on www.socialnetworksite.com can be placed in proximity to the social network search result.
In some implementations, social search results that reference user posts can be excluded from presentation by the output packager 222 based on the age of the user post. For example, the output packager 222 can exclude social search results that reference user posts if the user posts are older than a threshold age (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 7 days). In some implementations, the output packager 222 can exclude search results that reference user posts based on the type of user post and a threshold specific to that type. For example, the output packager 222 can exclude social search results that reference micro-blog posts created 2 days ago, status updates created 1 day ago, blog posts created 7 days ago, and so on.
In some implementations, the threshold age can be based on a measure of the affinity between the user and the creator of the user post. Generally, the greater the affinity between the user and the creator the longer the threshold period (e.g., a blog post may have a threshold of 3 days for most user posts, but the threshold may be increased to 7 days for user posts by creators with a high affinity with the user.
The formatted search results 224 are sent to the client device 202 for presentation to the user.
In some implementations, the determination to add social search results can be based on the generated search results. For example, the output packager 222 may compares search results to a list of known social network sites. The list of social network sites may be a determined by an analysis of user history as discussed above.
For any search result that references a known social network site, the output packager can request social search results. The obtained social search results are integrated with the search results as described above.
FIG. 3 illustrates an example search page presenting links related to a user's social affinity group. A search page 300 can present in a user interface on a client device, for example in a web browser. The search page 300 includes a text input area 302. The user enters a query 308 in the text input area 302 and selects (clicks) a search button 304. The search page sends a request to a search engine as described above). In this example, the server determines that the query 308 corresponds to a social network site, and therefore generates general search results and social search results.
Search results responsive to the query are presented in a separate area 310 of the search page 300. The search results include a social network search result 312 that references the social network site corresponding to the query 308.
Displayed in line with the social network search result 312, the search results include four social search results that reference user profiles on the social network site (Member A's user profile 314, Member B's user profile 318, Member C's user profile 316, and Member D's user profile 320). In this example, the user profile search results are presented in line with the social network search result 312. In some implementations, the social search results are accompanied by a picture of the user whose user profile is identified in the social search result.
In some implementations, search results referencing user profiles are identified based on the URLs associated with the search result. For example, for a social network site "socialnetworksite.com," user profiles can be located in a user profile directory "socialnetworksite.com/userprofile/Member_A.htm." User profiles can also be identified based on the content of the resources referenced by the search result. For example, each user profile page on a social network site may include phrases such as "View Photos of Member" and "Sent Member a Message". Profile pages may also include formatted sections of text, for example an "Information Section" which includes a birthday, a current city or location, or biography.
Nested beneath the social network search result 312 are two search results referencing user posts on the social network site (Member B's journal entry 322 and Member C's journal entry 324). In some implementations, the social search results are accompanied by a picture of the user whose user post is identified in the social search result.
Beneath the two search results referencing user posts are general search results responsive to the query 308 (a social network site ¨ encyclopedia entry 326 and a social network site ¨ stock quote 328.) In some scenarios, user posts can be found on the user profile page and may also be identifiable as distinct resources. For example, the user's profile page may include blog posts, micro-blog posts, and status updates that are all identifiable as distinct resources.
In some implementations, the general search results are examined to ensure that they do not duplicate the social search results. If a general search result references the same resource as a social search result then the general search result is removed from the general search results.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of formatting search results for display. In this example, the social search engine produces a list of search results 400. The list of search results 400 includes a social network search result 402, general search results 406, 410, 412, 414, 416, and social search results including user profile search results 404a, 404b, 404c, 404d, 404e and user post search results 408a, 408b. The search results are listed in an order based on an initial determination of the relevancy of the search result to the query (e.g. sorted based on a score).
Illustrated by process arrow 418, the ranking of the search results 404 is adjusted so that social search results are at the top of the list of search results (e.g. the user profile search results 404a, 404b, 404c, 404d, and 404e and the user post search results 408a, 408b). This may be accomplished, for example, by applying a very large boost to the score associated with the social search result and sorting based on the score. In some implementations, the score for each social search results is given the same boost to maintain the relative order within the social search results.
Illustrated by process arrow 422, the sorted search results 420 are formatted.
The social network search result 402 is identified. The user profiles search results 404a, 404b, 404c, and 404d are in line with the social network search result 402. In this example, the "Member E User Profile" search result 404e is discarded because the system only accepts the first four user profiles. The user post search results 408a and 408b are presented nested under the social search result 402. The remaining general search results are presented subsequently based on the original ordering.
FIG. 5 illustrates an example process for presenting social search results associated with a social network site. For convenience, the process will be described in relation to a search system performing the process.
The process receives a query from a user (502). The query can be sent from a client device being operated by the user (e.g., a personal computer or a smart phone running a suitable web browser). The query can be sent over a network (e.g. a LAN, WAN, or the Internet) using a conventional protocol (e.g., HTTP).
The process determines that the query references a social network site. In some implementations, the query is compared (or substrings of the query are compared) to a white list that contains a list of social network sites. If the query matches an entry in the white list, then the query is determined to reference a social network site.
The process receives search results (506) from a search engine, the search results including general search results that reference resources responsive to the query and social search results that reference resources that are both responsive to the query and associated with other users that are in the social affinity group of the user.
The process identifies a first search result that references the social network site (508). The first search result is identified from among the search results.
The process identifies a second search result that references a resource that is located on the social network site (510).
The process generates a response to the query (512). The response may be, for example, a HTTP Response message. In some implementations, the response can include formatting information to present the first social search result in proximity to the first general search result. As discussed above, in some implementations, the formatting information can include information to present the first social search result can be nested under the first general search result. In some implementations, the formatting information includes information to present first social search result can be in line with the general search result. In some implementations, the response is sent to the client device for presentation to the user.
