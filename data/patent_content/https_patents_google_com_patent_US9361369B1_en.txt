- a large number of documents may be electronically available for any particular topic through the Internet.
- the quality of these documents can range from top quality journalism to unreliable reporting.
- the source of a document may predict the quality of the particular document. For example, a highly regarded source may, on average, publish higher quality documents compared to documents published by a less highly regarded source.
- the flow diagram in FIG. 3 illustrates one embodiment for ranking sources.
- a specific source is identified.
- documents which are published by the specific source are detected.
- the detection of these documents published by a specific source may be limited to documents published within the last month. In other embodiment, these documents may include all documents published by the specific source.
- the originality of the documents are analyzed.
- duplicate documents which are published by the same source are removed. For example, duplicate documents which are published more than once by the same source are removed so that only the original document remains. Duplicate documents may be found by comparing the text of the documents published by the source. If the text of both documents are a close match, then one of the documents may be considered a duplicate.
- non-original documents which are re-published by different sources are removed.
- many news wire services such as Associated Press and Reuters carry original documents which are re-published by other sources.
- These non-original documents that are re-published may be found by comparing the text of the document re-published by one source and the text of the original document published by a different source. If both documents are a close match, the original document may be determined by finding the document with the earliest publication date.
- the first source to publish identical documents may be considered the original author, and the corresponding document is considered the canonical version with the remaining subsequent versions considered duplicates.
- the documents from other sources may be limited to those which have been published within a given length of time such as within the last month.
- freshness may be measured by a combination of the frequency in which the source generates new content and the speed in which a document is published after the corresponding event has occurred.
- freshness of a source can be measured by the number of canonical documents generated by the source over the course of X number of days.
- the freshness of a source can also be measured by an average lapse in time between an event and the publication of a document regarding the event.
- the canonical documents from the Block 330 are analyzed for freshness.
- all the documents including both canonical and duplicates as identified in the Block 320 are analyzed for freshness.
- the documents are analyzed for overall quality.
- the overall quality of the documents by the source may be judged directly by humans.
- the overall quality of the documents may be indirectly assessed by utilizing circulation statistics of the source.
- the overall quality of the documents may also be assessed by utilizing the number hit or views the documents received within an arbitrary time frame.
- the overall quality of the documents may also be assessed by measuring the number of links pointing to the documents published by the source.
- the source is scored based on multiple factors such as the number of documents published, the originality of the documents, the freshness of the documents, and the quality of the documents.
- the factors such as number of documents, originality, freshness, and quality may be weighted according the desired importance of these factors.
- the score of the source is stored as part of a database.
- the database may be located within the server 210 or accessible to the server 210 over the network 201 .
- the source is categorized in response, at least in part, to the score from the Block 360 .
- the source may be placed into any number categories.
- FIG. 4 illustrates categories 410 , 420 , 430 , and 440 for exemplary purposes. Any number of categories may be utilized to illustrate the different levels of sources.
- the category 410 is shown as the golden source level; the category 440 is shown as the lowest level; and the categories 420 and 430 are shown as intermediate levels.
- the threshold for sources achieving the category 410 (golden source level) is targeted for sources that carry a substantial number of canonical documents. In one embodiment, between 5% to 10% of all sources are targeted to fall within the golden source level. Other targets and levels may be utilized without departing form the invention.
- the categorization of the source in the Block 370 may be stored as part of a database.
- the database may be located within the server 210 or accessible to the server 210 over the network 201 .
- the flow diagram in FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of defining clusters, sub-clusters, and documents within the clusters and sub-clusters.
- a plurality of sources are identified.
- the clustering system 130 may detect the plurality of sources from one or more categories illustrated within FIG. 4 . These sources may be limited to sources associated with specific categories such as “golden sources”.
- documents published by the plurality of sources are identified.
- documents 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 , and 650 represent exemplary documents published by the plurality of sources.
- the documents identified in the Block 520 are analyzed for their content. For example, a topic or subject matter may be extrapolated from the analysis of the content from each of these documents.
- Each document may contain a document vector which describes the topic or subject matter of the document.
- the document vector may also contain a key term which characterizes the topic or subject matter of the document.
- the documents identified in the Block 520 are grouped into one or more clusters.
- the documents may be clustered using a text clustering technique such as hierarchical agglomerative cluster.
- various other clustering techniques may be utilized.
- the documents may be clustered by measuring the distance between the documents.
- the document vector for each document maybe utilized to measure the similarity between the respective documents.
- a common information retrieval (IR) technique such as term frequency and inverse document frequency (TFIDF) may be utilized to match document vectors.
- the document vectors and key terms may aid in measuring the distance between each document.
- the document vectors and key terms which are identified as titles, initial sentences, and words that are “named entities” may have increased importance and may be given increased weighting for measuring the similarities between documents.
- Named entities typically denote a name of a person, place, event, and/or organization. Named entities may provide additional value, because they are typically mentioned in a consistent manner for a particular event regardless of the style, opinion, and locality of the source.
- the documents 610 , 620 , and 630 are shown grouped together in a cluster 660 in FIG. 6 .
- the documents 640 and 650 are shown grouped together in a cluster 670 in FIG. 6 .
- the documents 610 , 620 , and 630 are determined to have more similarities than the documents 640 and 650 .
- the documents within the clusters which were formed in Block 540 may be further refined into sub-clusters.
- the documents within a cluster may be further analyzed and compared such that sub-clusters originating from the cluster may contain documents which are even more closely related to each other. For example, depending on the particular cluster, each cluster may be refined into sub-clusters. Additionally, the sub-cluster may contain a sub-set of documents which are included in the corresponding cluster, and the documents within the sub-cluster may have greater similarities than the documents within the corresponding cluster.
- the cluster 660 includes documents 610 , 620 , and 630 as shown in FIG. 6 .
- the cluster 660 is further refined into sub-clusters 680 and 685 .
- the sub-cluster 680 includes the documents 610 and 620 .
- the documents 610 and 620 within the sub-cluster 680 are more closely related to each other than the document 630 which is isolated in a different sub-cluster 685 .
- the documents within a sub-cluster are checked for their level of similarity. If there are multiple documents within the sub-cluster, and the documents are not identical enough, then the documents within the sub-cluster may be further refined and may be formed into lower level sub-clusters in Block 550 . When sub-clusters are formed into lower level sub-clusters, a stricter threshold is utilized to group sets of identical or near identical documents into these lower level sub-clusters.
- lower level sub-clusters are not shown in FIG. 6 .
- forming lower level sub-clusters from a sub-cluster is analogous to forming the sub-clusters 680 and 685 from the cluster 660 .
- the canonical document is identified by the earliest publication time and the remaining documents may be considered duplicates in Block 570 .
- a topic is identified.
- the topic is customized to a user.
- the topic may be in the form of a query of key word(s) initiated by the user.
- the topic may also be identified from a personalized page belonging to the user.
- the topic may also be selected from a generic web page which allows users to select different topic categories of interest.
- clusters that are matched to the topic are identified. For example, clusters which are similar to the topic may be identified.
- the identified clusters may be scored on various factors within the Blocks 715 , 720 , 725 , 730 , and 735 .
- these clusters are scored based on the recency of canonical documents within each cluster. For example, a cluster with the most recent canonical documents may be scored higher than other clusters.
- the recency of canonical documents may be computed for the cluster by using a weighted sum over the original documents within the cluster.
- a weighting scheme is utilized where a higher weight is given for fresher and more recent document.
- each document within a cluster may be sorted and assigned a bin that corresponds with the age of the document.
- Each bin is configured to accept documents within a time range and corresponds with a specific weighting factor.
- the specific weighting factor corresponds with the time range of the documents within the bin. In one embodiment, the weighting factor increases as the time range corresponds with more recent documents.
- FIG. 7B illustrates the use of bins relative to the weighted sum in computing the recency of coverage.
- Bins 760 , 765 , 770 , 775 , and 780 are shown for exemplary purposes. Additional or fewer bins may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention.
- the bin 760 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged less than 60 minutes.
- the documents within the bin 760 are assigned a weighting factor of 24.
- the bin 765 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 60 minutes and less than 2 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 765 are assigned a weighting factor of 20.
- the bin 770 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 2 hours and less than 4 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 770 are assigned a weighting factor of 15.
- the bin 775 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 4 hours and less than 24 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 775 are assigned a weighting factor of 3.
- the bin 780 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 24 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 780 are assigned a weighting factor of ⁇ 1.
- the cluster score may be calculated, in part, by multiplying the number of documents within each bin with the corresponding weighting factor and summing the results from each of these multiplications.
- a cluster contains documents with the following distribution of documents: bin 760 contains 2 documents, bin 765 contains 0 documents, bin 770 contains 1 document, bin 775 contains 5 documents, and bin 780 contains 10 documents.
- a sample calculation for a cluster score is shown in Equation 1.
- sample cluster score 3 ⁇ 24+0*20+1*15+5*3+10* ⁇ 1 Equation 1
- the clusters may be scored based on the quality of the sources that contribute documents within each cluster.
- the sources may be ranked on an absolute grade.
- a well-known source such as the Wall Street Journal may be ranked higher than a local source such as the San Jose Mercury News regardless of the topic.
- the importance of a source may also be computed based on the notoriety of the source. For example, the source may be computed based on the number of views or hits received by the source. In another example, the importance of a source may be computed based on the circulation statistics of the source. In yet another embodiment, the importance of the source may be based on the number of links for each of the documents published by the source and within the cluster.
- the quality of the source may be based on the importance of the source relative to the particular topic. For example, with an document relating to a news story, sources such as CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Reuters may be included with a top tier source category; sources such as XYZ News and Any City Times may be included in a second tier source category; and sources such as local news organizations may be included in a third tier source category.
- the importance of the source may depend, at least in part, on the subject matter of the particular document and may change with each unique topic.
- the local news organizations where the event which is identified in the query is located may be included within the top tier source category.
- These local news organizations may typically be included within the third tier source category for a national event/story, however due to the local nature of the event related to the query, these local news organizations may be elevated to the top tier source category for this particular query based on geography.
- the importance of the source may be proportional to the percentage of documents from the source which match the subject matter of the topic. For example, if the topic relates to the subject of “music”, then a source which may be considered important is MTV, because the majority of MTV's prior documents are related to music. The importance of the sources may also change over a period of time for the same topic depending on the subject matter of the documents.
- the clusters are scored based on the number of canonical documents contained within each cluster. For example, the cluster may be scored higher when there are more canonical documents within the cluster.
- the clusters may be scored based on the number of sub-clusters within each cluster. For example, the number of sub-clusters within a cluster may be utilized to measure the amount of diversity of documents within the cluster.
- the clusters may be scored based on a match between the subject of the cluster and a set of predetermined topics.
- the set of predetermined topics are deemed as important topics such as world news, national news, and the like.
- a cluster may be scored higher when there is a match between the subject of the cluster and one of the set of predetermined topics.
- each of the clusters may be scored according to parameters such as recency of documents, quality of sources, number of documents, number of sub-clusters, and important topics.
- the score for each clusters may be calculated by adding up the scores attributed by the parameter analyzed in the Blocks 715 , 720 , 725 , 730 , and 735 . In one embodiment, these scores may be stored within the database 140 . In addition, the clusters are sorted by score.
- a topic is identified.
- the topic is customized to a user.
- the topic may be in the form of a query of key word(s) initiated by the user.
- the topic may also be identified from a personalized page belonging to the user.
- the topic may also be selected from a generic web page which allows users to select different topic categories of interest.
- Block 820 clusters that are already sorted by the Block 780 are identified.
- centoids may be computed for each cluster.
- the centroid uniquely describes the topic or subject matter of the cluster.
- the centroid is computed by averaging individual term vectors from the documents contained within the cluster.
- the term vectors may include a weighted set of terms.
- the centroids of the sorted clusters may be compared with the centroids of previously viewed clusters. If the centroid of a particular cluster is similar to the centroids of the previously viewed clusters, this particular cluster may be rated lower than other sorted clusters which are not similar to the centroids of previously viewed clusters. The similar particular cluster may be rated lower than dissimilar sorted clusters, because the user has already viewed documents which are related to the similar particular cluster.
- the clusters identified in the Block 820 may be sorted based on the comparison between the centroids of these clusters and the centroids of previously viewed clusters.
- the flow diagram in FIG. 9 illustrates one embodiment of ranking and displaying documents within a cluster.
- a cluster is identified.
- duplicate documents within the cluster may be removed. For example, canonical documents remain within the clusters.
- the documents within the cluster may be rated for recency and/or content.
- recency for example, if a document is ten (10) hours old, the document is assigned a recency score of ten (10) hours.
- the measurement of recency may be defined as the difference in time between the present time and the time of publication. In another embodiment, the measurement of recency may be defined as the difference in time between publication of the document and the time of a corresponding event. In yet another embodiment, the measurement of recency may be defined as the difference in time between the present time and the time of an event corresponding to the document.
- the documents may also be scored according to the length of a document, the title of a document, and genre of a document. For example, in one embodiment, the longer the document is, the higher the particular document may be scored.
- the title of the document may be analyzed in a variety of ways to aide in scoring the document. For example, the length of the title may be utilized to score the document with a longer title scoring a higher score.
- the title may be searched for generic terms such as “News Highlights”, “News Summary”, and the like.
- the higher percentage of generic terms used with the title the lower the document may be scored.
- use of proper nouns in the title may increase the score of the document.
- the words within the title may be compared with the centroid of the cluster which contains the document.
- the score of the document is higher if the title contains words that overlap or match the centroid of the cluster.
- the document may belong to a specific genre such as “op/ed”, “investigative report”, “letter to the editor”, “news brief”, “breaking news”, “audio news”, “video news”, and the like.
- the score of the document may increase if the genre of the document matches the genre of a query.
- the query specifies a particular genre.
- the query includes the genre which passively specified by the user as a preference.
- the documents within the cluster may be rated for quality of the corresponding source. Rating the quality of the corresponding source is demonstrated in the Block 350 ( FIG. 3 ).
- the measurement of recency for a document (as described in the Block 930 ) may be taken into account with the quality of the corresponding source.
- a modified recency score is ten subtracted by X (10 ⁇ X) hours where X is a selected value based on the quality of the source.
- the modified recency score is less than the original recency score, because the corresponding source is considered a golden source.
- a modified recency score is ten added by Y (10+Y) hours where Y is a selected value based on the quality of the source.
- the modified recency score is greater than the original recency score, because the corresponding source is considered a lowest category.
- the documents may be sorted by recency of the document and quality of the source.
- the documents may be sorted by the modified recency score as shown in the Block 940 .
- the documents are sorted with the most recent documents listed first.
- the most recent document within each sub-cluster of the cluster is identified and included as part of a displayed list of documents.
- the displayed list of documents utilizes an order with the most recent document listed first according to the modified recency score.
- the documents within the displayed list of documents as described in the Block 960 are weighted by the number of documents within the corresponding sub-cluster.
- the modified recency score is further modified. For example, the more documents within a particular sub-cluster may increase the importance of the documents within the sub-cluster. In other words, the individual documents within the displayed list of documents are weighted based on the number of documents within the sub-cluster.
- a first and second document may each have a modified recency score of ten (10) hours.
- the first document is within a sub-cluster which includes twenty (20) documents
- the second document is within a sub-cluster which includes ten (10) documents.
- the first document has a new modified recency score of eight (8) hours based on the weighting of the number of documents within the sub-cluster.
- the second document has a new modified recency score of twelve (12) hours based on the weighting of the number or documents within the sub-cluster. Accordingly, the first document has a lower modified recency score than the second document and may be in a higher priority position to be viewed or displayed.
- the displayed list of documents is shown to the user.
- the documents within the displayed list of documents may be shown to the user based on the modified recency score as formed in the Block 960 .
- the documents within the displayed list of documents may be shown to the user based on the modified recency score as modified in the Block 970 .
