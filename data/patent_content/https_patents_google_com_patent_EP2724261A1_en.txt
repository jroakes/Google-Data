Definitions
- This specification relates to computer-implemented automatic language detection, and more particularly, to automatic language detection for search queries.
- Search engines can offer input suggestions (e.g., query suggestions) that correspond to a user's query input.
- the input suggestions include query alternatives (e.g., expansions) to a user-submitted search query and/or suggestions (e.g., auto-completions) that match a partial query input that the user has entered.
- the input suggestions that directly match the user's query input are called "primary-language input suggestions.”
- Some search engines can provide cross-language input suggestions (e.g., cross-language query suggestions) in response to a user's query input.
- Each cross-language query suggestion can be provided with a corresponding primary-language query suggestion, and is a translation of the corresponding primary-language query suggestion.
- a search engine can utilize a machine-translation service to translate the primary-language query suggestion.
- Techniques that correctly and suitable identify the source languages of primary-language query suggestions is useful in improving the quality of the cross-language query suggestions provided to users.
- This specification describes technologies relating to automatic language detection, and particularly to automatic source language detection for translating a primary-language input suggestion to a cross-language input suggestion.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: storing a character-to-language mapping on a client device, the character-to-language mapping including input characters of multiple natural languages and writing systems, and specifying respective one or more natural languages and associated writing systems in which each of the input characters exists; obtaining a search query comprising a plurality of query characters, the search query being a query suggestion generated based on a user-submitted query input received on the client device; for each of the plurality of query characters: ( 1 ) according to the stored character-to-language mapping, identifying, for the query character, respective one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs that each includes the query character; and (2) generating a sub-score for each of the respective one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for the query character based on a respective count of the respective one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs; for each of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for the plurality of query characters,
- FIG. 1 A system of one or more computers can be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be so configured by virtue of having instructions that, when executed by a data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving a search query comprising a plurality of query characters; for each of the plurality of query characters: (1) according to a stored character-to-language mapping, identifying, for the query character, respective one or more candidate "language- writing system” pairs that each includes the query character; and (2) generating a sub-score for each of the respective one or more candidate "language- writing system” pairs identified for the query character based on a respective count of the respective one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs; for each of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for the plurality of query characters, aggregating all sub-scores generated for the candidate "language-writing system” pair to obtain a respective score for the candidate "language- writing system” pair; and determining a source language for the search query based on the respective scores of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for the plurality of query characters.
- FIG. 1 A system of one or more computers can be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be so configured by virtue of having instructions that, when executed by a data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- the techniques further include the action of storing the character-to-language mapping on a client device that performs the actions of identifying, generating, aggregating, and determining.
- the character-to-language mapping identifies, for each unique character in a plurality of non-overlapping character sets, respective one or more "language-writing system" pairs in which the unique character exists.
- the sub-score generated for each candidate "language-writing system” pair identified for each query character has a negative correlation with the respective count of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for the query character.
- that action of aggregating all sub-scores generated for the candidate "language-writing system” pair to obtain the respective score for the candidate "language-writing system” pair further includes the action of: boosting one or more sub-scores generated for the candidate "language-writing system” pair if the candidate "language- writing system” pair is the only candidate “language-writing system” pair identified for one or more of the plurality of query characters.
- the search query is a primary-language query suggestion generated in response to a query input submitted to a search engine.
- the methods further include the actions of: sending a machine-translation request for translating the search query from the determined source language to a target language different from the determined source language; and providing a machine-generated translation of the search query received in response to the machine-translation request as a cross-language query suggestion corresponding to the search query.
- the techniques described in this specification can be completed quickly and efficiently using a simple client-side process.
- the techniques are suitable for detecting the languages of search queries which are often considered too short for producing accurate language-detection results by other sophisticated language detection methods.
- the techniques can identify an appropriate source for a mixed-language search query (e.g., a query that contains words or characters of multiple languages), such that a useful cross-language query suggestion can be generated by translating the mixed-language search query from the identified source language to a desired target language.
- FIG1. 1 is a block diagram illustrating example data flow in an example system that generates query suggestions in different natural languages.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example of an automatic language detection subsystem for determining a source language of a primary-language query suggestion for a machine-translation request.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process for determining a source language of a primary-language query suggestion for a machine-translation request.
- a search engine can provide primary-language query suggestions in response to a query input entered by a user.
- the primary-language query suggestions are query suggestions generated based on the user's original query input, such as expansions and auto-completions of the user's original query input.
- the primary language query suggestions are often generated based on user-submitted search queries stored in one or more query logs.
- Some search engines can also provide a cross-language query suggestion for each primary-language query suggestion, where the cross-language query suggestion is a query written in a second language or writing system different from that of the primary-language query suggestion.
- the search engine When providing a cross-language query suggestion, the search engine typically employs a machine-translation service to generate the candidate translations for each primary-language query suggestion. For each translation task, the
- machine-translation service requires a specification of a source language for the primary-language query suggestion, and a specification of a target language for the translation.
- the quality of the cross-language query suggestion depends on the correct and appropriate identification of the source language for the primary-language query suggestion.
- primary-language query suggestion is a mixed language query and includes words from multiple languages and/or writing systems.
- Conventional machine-based techniques for identifying a single source language for this kind of mixed language queries often produce incorrect and unpredictable results.
- the auto-detected language for an example primary-l nguage query suggestion "Autobot 3 ⁇ 43 ⁇ 4 A” can be German
- the auto-detected language for an example primary-l nguage query suggestion "AutoCad t-fcfS” can be Malay, while both query suggestions are in fact half English and half Chinese.
- a character-to-language mapping can be stored on a client device.
- the character-to-language mapping covers all unique characters that can be entered as text input by a user and form part of a search query submitted to a search engine by the user.
- the character-to-ianguage mapping covers a subset of all such unique characters (e.g., character sets used in 30 most popular languages and writing systems).
- Each unique character has a unique identifier (e.g., a Unicode encoding).
- the character-to-language mapping specifies, for each unique character in the mapping, a corresponding set of languages and associated writing systems in which the unique character can exist (e.g., as part of an alphabet or script).
- the set of language and writing system pairs associated with each unique character can be identified according to the character-to-language mapping by the unique identifier of the unique character, for example.
- a language detection module can process each character of a search query (e.g., a primary-language search query) and identifies a respective set of candidate "language-writing system" pairs in which the character can exist. The language detection module can then generate a sub-score for each of the respective set of candidate "language- writing system" pairs identified for the character, where the sub-score depends on a count of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs that have been identified for the character. For example, a higher count can correspond to a lower sub-score, while a lower count can correspond to a higher sub-score.
- the language detection module can then identify a suitable source language for the search query from the candidate "language-writing system” pairs based on the final scores of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs.
- the sub-score generated for this candidate "language-writing system” pair in the context of this particular character can be boosted.
- the overall likelihood that this candidate "language- writing system” pair will be selected as the source language for the query can be increased.
- a boost can be applied to the particular candidate
- FIG. 1 is block diagram illustrating example data flow in an example system 100 in which input suggestions (e.g., query suggestions) in different natural languages are provided.
- a module 1 10 running on a client device 1 15 monitors input 120 received in a search engine query input field from a user 122.
- the input 120 is written as a sequence of characters. Each character has a respective unique encoding that distinguishes it from all other characters in the same or different languages and writing systems.
- An example of such unique encoding systems is the Unicode system, which provides unique encodings for each of over 109,000 characters, over 93 scripts.
- the input “auto” includes four English characters: “a”, "b", “c", and “d”.
- An input " t ⁇ A” includes three Chinese characters “ C", and "A”.
- An input “y3 ⁇ 4 ⁇ A movie” includes nine characters “ ⁇ ” “$", "A”, a white space, "m”, “o”, “v”, “i”, and "e”.
- the module 1 10 is a JavaScript script executing in a web browser running on the client device 1 15, or plug-in software installed in a web browser running on the client device 1 15.
- the module 1 10 receives the input 120 and automatically sends the input 120 to a suggestion service module 125, as the input 120 is received.
- the suggestion service module 125 is software running on a server that receives a textual input, e.g., a user-submitted query input, and returns alternatives to the textual input, e.g., query suggestions.
- the suggestion service module 125 detemiines a set of primary-language query suggestions based on the user's query input 120.
- the search engine can generate the primary-language query suggestions (e.g., expansions and auto-completions of the query input) based on user-submitted queries stored in one or more query logs.
- the primary-language query suggestions generated from the query logs can sometimes include mixed language queries, and queries in languages other than a user-specified preferred language or machine-specified default language. Therefore, additional steps are sometimes needed to ascertain the actual source languages for the primary-language query suggestions, when the
- primary-language query suggestions are to be translated using machine-translation techniques.
- the suggestion service module 125 can contact a machine-translation service to obtain candidate translations for use as cross-language query suggestions for the primary-language query suggestions generated by the suggestion service module 125.
- the suggestion service module 125 can return the set of primary-language query suggestions back to the module 1 10, and the module 1 10 then contacts a translation service module 130 to obtain a translation for each primary-language query suggestion.
- the module 1 10 can display the translation to the user as a cross-language query suggestion corresponding to the primary-language query suggestion.
- the module 1 10 specifies the source language and target language for each translation request according to an automatically detected source language for the primary-l ngue query suggestion and a user-specified, preferred language for the cross-language query suggestion. More details on how the module 1 10 determines a suitable source language for the primary-language query suggestion is provided with respect to FIG. 2.
- Various machine translation techniques can be used by the translation service module 130 to translate the primary-language query suggestions in response to the translation requests.
- Examples of the machine-translation techniques include rule-based machine translation techniques, statistical machine translation techniques, example-based machine translation techniques, and combinations of one or more of the above. Other machine-translation techniques are possible.
- the module 1 10 can provide a plurality of candidate "language- writing system" pairs to the translation service module along with the translation request.
- the translation service module 130 can perform additional automatic language detection processes based on other techniques before carrying out the translation.
- the module 1 10 can present the
- the module 1 10 can present a first group of primary-language query suggestions and cross-language query suggestions associated with a first character typed by the user 122, and present a second group of
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the operations of an example language detection module 200.
- the language detection module 200 can be used to implement the language detector 135 shown in FIG. 1.
- FIG. 2 also shows a character-to-language mapping 204.
- the language detection module 200 receives a primary- language query suggestion (Q) 202.
- the primary-language query suggestion (Q) 202 can be generated by the suggestion service module based on a user's original query input and provided to the language detection module 200.
- the primary-language query suggestion Q includes a sequence of characters, where the sequence of characters forms one or more words in one or more languages and associated writing systems.
- the character processing module 210 of the language detection module 200 processes each character of the primary-language query suggestion (Q) 202.
- the processing of the characters can be in parallel or in sequence.
- the character processing module 210 can perform a look-up in the character-to-language mapping 204 according to the unique identifier of the character.
- the character-to-language mapping 204 can include entries for each unique character that can be found in a search query received at a search engine. Since a search engine can accept queries written in one or more of many natural languages and associated writing systems, the character-to-language mapping 204 also covers characters from many different languages and associated writing systems.
- the character-to-language mapping 204 can include entries for Chinese characters, Arabic characters, English characters, Japanese hiragana characters, Japanese Katakana characters, Korean Hanguel characters, Roman numerals, and characters of other languages and associated writing systems.
- each unique character in the character-to-language mapping 204 can map to more than one language and writing system pairs.
- many Chinese characters are also used in Japanese as Kangji characters, and in Korean as Hanja characters.
- the English letter "A” can also be found in many other languages and associated alphabets (e.g., German, Italian, Chinese Pinyin, Spanish, etc.).
- the character-to-language mapping 204 can be stored locally as a text file on the device which performs the automatic language detection for the search query (Q) 202. By storing the character-to-language mapping locally, the speed of automatic language detection can be improved.
- the character-to-language mapping 204 can be implemented as a searchable table or searchable index, using the respective unique character identifier (e.g., the Unicode encoding) of each character as a key to the set of "language-writing system" pairs associated with the character.
- the character-to-language mapping 204 can also specify, for each unique character, a respective count (N) of the number of languages and associated writing systems (e.g., "language-writing system" pairs) in which a character can exist.
- N a respective count of the number of languages and associated writing systems (e.g., "language-writing system" pairs) in which a character can exist.
- the count can serve as an indicator of how likely a query including a particular character is written in one of the languages and associated writing systems.
- a character is a common character (e.g., the letter "a") found in many languages and associated writing systems
- the presence of the common character is a search query provides a weak indicator that the search query may be written in one of the many languages and associated writing systems that include the common character.
- a character is a rare character (e.g., the character " ⁇ ") which only is found in a few languages and associated writing systems, then the presence of the rare character provides a strong indicator that the search query may be written in one of the few languages and associated writing systems.
- a character e.g., the character "C9”
- one language and associated writing system e.g., in Japanese and the associated Hiragana writing system
- the character processing module 210 processes all of the characters in the search query (Q) 202 by looking up the characters in the character-to-language mapping 204, and determines the candidate "language-writing system" pairs for the query according to the "language-writing system” pairs that were mapped to at least one character of the search query,
- some characters in the search query can be removed before the character processing step. For example, characters that are universal to all languages and writing systems, such as write spaces, roman numerals, can be removed and not used by the character processing module 210.
- the character processing module 210 can generate a sub-score (SSci_Lj) for each of the set of one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs (Lj) in the context of the character (Q).
- the sub-score (SSci_Lj) can be negatively correlated with the count of candidate "language- writing system” pairs (Nj) that have been identified for the character ( ). In other words, a greater value of N; corresponds to a smaller value of SSci Lj for each candidate "language-writing system” pair L j .
- N, 1, the value of SSa_Lj for each candidate "language-writing system” pair L j can be boosted (e.g., multiplied by a large multiplier).
- the language scoring module 220 can generate a final score for each of the candidate "language-writing system” pair identified for the search query (Q) 202.
- the number of sub-scores that have been generated for each candidate "language- writing system” pair is equal to the number of query characters for which the candidate "language- riting system” pair has been identified. In other words, the number of sub-scores that have been generated for each candidate "language-writing system” pair is equal to the number of query characters that can be found to exist in the candidate "language-writing system” according to the character-to-language mapping 204,
- the language scoring module 220 can generate the final score for each candidate "language-writing system” by tallying all the sub-scores that have been generated for the candidate "language- writing system” pair. For example, suppose the search query "#CO3 ⁇ 4" is submitted to the language detection module 200. When the first character is processed by the character processing module 210, it is determined that the first character " ⁇ " is mapped to three (N 3) different "language-writing system” pairs (e.g., Japanese-Kanji, Chinese-Hanzi, Korean-Hanja).
- the language scoring module 220 calculates the final score for each of the candidate "language- writing system” pairs identified for the query "# ⁇ Oi£"
- the language score module 220 can aggregate (e.g., sum) all the sub-scores that have been generated for the candidate "language-writing system” pair.
- the language scoring module 220 can determine that the search query is most likely written in Japanese. Since Japanese often use the Hiragana and the Kangji writing systems in combination, the language scoring module 220 can simply conclude that the source language of the search query " ⁇ is Japanese, and does not further ascertain a particular writing system for the search query.
- the language scoring module 220 can boost the a sub-score of a particular candidate "language- writing system” pair that was derived in the context of a particular query character, provided that the particular candidate "language-writing system” pair is the only "language- writing system” pair that maps to the particular query character.
- the boost is accomplished by multiplying a large multiplier to the sub-score.
- a boost constant can be added to the final score of the candidate "language-writing system” pair, instead of being applied to a sub-score of the candidate "language-writing system” pair.
- a boost can be applied to the final score of the particular candidate "language-writing system” pair as well.
- the language scoring module 220 can send the identified source language to the translation request module 230.
- the translation request module 230 can then send a translation request to a translation service module requesting a translation of the search query (Q) from the determined source language to a desired target language (e.g., a user-specified, preferred language for cross-language query suggestions).
- the final scores of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs are used as one of several factors in determining an appropriate source language for the search query (Q) 202.
- the language scoring module may provide each of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs as a source language in a separate translation request to the translation service module.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 300 for determining a suitable source language for a search query.
- the process 300 can be implemented by the module 110 in FIG. 1 or the language detection module 200 in FIG. 2, for example.
- the example process 300 begins when a search query is received (302).
- the search query includes a plurality of query characters.
- the search query is preprocessed to remove certain characters (e.g., white spaces, Arabic numerals, etc.) that do not have particular "language- writing system" affiliations.
- respective one or more candidate "language-writing system" pairs are identified for the query character according to a stored character-to-language mapping (304).
- the character-to-language mapping is stored on a client device that performs one or more steps of the process 300.
- the character-to-language mapping identifies, for each unique character in a plurality of non-overlapping character sets, respective one or more "language-writing system" pairs in which the unique character exists.
- the process 300 continues when a sub-score is generated for each of the respective one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for each query character, based on a respective count of the respective one or more candidate "language-writing system” pairs (306).
- the sub-score generated for each candidate "language-writing system” pair identified for each query character has a negative correlation with the respective count of the candidate "language- writing system” pairs identified for the query character. For example, a decreasing function can be used to define the relationship between the sub-score and a corresponding count.
- all sub-scores generated for the candidate "language-writing system” pair are aggregated to obtain a respective score for the candidate "language-writing system” pair (308).
- one or more sub-scores generated for the candidate "language-writing system” pair can be boosted if the candidate "language-writing system” pair is the only candidate “language-writing system” pair identified for one or more of the plurality of query characters.
- a source language can be determined for the search query based on the respective scores of the candidate "language-writing system” pairs identified for the plurality of query characters (310).
- the search query is a primary-language query suggestion generated in response to a query input submitted to a search engine
- the process 300 can further include steps for sending a machine-translation request for translating the search query from the determined source language to a target language different from the determined source language; and providing a machine-generated translation of the search query received in response to the machine-translation request as a cross-language query suggestion corresponding to the search query.
