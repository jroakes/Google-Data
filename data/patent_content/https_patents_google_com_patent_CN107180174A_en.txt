Embodiment
Generally describe herein and choose whether unified pass code.Some computing devices (for example, smart phone) allow user
Pass code is specified with unlocker device and some features of access equipment.For example, being set in computing device because overtime or user closes
It is standby and after locking, user may must specify pass code (such as " 59823 ") to access the main screen of computing device and check
Available the application list.
One or more of these application programs can by user employer or represent user employer develop, Huo Zheke
To be configured to access the data that employer provides.The example of this program will be related to the electronics for being configured to access and being provided by employer
The e-mail program of email account, or the application program for allowing user to access the docketing system provided by employer.Calculating is set
It is standby one or more of these " employer " application programs to be distributed to work profile, and distribute to active configuration
All application programs of file may must be fulfilled for some safety standards that can be specified by the keeper of employer.For example, management
Member can be specified before user is able to access that any employer's application program, and user must input the pass code of length-specific.
In some instances, what the standard that keeper specifies may possess than user is used for the mark that its equipment unlocks pass code
Accurate tightened up, equipment unblock pass code can be for for example accessing the main screen of computing device.For example, keeper can specify
User must input the pass code of eight-digit number length to access employer's application program, and user can only input four figures pass code
To unlock its equipment.Some users may prefer to this method, because then they can use a pass code (possible phase
When simple one) come the equipment that unlocks them, once and equipment be unlocked and when user desires access to action (example
Such as, it is configured to access the e-mail program of work email with activation) when, another must be simply inputted once in a while passes through
Code (may be more complicated).
For the certain user of regular visit work-related content, periodically two passwords of input are probably inconvenience.
In this way, computing system can provide the setting for allowing a user to specify whether to provide two pass codes, one is used for unlocker device, one
It is individual to be used to access action Yi Dan unlocked, or be provided solely for a password to access all devices content.When selection one
When individual password is set, a password may must be fulfilled for the standard that keeper specifies, and therefore unlocker device may relate to
The more complicated password of input.
The keeper of employer may can specify the various settings for accessing the application associated with employer or data.Pipe
Reason person may can specify the requirement to pass code, and it can include the length of pass code, allow the pass code (example of which type
Such as, numeric only, alphanumeric, fingerprint, pattern unblock etc.), it may be possible to specify how long must reset pass code once (for example,
Every three months), and before the possible data associated with employer and/or the application that can be specified in device erasing equipment
Number of failed attempts.
Like carrying out unlocker device using a password for user and that of work-related content is accessed using another
A little examples, equipment user or keeper can specify user interface feature, to distinguish the pass code input screen for unlocker device
Curtain and the pass code entr screen for accessing action.For example, keeper can select to present on every screen
Different background (colored, display image or the text presented thereon).
Furthermore, like carrying out unlocker device using a password in user and access work-related content using another
In those examples, each operational application that keeper can specify user whether to be necessary for user's trial entrance is re-entered
Work associated cryptographic, once or user's input service associated cryptographic, user is before equipment is locked or is specifying
Time quantum in whether need not re-enter password.In some instances, even if user locking device and must may weigh
New input unblock pass code, but user may only need in certain period of time input service associated cryptographic once (for example, every
Hour is once).For example, user, which can input pass code, carrys out unlocker device, attempt (for example, by selecting for application program
Icon) the work related application of activation first, and it is prompted to enter its work pass code.After being successfully entered, user
Locking device can be selected.If user and then decision access the second work related application, user may must input it
Pass code carrys out unlocker device, but if user is still in the special time period of input service pass code, then be able to may swash
Second work related application living, and without re-entering work pass code.
