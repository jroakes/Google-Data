Definitions
- Another problem facing small electronic devices is the difficulty of inputting information. With a small form factor or pocket-size device, it is simply not feasible to include a substantial keyboard for inputting information. Again, the size of the devices reduces the physical surface area available for accommodating input keys or the like.
- a conventional approach to the problem is to simply build a smaller keyboard, one using miniature input keys. The approach is problematic. In particular, most users find that their fingers are simply too big to use small keys with any degree of efficiency. Further, any efforts to increase the size of a keyboard or keypad in such a device reduces the amount of surface area available for the display screen.
- a portable computing device or “information appliance” having terse user input is provided with a user interface for navigating user data.
- the computing device comprises a central processing unit (e.g., microprocessor) connected via a system bus to a display, an input, ports, and memory.
- Display is a screen device for displaying information, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.
- Input comprises a keypad, either physical or logical (e.g., on screen buttons), but limited to a terse set numbering about three to ten buttons and more preferably about five buttons.
- Memory comprises persistent memory, volatile memory, and non-volatile RAM memory. Persistent memory is typically implemented as a ROM or read-only memory.
- Volatile memory stores a single-purpose operating system (SPOS) and application(s).
- Volatile memory is a “scratch” memory, for storing temporary computation results. It typically is implemented as a RAM (random-access memory), for providing a work space for the operating system and applications.
- RAM random-access memory
- Non-volatile RAM memory represents battery-backed RAM memory, for storing context information from one session to another. When the device is powered down, the memory stores user data from that session.
- SPOS single purpose operating system
- API application programming interface
- Applications are software application programs or modules provided for user operation of the device.
- the application programs can be implemented as separate modules,. which are controlled by a module selector.
- the module selector serves as a user interface or shell representing the top-level or “home” display presented to a user.
- the module selector presents the user with selection icons for navigating to different applications or modules of functionality.
- other modules include a calendar module, a to do module, and an address book module.
- the device In typical use, the device is used in tandem with a desktop computer or PC.
- the desktop PC is used by the user when “at the office,” and the portable computing device is employed when the user is “on the road” (i.e., out of the office).
- large repositories of data reside on the desktop PC which are periodically transferred or synchronized with data residing on the portable computing device.
- a device input/output (I/O) protocol or standard such as the PC card standard (formerly PCMCIA standard)
- the user can easily transfer data to the device via a direct memory transfer.
- data can be streamed from the desktop PC to the portable computing device via a direct cable (or infrared) connection, such as using a serial port-to-serial port connection.
- a direct cable (or infrared) connection such as using a serial port-to-serial port connection. Since the data transferred is that of an application operating on the desktop PC, potentially thousands of data items or records might be downloaded into the portable computing device. This potentially large dataset, coupled with the terse key set available at the portable computing device, poses a challenge to the location of desired information by a user. Therefore, improved user interface methodology is needed.
- the present invention provides a user interface implementing a “single-click” style of button operation, so that users can associate each button with a particular task for a given program context.
- the preferred embodiment imposes “click consistency” for each button.
- the same buttons are used over and over again to perform their respective tasks, even though the user has navigated to different modules of an application. In this manner, the user is presented with a consistent interface or metaphor which can be easily mastered.
- the user interface supports in a small form factor device the browser-style navigation that users have become accustomed to on desktop computers (e.g., using Web browsers). More particularly, the interface supports up, down, forward, and backward (reverse) navigation for allowing a user to “drill down” to “drill across” his or her data. This allows the user to find a data item (link) of interest and then drill down into it. Once at the appropriate level, the user can then easily select the particular item of interest. Further, once the user has selected or entered an item, the system provides the ability for the user to return to “home” with a single button click. In this manner, the present invention provides an interface allowing browser-style navigation in a device having a terse set of input keys.
- a method for providing users with access to applications and user information in a computing device having a limited set of input keys may be summarized by the following method steps.
- the device displays a user interface having a top level view for allowing a user to select among applications available for the computing device.
- User interface navigation is provided in response to user operation of the limited set of input keys.
- the device moves a screen cursor in a forward relative direction among screen objects at a given level.
- the device moves the screen cursor in a reverse relative direction among screen objects at a given level.
- the device In response to user selection of a select key from said limited set of input keys, the device selects a particular screen object at which the screen cursor is currently located, whereupon the device displays a lower level view of the user interface which pertains to the particular screen object. In response to user selection of a home key from said limited set of input keys, the device returns to the top level view. In this manner, access to the applications and user information is achieved for the computing device through use of said limited set of input keys.
- a device having a terse set of input keys provides password protection as follows.
- the interface implements a “graphical password” which can be entered directly from the terse set of keys.
- the graphical password comprises a sequence of non-alphabetic key strokes from the terse set.
- an exemplary graphical password might comprise, for example, FORWARD, FORWARD, BACK, BACK, SELECT, or, alternatively, the user could select HOME, SELECT, FORWARD, HOME, HOME, BACK.
- a password entry screen When the device is configured for password protection, the screen appears each time the device is powered up. To gain access to information on the device, the user must at this point enter the same sequence of key strokes as that which comprises the user's graphical password.
- a password mask field indicates entries of each key stroke, but with the actual keys themselves being masked.
- a method for controlling access to a computing device having a limited set of input keys may, therefore, be summarized as follows.
- the device records a user-provided sequence of key strokes entered from the non-alphanumeric keys.
- the device stores the recorded sequence of key strokes as a “graphical password”—that is, a password comprising non-alphanumeric key strokes.
- the device Upon request from a user for access to the computing device, the device prompts the user to enter the graphical password. If the user enters a sequence of key strokes which matches that of the sequence of key strokes stored as the graphical password, the device grants device access to the user.
- Additional methodology is provided for dynamically adjusting tab categories and subcategories.
- the method is, in the preferred embodiment, driven in part by the number of lines supported by the display.
- the interface supports seven displayable lines which the user can navigate.
- the number of displayable lines is employed to set a threshold number of items which must exist before creating further tab categories (i.e., subcategories).
- the number is set equal to the number of displayable lines plus 1 (e.g., the number 8, for a display having 7 displayable lines). Any three-letter category which qualifies for subcategory tabs is determined by eight or greater items which satisfy that key.
- the method adopted always creates a boundary tab—that is, a category tab for the starting index after the subcategory set.
- the next tab category created is “Mo” (instead of the tab category “N”), even though the number of “Mo” entries might be less than the threshold value.
- the methodology ignores combinations which do not exist in the user data. If no “J” items exist, for example, then a “J” tab is not created.
- the system provides the user with a “find” operation based, not on a linear search, but on dynamically-created categories.
- a method for providing access to a data set which stores information in data records having data fields may, therefore, be summarized as follows.
- An initial order for displaying the data set based on values of a particular data field is established. Commonly, this will be an alphabetic sort order, such as a descending sort by Last Name.
- the data set is displayed according to this established order.
- category tabs for navigating among individual data records of the data set. This entails the following.
- the device determines dynamically, based on actual values stored at the particular data field of the data records, categories of information available for the particular data field. Based on this determination, the device displays a tab identifier allowing navigation to a particular category if at least one data item exists for the particular category. In this manner, at least some tab identifiers are eliminated from display—particularly, tab identifiers are eliminated for those categories of information which currently have no data items.
- the result is much faster and efficient navigation through large datasets when using a terse or limited key set.

- computing device 100 comprises a central processing unit 105 (e.g., microprocessor) connected via a system bus 140 to a display 101 , an input 102 , ports 103 , and memory 110 .
- Display 101 is a screen device for displaying information, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.
- Input 102 comprises a keypad, either physical or logical (e.g., on screen buttons), but limited to a terse set numbering about three to ten buttons and more preferably about five buttons.
- Memory 110 comprises persistent memory 111 , volatile memory 120 , and non-volatile RAM memory 130 .
- Persistent memory 111 is typically implemented as a ROM or read-only memory. As shown, it stores a single-purpose operating system (SPOS) 112 and application(s) 113 , which are described in further detail below.
- Volatile memory 120 is a “scratch” memory, for storing temporary computation results. It typically is implemented as a RAM (random-access memory), for providing a work space for the operating system and applications.
- Non-volatile RAM memory 130 represents battery-backed RAM memory, for storing context information from one session to another. When the device 100 is powered down, the memory 130 stores user data from that session.
- the single purpose operating system functions to provide a consistent mechanism by which applications 113 can communicate with the device 100 .
- applications 113 are shielded from hardware complexity, such as hardware interrupts and ports.
- hardware complexity such as hardware interrupts and ports.
- API application programming interface
- Applications 113 are software application programs or modules provided for user operation of the device. As shown in FIG. 2, for instance, the application programs can be implemented as modules 201 - 206 , which are controlled by a module selector 200 .
- the module selector 200 serves as a user interface or shell representing the top-level or “home” display presented to a user. In the currently-preferred embodiment, the module selector 200 presents the user with selection icons for navigating to different applications or modules of functionality.
- other modules include a calendar module, a to do module, and an address book module.
- the device 100 is used in tandem with a desktop computer or PC.
- the desktop PC is used by the user when “at the office,” and the portable computing device 100 is employed when the user is “on the road” (i.e., out of the office).
- large repositories of data reside on the desktop PC which are periodically transferred or synchronized with data residing on the portable computing device 100 .
- a device input/output (I/O) protocol or standard such as the PC card standard (formerly PCMCIA standard)
- the user can easily transfer data to the device 100 via a direct memory transfer.
- data can be streamed from the desktop PC to the portable computing device via a direct cable (or infrared) connection, such as using a serial port-to-serial port connection. Since the data transferred is that of an application operating on the desktop PC, potentially thousands of data items or records might be downloaded into the portable computing device 100 . This potentially large dataset, coupled with the terse key set available at the portable computing device, poses a challenge to the location of desired information by a user. Therefore, improved user interface methodology is needed.
- the user interface of the present invention implements a “single-click” style of button operation. Given a device with five input buttons, for instance, various key combinations beyond the simple clicking of each individual button could be created. Buttons could, for example, be “double clicked” by users or combined to create double or triple (or even more) key combinations. Although such an approach yields more logical buttons from the available physical buttons, the approach requires users to memorize key combinations which are not intuitive (and are a source of endless grief for users of such devices). Accordingly, in the most-preferred embodiment, a single-click style is adopted, so that users can associate each button with a particular task for a given program context.
- buttons are used over and over again to perform their respective tasks, even though the user has navigated to different modules of an application. In this manner, the user is presented with a consistent interface or metaphor which can be easily mastered. If, on the other hand, behavior of the button changed from one portion or context of the application to another, the user must relearn the functionality of each button.
- the user interface supports in a small form factor device the browser-style navigation that users have become accustomed to on desktop computers (e.g., using Web browsers). More particularly, the interface supports up, down, forward, and backward navigation for allowing a user to “drill down” to “drill across” his or her data. This allows the user to find a data item (link) of interest and then drill down into it. Once at the appropriate level, the user can then easily select the particular item of interest. Further, once the user has selected or entered an item, the system provides the ability for the user to return to “home” with a single button click. As set forth below, the present invention provides an interface allowing browser-style navigation in a device having a terse set of input keys.
- the module selector presents an array of icons, each one corresponding to a particular application within the system. At all times, the system displays a highlight on screen for indicating “focus”—that a particular item is the focus of further user input (at that point in time). At the top level or “home,” focus is indicated by a highlight around one of the application icons.
- display interface 320 comprises a plurality of application or module icons (e.g., icons 321 , 323 ), from which the user can invoke particular application functionality.
- icon 321 currently had “focus,” as indicated by focus outline (rectangle) 325 .
- the device 300 includes five buttons 310 . These buttons function as follows.
- Home key 311 provides a browser-like key allowing a user to always return to “home”—that is, a general or overview display screen.
- “home” is the module selector display or shell shown by display screen 320 . In this manner, no matter how far a user has “drilled down” in the interface, the home key 311 will always return the user to the top-level view or shell, with a single button click.
- Forward key 319 and backward key 317 allow the user to navigate forward or backward (respectively), within a given level of the interface.
- the forward and backward keys move the selective or highlight from one icon to another, either in a forward or reverse direction depending on which of the two buttons 317 , 319 is activated.
- a highlight or selector is presented at all levels of the interface so that the functionality of buttons 317 , 319 remains consistent and intuitive. As a result, the user always knows how to shift focus from one item to another regardless of what level of the interface the user has navigated to.
- select button 315 invokes (or “selects”) the item currently having focus, when the button is activated by the user.
- select button 315 serves to select the calendar module represented by icon 321 .
- the system “drills down” into the calendar module.
- buttons provide a navigation model where the user can move from point to point for changing direction within a level, selection itself always indicates the current focus or point of activity (which will occur) within a given level. Selecting that item with the select button 315 causes the system to drill down into the functionality represented by the selected item. Regardless of how many levels the user has drilled down into using this technique, the home button 311 will always return the interface back to the top-level view (e.g., such as the “home” view represented by display 320 ).
- buttons 310 include a fifth key or button, view switch button 313 .
- the view switch button 313 allows the user to instruct the system to switch to a different view within a given level, thus providing the user with a different way of viewing the data.
- presentation of calendar data by a calendar module can be represented or displayed in multiple ways.
- One way to represent such information for example, is to display a linear (event-by-event) list.
- such information could be presented on a week-by-week basis—that is, viewing data over a span of a given week.
- Yet another way to view such information is a monthly view which highlights dates for a given month which have events (or other user data).
- the view switch 313 therefore, cycles through different views at a particular level, with the actual views available being dictated by the particular application (module). In order to simplify the interface for the user, the number of views available at a given level should typically not exceed about four views.
- the high-level navigation model can be applied to other types of user information. This is illustrated in FIGS. 4A-B.
- the calendar module has focus, as indicated at 401 .
- the interface invokes the calendar module, as indicated at 410 in FIG. 4 B.
- the view switch key By activating the view switch key, the user can switch the display to get another view of the data. For instance, upon the user first invoking the key, the display switches to a weekly view, as indicated at 420 in FIG. 4 C. Further activation of the key switches the display to a monthly view, as shown at 430 in FIG. 4 D. In any one of these views, the user can select an item and drill down into it. For the present example, this is illustrated by FIGS.
- FIG. 4E the user selects an item, shown at 440 , using forward/backward keys. Now that a particular item has focus, the user can drill down into that item, by activating the select key. The result is shown at 450 in FIG. 4 F.
- the system displays the particular record corresponding to the selected item.
- the user can continue navigating using the selection and drill down approach.
- the user has selected item 460 from the displayed list of items.
- the user can invoke the select key for displaying further information about the selected item—detailed information for a particular time interval for this example (not shown).
- the foregoing example illustrates that the navigation module of the present invention can easily be applied to completely different datasets. At the same time, the user is still able to efficiently navigate among items in each dataset even though the device itself only includes a terse set of input keys.
- the interface methodology also has application to a variety of other devices.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- the interface methodology also has application to a variety of other devices.
- enhanced processing power becomes available to more and more devices, including household appliances, there is a growing need for an interface for efficiently controlling such devices.
- those devices will continue to have a small set of input keys, instead of larger keypads or handwriting recognition.
- the physical size of the device makes it undesirable to incorporate a large keypad or a style list for handwriting recognition.
- FIGS. 5A-C illustrate use of the navigation model for setting user preferences.
- the user begins by invoking the preference module from the module selector screen.
- the preference setting screen such as illustrated in FIG. 5A
- the user employs the forward and backward keys for navigating to a particular item, such as “date display.”
- the user invokes the select key to navigate to the item's value, such as the date display value 510 as shown in FIG. 5 B.
- the user can change the value by using the backward and forward keys.
- the user can select that to be the preference value by invoking the select key.
- the selected value is now entered as the preferred setting.
- a method for providing users with access to applications and user information in a computing device having a limited set of input keys may be summarized as shown in FIG. 5 D.
- the device displays a user interface having a top level view for allowing a user to select among applications available for the computing device (step 531 ).
- User interface navigation is provided in response to user operation of the limited set of input keys (step 532 ).
- the device moves a screen cursor in a forward relative direction among screen objects at a given level (step 533 ).
- the device moves the screen cursor in a reverse relative direction among screen objects at a given level (step 534 ).
- the device selects or invokes a particular screen object at which the screen cursor is currently located (step 535 ), whereupon the device displays a lower level view of the user interface which pertains to the particular screen object.
- the device returns to the top level view (step 536 ). The method or process loops or continues for other user input. In this manner, access to the applications and user information is achieved for the computing device through use of said limited set of input keys.
- a device having a terse set of input keys implements password protection as follows.
- the interface implements a “graphical password” which can be entered directly from the terse set of keys.
- the graphical password comprises a sequence of non-alphabetic key strokes from the terse set.
- an exemplary graphical password might comprise, for example, FORWARD, FORWARD, BACK, BACK, SELECT, or, alternatively, the user could select HOME, SELECT, FORWARD, HOME, HOME, BACK.
- a password entry screen 600 upon the user entering a graphical password, the device displays a password entry screen 600 , as shown in FIG. 6 A.
- the screen appears each time the device is powered up.
- the user To gain access to information on the device, the user must at this point enter the same sequence of key strokes as that which comprises the user's graphical password.
- a password mask field 610 indicates entries of each key stroke, but with the actual keys themselves being masked.
- a method for controlling access to a computing device having a limited set of input keys may, therefore, be summarized as shown in FIG. 6 B.
- the device records a user-provided sequence of key strokes entered from the non-alphanumeric keys (step 631 ).
- the device stores the recorded sequence of key strokes as a “graphical password” (step 632 )—that is, a password comprising non-alphanumeric key strokes.
- the device Upon request from a user for access to the computing device (step 633 ), the device prompts the user to enter the graphical password (step 634 ).
- the device grants device access to the user (step 636 ). Otherwise, the method repeats the prompt (step 634 ) or fails.
- a user desires to employ a portable computing device for storing and managing large lists of information, such as an electronic address book.
- information is sorted by a particular key (i.e., indexed by one or more fields).
- information can be indexed on the key of last name plus first name.
- information is potentially a very large list.
- a quick way to navigate to a desired entry in a large list is to perform a search. If one wanted to find an entry in an electronic address book beginning with the letter “S,” for instance, the user could quickly search to names beginning with “S” if he or she could easily enter such a letter. For a portable computing device having a terse set of input keys, such as the device 100 , the user does not have this option. Given a device with a terse set of input keys or buttons, therefore, a problem arises as to how one efficiently navigates such information efficiently.
- the difficulty with the approach is that the user must still navigate a potentially large list. If something more than simple input is required, such as the input of alphabetic characters, the fast repeat approach becomes unacceptable. For instance, inputting characters from an entire alphabetic character set, including both upper case and lower case characters, the approach is simply not a practical way to input the information into a device. The fast repeat approach is not practical for navigating large datasets, such as an electronic address book containing hundreds of entries.
- list information is organized into discrete categories.
- information is grouped in a Rolodex.
- tabs are provided for individual letters of the alphabet. Adopting that approach electronically, however, is not an optimal approach, as the user would have to navigate or “tab through” a lot of information before reaching the desired target information.
- information is grouped intelligently at runtime (i.e., dynamically) such that a user can rapidly reach a destination or target item without having to tab through a lot of categories which are not of interest.
- the tabs themselves adjust dynamically at runtime to the user's actual data. Specifically, the tabs adjust on-the-fly to correspond to entries in the user's data. In this manner, the system eliminates the need for navigating or tabbing to categories which do not correspond to the actual user data present in the system.
- both a high level approach and a low level approach are adopted.
- the system employs the alphabet (and digits) broken down into sets of three characters, such as “#AB,” “CDE,” and the like. If no “E” entries are present in the user's date, for instance, the second tab can adjust to “CDF.”
- the approach provides an interface allowing the user to quickly navigate among categories. Unlike a Rolodex, however, the categories are simplified based on the user's actual data.
- FIGS. 7A-D illustrate an interface which embodies the approach.
- FIG. 7A illustrates address book interface 700 displaying list information 701 .
- the interface 700 includes category tabs 710 , such as “#AB” tab 711 . Since the tab 711 currently has focus, it is highlighted (e.g., displayed in reverse video).
- the user activates forward (i.e., right or down) and backward (i.e., left or up) keys 715 , 713 .
- FIG. 7 B the user activity of clicking the forward button or key 715 twice.
- the interface 700 shifts focus to tab 721 , as shown.
- the displayed list 701 (now 701 a ) is updated, for displaying entries corresponding to the now-selected category (i.e., tab 721 ).
- the user can now invoke the select button, shown at 725 in FIG. 7B, for drilling down into the then currently-selected category.
- Interface 700 (now 700 b ) displays the tab 721 (now 721 a ) as the first category. Further, focus has shifted to a particular item on the list 701 (now 701 b ). Hence, once the user has quickly navigated to the desired category of information, the user can select into that category and proceed to quickly select a particular item from that category.
- the input events can be summarized as follows: across ⁇ select ⁇ down ⁇ select.
- the system displays the information record pertaining to that item.
- Final selection of item 722 for instance, invokes the display of information record 730 , as illustrated in FIG. 7 D. At any point during this process, the user can easily return to the top-level view by selecting the “home” key.
- a method for providing access to a data set which stores information in data records having data fields may be summarized as shown in FIG. 7 E.
- An initial order for displaying the data set based on values of a particular data field is established (step 741 ). Commonly, this will be an alphabetic sort order, such as a descending sort by Last Name.
- the data set is displayed according to this established order (step 742 ).
- the device displays category tabs for navigating among individual data records of the data set. This entails the following.
- the device determines dynamically, based on actual values stored at the particular data field of the data records, categories of information available for the particular data field (step 743 ).
- the device Based on this determination (tested at step 744 ), the device displays a tab identifier allowing navigation to a particular category if at least one data item exists for the particular category (step 745 ). In this manner, at least some tab identifiers are eliminated from display—particularly, tab identifiers are eliminated for those categories of information which currently have no data items. The result is much faster and efficient navigation through large datasets when using a terse or limited key set.
- FIG. 8A illustrates this scenario.
- the user has tabbed to a category including “M” entries.
- the list 701 is updated and, for this example, includes a large number of “M” entries.
- the interface 700 (now 700 d ) updates, as indicated in FIG. 8 B.
- the category tab has, in effect, “split” into subcategory tabs.
- “M” entries are now represented by three tabs 811 : “M,” “Mc,” and “Mo” tabs.
- the system has synthesized dynamically an “Mc” tab, so those entries have their own subcategory tab. In this fashion, the user can quickly navigate to a particular subcategory of interest, thereby avoiding the need to linearly scan through a subcategory having a large number of entries which are not of interest (e.g., “Mc” entries).
- FIGS. 8C-E illustrate the action of the user tabbing through the subcategory tabs 811 .
- the display list 701 (now 701 d ) updates to display items corresponding to the newly-selected subcategory tab.
- the user selecting subcategory tab 811 b as shown in FIG. 8D or selecting subcategory tab 811 c in FIG. 8E also leads to updating the display list 701 , as shown at 701 e and 701 f , respectively.
- the user can select into or drill down to a particular item, such as indicated in FIG. 8 F.
- the user can select the target item of interest using the select key or button.
- the system displays the corresponding information record (not shown) for that selected item.
- the methodology adopted for dynamically adjusting tab categories and subcategories is, in the preferred embodiment, driven in part by the number of lines supported by the display.
- the interface supports seven displayable lines which the user can navigate.
- the number of displayable lines is employed to set a threshold number of items which must exist before creating further tab categories (i.e., subcategories).
- the number is set equal to the number of displayable lines plus 1 (e.g., the number 8, for a display having 7 displayable lines).
- Any three-letter category which qualifies for subcategory tabs is determined by eight or greater items which satisfy that key.
- the method adopted always creates a boundary tab—that is, a category tab for the starting index after the subcategory set.
- the next tab category created is “Mo” (instead of the tab category “N”), even though the number of “Mo” entries might be less than the threshold value.
- the methodology ignores combinations which do not exist in the user data. If no “J” items exist, for example, then a “J” tab is not created.
- the system provides the user with a “find” operation based, not on a linear search, but on dynamically-created categories. The result is much faster and efficient navigation through large datasets when using a terse key set.
- the interface includes a special sort tab 901 .
- the device displays selection screen 903 .
- the user can select another index for presenting the data, such as index by “title” or by “company.”
- FIG. 9B at display screen 910 , the user data is now sorted by company name. Accordingly, the tab categories are updated.
- the method's operation is generic to a variety of different datasets.
