Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to encoding and decoding data and in particular, to a method and apparatus for generating a punctured symbol vector for a given information vector.
- Digital data transmissions over wired and wireless channels sometimes may be corrupted, for instance, by noise in the link or channel, by interference from other transmissions, or by other environmental factors. Even with clear communication channels, which lend themselves to high data rates, it may not be possible to appropriately decode the data stream with the requisite error rates. In order to solve this problem, many communication systems employ error-correction techniques to aid in communication.
- One technique utilized for error correction is the convolutional coding of information to be transmitted.
- an encoder will encode the information bits from an information vector into data symbols at a fixed encoding rate with an encoding algorithm which facilitates subsequent decoding of the data symbols into information bits (e.g., maximum a posteriori decoding algorithms, maximum likelihood decoding algorithms).
- information bits are encoded using a rate 1/R 0 mother code. Since over-the-channel transmission rates may differ from the encoding rate, the encoded data needs to be modified to match the over-the-channel transmission rate.
- Prior art techniques for matching the rate of encoding to the over-the-channel transmission rate have used an appropriate puncturing pattern.
- this puncturing pattern is fairly simple, puncturing patterns can often be fairly complicated for different rates (e.g., rate 0.4177). Puncturing patterns are typically generated by exhaustive searches that match each combination of data rate, the encoding rate, and over-the-channel transmission rate. As a result, introducing new data rates, encoding rates, or over-the-channel transmission rates into a communication system can be difficult.
- IR incremental redundancy
- HARQ hybrid automatic repeat request
- this example requires the information block size to be a multiple of 12 to achieve the exact code rate of 4 ⁇ 5 after the first transmission, and rate 3 ⁇ 4 after the second transmission.
- This example illustrates the inflexibility of the puncturing pattern approach in providing the required code rate for forward error correction (FEC) and IR systems.
- FEC forward error correction
- the IEEE 802.16 standard contains a rate-matching procedure for turbo codes.
- the turbo encoder takes an information stream and produces a systematic stream and an even number of parity streams.
- Half of the parity streams are produced using a turbo interleaved version of the information stream.
- the rate-matching arranges the bits in the streams in a manner suitable for iterative turbo decoding by (a) rearranging the bits in each stream using additional (identical) block interleavers and (b) giving the information stream higher priority for transmission.
- a convolutional code may not even produce an information stream, and even if it does produce an information stream, the performance may be degraded if the information stream is prioritized. Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for generating a punctured symbol vector for a given information vector for convolutional codes.

- FIG. 4 is a flow chart showing operation of the receiver of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates interleaving
- data represented by an information vector enters a convolutional encoder.
- the encoder encodes the information bits from the information vector at encoding rate (1/R 0 ) to produce data symbol vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 .
- Vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 are each interleaved separately to form vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′.
- a multiplexer multiplexes P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . .
- vector Q The multiplexed interleaved symbol vector Q is input into a symbol adder/remover where appropriate symbols are added or removed to match the over-the-channel transmission rate, forming vector Q′.
- the above-described rate matching algorithm provides good performance for various data rates, encoding rates and over-the-channel transmission rates. Compared to using a puncturing pattern, the above-described technique has the advantage of flexibility and fine granularity in that any target code size can be easily achieved for any combination of data rate and encoding rate. Compared to existing rate matching algorithms, it also has the advantage of simplicity.
- the present invention encompasses a method for operating a transmitter.
- the method comprises the steps of encoding an information vector to produce data symbol vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 , interleaving vectors P 1 , . . . , P R0 to produce vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′, wherein each vector P 1 , . . . , P R0 is interleaved separately, and multiplexing vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ to produce vector Q.
- Q′ Symbols are added or removed from Q to form a vector Q′ having a rate that matches an over-the-channel transmission rate.
- vector Q′ is transmitted over-the-channel.
- the present invention additionally encompasses a method for operating a receiver that estimates an information vector.
- the method comprises the steps of receiving a signal vector Q′ over-the-channel.
- Vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ are de-interleaved to produce vectors P 1 , . . .
- the present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising an encoder encoding an information vector to produce data symbol vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 , at least one interleaver for interleaving vectors P 1 , . . . , P R0 to produce vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′, a multiplexer multiplexing vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . .
- the present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising a receiver receiving vector Q′ over-the-channel, a symbol adder/remover adding or removing symbols from Q′ to form a vector Q, a de-multiplexer de-multiplexing vector Q to produce a plurality of vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′, at least one de-interleaver de-interleaving P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ to produce vectors P 1 , . . . , P R0 , and a decoder decoding P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 to produce an estimated information vector.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a transmitter 100 utilized for data transmission.
- transmitter 100 comprises convolutional encoder 101 , a plurality of (at least one) interleavers 103 (only one labeled), a multiplexer 105 , a symbol adder/remover 107 , and transmission circuitry 109 .
- Encoder 101 will encode the information bits from the information vector into data symbols at a fixed encoding rate (e.g., 1 bit in for every R 0 symbols out) with an encoding algorithm which facilitates subsequent decoding of the received data symbols into information bit estimations.
- Encoder 101 determines an encoding rate (1/R 0 ) for the data and encodes the information bits into data symbols at the fixed encoding rate with a convolutional encoding algorithm.
- the encoder 101 produces R 0 symbol streams P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 .
- streams and vectors” can be used interchangeably.
- convolutional encoder 101 implements a non-systematic non-recursive convolutional code, where all the symbol vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 are parity vectors, not equal to the information vector.
- a parity vector can be produced from a tap delay line operating on the information vector.
- convolutional encoder 101 implements a systematic recursive convolutional code, where one symbol vector is the systematic vector, equal to the information vector. For the present invention, if a systematic stream is generated, it is treated in the same manner as a parity stream. In the receiver, a systematic vector corresponds to the transmitted information vector (e.g., a one-to-one mapping) while a parity vector does not correspond to the transmitted information vector.
- the R 0 symbol streams are each input into interleavers 103 (which may be the same or different interleavers).
- Interleavers 103 interleave the data symbols at the symbol level to produce R 0 interleaved symbol streams P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′.
- the interleaver for P i is different from the interleaver for P j , for certain i ⁇ j, 1 ⁇ i, j ⁇ R 0 .
- the interleavers 103 are each represented by a matrix, with symbol streams P 0 , P 1 , . . .
- P R0 individually input into locations within a matrix so that the matrix is filled in a column by column manner. Symbols are individually output from locations within the matrix so that the matrix is emptied in a row by row manner, where the rows may have been permuted.
- P 1 enters a first interleaver 103 and is interleaved to produce P 1 ′
- P 2 enters a second interleaver 103 and is interleaved to produce P 2 ′.
- the interleaved symbol streams P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ are output by interleavers 103 at the same data symbol rate that they were input (e.g., x ksymbol/second rate).
- the predetermined size of the block of data symbols defined by the matrix can be derived from the maximum number of data symbols which can be transmitted at a predetermined symbol rate within a predetermined length transmission block.
- Interleaved symbol streams P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ are output from each interleaver at a rate of x ksymbol/second, and enter multiplexer 105 where they are multiplexed to produce vector Q.
- Q [P 1 ′(1), P 1 ′(2), P 2 ′(1), P 2 ′(2), . . . , P R0 ′(1), P R0 ′(2), P 1 ′(3), P 1 ′(4), P 2 ′(3), P 2 ′(4), . . . , P R0 ′(3), P R0 ′(4), . . . , P 1 ′(K ⁇ 1), P 1 ′(K), P 2 ′(K ⁇ 1), P 2 ′(K), . . . , P R0 ′(K ⁇ 1), P R0 ′(K)], where K is a length of the information vector.
- Vector Q is output from multiplexer 105 at a symbol rate of R 0 *x ksymbol/second. Alternative multiplexing methods may be chosen to improve performance and/or to simplify implementation.
- the encoded data needs to be modified to match the over-the-channel transmission rate. Because of this, the multiplexed interleaved symbols in Q are input into symbol adder/remover 107 where appropriate symbols are added or removed to match the over-the-channel transmission rate. For example, if N c symbols need to be transmitted, N c consecutive symbols will be taken from sequence Q starting at position L i . If (L i +N c ⁇ 1) is greater than the length R 0 *K of Q, the extraction wraps around and will take symbols from the beginning of sequence Q. By varying L i , a different part of Q will be extracted. Thus vector Q′ is produced by adding or removing symbols from vector Q.
- the multiplexing method used to produce vector Q in multiplexer 105 allows Q′ to have a substantially equal number of symbols from the interleaved symbol streams P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′.
- Substantially equal means that the same or approximately the same number of symbols is used. For example, when vector Q is [P 1 ′(1), P 2 ′(1), P 3 ′(1), P 1 ′(2), P 2 ′(2), P 3 ′(2), . . .
- no overlap (repetitions) of the symbols in any adjacent transmissions occurs unless all R 0 *K symbols of Q have been selected. In another embodiment, some overlap may occur.
- Transmission circuitry 109 preferably comprises common circuitry known in the art for transmitting utilizing a well known communication protocol, and serve as means for modulating and transmitting symbols to a receiver.
- transmitter 109 comprises well known circuitry that utilize the 3GPP communication system protocol.
- transmission circuitry 109 may perform additional operations on the symbols before they are transmitted over the air. For example, in 3GPP, the symbols go through numerous operations including 1 st interleaving, radio frame segmentation, transport channel multiplexing, physical channel segmentation, 2 nd interleaving, physical channel mapping. These operations may change the order of the bits in Q′ over the air.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of receiver 200 for receiving over-the-channel transmissions.
- receiver 200 comprises convolutional decoder 201 , a plurality of (at least one) de-interleavers 203 (only one labeled), a de-multiplexer 205 , a symbol adder/remover 207 , and a receive circuitry 209 .
- receive circuitry 209 receives over-the-channel transmission 113 . Similar to transmit circuitry 109 , receive circuitry 209 comprises common circuitry known in the art for receiving over-the-channel communications utilizing a well known communication protocol, and serve as means for receiving and demodulating symbols. For example, receive circuitry 209 comprises well known circuitry that utilize the 3GPP communication system protocol. Other possible receivers include, but are not limited to receivers utilizing Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, or HyperLAN protocols.
- receive circuitry 209 demodulates the received signal and passes a received vector Q′ to symbol adder/remover 207 .
- the elements of the received vector Q′ may represent log-likelihood ratios (LLRs).
- LLRs log-likelihood ratios
- received vector Q′ may have been modified to match the over-the-channel transmission rate. Because of this, the received vector Q′ is input into symbol adder/remover 207 to produce a received vector Q which has a rate of R 0 *x.
- the symbol adder/remover 207 maps elements of the received vector Q′ to the received vector Q starting at position L i .
- R 0 *K ⁇ N c null elements e.g., LLRs corresponding to substantially zero confidence
- the output vector of 207 can be [0, 0, . . . , Q′(1), . . . , Q′(R 0 *K/2)], where 0 represents the inserted null elements, such as zero valued LLRs.
- the output of 207 can be [Q′(1)+Q′(R 0 *K+1), . . . , Q′(R 0 *K/2)+Q′(3*R 0 *K/2), Q′(R 0 *K/2+1), . . . , Q′(R 0 *K)].
- multiple transmissions of the same information vector may occur due to, for example, the unsuccessful decoding (incorrect information vector estimation) of previous transmissions of the same information vector or unsuccessful acknowledgement of the decoding status.
- the output of symbol adder/remover 207 for this reception may be combined with the output of the symbol adder/remover 207 from a previous reception. The combining may happen when the first reception cannot be successfully decoded into a correct information vector estimation.
- the receiver thus sends an indication that a first vector Q′ was improperly received, and requests from the transmitter a second vector Q′ also derived from vector Q.
- the transmitter receives an indication that a first Q′ was improperly received; and builds and transmits the second Q′ from vector Q.
- the second Q′ may contain symbols from the first Q′, though an attempt may be made to minimize the overlap between the first and second Q′.
- the preferred embodiment is that the second Q′ differs from the first Q′.
- the second Q′ is a subset of or equal to the first Q′.
- the retransmission request and response may happen several times until the information vector is correctly decoded or a maximum number of transmissions are reached.
- the received signal vectors Q′ from all the transmissions related to the same information vector can be combined in estimating the information vector.
- N c R 0 *K/2 for both receptions.
- Incremental redundancy type of combining like this can improve the system performance.
- N c 3*R 0 *K/4 for both transmissions.
- Vector Q i ′ corresponds to the first 3*R 0 *K/4 elements of Q.
- Q i ′(3*R 0 *K/4)] [Q(3*R 0 *K/4+1), . . . , Q(R 0 *K), Q(1), Q(2), . . . , Q(R 0 *K/2)] be sent for the i-th transmission.
- the (i ⁇ 1)-th and the i-th transmission can be combined at the receiver to form a vector [Q i ⁇ 1 ′(1)+Q i ′(R 0 *K/4+1), Q i ⁇ 1 ′(2)+Q i ′(R 0 *K/4+2), . . .
- the vector is output to de-multiplexer 205 where it is de-multiplexed to produce received vectors corresponding to P 0 ′, P 1 ′, . . . , P R0 ′.
- Each vector P 0 ′, P 1 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ is input into de-interleaver 203 (which may be the same or differing de-interleavers 203 ), and received vectors P 0 , P 1 , . . . , P R0 are output from de-interleavers 203 .
- Received vectors corresponding to P 0 , P 1 , . . . , P R0 are then input into convolutional decoder 201 and appropriately decoded to produce the estimated information vector.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing operation of the transmitter of FIG. 1 .
- the logic flow begins at step 301 where data represented by an information vector of length K enters convolutional encoder 101 .
- Encoder 101 encodes information bits from the information vector at encoding rate (R 0 ) to produce data symbol vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 (step 303 ).
- Vectors P 1 , . . . , P R0 are input into interleavers 103 and vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . .
- P R0 ′ are output by interleavers 103 at the same data symbol rate that they were input (e.g., x ksymbol/second rate) (step 305 ).
- each vector P 1 , . . . , P R0 is interleaved separately. This may entail using differing interleavers on each P 1 , . . . , P R0 .
- Interleaved data symbols P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ are output from each interleaver at x ksymbol/second, and enter multiplexer 105 where they are multiplexed to produce vector Q (step 307 ).
- the multiplexed interleaved symbols Q are input into symbol adder/remover 107 where appropriate symbols are added or removed to match the over-the-channel transmission rate, producing Q′ (step 309 ).
- vector Q′ is passed to transmission circuitry 109 where it is transmitted via over-the-channel transmission 113 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart showing operation of the receiver of FIG. 2 .
- Receiver 200 estimates the information vector from the received signal vector Q′.
- receive circuitry 209 receives over-the-channel transmission 113 .
- receive circuitry 209 demodulates the received signal to produce vector Q′ (step 403 ) and passes vector Q′ to symbol adder/remover 207 where the appropriate elements, such as bits for a hard decision decoder or log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for a soft decision decoder, are inserted/combined to produce vector Q (step 405 ).
- LLRs log-likelihood ratios
- each vector P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′ is input into de-interleaver 203 (which may be the same or differing de-interleavers 203 ) where vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 are produced (step 409 ) by de-interleaving vectors P 1 ′, P 2 ′, . . . , P R0 ′.
- vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 are input into convolutional decoder 201 and appropriately decoded to produce the estimation of the information vector, which has a length K.
- the vector in the receiver that corresponds to the vector in the transmitter is labeled with the same variable, such as Q.
- the transmitter and receiver methods described above offer benefits when used with convolutional codes.
- the output streams from the convolutional encoder are of equal importance in a trellis-based decoder, and are therefore treated the same in the rate-matching procedure.
- approximately the same number of bits may be sent from each parity stream.
- a turbo code where in the iterative decoding process the information stream (systematic bits) is prioritized, and therefore may be sent before the remaining parity streams are sent.
- a turbo code may send 290 information bits from the information stream and 110 bits in total from other parity streams.
- punctured parity positions i.e., bits not selected from Q to be in Q′
- this distribution may be accomplished by using a different interleaver for each parity stream, as will be described in more detail below.
- iterative decoding is possible as long as parity bits from each constituent code are available; iterative decoding makes the code less sensitive to the individual locations of punctured parity positions.
- the steps of interleaving vectors P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 (each of length K) separately and then multiplexing them can be achieved using an equivalent interleaver that interleaves a concatenated vector of length R 0 *K.
- the concatenated vector is formed by concatenating P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 .
- the procedures (interleaving, multiplexing, adding/removing symbols from Q) to determine vector Q′ can be achieved equivalently by selecting the appropriate symbols from each vector P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P R0 .
- the convolutional code produces R 0 output symbols per each information bit.
- the mother code rate of the convolutional code can be A/R 0 , A is a positive integer, i.e., R 0 output symbols are generated for every A input information bits.
- the read-out sequence is the ⁇ T j ⁇ sequence.
- the scheme above has the advantage of simplicity and efficiency compared to a scheme using puncturing patterns.
- code rate of any granularity can be achieved.
- Retransmission for IR can be achieved by choosing symbols from Q that have minimum overlap from previous transmissions.
- the error-correcting performance is improved by sending data symbols that are evenly distributed over the code trellis.
- the scheme is also flexible with different information vector lengths. This is achieved by defining a sub-block interleaving method which is flexible with vector lengths. For example, if only sub-block interleaving of discrete sizes are defined, then filler bits such as zeros may be padded to each stream before sub-block interleaving. Those filler bits may be discarded after sub-block interleaving.
