Description
- This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/839,781, filed Jun. 26, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- The present disclosure discusses identifying ambient acoustic characteristics associated with a location.
- Audio recognition applications provide users with information about an audio signal, e.g., an audio signal that contains a music track. An audio recognition application can receive the audio signal, and identify a name of a song that is playing, or an artist associated with the song.
- A major consideration for many people is music and ambiance when choosing a restaurant, club, or bar. Background music or ambient noise can help influence and predict the atmosphere and clientele of an establishment. In some examples, ambient noise can include aspects of an establishment's auditory environment, e.g., music, background noise, volume, and nature sounds. Annotating map data with location characteristics identified from audio signals helps enable users to search destinations by, among other parameters, music and ambiance preferences.
- In some examples, enhanced destination searches are provided utilizing such ambiance information as a part of local searches. That is, users can search for establishments based on music and ambiance preferences, e.g., local search results can show music and ambiance information for establishments.

For instance, identifying the one or more ambient acoustic characteristics includes identifying a song, a song artist, or a music genre associated with the ambient sounds. Associating the one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics with the location includes incrementing a count associated with the one or more ambient acoustic characteristics, for the location. Associating the one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics with the location includes storing data indicating a time or a date when the audio signal was received by the computing device. Associating the one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics with the location includes storing data indicating a loudness associated with the ambient sounds.
- Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that further include the actions of receiving a query; determining a location associated with the query; identifying one or more ambient acoustic characteristics associated with the location; and providing a response to the query that identifies the one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics.

Providing the response to the query includes providing context information associated with the one or more ambient acoustic characteristics for display on a map, wherein the map corresponds to a geographical region that includes the location.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
-
FIG. 1 depicts an example system for identifying ambient acoustic characteristics. -
FIG. 2A depicts an example process for identifying ambient acoustic characteristics. -
FIG. 2B illustrates an example process for providing a response to a query that identifies ambient acoustic characteristics. -
FIG. 3 depicts an example of a map of a geographic region including identified ambient acoustic characteristics. -
FIG. 4 depicts a computer device and a mobile computer device that can be used to implement the techniques described here. - In some implementations, ambiance information can be stored in a geographically-indexed database that can be used to produce various reports used by a mapping application or other applications. For example, the mapping application can annotate map data for a particular location, including generating a map overlay, e.g., a map overlay of music genres within a city based on the stored ambience information. Also, for example, a “top ten” report of music tracks recently played in a music club can be generated. Additionally, users can filter location searches by noise factors such as “noisy,” “quiet,” or even “crowded,” “chatty” or “demure.”
- In some examples, a user can search for ambiance-based information associated with a specific location. That is, the geographically-indexed database can be used to produce search results, e.g., in response to a query. For example, a user can generate a query such as “Where has ‘Gangnam style’ been played?” or “Where is there a quiet Thai restaurant?” A real-time response can be generated that can identify, based on the stored ambiance information, responses to such queries that satisfy the queries. In some examples, the ambiance-based information can be indexed, or stored in a knowledge graph.
- In some implementations, a server computing system receives an audio signal that includes one or more ambient sounds that are recorded by a mobile computing device. Specifically, a mobile computing device, e.g., a smartphone, a tablet computing device, or a wearable computing device, records the ambient sounds and provides an audio signal based on the ambient sounds to the server computing system. In some examples, ambient sounds include music, background noises, broadcasting sounds, crowd noises, echoes, machine noises, sounds that are produced by forces of nature, etc.
- In some implementations, the server computing system determines a location associated with the mobile computing device. Specifically, the mobile computing device provides, e.g., over one or more networks, location data that the mobile computing device is associated with to the server computing system. In some examples, the audio data and the location data associated with the mobile computing device is collected by the mobile computing device in response to a trigger generated by a user associated with the mobile computing device. For example, the user can initiate a query within an application running on the client computing device. The mobile computing device, the server computing system, or both, can identify one or more triggering elements within the query such that upon identification of the triggering elements, collection is commenced of the audio data and the location data. For example, the trigger elements can include identification of specific word(s) or phrases in the query.
- In some implementations, the server computing system identifies one or more ambient acoustic characteristics to associate with the location of the mobile computing device based on one or more of the ambient sounds. In some examples, the ambient sounds recorded by the mobile computing device can include music. To that end, based on the musical ambient sounds, the server computing system can i) identify ambient acoustic characteristics of the music, including a song, a song artist, and/or music genre that are associated with the music, and ii) associate the ambient acoustic characteristics of the music, including a song, a song artist, and/or music genre that are associated with the music, with the location of the mobile computing device.
- In some examples, identifying the ambient acoustic characteristics to associate with the location of the mobile computing device by the server computing system can be performed immediately after collection of the audio data and/or the location data by the mobile computing device. That is, in some examples, the audio data and/or the location are not retained, e.g., stored, by the server computing device. In some examples, the identified ambient acoustic characteristic associated with the location of the mobile computing device can be anonymized.
- In some examples, based on the identified ambient acoustic characteristics, the server computing system can generate a tuple containing i) the location of the mobile computing device; ii) a list of ambient sounds detected with respect to the location of the mobile computing device, each sound associated with a confidence score that the ambient sound is present at the location of the mobile computing device; and iii) a score indicating a strength of the identified ambient acoustic characteristics associated with the location of the mobile computing device.
- In some implementations, the server computing system associates the one or more ambient acoustic characteristics with the location of the mobile computing device. For example, associating the ambient acoustic characteristics with the location can include annotating map data of the location of the mobile computing device with the ambient acoustic characteristics identified for the location. The ambient acoustic characteristics associated with the location of the mobile computing device can be associated with search and mapping applications, such that when a user is presented with various locations on a map, the ambient acoustic characteristics are included on or accessible from the mapped locations.
- In some examples, different ambient acoustic characteristics can be associated with the location associated with the mobile computing device at different times. In some examples, the location of the mobile computing device can be associated with two or more ambient acoustic characteristics over a period of time. When two or more ambient acoustic characteristics are associated with the location, the server computing system can determine, for each ambient acoustic characteristic, a count associated with the ambient acoustic characteristic, for the location. In some examples, the server computing system can designate ambient acoustic characteristics that have been associated with the location of the mobile computing device for more than a threshold number of times or ambient acoustic characteristics that have been associated with the location of the mobile computing device for the most number of times to be associated with the location.
- In some examples, the server computing system can provide to the mobile computing device context information about the ambient acoustic characteristics of the location for display on a map of a geographical region that includes the location. The server computing system can also provide context information about the ambient acoustic characteristics of the location in response to receiving a search query about the location. In some examples, when a user submits a query for the location, the server computing system can provide the user with context information, e.g., a count of times that a song has played at the location.

Theserver computing system 108 includes aprocessing device 112 and adata store 114. Theprocessing device 112 executes computer instructions stored in a computer-readable medium, for example, to appropriately process a received audio signal to identify ambient acoustic characteristics. Thedata store 114 includes storage systems that store the identified ambient acoustic characteristics associated with one or more locations. In some examples, theserver computing device 108 can include more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer. - In some examples, the
computing devices FIG. 1 , thecomputing device 102 is a smartphone, e.g., amobile computing device 102; thecomputing device 104 is a desktop computer; andcomputing device 106 is a PDA. - In some examples, the
computing devices computing devices server computing system 108. In some examples, thecomputing devices computing devices server computing system 108. - The
network 110 can include, for example, any one or more of a cellular network, a satellite network, a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, thenetwork 108 can include any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 receives an audio signal. Specifically, theserver computing system 108 receives the audio signal from one of thecomputing devices mobile computing device 102, over thenetwork 110. Specifically, the audio signal includes ambient sounds that are detected by themobile computing device 102, e.g., by the audio detection module. The ambient sounds are associated with a location of themobile computing device 102, and further include aspects of the location's auditory environment, e.g., music, background noise, and nature sounds. Theserver computing system 108 can receive the audio signal from themobile computing device 102 over thenetwork 110, e.g., in response to a request from theserver computing system 108, or automatically from themobile computing device 102. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. In some examples, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.
- In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 determines a location associated with themobile computing device 102. Specifically, theserver computing system 108 can receive location-based data from themobile computing device 102, e.g., over thenetwork 110. Theserver computing system 108 can receive the location-based data from themobile computing device 102 in response to a request from theserver computing system 108, or automatically from themobile computing device 102. - The
server computing system 108 processes the received audio signal to identify one or more ambient acoustic characteristics to associate with the location of themobile computing device 102. Specifically, theserver computing system 108 utilizes one or more audio signal recognition applications to appropriately process the ambient sounds of the received audio signal to identify ambient acoustic characteristics based on the ambient sounds. In some examples, theserver computing system 108 can determine that the received audio signal from themobile computing device 102 includes a music component. Theserver computing system 108 can process the music component to identify ambient acoustic characteristics corresponding to music that is currently playing proximate to the location of themobile computing device 102. Theserver computing system 108 can identifying such ambient acoustic characteristics as a song associated with the music component, e.g., song title; a song artist associated with the music component, a musical genre associated with the music component, and other information that is typically associated with music. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 increments a count associated with the ambient acoustic characteristics for the location that themobile computing device 102 detects the ambient sounds. The count can include a total number of times that a specific ambient acoustic characteristic was detected at the location, e.g., across one or more mobile computing devices and across one or more time periods. For example, the specific ambient acoustic characteristic can include a song associated with musical ambient sounds. To that end, the count can reflect a number of times the song has played at the location over a specific time period. For example, theserver computing system 108 increments a count associated with the song “Gangnam Style” for the location each time the song is identified for the location. In some examples, theserver computing system 108 increments a count associated with the song “Gangnam Style” for the location each time the song is identified for the location for a specific time period, e.g., between 10 pm-2 am. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 stores data indicating a time or a date when the audio signal was recorded by themobile computing device 102. For example, when the audio signal can include musical ambient sounds, the time or date when themobile computing device 102 records the musical ambient sounds can be stored, e.g., by theserver computing system 108 and/or themobile computing device 102. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 determines that the received audio signal from themobile computing device 102 includes a loudness component. Theserver computing system 108 can process the loudness component to determine an ambient acoustic characteristic corresponding to a loudness of the ambient sounds at the location of themobile computing device 102. For example, when the audio signal includes the loudness component, theserver computing system 108 can identify decibel data associated with the loudness component of the audio signal. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 associates the identified ambient acoustic characteristics with the location of themobile computing device 102. For example, theserver computing system 108 can associate a song, a song artist, and/or a music genre with the location of themobile computing device 102. In some examples, theserver computing system 108 associates one or more counts, each associated with a respective ambient acoustic characteristic, with the location that themobile computing device 102 records the ambient sounds. For example, theserver computing system 108 associates the count of number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played for the location. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 associates a time or a date when the ambient sounds are recorded by themobile computing device 102. For example, theserver computing system 108 stores a time or date when themobile computing device 102 records the song “Gangnam Style” at the location of themobile computing device 102. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 associates the ambient acoustic characteristics with the location of themobile computing device 102 for a time period. That is, theserver computing system 108 associates the ambient acoustic characteristics for i) the location that themobile computing device 102 records the ambient sounds, and for ii) a time period that themobile computing device 102 records the ambient sounds. For example, theserver computing system 108 can associate a count of times a song has played at a location over a specific time period. For example, theserver computing system 108 can associate the count of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at a location, e.g., at a bar or night club, between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 associates a loudness, e.g., volume, with the location of themobile computing device 102. That is, theserver computing system 108 can associate the loudness of the ambient sounds for i) the location that themobile computing device 102 records the ambient sounds and ii) a time period that themobile computing device 102 records the ambient sounds. For example, theserver computing system 108 can associate a decibel level, e.g., 150 decibels, of an ambient sound, e.g., the song “Gangnam Style,” for the location of themobile computing device 102. Moreover, theserver computing system 108 can further associate the decibel level of the ambient sound, e.g., the song “Gangnam Style,” for a time period, e.g., between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 receives a query. Specifically, theserver computing system 108 receives the query from one of thecomputing devices computing device 106 over thenetwork 110. In some examples, a user associated with thecomputing device 106 can provide a query associated with a location, and in some examples, the query is associated with ambient acoustic characteristics of the location. For example, the query can include such queries as “Where does Gangnam Style play;” “Does this bar play Gangnam Style;” “How loud is this bar.” - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 receives a map search query from thecomputing device 106. Specifically, theserver computing system 108 can provide for display, e.g., on a display of thecomputing device 106, a map of a geographic region that includes the location of thecomputing device 106. In some examples, the map can include context information such as the ambient acoustic characteristics that are associated with one or more locations displayed within the map. For example, the map can include, for one or more locations displayed with the map, what songs are most commonly associated with the location, what time periods the songs are most commonly associated with the location, and a loudness associated with the location for certain time periods. For example, for a nightclub location displayed on the map, the map can display adjacent the nightclub location that the song “Stayin' Alive” typically plays from 10 pm-11 pm on Saturday nights, and that the nightclub is “very loud.” - In some examples, the map displays, for one or more locations, associated ambient acoustic characteristics upon initial display of the map, e.g., prior to receiving the query from the
computing device 106. In some examples, the map includes associated ambient acoustic characteristics for one or more other locations exclusive of the location of the query. In some examples, the map includes associated ambient acoustic characteristics for one or more other locations based on a current location of thecomputing device 106. That is, thecomputing device 106 can provide the current location thereof to theserver computing system 108 such that theserver computing system 108 provides the map based on the current location of thecomputing device 106. Thus, the map can include associated ambient acoustic characteristics for one or more locations proximate to the current location of thecomputing device 106. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 determines a location associated with the received query from thecomputing device 106. In some examples, theserver computing system 108 determines the location associated with the received query based on one or more located-based terms of the query. For example, the query can include terms that identify the location, e.g., the name of a nightclub. For example, the query can include “Does the Roxy nightclub in Austin play Gangnam Style?” In some examples, the query is associated with two or more locations. For example, the query can include “What nightclubs play Gangnam Style in Austin?” - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 receives a current location of thecomputing device 106 from thecomputing device 106, as described above. To that end, theserver computing system 108 can augment the received query from thecomputing device 106 with the current location of thecomputing device 106 to determine the location associated with the received query. For example, the query can include “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style.” Theserver computing system 108 can augment the query with the current location of Austin, Tex. that is associated with thecomputing device 106. Thus, theserver computing system 108 can determine that the query refers to the location of the Roxy nightclub in Austin, Tex. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 identifies one or more ambient acoustic characteristics associated with the location. Specifically, thedata store 114 stores a mapping, e.g., in a table or a database, between one or more locations and one or more ambient acoustic characteristics. To that end, theserver computing system 108 accesses thedata store 114 to identify which ambient acoustic characteristics are associated with the location associated with the query, e.g., via the mapping. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 identifies a song, a song artist, and/or a music genre associated with the location associated with the query. That is, thedata store 114 stores mappings between one or more locations and songs, song artists, and music genres. For example, for the query that identifies the location of the Roxy Nightclub in Austin, Tex., theserver computing system 108 identifies the associated ambient acoustic characteristics that the song “Gangnam Style” plays between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 108 provides a response to the query to thecomputing device 106 over thenetwork 110. Specifically, theserver computing system 108 provides the response that identifies the ambient acoustic characteristics that are associated with the location of the query. For example, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 provide the response of “Gangnam Style plays at the Roxy nightclub between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday.” However, other substantially similarly phrased responses can be provided. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 provides a map-based response to a map search query to thecomputing device 106 over thenetwork 110. That is, theserver computing system 108 can update the map provided to thecomputing device 106 such that the context information displayed adjacent to one or more locations of the map search query is updated to include the map-based response. For example, in response to the query “What nightclubs play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 updates the map to identify one or more locations that play the song “Gangnam Style,” and further updates the context information adjacent the one or more locations to include ambient acoustic characteristics such as a time/date the song is played. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 can further provide with the response a count associated with one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics, for the location. The count provided with the response can be associated with a song, a song artist, and/or a music genre, for the location. In some examples, theserver computing system 108 can provide with the response a count of times a song has played at a location. For example, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 can provide the count of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at the Roxy nightclub overall. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 can provide with the response a count associated with one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics, for the location for a time period. The count provided with the response can be associated with a song, a song artist, and/or a music genre, for the location for the time period. In some examples, theserver computing system 108 can provide with the response a count of times a song has played at a location over a time period. For example, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 can provide the count of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at the Roxy nightclub between the hours of 10 pm-2 am on Fridays and Saturdays. Moreover, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 provides the response of “Gangnam Style typically plays at the Roxy nightclub 3 times between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday.” Furthermore, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 provide the response of “Gangnam Style has played at theRoxy nightclub 55 times between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday over the past year.” However, other substantially similarly phrased responses can be provided. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 can further provide with the response a count associated with one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics that is greater than a respective threshold, for the location. Specifically, theserver computer system 108 can compare the count associated with one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics with a respective threshold. In some examples, based on the comparison, theserver computing system 108 determines that the count of one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics is greater than the respective threshold. Thus, theserver computing system 108 can provide with the response the count of the one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics that is greater than the respective threshold to thecomputing device 106. - For example, for the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” the
server computing system 108 can compare a count of the number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at the Roxy nightclub with an associated threshold. Continuing, theserver computing system 108 determines that the count of the number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at the Roxy nightclub, e.g., 60, is greater than the associated threshold, e.g., 50. Thus, theserver computing system 108 can provide with the response the count associated with the number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played the Roxy nightclub. For example, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 provides the response of “Gangnam Style has played at theRoxy nightclub 60 times.” However, other substantially similarly phrased responses can be provided. - In some examples, the
server computing system 108 can further provide with the response a count associated with one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics that is greater than a respective threshold, for the location for a time period. Specifically, theserver computer system 108 can compare the count associated with one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics, for a time period, with a respective threshold. In some examples, based on the comparison, theserver computing system 108 determines that the count of one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics, for the time period, is greater than the respective threshold. Thus, theserver computing system 108 can provide with the response the count of the one or more of the ambient acoustic characteristics, for the time period that is greater than the respective threshold to thecomputing device 106. - For example, for the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” the
server computing system 108 can compare a count of the number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at the Roxy nightclub for a time period with an associated threshold. Continuing, theserver computing system 108 determines that the count of the number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played at the Roxy nightclub between 10 am-2 pm on Friday and Saturday, e.g., 55, is greater than the associated threshold, e.g., 50. Thus, theserver computing system 108 can provide with the response the count associated with the number of times the song “Gangnam Style” has played the Roxy nightclub for the time period. For example, in response to the query “Does the Roxy nightclub play Gangnam Style,” theserver computing system 108 provides the response of “Gangnam Style has played at theRoxy nightclub 55 times between 10 pm-2 am on Friday and Saturday.” However, other substantially similarly phrased responses can be provided. - In some examples, the threshold can be manually set by an administrator associated with the
server computing system 108, or can be dynamically determined based on historical data. In some examples, the historical data can include data of previous interactions by a plurality of users with respect to responses to queries. However, the threshold can be based on other factors as well. To that end, in some examples, the threshold associated with each ambient acoustic characteristic can differ. For example, for the count associated with a song can be compared to a first threshold, while the count associated with a song artist can be compared to a second, different threshold. -
