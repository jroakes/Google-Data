- server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 .
- Methods according to the present invention may be implemented by, for example, a processor-executable program code stored on a computer-readable medium.
- a system such as indexer 130 , captures processor 124 , or query system 132 , associates a keyword with a first user interface area.
- the query system 132 receives a signal that the first user interface area is inactive and that a second user interface area is active.
- the query system 132 may intercept an application programming interface (API) call directed to the operating system that instructs the operating system to maximize a window or other user interface area in which an application is executing.
- the query system 132 interprets this call as activating the window that is the subject of the call and as inactivating all of the other windows in the user interface.
- the query system 132 may respond to receiving the call by executing a separate API call to determine all of the windows that are currently executing in the operating system and are inactive (i.e., all of the windows other than the active window).
- the query system 132 In response to receiving the signal that the first user interface area is inactive and the second is active, the query system 132 generates an implicit search query that includes the keyword.
- the keyword may be a single keyword or a plurality of keywords.
- a computer program also identifies the keyword to be associated with the user interface area.
- the user interface area may include a document, such as a word-processing document.
- a computer program is able to retrieve or receive a keyword associated with the document.
- the query system 132 receives a second signal indicating that a second user interface area is active and generates an implicit query that includes the keyword from the first user interface area.
- use of the keyword in the implicit query may be discontinued after a period of time has elapsed, e.g., ten seconds in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the keyword or results associated with the keyword are downweighted after a period of time has elapsed. For example, after ten seconds the results associated with the keyword are downweighted by fifty percent; after 20 seconds, the results are downweighted by seventy-five percent; and after thirty seconds, use of the keyword is discontinued.
- the amount of downweighting is a function of the time since the keyword was extracted and/or the corresponding user interface area was active.
- the association between the keyword and the user interface area may persist.
- the keyword and a user interface area identifier may be stored in memory.
- the keyword is an attribute of an event as described in relation to FIG. 1 .
- the event may include other attributes, such as an identifier of the user interface area.
- the query system 132 submits the search query to a local or global index. In response, the query system 132 receives a result set and causes the result set to be output.
- the query system 132 weights the keywords for the active user interface area (e.g., window) more heavily than keywords for inactive user interface areas.
- the weight may decrease proportionally to the time since the particular user interface area with which a keyword is associated was last active. If the user switches back to an inactive user interface area, then the keywords for that user interface area become weighted more heavily again. This is facilitated by keeping track of keywords for each active and inactive user interface area.
- sets of one or more keywords e.g., from events), each of which has a corresponding user interface area identifier and a corresponding time.
- the weight at which the keywords are used varies depending on the active user interface area, the time since the keywords were created, and the time since the user interface area was last active if it is not currently active. Older keywords have lower weight, and keywords associated with an inactive application have lower weight. If the user interface area becomes active again the weight increases. In another embodiment, the time since an application was last inactive is used in the weighting scheme, with lower weight going to keywords associated with user interface areas that have been inactive for a longer period.
- the system tracks the frequency and total amount of time that a user interface area is active. For example, if a user continually switches back and forth between an IM user interface area and several other applications, the system may recognize the repeated accesses to the IM user interface area and adjust the weight for keywords associated with that user interface area accordingly.
- adjustment of the weighting is performed using a step function that changes at certain predefined thresholds. In another embodiment, the adjustment is performed using a smooth function based on the age of the keyword.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method for associating a keyword with a user interface area in one embodiment of the present invention.
- a computer program such as the query system 132 , receives an event 202 .
- the event signifies that some activity has occurred.
- an event may signify that the user has received or sent an email, accessed a document, submitted an explicit query to a search engine, or performed some other activity.
- the event shown in FIG. 2 signifies that some activity has occurred that is associated with a user interface area.
- the user may have maximized, minimized, or restored a window, entered text into a document, printed a document, selected text from a web page, or performed some other activity associated with the user interface area.
- the event includes attributes.
- the event includes an identifier of the user interface area containing the application that caused the event to be generated.
- the user interface area may include a word-processing application.
- the event includes an identifier of the word-processing application.
- the event may also include one or more keywords.
- the query system 132 associates the keyword(s) with the user interface area 204 . The association may be stored in memory or otherwise persist. For instance, in one embodiment, a word processing application executes within a user interface area.
- an event is generated.
- the event may comprise an identifier of the user interface area as well as a keyword or keywords from the sentence that the user just completed.
- the query system 132 saves the association between the keyword and the user interface area.
- the query system 132 receives a signal indicating that the user interface area with which the keyword or keywords is associated is active 206 .
- the user may receive an email message and click on the email program to access the message.
- the query system 132 receives a signal indicating the user interface area associated with the email program is now active.
- the query system 132 receives a signal indicating that the user interface area associated with the email program is now inactive, and that the user interface area associated with the word processing program is now active.
- the query system 132 After receiving the signal or in response to receiving the signal, the query system 132 generates an implicit query 210 . Since the user interface area is active, the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 includes the keywords associated with the user interface area in the implicit query. If the user interface area is not currently active, the keywords may or may not be included within the implicit query. In one embodiment, when keywords associated with non-active user interface areas are used, they are associated with lower weight than keywords corresponding to the active user interface area.
- the query system 132 causes the search result to be executed against a global or local index 210 .
- the query system receives the search result or results 212 and causes them to be output to a user 214 .
- the query system 132 may receive or generate an HTML page including the search results and transmit the HTML page to the client 102 a.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method of reweighting a keyword based on an inactivity period in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the query system 132 receives an event 302 .
- the query system 132 associates a keyword of the event with an application user interface area 304 .
- the query system 132 receives a signal indicating that the application user interface area is inactive 306 . For instance, if the user clicks on another application in a different user interface area, the user interface area that is the source of the signal becomes inactive.
- implicit queries may rely relatively less on keywords associated with the inactive user interface area than they would when the user interface area is active.
- the query system 132 next determines whether the amount of time that the user interface area has been inactive exceeds a threshold 310 .
- the threshold may be predetermined or may be based on user or client-specific attributes. For example, the user may explicitly set a limit for the amount of time keywords associated with an inactive user interface area are utilized to perform implicit queries.
- one or more thresholds may be used. In the embodiment shown, if the inactive time period exceeds the threshold, the keyword is either excluded from implicit queries or the results based on the keywords associated with the inactive user interface area are downweighted in comparison to a keyword associated with an active user interface area 312 . In another embodiment, the amount of downweighting is a function of the time since the keyword was extracted and/or the corresponding interface area was active.
- the query system 132 executes the implicit query or causes the implicit query to be executed on a global or local index 314 .
- the query system 132 receives search results 316 .
- the query system 132 then causes the query results to be output 318 .
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a user display in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the embodiment shown includes a user interface screen 402 .
- the user interface screen 402 includes a content display 404 for displaying the results of search queries.
- the user interface screen also includes two user interface areas, application windows 406 and 408 .
- the application windows 406 , 408 contain two applications, Application 1 and Application 2 , respectively, i.e., the two applications execute within the respective windows.
- the user interface screen 402 also includes a toolbar 410 .
- the user enters data into the application executing within the first window 406 .
- the user enters data one or more keywords in the data are associated with that window and implicit queries are generated based on the keywords.
- the results of the implicit queries are displayed in the content display 404 .
- implicit queries continue to be generated periodically (e.g., once per second). Initially, after the first window becomes inactive, the implicit queries include keywords from both the first window 406 and the second window 408 . After a specified period of time, the keywords associated with the inactive window 406 are either downweighted in the query or result set, or the keywords are excluded from implicit queries. The time period may be equal to zero, i.e., those keywords are downweighted or excluded immediately when the window becomes inactive. The association of the keyword and the window may persist even though the keyword is not currently used in implicit queries.
- the keywords that were previously associated with the window are used to form implicit queries.
- the content display provides search results to the user that are relevant to the application on which the user is focused or at least are relevant to the currently active application.
