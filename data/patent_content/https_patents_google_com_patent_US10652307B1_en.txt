- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.

- a user interface 204 e.g., running on the initiating device 106 a , can allow the user 202 to control presentation, including selection and presentation of content, on the presentation device 106 b .
- providing content within the system 200 can occur in the following example sequence of stages.
- the user identification engine 121 can identify ( 206 ) the user 202 of (e.g., associated with) the initiating device 106 a and locate profile information for the identified user 202 .
- the user 202 in this example, can be a user using the initiating device 106 a to control content selected for presentation on the presentation device 106 b .
- identification of the user 202 can include using login credentials provided by the user when logging into a user service associated with the user's use of the initiating device 106 a .
- the identification of the user 202 can be based on information that is available in the user profile information 131 . Other ways of identifying the user are possible.
- the user intent engine 122 can receive an indication 208 from an application running on the initiating device 106 a of an intent, by the user 202 , to receive a first content item 132 a on the separate but co-located presentation device 106 b .
- the presentation device 106 b can have enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the initiating device, for presenting content.
- the enhanced presentation characteristics can include, for example, display characteristics (e.g., higher resolution and/or a larger screen area) or audio characteristics (e.g., higher-quality speakers or other sound components). Other enhanced presentation characteristics are possible.
- the first content item 132 a can be a video (e.g., that includes rich content) that can be streamed to the presentation device 106 b or that uses other enhanced presentation capabilities of the device. Also, the first content item 132 a , for example, can be one of the eligible content items 132 , e.g., a particular video selected by the user 202 using the user interface 204 for presentation on the presentation device 106 b.
- the content identification engine 123 can select one or more additional content items 132 b for delivery along with the first content item 132 a .
- the selection of the one or more additional content items can include, for example, identifying at least second different content items, such as from the eligible content items 132 .
- the identification can be based, at least in part, on the profile information for the identified user (e.g., user 202 ) and the enhanced presentation characteristics of the presentation device 106 b .
- the content identification engine 123 can identify content items that are selected based, at least in part, on user profile information for the user 202 .
- the selection of content items for example, can also be based on information associated with the first content item.
- the content item can be an ad.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. A user of an initiating device is identified. Profile information for the identified user is located. The initiating device includes a display for presenting content to the user. An indication is received from an application running on the initiating device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device having enhanced presentation characteristics for presenting content. Additional content items are selected for delivery along with the first content item. The selection includes identifying a second different content item based on the profile information for the identified user and the enhanced presentation characteristics. The first and second different content items are delivered directly to the co-located presentation device without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device.
Description
The present application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 120 as a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/102,348, filed Dec. 10, 2013. The foregoing application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
This specification relates to information presentation.
The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes identifying a user of an initiating device and locating profile information for the identified user, wherein the initiating device includes a display for presenting content to the user. The method further includes receiving an indication from an application running on the initiating device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device, the separate co-located presentation device having enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the initiating device, for presenting content. The method further includes selecting, by one or more processors, one or more additional content items for delivery along with the first content item including identifying a second different content item based at least in part on the profile information for the identified user and the enhanced presentation characteristics. The method further includes delivering, by one or more processors, the first and second different content items directly to the co-located presentation device without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The initiating device can be a mobile communication device or tablet computer, and the presentation device can be a television. The first content item can be an Internet content item and the second different content item can be selected based at least in part on content or metadata of the Internet content item, wherein the Internet content item can be selected from the group comprising a multi-media content item, a graphical display item, an audio content item, an executable software application or an Internet resource. One or both of the first content item or the second different content item can be an audio content item. The enhanced presentation characteristics can include display characteristics or audio characteristics. The display characteristics can include higher resolution and larger screen area. Receiving an indication can include receiving a request to initiate a session for presenting content on the co-located presentation device, wherein the request includes an identifier for the first content item. Selecting one or more additional content items can include identifying eligible content items from an inventory of content items, and eligible content items can include items that are adapted for presentation in an environment that supports the enhanced presentation characteristics. Selecting one or more additional content items can include identifying a content item and adjusting one or more characteristics of the content item to produce the second different content item. Selecting one or more additional content items can include selecting a campaign associated with a content sponsor for providing the second different content item, the campaign having two or more associated content items each having different characteristics, and wherein selecting the second different content item can include selecting one of the two or more content items as the second different content item based at least in part on the enhanced presentation characteristics and associated characteristics of an individual content item of the two or more content items. The method can further include selecting a third different content item based at least in part on the second different content item and providing the third different content item to the initiating device for presentation on the initiating device after presentation of the second different content item on the co-located presentation device. The method can further include presenting information for presentation in a user interface (UI) to a sponsor of the second different content item to enable selection of different bids or different selection criteria or different content items for presentation based at least in part on the enhanced presentation characteristics or the characteristics associated with the display of the initiating device.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include another computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes initiating an application on a client device to enable the presentation of user-selected content delivered from a serving system to be presented on a separate but co-located presentation device, wherein the client device includes a display for presenting content to the user. The method further includes providing, by one or more processors, user-identifying information to enable the serving system to locate profile information for the user. The method further includes receiving an indication from the application of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on the separate but co-located presentation device, the separate co-located presentation device having enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the client device, for presenting content. The method further includes, after the first content item is delivered to the separate co-located presentation device, receiving an input from the user to interact with or adjust a presentation of the first content item. The method further includes providing, directly to the separate co-located presentation device, a prompt that includes the input. The method further includes receiving one or more additional content items at the client device based on content that is delivered by the serving system directly to the separate co-located presentation device based at least in part on the content and the profile information.

The enhanced presentation characteristics can include display characteristics or audio characteristics. The display characteristics can include higher resolution and larger screen area.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system comprising a user identification engine for identifying a user of an initiating device and for locating associated profile information for the identified user, a user intent engine for receiving an indication from an application running on the initiating device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device, a content identification engine for selecting one or more additional content items for delivery along with the first content item, including identifying a second different content item based at least in part on the profile information for the identified user and the enhanced presentation characteristics, and a content delivery engine for delivering the first and second different content items directly to the co-located presentation device without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device.
Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Content sponsors can elect to bid higher for presentations of their content to devices that have enhanced presentation characteristics. Users can enjoy a better user experience that results from the presentation of content on devices having enhanced display and/or audio characteristics.
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
This document describes systems, methods, computer program products and mechanisms for delivering content to a presentation device that is separate from, but co-located with, an initiating device. For example, a user associated with an initiating device (e.g., a laptop computer, tablet computer, smartphone or other mobile or non-mobile communication device) can be identified, and profile information associated with the user can be located. The initiating device, for example, can include a display for presenting content to the user. An indication can be received from an application running on the initiating device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device (e.g., a video to be presented on the television). For example, the separate but co-located presentation device (e.g., in the same room) can have enhanced presentation characteristics, e.g., relative to the display of the initiating device, for presenting content, such as enhanced display characteristics or audio characteristics. One or more additional content items can be selected for delivery along with the first content item, including identifying a second different content item based, at least in part, on the profile information for the identified user and the enhanced presentation characteristics. The first and second different content items can be delivered directly to the co-located presentation device without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device. For example, the video and content item can be presented on the television and not on the user's initiating device.
While the examples provided herein include the use of two devices that are co-located, other configurations are possible. In some implementations, configurations can exist in which more than two devices are used, e.g., including plural of either or both of initiating devices and presentation devices. In some implementations, the initiating device and the presentation device need not be co-located, e.g., if the initiating device controls content provided to one or more remote presentation devices. Other configurations are possible.
The environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. A data store of user profile information 131, for example, can include profile information about users (e.g., including user interests). User interest information associated with user profile information can include information declared by a user in creating the user profile. User interest information can also include information directly derived or inferred from user actions on the network 102, such as Web page navigation, resource consumption, endorsements, communications, search queries and the like. For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server. In some implementations, the user profile information 131 can be organized by user identifier or in other ways. A data store of eligible content items 132 can include different types of content items such as multi-media content items, graphical display content items, audio content item, executable software applications, Internet resources, and other formats or types of content items.
The content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be combined or separate, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102). A user identification engine 121, for example, can identify a user of an initiating device and locate associated profile information for the identified user. For example, the initiating device can be the user's laptop computer, tablet computer, smartphone or other mobile or non-mobile communication device.
A user intent engine 122 can receive an indication from an application running on the initiating device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device (e.g., a television). For example, the separate but co-located presentation device can have enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the initiating device, for presenting content.
A content identification engine 123, for example, can select one or more additional content items for delivery along with the first content item, including identifying a second different content item based at least in part on the profile information for the identified user and the enhanced presentation characteristics. For example, the content identification engine 123 can identify a content item related to fast cars to be presented on the television with a video related to cars, e.g., using profile information indicating that the user is interested in fast cars.
A content delivery engine 124, for example, can deliver the first and second different content items directly to the co-located presentation device without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device. For example, the car-related video and fast car-related content item can be provided to the television and not to the user's initiating device.
A website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
A resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102. A resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts).
A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
A user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104. In turn, data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106. The data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114.
When a resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by a user device 106, the content management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110.
For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116.
Based at least in part on data included in the request, the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
The content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
At stage 1, for example, the user identification engine 121 can identify (206) the user 202 of (e.g., associated with) the initiating device 106 a and locate profile information for the identified user 202. The user 202, in this example, can be a user using the initiating device 106 a to control content selected for presentation on the presentation device 106 b. In some implementations, identification of the user 202 can include using login credentials provided by the user when logging into a user service associated with the user's use of the initiating device 106 a. The identification of the user 202 can be based on information that is available in the user profile information 131. Other ways of identifying the user are possible.
At stage 2, for example, the user intent engine 122 can receive an indication 208 from an application running on the initiating device 106 a of an intent, by the user 202, to receive a first content item 132 a on the separate but co-located presentation device 106 b. In the current example, the presentation device 106 b can have enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the initiating device, for presenting content. In some implementations, the enhanced presentation characteristics can include, for example, display characteristics (e.g., higher resolution and/or a larger screen area) or audio characteristics (e.g., higher-quality speakers or other sound components). Other enhanced presentation characteristics are possible. The first content item 132 a, for example, can be a video (e.g., that includes rich content) that can be streamed to the presentation device 106 b or that uses other enhanced presentation capabilities of the device. Also, the first content item 132 a, for example, can be one of the eligible content items 132, e.g., a particular video selected by the user 202 using the user interface 204 for presentation on the presentation device 106 b.
At stage 3, for example, the content identification engine 123 can select one or more additional content items 132 b for delivery along with the first content item 132 a. The selection of the one or more additional content items can include, for example, identifying at least second different content items, such as from the eligible content items 132. The identification can be based, at least in part, on the profile information for the identified user (e.g., user 202) and the enhanced presentation characteristics of the presentation device 106 b. For example, the content identification engine 123 can identify content items that are selected based, at least in part, on user profile information for the user 202. The selection of content items, for example, can also be based on information associated with the first content item. The content item can be an ad. For example, the first content item 132 a can be a video that includes scenes of cars, and the user's profile information can indicate an interest in fast cars. As such, the one or more additional content items 132 b selected by the content identification engine 123 can include content items for sports cars or other cars of potential interest to the user 202. In some implementations, the additional content items 132 b selected in the current example and other examples can be enhanced versions of eligible content items 132 that are available for presentation on devices not having enhanced presentation characteristics.
At stage 4, for example, the content delivery engine 124 can deliver the first and second different content items directly to the co-located presentation device 106 b, without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device 106 a. For example, after the request for content, e.g., in the form of the indication 208, is received from the initiating device 106 a, the content management system 110 can provide the content (e.g., the first content item 132 a and additional content items 132 b) to the presentation device 106 b. Alternatively, or in addition, the content management system 110 can provide additional content items 132 b to the initiating device 106 a while or after processing the request for the first content item 132 a.
A user of an initiating device is identified, and profile information for the identified user is located (302). The initiating device includes a display for presenting content to the user. For example, the user identification engine 121 can identify the user 202 as the user using the initiating device 106 a, e.g., the user's laptop computer, tablet computer, smartphone, or other mobile or non-mobile computation device. The user identification engine 121 can also locate user profile information 131 for the user 202, e.g., using a user identifier, account information, a device identifier, or other information.
An indication is received from an application running on the initiating device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device (304). The separate co-located presentation device has enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the initiating device, for presenting content. As an example, based on user selections on the user interface 204, the initiating device 106 a can send the indication 208 to the content management system 110, e.g., where it is received by the user intent engine 122. The indication 208, for example, can include information regarding a particular content item (e.g., a video) selected by the user 202 for presentation on the presentation device 106 b.
In some implementations, receiving an indication can include receiving a request to initiate a session for presenting content on the co-located presentation device, wherein the request includes an identifier for the first content item. For example, the user 202 can input the name, title, URL or other information associated with the video that is to be presented on the television.
In some implementations, the initiating device 106 a and the presentation device 106 b can be communicatively coupled, e.g., using near field communication (NFC), direct Wifi, a local area network or other communication link.
One or more additional content items are selected for delivery along with the first content item (306). The selection can include identifying a second different content item based at least in part on the profile information for the identified user and the enhanced presentation characteristics. For example, the content identification engine 123 can select one or more content items (e.g., related to cars) to be presented on the presentation device 106 b with the user-selected video (e.g., about fast cars). Selection of the one or more content items, for example, can be based on user profile information for the user. Also, the types of enhanced versions of the content items, for example, that are selected can be based on the enhanced presentation characteristics of the presentation device 106 b. In some implementations, the indication 208, when received by the user intent engine 122, can include information associated with the enhanced presentation characteristics (e.g., capabilities) of the presentation device 106 b.
In some implementations, the first content item can be an Internet content item, and the second different content item can be selected based, at least in part, on content or metadata of the Internet content item. For example, the first content item to be presented on the television can be a car-related video from a video content sharing site (or other location), and the second content item (e.g., a content item related to cars) can be selected based on the first content item and/or metadata associated with the car-related video. In some implementations, the Internet content item can be a multi-media content item, a graphical display item, an audio content item, an executable software application, an Internet resource, or some other content item.
In some implementations, one or both of the first content item or the second different content item can be or include an audio feed (e.g., radio). Other combinations of formats are possible.
In some implementations, selecting one or more additional content items can include identifying eligible content items from an inventory of content items (e.g., the eligible content items 132). In some implementations, eligible content items can include items that are adapted for presentation in an environment that supports the enhanced presentation characteristics, e.g., an ad or other content items that have been designed to appear on televisions or other devices having enhanced visual and/or audio presentation characteristics (e.g., capabilities).
In the example shown, first and second different content items are delivered directly to the co-located presentation device without delivering the first and second different content items to the initiating device (308). For example, the content management system 110 can provide the first content item 132 a (e.g., car-related video) and the one or more additional content items 132 b (e.g., presentation-enhanced car-related content items) to the presentation device 106 b. Alternatively, or in addition, the content management system 110 can provide additional content items to the initiating device 106 a while or after processing a request to send a first content item 132 a to the presentation device 106 b.
In some implementations, selecting the one or more additional content items can include identifying a content item (e.g., from the eligible content items 132) and adjusting one or more characteristics of the content item to produce the second different content item. For example, the content management system 110 can make changes to a script or other code or logic associated with the car-related video to include commands or other features that change the content item to be adapted to an enhanced environment. In some implementations, the adjustments can be table-driven, e.g., to automatically substitute one aspect of the content item with another. In some implementations, the adjustments can be based on the type of device on which the content item will be presented, e.g., as some televisions may have higher resolutions or screen sizes than others.
In some implementations, selecting the one or more additional content items can include selecting a campaign associated with a content sponsor for providing the second different content item, the campaign having two or more associated content items each having different characteristics (e.g., a high-resolution and a low-resolution version of the same content item). In some implementations, selecting the second different content item can include selecting one of the two or more content items as the second different content item based at least in part on the enhanced presentation characteristics and associated characteristics of an individual content item of the two or more content items. For example, the content item selected (e.g., high-resolution versus low-resolution) can depend on the request and on the particular type of device on which the content item will be presented.
In some implementations, the process 300 can further include selecting a third different content item based at least in part on the second different content item and providing the third different content item to the initiating device for presentation on the initiating device after presentation of the second different content item on the co-located presentation device. For example, the content management system 110 can select an additional one of the eligible content items 132 (e.g., another car-related content item) for delivery to the initiating device 106 a. In this example, the content item that is presented to the user 202 on the user's laptop, table computer, smartphone or other computing device can be a low-resolution car-related content item that may or may not be related to the high-resolution content item appearing on the user's television.
In some implementations, the process 300 can further include presenting information for presentation in a user interface (UI) to a sponsor of the second different content item to enable selection of different bids or different selection criteria of different content items for presentation based at least in part on the enhanced presentation characteristics of a presentation device (i.e., the device used to present the second content item) or the characteristics associated with the display of the initiating device. For example, campaign sponsors can use options and controls for setting different bids for impressions of creatives depending on the circumstances, e.g., using higher bids for content items that are to be presented on televisions having enhanced presentation characteristics when their enhanced presentation content is presented on such devices.
An application is initiated on a client device to enable the presentation of user-selected content delivered from a serving system to be presented on a separate but co-located presentation device (322). The client device can include, for example, a display for presenting content to the user. For example, the user interface 204 can be started by the user 202 on the initiating device 106 a (e.g., the user's laptop computer, tablet computer, smart phone, or other mobile or non-mobile communication device). In this example, the initiating device 106 a can be configured (e.g., by being Internet-enabled) to interface with the content management system 110 to control content presented on the presentation device 106 b (e.g., the user's Internet-enabled, large-screen television).
User-identifying information is (e.g., optionally) provided to enable the serving system to locate profile information for the user (324). For example, information provided by the user on, or available from, the initiating device 106 a can be used by the user identification engine 121 to look up user profile information 131 (e.g., identifying user interests) associated with the user 202.
An indication is received from the application of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on the separate but co-located presentation device (326). The separate co-located presentation device has enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of the client device, for presenting content. For example, user selections made by the user 202 in the user interface 204 can cause the initiating device 106 a to send the indication 208 to the content management system 110, e.g., where it is received by the user intent engine 122. The indication 208, for example, can include information regarding a particular content item (e.g., a video) selected by the user 202 for presentation on the presentation device 106 b.
After, or during delivery of the first content item to the separate co-located presentation device, an input is received from the user to interact with or adjust a presentation of the first content item (328). As an example, after the video begins playing on the presentation device 106 b, the user 202 can make a section on the initiating device 106 a to control the presentation (e.g., volume, play, etc.) of the video on the presentation device 106 b. For example, the selection can be associated with a simulcast of related content to be presented on the initiating device 106 a and the presentation device 106 b.
A prompt is provided directly to the separate co-located presentation device that includes the input (330). For example, in communication between the initiating device 106 a and the presentation device 106 b, the user's input on the initiating device 106 a can cause a prompt to appear that is associated with the simulcast presentation of content on the initiating device 106 a and that is related to content presented on the presentation device 106 b.
One or more additional content items are received at the initiating device based on content that is delivered by the serving system directly to the separate co-located presentation device based at least in part on the content and the profile information (332). For example, content, such as content items related to fast cars, can be received at the initiating device 106 a that are selected based on the video being presented on the presentation device 106 b and further based on user profile information associated with the user 202. Selection of an content item related to fast cars can be made, for example, because the video is related to the theme of cars, and more specifically, the video is related to a known interest by the user 202 in fast cars.
The memory 404 stores information within the computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units.
The storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 400. In one implementation, the storage device 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, the storage device 406 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 404, the storage device 406, or memory on processor 402.
The high-speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while the low-speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is an example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled to memory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled to storage device 406 and low-speed bus 414. The low-speed bus 414 (e.g., a low-speed expansion port), which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth®, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet), may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter.
The computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a rack server system 424. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as computing device 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing devices 400, 450, and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 400, 450 communicating with each other.
The processor 452 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 450, including instructions stored in the memory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of the computing device 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by computing device 450, and wireless communication by computing device 450.
The memory 464 stores information within the computing device 450. In one implementation, the memory 464 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 464 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 464 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 474 may also be provided and connected to computing device 450 through expansion interface 472, which may include, for example, a subscriber identification module (SIM) card interface. Such expansion memory 474 may provide extra storage space for computing device 450, or may also store applications or other information for computing device 450. Specifically, expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module for computing device 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of computing device 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIM card in a non-hackable manner.
The memory may include for example, flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 464, expansion memory 474, or memory on processor 452.
The computing device 450 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of a smartphone 482, personal digital assistant, or other mobile device.
Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. Other programming paradigms can be used, e.g., functional programming, logical programming, or other programming. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
Thus, particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
