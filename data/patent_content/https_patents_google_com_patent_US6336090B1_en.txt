Definitions
- the present invention relates to Automatic Speech/Speaker Recognition (ASR) and, more particularly, ASR over wireless communications channels.
- ASR Automatic Speech/Speaker Recognition
- ASR Automatic Speech/Speaker Recognition
- PCS personal communications systems
- wireless wireless
- ASR over wireless channels is problematic because of the additional noise and distortion introduced into voice signals during the coding, transmission (e.g., due to fading or packet loss), and decoding stages.
- Noise-degraded voice signals present in wireless environments are often substantially different from the original voice signal, leading to degradation in ASR performances when standard ASR techniques arc applied.
- This problem has become acute as attempts to create advanced ASR-based services, such as intelligent agent services or large vocabulary speech recognition services over digital wireless channels.
- Previous approaches have mainly focused on noise reduction techniques, but the results are far from ideal and of limited applicability because of the many variations in wireless environments (e.g. TDMA, CDMA, (GSM, etc.).
- FIG. 1 A typical prior art dual channel system is illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- a cellular handset 101 is employed by a mobile user to encode normal speech and transmit the coded signal, including relevant coder parameters, through primary (voice) channel 105 to cellular base station 120 .
- Base station 120 then decodes the received coded signal to produce a voice output suitable for communication over the public switched telephone network (PSTN), or other voice communications network as represented by public switch 130 and its output to a network.
- PSTN public switched telephone network
- FIG. 1 also shows the generation at the cellular handset 101 of a second set of signals corresponding to the ASR parameters to be used by an ASR application.
- This second set of signals is transmitted over a second digital channel 110 to cellular base station 120 , where they are forwarded to ASR system 140 .
- reliable ASR feature vector sequences are derived at a base station (or other network or system unit) directly from the digitally transmitted speech coder parameters.
- the ASR functions are performed at a public switch or elsewhere in a network.
- a novel ASR feature extractor operates on the received speech coder parameters from the handset with no additional processing or signal modification required at the handset.
- speech coder parameters received at a base station are used not only for reproducing the voice signal, as at present, but also for generating the feature vector sequence for ASR applications.
- An illustrative ASR feature vector extractor at the base-station in operating on digitally transmitted speech coder parameters prior to conversion of these coder parameters back to a voice signal avoids the lossy conversion process and associated voice distortion.
- there is no need to modify wireless handsets since the ASR feature vectors are derived from the same set of speech coder parameters ordinarily extracted at the handset. Therefore, existing handsets provide a front end for the ASR feature vector extractor at the base station.
- connection from the handset to the base station in digital wireless environments is all-digital and includes error protection for data signals communicated to a base station. Therefore, the transmission from the handset to the present inventive feature extractor at a base-station or other location has the same digital transmission quality as in secondary channel schemes.
- the present invention provides illustrative techniques for realizing a speech feature extractor based on normal speech coder parameters. Further, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, perfect synchronization of the (decoded) voice signal and the ASR feature vector signal is provided without additional signal synchronization bits. This is possible, as disclosed in illustrative embodiments of the present invention, because both the voice signal and ASR feature vector signal are generated from the same speech coder parameters.
- the present invention provides systems and methods for enhanced ASR with no need for a secondary channel and no major changes to current wireless standards. Changes, extensions and operational differences at base stations are also minimal.
- the digital channel for ASR applications is created (through modifications to software) as a second destination for a voice call.
- Alternative embodiments perform the ASR feature extraction and ASR functions at a switch connected (directly or through network connections) to the receiving base station.
- the coded speech signals received at a base station from the transmitting handset are forwarded (with or without decoded speech signals) to a network location, including a terminal or storage system.
- FIG. 1 shows a prior art system using a secondary digital channel to transmit ASR parameters to a base station for subsequent use by an ASR system.
- FIG. 2 shows an overall system representation of an illustrative single-channel embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 shows illustrative processing steps useful in converting coded voice signals received at a base station to ASR feature parameters.
- FIG. 4 shows an illustrative ASR system operating on ASR feature parameters of the illustrative processing shown in FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram useful in understanding the conversion of LPC values to correlation coefficients in accordance with one aspect of the illustrative process of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 6A shows an illustrative traffic message format including LSP information and error protection bits.
- FIG. 6B shows an illustrative traffic message format including LPC information and error protection bits.
- FIG. 6C shows an illustrative traffic message format including LSF information and error protection bits.
- FIG. 2 shows an illustrative system embodiment of the present invention.
- a handset 201 is shown generating speech coder parameters for transmission to wireless base station 220 in response to spoken user inputs.
- the coded speech signals sent on transmission channel 205 are identical (for the same spoken input) in every way to coded speech signals used for voice communications in normal (non-ASR) use of the wireless system of FIG. 2 .
- these coded speech signals are of the same type as those transmitted on the voice channel 105 in the system in FIG. 1 .
- No secondary digital channel is required to carry a set of ASR-related parameters, as in the system of FIG. 1 .
- the received coded voice signals are, on the one hand, provided on path 222 for delivery to public switch 230 , as in normal performance of the wireless system (and in the system of FIG. 1 ).
- decoding of the handset-coded speech signals is accomplished at a switch such as public switch 230 , but such decoding to speech signals can occur at base station 120 or, via switch 230 and path 231 , elsewhere in the PSTN (or other) network.
- the coded voice signals received at wireless base station 220 are provided to ASR feature extraction system 235 and ASR system 240 , illustratively located at base station 220 .
- the same coded representations that are decoded to produce voice signals are, instead used to extract ASR feature parameters in ASR feature extraction unit 235 for use by ASR systems such as 240 .
- the speech coder parameters received from handset 205 are also illustratively provided on lead 225 to public switch 230 , where they are alternatively (or additionally) available for delivery as digital signals to feature extraction and ASR units at switch 230 or elsewhere in a network.
- connection from base station 220 to ASR feature extraction system 235 and thence to ASR system 240 is for some applications advantageously arranged to be a separate switch connection, such as is used to connect the normal voice path to public switch 230 . In other applications it proves convenient to have the coded parameters sent by the same path to a switch 230 , where feature extraction (and ASR) are performed in addition to speech decoding.
- base station 220 will, in one typical application of the present inventive principles, provide the coded speech parameters directly to ASR feature extraction unit 235 and ASR system 240 .
- the path to ASR feature extractor 235 and/or ASR system 240 may be maintained at switch 230 or other centralized facility for application of the recognized speech.
- the recognized speech may be used for authentication of the speaker, or for command or other inputs to a text-responsive system.
- One application for such recognized speech is the transfer of a text version of the speech to a responsive system, e.g. for speaker-machine interaction, though numerous and varied other applications of speech recognition are known in the art.
- the manner of conversion of standard voice coded signals to produce ASR feature parameters will be described in more detail below.
- One useful characteristic of digital wireless environments is that a user's speech, after conversion into a sequence of digital coder parameters at the handset, is advantageously error protected by channel coding techniques during the transmission through the wireless medium.
- This channel coding is typically applied unequally to different parts of the transmission. That is, it is common to have the most important coder parameters transmitted with more complete protection, while less important parameters are less fully protected. Among these most important parameters are those relating to signal synchronization and the spectral shape of the voice signals.
- ASR feature vector signals are advantageously extracted from these better-protected speech coder parameters.
- information for ASR feature extraction is received digitally and with high reliability using, only the channel coding scheme normally used to protect original speech coder parameters.
- ASR feature extraction is advantageously accomplished from the speech coder parameters before they are converted back to voice signals.
- the converted voice signal is distorted in the decoding process.
- the segmental-signal-to-quantization-noise-ratio (SSNR) of the decoded voice is often only approximately 20 dB in typical wireless environments. See, for example, B. S. Atal. V. Cuperman and A. Gersho “Advances in Speech Coding” Kluwer Academic Publisher .
- This latter signal condition arises because in seeking to meet low-bit-rate constraints, many features, e.g., excitation signals, are not adequately coded and represented.
- channel fading and interference cause many speech coder parameters to be unreliable for high-quality conversion back to voice signals.
- the converted voice signal is normally a synthesized voice signal.
- the converted voice signal has a heavy dependency on the particular coding scheme used in the speech coder.
- the synthesized speech from the speech coder is usually very different from the human speech used to establish the speech recognition model; typically many characteristics of a speaker's voice are altered or lost in the synthesis process.
- Speech coders typically used in wireless environments vary in many respects from one system to another. See, for example, R. Steele, “Speech codecs for Personal Communications,” IEEE Communications Magazine , November 1993, pp. 76-83. Nevertheless, many of the most widely used coders use analysis-by-synthesis techniques described, for example in J. Flanagan “Speech Analysis, Synthesis and Reproduction” Springer-Verlag. Moreover, these coders typically use linear predicative coding (LPC) analysis to characterize the spectral shape of windowed speech frames. Examples of these LPC-based coders include several variants of the well-known CELP techniques.
- LPC linear predicative coding
- the order of the analysis filter A(z) and parametric representations for speech signals typically vary from coder to coder.
- such analysis filters are typically characterized by various sets of parameters, including reflection coefficients, log-area ratio coefficients, line spectral pairs (LSPs) and line spectrum frequencies (LSFs), among others.
- LSPs line spectral pairs
- LSFs line spectrum frequencies
- Autocorrelation coefficients carry salient information from which the most widely used ASR feature parameters, LPC cepstial coefficients, can be derived. See, for example, L. Rabiner and B.-H. Juang Fundamentals of Speech Recognition , Prentice-Hall, 1993. Moreover, the order of the LPC analysis in speech coders is often higher than the order of the LPC analysis needed for typical ASR applications. This is because in speech coding the shape of the spectral envelope must be tracked closely in order to accurately reproduce the voice waveform. In contrast, the minor details of the spectral envelope have little value in ASR. Since the lower order autocorrelation coefficients are always part of the autocorrelation coefficients obtained from higher order LPC analysis characteristic of wireless coders, they can always be extracted from the speech coder parameters.
- FIG. 3 depicts operations performed in an illustrative ASR feature extractor (such as 235 in FIG. 1 ).
- the coder parameters are retrieved from the handset-to-base-station transmission and applied as input 300 in FIG. 3 .
- These received speech coder parameters are typically provided in sets for contiguous speech intervals, each of 10-20 msec duration. These received sets of coder parameters are first processed to retrieve the parameters related to the analysis filter from the larger set of received parameter values.
- the selected coder parameter set is further transformed at step 310 into auto correlation coefficients by means of an appropriate transformation implemented in the feature extractor.
- an appropriate transformation implemented in the feature extractor One particular example is given below for the illustrative case of the IS-127 CDMA wireless standard.
- order reduction is performed on the autocorrelation coefficients, and the lower order autocorrelation coefficients ⁇ r l (t)
- l 0, 1 . . . , 10 ⁇ are extracted at step 320 for the purpose of generating ASR feature vectors.
- l 0, 1, . . . , 10 ⁇ . It proves convenient in many cases to perform this latter conversion using the well-known Levison-Durbin recursion algorithm described, for example, in L. Rabiner and B-H Juang, Fundamentals of Speech Recognition , Prentice-Hall, 1993.
- LPC cepstral coefficients advantageously provide the basis of ASR feature vectors, as is well known in the art.
- the LPC cepstral coefficients arc then weighted at step 350 in FIG.
- FIG. 4 shows a typical speech recognition system ( 240 in FIG. 2) that receives the output feature vector c from a features extractor (e.g., 235 in FIG. 2, and FIG. 3) on input 400 .
- a features extractor e.g., 235 in FIG. 2, and FIG. 3
- the illustrative ASR system of FIG. 4 employs subword models represented by 455 in FIG. 4 for use in connection with lexicon information stored in lexicon store 457 .
- the subword models are based on phone-like units and are typically built using training data collected from speakers.
- the subword models are concatenated to form models for words in a lexicon provided from a dictionary or other known source.
- word model composition block 450 When subword units are selected corresponding to a complete set of phonemes in English, the subword model set can model any given words in English.
- word model composition block 450 The combination of these modeling sources is illustrated in FIG. 4 by word model composition block 450 .
- composition block 450 The word models provided by composition block 450 are then processed in accordance with well-known hidden Markov models (HMMs) techniques described, for example, in the above-cited Rabinier and Juuag reference.
- HMMs hidden Markov models
- the grammar language model 460 and semantics model 465 shown in FIG. 4 can be used to constrain the searches performed in such HMM processing.
- the best word sequence is obtained in the system of FIG. 4 by using a Viterbi decoding process based on all knowledge sources, while using ASR speech feature vector sequences from the ASR feature vector extractor 235 in FIG. 2 .
- This section presents an illustrative process, including pseudocode listings, for the converstion of speech coder parameters received at a feature extractor (such as 235 in FIG. 2) to correlation coefficients useful in constructing the feature vectors for input to an ASR system (such as 240 in FIG. 2 and in FIG. 4 ).
- speech coding algorithms standardized for use in digital wireless telecommunication systems operate on digitally sampled audio waveforms.
- the sampled waveforms are processed in discrete time intervals (frames), and the speech encoder at the transmitting side of the communications link uses a number of operations to determine the values for a set of parameters that would best describe the audio waveform in the frame being processed.
- These parameters are encoded, often in the form of an index to a table or codebook, and transmitted over the air interface to the receiver.
- the speech decoder at the receiver possesses the same codebooks as the encoder at the transmitter, and performs a series of operations using the encoded parameters in order to generate an approximation to the original waveform that was presented to the encoder at the transmitter.
- LPCs linear predictor coefficients
- LSPs line spectral pairs
- LSFs line spectral frequencies
- EVRC Enhanced Variable Rate Coder
- TIA Telecommunications Industry Association
- CDMA Code Division Multiple Access
- the techniques described are equally applicable to any speech coding algorithm based on the CELP model or on any form of linear predictive coding (LPC).
- FIGS. 6A, 6 B and 6 C shows illustrative traffic message formats and including error protection bits and LSP, LPC and LSF information, respectively. Such formats are illustrated, for example, in D. J. Goodman, Wireless Personal Communications Systems , Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass, 1997.
- the coding algorithm operates on digitally sampled audio waveforms in 20 msec intervals (frames) to generate and transmit a set of parameters that describes the waveform for the frame being processed.
- the transmitted parameters include codes that represent the values of the LSPs for the frame.
- the LSP codes comprise a set of three codebook indices, each of which identifies a particular set of LSP values included in one of the three LSP codebooks maintained by both the speech encoder and speech decoder. These LSP codes are translated to a vector of ten LSPs, which are then converted to LPCs for use in the decoder's synthesis filter.
- the process of generating correlation coefficients can be accomplished in a number of ways. One way is to first convert the LPCs to reflection coefficients (RCs), and then to convert the RCs to autocorrelation coefficients (CCs).
- RCs reflection coefficients
- CCs autocorrelation coefficients
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of functions performed in this illustrative process.
- input LPCs are received at 501 and applied to the LPC-to-RC functional block 510 .
- the input LPCs are also applied to the RC-to-CC functional block over path 515 .
- This latter input and the output of block 510 are used in block 520 to generate the desired correlation coefficients on output path 530 .
- aa[j] (aa[j] ⁇ aa[I]* tempt[j])/tmp;
- LPC 13 ORDER is nominally equal to 10 for the IS-127 speech coder, though other particular values can be used as circumstances might dictate.
- tmp is a temporary variable and temp is a temporary array of dimension LPC_ORDER.
- the array lpc of dimension LPC_ORDER is an input to this transformation, and contains the LPCs calculated by the IS-127 speech decoder.
- the array rc of dimension LPC_ORDER is the output of the transformation and contains the RCs.
- dummy[j+1] dummy[j+1]+rc[i]* dummy[j+1];
- LPC_ORDER is a constant whose value is again nominally 10 for IS-127
- tmp is a temporary variable
- dummy is temporary array of dimension LPC_ORDER+1.
- the inputs to the transformation are the arrays lpc and rc, both of dimension LPC_ORDER+1, that contain the LPCs and RCs, respectively.
- the output of the transformation is the array cc, also of dimension LPC_ORDER+1, that contains the correlation coefficients to be used by the ASR system.
- the LPCs are generated internally by the IS-127 decoder; the operations to calculate and output CCs described above are advantageously inserted into the decoder at the point immediately after the LPC calculation.
- CELP-based coders commonly used today, no such limitation is essential to the present invention.
- a variety of coding techniques advantageously provide error-protected (and other high-reliability) received speech coding parameters from which useful ASR feature vectors can be derived, as taught in the present disclosure.
- FIG. 4 While the illustrative ASR system shown in FIG. 4 employs particular modeling and processing steps and functions, none of these are essential to the broader aspects of the present invention.
- Other particular speech recognizers will be applied by those skilled in the art and appropriate feature information will be extracted from received signals in the manner described above, and in modifications and extensions thereof—all as will be clear to those skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure.
- ASR automatic speech recognition
- speaker recognition and authentication will also be advantageously performed using the inventive principles described herein.
- Useful adaptations and modifications of the present teachings for embodiments employing such additional or alternative functionality are well-known in the art.
- information about the speech characteristics of such speakers will be stored or otherwise made available for use in the speech models employed.
- the feature extraction and/or ASR units can be located a the receiving base station, the switch connected to the base station (or another network switch connected through that first switch), or at another location connected on the network(s) to which these elements are connected.
- the digital coded handset signals can be communicated to any convenient location for feature extraction and ASR operations. In some cases it will be convenient to have the feature extraction and ASR operations performed at different locations.
