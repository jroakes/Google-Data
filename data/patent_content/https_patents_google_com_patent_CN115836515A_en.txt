Abstract
Embodiments relate to using an assistant to initiate an automated telephone call with an entity. Some embodiments identify an item of interest, identify a group of entities associated with the item, and initiate a call with the entities. During a given call with a given entity, the assistant may request a status update regarding the item and determine a time delay before initiating another call with the given entity to request a further status update regarding the item based on information received in response to the request. Other embodiments receive a request to perform an action on behalf of a user, identify a group of entities that can perform the action, and initiate a given call with a given entity. During a given call, the assistant can initiate additional calls with additional entities and generate notifications for the user based on the results of the given call and/or the additional calls.
Description
Technical Field
Background
A user may interact with the automated assistant via various computing devices, such as a smartphone, tablet computer, wearable device, automotive system, standalone personal assistant device, and so forth. The automated assistant receives input (e.g., verbal, touch, and/or key input) from the user and responds with responsive output (e.g., visual and/or audible).
The user can interact with the automated assistant to cause the automated assistant to perform actions on behalf of the user. As one example, an automated assistant may place a telephone call on behalf of a user to perform a given action, and may converse with other users to perform the action. For example, a user may provide input requesting the automated assistant to query the project or service on behalf of the user via the telephone. The automated assistant can initiate an automated phone call with a particular entity associated with an item or service, and can provide information to additional users associated with the particular entity to query. The automated assistant can then notify the user of the results of the automated phone call and/or can update search results associated with the particular entity based on the results.
However, for some actions performed by the automated assistant on behalf of the user, the particular entity may not be able to fully satisfy the user's request, resulting in a waste of computing and/or network resources utilized in performing the action. As one example, assume that the automated assistant interrogates on behalf of the user over the telephone as described above, and further assume that additional users associated with a particular entity indicate that the item or service is not available. Some automated assistants may determine that the item or service is not available and simply provide a notification to the user that reflects that the item or service is not available. As a result, computational and/or network resources utilized in performing the automatic call are wasted. In addition, the user may manually place other telephone calls to other entities and/or have the automated assistant place other automated telephone calls to other entities in an attempt to satisfy the request, thereby resulting in further use of computing and/or network resources. Moreover, other users may place manual and/or automatic calls to a particular entity with the same or similar requests that the particular entity cannot satisfy, resulting in further use of computing and/or network resources.
Disclosure of Invention
Embodiments relate to using an automated assistant to initiate and perform automated telephone calls. In some implementations, the automated telephone call may be initiated and executed in response to a request to initiate and execute the automated telephone call. The automated assistant can identify a group of entities associated with the request, and can initiate corresponding automated phone calls with one or more of the entities of the group to perform the action associated with the request. Further, the automated assistant can perform an action associated with the request by rendering an instance of the synthesized speech related to the request. At least some of the instances of synthesized speech may be generated based on the request and based on processing responses from representatives of the entities participating in the telephone call during the automated telephone call.
In some implementations, the request to initiate and perform an automated phone call can be based on analyzing query activity of multiple users. The automated assistant can identify terms corresponding to items or services of interest that are included in a threshold number of queries (and optionally span a threshold duration) based on analyzing query activity. In response to identifying that the term corresponding to the item or service of interest is included in a threshold number of queries (and optionally spans a threshold duration of time), the automated assistant may identify, in one or more databases, a group of entities associated with the item or service of interest. For example, suppose there is a proliferation of queries for toilet paper. In this example, the request may be a request for a status update of toilet paper at each entity of the group, and each entity may be identified based on the entities stored in association with the toilet paper items. In some versions of those embodiments, entities included in the group may be limited to a particular geographic area from or near which (e.g., within 10 miles, 50 miles, or other distance thresholds), the query origin of the analysis of the query activity, and/or only to a particular type of entity or entities (e.g., drug store, supermarket, convenience store, grocery store, etc.) stored in association with the item of interest. Continuing with the example above, assume further that the recently proliferated queries originated from jifibon county, kentucky. In this example, the entities included in the group may be limited to entities that are physically located in (or within a threshold distance of) jackfison county, kentucky and that are stored in association with toilet paper items. The automated assistant can also intelligently identify corresponding meaningful types of entities that are related to the item of interest. Continuing with the example above, the automated assistant may identify that toilet paper is primarily sold at an entity such as a supermarket, convenience store, grocery store, etc., and that the relevant store in jackson county, kentucky will be included in the group of entities.
In some versions of those embodiments, an instance of an automated assistant may be used to call each entity of a group in parallel. During each automatic telephone call, an action associated with the request may be performed by rendering an instance of the synthesized speech (e.g., requesting a status update), and information may be received from a representative associated with a corresponding one of the entities in response to the synthesized speech. Further, the automated assistant can determine a time delay before initiating a subsequent additional corresponding automated phone call with the given entity to perform the action again. Further, in response to determining that the time delay has elapsed, the automated assistant may initiate a subsequent additional corresponding automated phone call with the given entity to perform the action again.
For example, assume that the request is a request for a status update regarding toilet paper at each of the entities of the group, and assume that the representative associated with the given entity indicates that the given entity has enough toilet paper for three days. In this example, the automated assistant can assign a 72 hour period as the time delay based on the information received from the representative. Thus, the automated assistant will not initiate subsequent corresponding automated phone calls with a given entity until the 72 hour period has elapsed. Instead, assume that the representative associated with a given entity indicates that the given entity may not have enough toilet paper to last the remainder of the day. In this example, the automated assistant can assign a time period of four hours as the time delay based on the information received from the representative. Thus, the automated assistant will initiate subsequent corresponding automated phone calls with the given entity later on that same day. In these and other ways, a corresponding time delay may be dynamically determined for each entity based on information received during an automated telephone call with the entity. Dynamically determining the time delay in this manner may balance the technical benefits achieved by maintaining up-to-date information from the entity with the resources used in initiating and performing the automated telephone call. In other words, dynamically determining the time delay may prevent another automated telephone call to the entity from being performed too quickly, which may result in unnecessary utilization of computing and/or network resources — while ensuring that information from the entity is up-to-date.
In other implementations, the request to initiate and perform an automated phone call may be based on user input from a user of a computing device associated with the automated assistant. The automated assistant can identify an item or service of interest associated with the request based on processing the user input. In response to identifying the item or service of interest in the user input, the automated assistant can identify, in one or more databases, a group of entities associated with the item or service of interest. For example, assume that a user of a computing device provides a user input of "find rooftop worker me". In this example, the request may be a request for availability of roofers from each of the entities of the group, and each of the entities may be identified based on the entities stored in association with the rooftop item. In some versions of those embodiments, the entities included in the group may be limited to entities within a threshold distance of the location of the user's computing device. Continuing with the example above, the entities included in the group may be limited to entities that are stored in association with the rooftop service within ten miles of the location of the user's computing device. If no entities are included in the group, the threshold distance may be increased until one or more entities are included in the group.
In some versions of those embodiments, each of the entities of the group may be called in an interleaved manner using an instance of the automated assistant. The automated assistant may initiate a first automated phone call with a first entity of the group of entities. The action associated with the request may be performed by rendering an instance of the synthesized speech (e.g., requesting a status update, requesting availability of a service, and/or other action), and information may be received from a representative associated with the first entity of the group in response to the synthesized speech. Further, the automated assistant can determine a call origination time associated with each of the other entities of the group. As described in more detail herein (e.g., with respect to fig. 1), the call initiation time may be a set duration after each automated telephone call is initiated, determined based on historical call data associated with each entity in the group, determined based on progress with respect to the automated telephone call, and/or other data related to the automated telephone call. The automated assistant may continue to initiate automated phone calls with the entities of the group until the request is satisfied.
Further, the automated assistant can generate one or more notifications based on results of the one or more automated phone calls such that the one or more notifications can be rendered for each automated phone call initiated and executed by the automated assistant. Further, the automated assistant can cause the user's computing device to audibly and/or visually render the notification at the user's computing device. In some further versions of those embodiments, the notification may include a prompt requesting that a user of the computing device authorize provision of user information to a representative associated with the given entity. As described herein, in various embodiments, call origination times utilized in staggering automatic calls may be determined in view of seeking to reduce latency in providing notifications and/or reduce the overall duration of user interaction with an automated assistant. In many of those embodiments, the call origination time is further determined in view of seeking to mitigate unnecessary calls and/or unnecessarily extended call durations with one or more later called entities (e.g., where an earlier called entity may satisfy the action). Determining the call origination time in this manner may balance the technical benefits achieved by reducing latency and/or interaction duration with the resources utilized in performing automated telephone calls.
In various implementations, the results associated with the entities of the group may be updated based on information obtained during the automated telephone call. For example, assume that the request is a request for a corresponding status update for a toilet paper item originating from an information retrieval system, such as a search interface. Assume further that first information received from a first representation associated with a first entity indicates that the first entity has sufficient toilet paper for three days, and second information received from a second representation associated with a second entity indicates that the second entity may not have sufficient toilet paper for the remaining time of the day. In this example, the results associated with the first entity and the second entity may be updated to include respective indications of information received during the automatic telephone call. In some versions of those embodiments, the results of the update may further include an indication of when the information was received. In these and other ways, the user is provided with an indication of the information of the entity and optionally a time indication of the information, which may at least selectively prevent the user from manually calling the entity for such information and/or cause an automatic call to be initiated for the entity for such information and/or may mitigate the risk of the user going to and from a location associated with the entity. This may reduce the overall number of telephone calls to an entity, at least overall and across a large user population, thereby saving network resources and/or computing resources that would otherwise be utilized in such calls.
The above description is provided merely as a summary of some embodiments disclosed herein. Those embodiments and others are described herein in additional detail.

Detailed Description
FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment that demonstrates aspects of the present disclosure. The client device 110 is illustrated in fig. 1 and, in various embodiments, includes a user input engine 111, a rendering engine 112, a notification engine 113, a speech recognition engine 120A1, a natural language understanding ("NLU") engine 130A1, and a speech synthesis engine 140A1.
User input engine 111 may detect user input at client device 110. The user input detected at client device 110 may include verbal input detected via a microphone of client device 110 and/or additional verbal input transmitted from additional client devices of additional users to client device 110 (e.g., during an automated phone call), touch input detected via a user interface of client device 110, and/or typing input detected via a user interface of client device 110. The additional user may be, for example, a human representative associated with the entity, an automated assistant associated with the entity, an interactive voice response system ("IVR" system) associated with the entity, and/or combinations thereof. The automatic telephone calls described herein may be performed using various voice communication protocols including, for example, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and/or other telephone communication protocols. Further, the automated phone calls described herein may be initiated and executed using automated assistant 115, automated assistant 115 executing locally at client device 110 (e.g., a local assistant), remotely at one or more servers (e.g., a cloud-based assistant), and/or combinations thereof (e.g., as indicated by the dashed lines in fig. 1).
In various implementations, the automated assistant 115 can initiate and execute an automated phone call using the automated request system 180. In embodiments where the automated assistant 115 executes locally at the client device 110, the automatic request system 180 may execute locally on the client device 110 such that automatic telephone calls are initiated and executed using only the resources of the client device 110. In embodiments where the automated assistant 115 is executed remotely at one or more servers, the automated request system 180 may be executed remotely at one or more servers such that only the resources of the one or more servers are used to initiate and execute automated telephone calls. In embodiments where the automated assistant 115 is executed in a distributed manner as shown in fig. 1, the automated request system 180 may be executed remotely at one or more servers in communication with the client device 110 over the network 190. The network 190 may include, for example, wi-Fi, bluetooth, near field communication, local area network, wide area network, other networks, and/or any combination thereof.
In various embodiments, the automatic request system 180 includes a speech recognition engine 120A2, an NLU engine 130A2, a speech synthesis engine 140A2, and an automatic telephone call engine 150. Further, in various embodiments, automated phone call engine 150 includes query analysis engine 151, request handling engine 152, entity identification engine 153, request execution engine 154, update engine 155, authorization engine 156, and time delay engine 157.
In some implementations, the automated assistant 115 can initiate and execute an automated phone call using the automated request system 180 in response to detecting user input from a given user of the client device 110 and via the user input engine 111, where the user input includes a request to initiate the automated phone call. The user input may include a typed or touch input detected via a touch screen or keyboard of the client device 110, and/or a spoken input detected via a microphone of the client device 110. In implementations where the user input engine 111 detects a typed or touch input, the client device 110 may transmit an indication of the detected user input to the request handling engine 152 of the automated phone call engine 150 over the network 190. For example, the user input engine 111 may detect a typing input or a touch input via a search interface, automated assistant interface, and/or other interface of the client device 110, determine that the detected user input relates to initiating and performing an automated phone call, and transmit the detected user input to the request handling engine 152 of the automated phone call engine 150 for further processing of the detected user input.
In implementations where the user input engine 111 detects spoken input of a given user via a microphone of the client device 110, the speech recognition engine 120A1 of the client device 110 may process audio data generated by the microphone capturing the spoken input using the speech recognition model 120A to generate recognized text corresponding to the spoken input. Further, NLU engine 130A1 of client device 110 may process the recognized text generated by speech recognition engine 120A1 using NLU model 130A to determine the intent included in the spoken input. For example, if client device 110 detects a spoken input from a given user of "find toilet paper near me," client device 110 may process audio data capturing the spoken input using speech recognition model 120A to generate recognition text corresponding to the spoken input, and may process the recognition text using NLU model 130A to determine at least an intent to find toilet paper near the given user's current location as an action included in a request to initiate and perform an automated phone call. In some versions of those implementations, the client device 110 may transmit the recognized text corresponding to the spoken input and/or the intent determined based on the spoken input to the request handling engine 152 of the automatic phone call engine 150 for further processing of the recognized text and/or intent.
In other implementations, when the user input engine 111 detects verbal input of a given user via a microphone of the client device 110, the automated assistant 115 can cause the client device 110 to transmit audio data to the automatic request system 180 that captures the verbal input. Speech recognition engine 120A2 and/or NLU engine 130A2 of secondary call system 180 may process audio data capturing verbal input in a similar manner as described above with respect to speech recognition engine 120A1 and/or NLU engine 130A1 of client device 110. Further, the verbal input and/or the intent determined based on the verbal input is directed to a request handling engine 152 of the automated phone call engine 150 for further processing of the identified text and/or intent. In some additional and/or alternative implementations, the speech recognition engine 120A1 and/or the NLU engine 130A1 of the client device 110 can be used in a distributed manner in conjunction with the speech recognition engine 120A2 and/or the NLU engine 130A2 of the automatic request system 180. Further, the speech recognition models 120A and/or NLU models 130A may be stored locally on the client device 110, remotely at the automatic request system 180, and/or remotely at other servers in communication with the client device 110 and/or the automatic request system 180 over the network 190.
In various implementations, the speech recognition model 120A is an end-to-end speech recognition model such that the speech recognition engines 120A1 and/or 120A2 can directly use the model to generate recognized text corresponding to the spoken input. For example, the speech recognition model 120A may be an end-to-end model for generating recognized text on a character-by-character basis (or other token-by-token basis). One non-limiting example of such an end-to-end model for generating recognized text on a character-by-character basis is the recurrent neural network converter (RNN-T) model. The RNN-T model is a form of sequence-to-sequence model that does not employ a mechanism of attention. Unlike most sequence-to-sequence models, which typically require processing of the entire input sequence (e.g., audio data waveforms or mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or other representations) to generate a predicted output, RNN-T models can be used to continuously process input samples and stream-out symbols (e.g., characters of the alphabet). Further, for example, the speech recognition engines 120A1 and/or 120A2 may instead generate predicted phonemes (and/or other representations) when the speech recognition model is not an end-to-end speech recognition model. For example, using such a model, the predicted phonemes (and/or other representations) are then utilized by the speech recognition engines 120A1 and/or 120A2 to determine recognized text that conforms to the predicted phonemes. In doing so, the speech recognition engines 120A1 and/or 120A2 may optionally employ decoding maps, dictionaries, and/or other resources.
In some additional and/or alternative embodiments, the automated assistant 115 can initiate and perform an automated phone call using the automated request system 180 without detecting any user input via the user interface input engine 111. In some implementations, the query analysis engine 151 may analyze query activities stored in the query activity database 151A and may transmit a request to initiate and perform an automated telephone call in response to determining that one or more conditions are satisfied. The query activity analyzed by the query analysis engine 151 can include queries submitted to a search engine by multiple users using respective client devices (e.g., via a search interface or automated assistant interface). In some versions of those embodiments, the one or more conditions may include determining whether a threshold number of queries for a given item or service have been submitted by a plurality of users. For example, if query analysis engine 151 determines that the plurality of users have submitted 30,000 queries for "toilet paper" or variants thereof (e.g., "TP," "bathroom tissue," etc.) exceeding a threshold number of queries for a given item (e.g., toilet paper) based on analyzing the query activity used by the plurality of users, automated assistant 115 may transmit a request to request handling engine 152 to initiate and execute an automated phone call. In some versions of those embodiments, the query activity may be limited to queries submitted by users in a particular geographic area. For example, query activity may be limited to queries submitted by users in a particular zip code, county, city, town, city, state, country, and/or other geographic region.
In some further versions of those embodiments, the one or more conditions may include determining whether a threshold number of queries for a given item or service have been submitted by a plurality of users within a given time frame. Continuing with the above example, if the query analysis engine 151 determines that 30,000 queries for "toilet paper" or variants thereof were submitted within a two week period, the automated assistant may not transmit the request to the request handling engine 152. However, if the query analysis engine 151 determines that 30,000 queries for "toilet paper" were submitted within a two-day period, the automated assistant may not transmit the request to the request handling engine 152. In this manner, the query analysis engine 151 may detect whether a query for a given item increases over a particular time period. Further, in various embodiments, the query analysis engine 151 may analyze only a subset of queries submitted in the query activity database 151A, such as queries that attempt to find or retrieve items of interest rather than queries that merely mention "toilet paper" or variations thereof. In this manner, the query analysis engine 151 can identify a surge in submitted queries from a particular geographic area.
Each entity identified by the entity identification engine 153 may be stored in the entity database 153A. Further, each entity may be stored in the entity database 153A in association with their associated items, their associated services, their associated locations, their associated web pages, and/or other data associated with each entity. In some implementations, the entities database 153A can be populated with entities and associated data using a web crawler. For example, if the given entity is a hypothetical toy store, the web crawler may crawl web pages associated with the hypothetical toy store to identify each location of the hypothetical toy store, the available inventory of particular goods at the hypothetical toy store, and the hours of operation of the hypothetical toy store, and store this data in the entity database 153A in association with the hypothetical toy store. As another example, if the given entity is a hypothetical cafe, the web crawler may crawl web pages associated with the hypothetical cafe to identify each location of the hypothetical cafe, menu items available at the hypothetical cafe, and hours of operation of the hypothetical cafe and store this data in the entity database 153A in association with the hypothetical cafe. In this manner, the entity database 153A includes a mapping between each entity stored therein and the data associated therewith. In some additional and/or alternative embodiments, the entity or a user accessing the entity may provide an indication of items associated with the entity.
In embodiments where the request is based on received user input detected at client device 110 via user input engine 111, entity identification engine 153 may identify groups of entities that are each capable of satisfying the request in response to receiving the user input. The entity identification engine 153 may initially identify each of the entities stored in association with a given item or service included in the request in the entity database 153A as an initial group of entities each capable of satisfying the request. Further, entity identification engine 153 may identify the location of client device 110 based on location data generated by one or more sensors (e.g., GPS) of client device 110, and may determine which entities of the initial group are within a threshold distance of the location of client device 110. Further, entity identification engine 153 can include entities in the group of entities that are within a threshold distance of the location of client device 110 and that can satisfy the request. For example, if the user input detected at client device 110 is a verbal input to "look up paper towels," entity identification engine 153 may identify the current location of client device 110, identify the entities stored in entity database 153A in association with the paper towels, determine which of the identified entities are within a ten mile radius of the current location of client device 110, and include each entity associated with a paper towel and within a ten mile radius of the current location of client device 110 in the group of entities.
In some versions of those embodiments, the initially identified entities may be limited to entities stored in association with locations within a threshold distance of the location of the client device 110. Continuing with the example above, only entities stored in association with paper towels and within a ten mile radius of the client device 110 may be considered for inclusion in the group. In some versions of those embodiments, entity identification engine 153 may include only a threshold number of entities in a group. For example, if the number of entities in the group exceeds a threshold number of entities, only entities that meet one or more criteria may be included in the group. The one or more criteria may include, for example, location criteria, time criteria, rating criteria, user preference criteria, and/or other criteria. Continuing with the above example, if there are ten entities associated with the towel and within a ten mile radius of the current location of the client device 110, then there are only five closest entities, five highest-ranked entities, and/or five entities currently open as indicated by business hours or five entities that have been visited or are frequently visited by the user of the client device 110 in the past. In some additional and/or alternative versions of those embodiments, entity identification engine 153 may identify additional groups of entities if any of the groups of entities cannot satisfy the request. The threshold distance may be modified in response to determining that none of the entities in the group can satisfy the request. Continuing with the example above, if none of the five entities in the group have available towels, then five additional entities within a ten mile radius may be included in the additional group, or if none of the five additional entities within the ten mile radius, then the ten mile radius may be expanded to fifteen miles or greater. In this way, the entities identified in response to user input are personalized to the user providing the user input.
In embodiments where the request is based on analyzing query activity via the query analysis engine 151, the entity identification engine 153 may identify groups of entities that are each capable of satisfying the request in response to receiving the request. The entity identification engine 153 may identify each of the entities stored in association with a given item or service included in the request in the entity database 153A as a group of entities each capable of satisfying the request. For example, if query analysis engine 151 determines that submitted queries including the term "trending christmas toy in 2020 have proliferated recently, each entity stored in association with the trending christmas toy in 2020 may be included in the group of entities. In some versions of those embodiments, entity identification engine 153 may identify a particular geographic region from which to submit a query in a query campaign. Further, entity identification engine 153 can include entities in a group of entities that are within a particular geographic region and that can satisfy a request. Continuing the example above, if query analysis engine 151 determines that queries for the 2020 popular Christmas toy originated in san Francisco county, california have recently proliferated, entity identification engine 153 may limit the entities in the group to only entities stored in association with locations within san Francisco, california. In this manner, entities identified in response to recently proliferated submitted queries are personalized for the particular geographic region from which the query originated.
More specifically, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to engage in a conversation with a representative associated with the given entity using synthesized speech during the automated telephone call to perform the action included in the request. Request execution engine 154 may provide text and/or phonemes associated with the requested execution to speech synthesis engine 140A1 of client device 110 and/or speech synthesis engine 140A2 of secondary call system 180 to generate synthesized speech audio data. The synthesized speech audio data may be transmitted to additional client devices of the representative associated with the given entity for audible rendering. The speech synthesis engines 140A1 and/or 140A2 may generate synthesized speech audio data including synthesized speech corresponding to text and/or phonemes associated with the requested execution using the speech synthesis model 140A. For example, assume that the request is for a request for status update regarding "hit christmas toy in 2020". In this example, speech synthesis engines 140A1 and/or 140A2 may determine a phoneme sequence corresponding to a status update of "do you have a hot christmas toy available for sale in 2020," and may process the phoneme sequence using speech synthesis model 140A to generate synthesized speech audio data that captures a request for a status update regarding the hot christmas toy. The synthesized speech audio data may be in the form of audio waveforms, for example. In determining the sequence of phonemes corresponding to at least the phonemes associated with the execution of the request, the speech synthesis engines 140A1 and/or 140A2 may access a token-to-phoneme mapping stored locally at the client device 110 or remotely at a server via the network 190.
In various implementations, the automated assistant 115 can obtain consent from a representative associated with the given entity to participate in a conversation with the automated assistant 115 prior to performing the request during a corresponding automated call with the given entity. For example, the automated assistant 115 may obtain consent upon initiating an automated phone call by identifying itself as the automated assistant 115 and prompting a representative associated with the given entity to consent to participate in a conversation with the automated assistant. If the automated assistant 115 obtains consent from a representative associated with the given entity, the automated assistant 115 can perform the actions included in the request using the automatic request system 180. Further, once consent has been obtained, the automated assistant may not prompt the representative in any subsequent automated phone calls. However, if the automated assistant 115 does not obtain consent from the representative, the automated assistant 115 may terminate the automated telephone call.
For example, assume that the request is a request for a status update regarding the availability of latex gloves. In this example, synthesized speech audio data for "do you have any latex gloves available" may be rendered at the representative's additional client device, the representative may provide information such as "yes" or "no," and the audio data that captures the received information may be processed. Based on the processing of the received audio data, the automated assistant 115 can manipulate the dialog. For example, if the representative indicates that a latex glove is available at a given entity, the request execution engine 154 may further request an available amount of latex gloves, whether the given entity expects the latex glove to be available for the remainder of the day, and so on. However, if the representative indicates that a latex glove is available at the given entity, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to terminate the conversation. Participating in a conversation with a representative associated with a given entity is described in more detail herein (e.g., with reference to fig. 4A-4C, 5B-5D, and 6B-6C).
In embodiments where the request is a request for a corresponding status update for a given item, the update engine 155 may cause the results associated with the given entity to be updated based on information received during a corresponding automated phone call with a representative associated with the given entity. Notably, the results associated with a given entity can be updated whether the request is based on received user input detected via the user input engine 111 or based on analysis of query activity via the query analysis engine 151. The results of the update associated with the given entity may include, for example, an indication of whether the given item is available at the given entity, an indication of the available number of items at the given entity, and/or other information received during a corresponding automated phone call with a representative associated with the given entity. Notably, the results (also referred to herein as "search results") may include any results that may be rendered to the user through various interfaces. For example, the results may be presented via an information retrieval system interface, an automated assistant interface, a map or navigation application interface, a customization interface, and/or any other interface for surfacing information to a user.
For example, assume that the request is a request for a status update regarding toilet paper. In this example, the automated assistant 115 may engage in a conversation with a representative associated with the given entity to request a status update regarding toilet paper at the given entity. It is further assumed that during the conversation, the representatives associated with a given entity provide information indicating that the given entity has toilet paper available, and also provide information regarding an indication of the amount of toilet paper available (e.g., "we have enough toilet paper for the time remaining on the day," "we have 100 packs of toilet paper," "we will run out before noon," etc.). Based on this received information, the update engine may cause the results associated with the given entity to be updated to include an indication that the given entity has available toilet paper and an indication of the available quantity of toilet paper. In contrast to the above example, assume that the information received from the representative associated with a given entity indicates that the entity is not selling toilet paper. In this example, the results associated with the given entity may be updated to indicate that the given entity is not associated with toilet paper. Further, update engine 155 may transmit an indication that the given entity is no longer associated with toilet paper, and entity identification engine 153 may remove the association between toilet paper and the given entity in entity database 153A.
In some versions of those embodiments, the results of the updates associated with the given entity may also include a time indicator of when the information was received from the representative associated with the given entity. The time indicator may include, for example, a particular time at which the information was received (e.g., 9 a.m., 00 p.m., 2 p.m.:00 p.m.), a particular date at which the information was received (e.g., yesterday, today, 6/11/2020), a range of dates at which the information was received (e.g., last week, yesterday am, today pm), and/or any combination thereof. Updating results associated with multiple entities based on information received during a corresponding automatic call is described in more detail herein (e.g., with reference to fig. 4A-4D). By updating the results associated with the given entity, the plurality of users need not call the given entity to request status updates regarding the item, thereby conserving computing resources of the client devices of the plurality of users and computing resources of the client devices associated with the given entity. In other words, a single automated phone call and providing information to multiple users from the single automated phone call may prevent at least two or more of the multiple users from making calls to a given entity seeking such information. Furthermore, by updating the results associated with a given entity, multiple users do not need to go to multiple entities to search for items, thereby saving natural resources consumed by multiple users in searching for items during traffic to multiple entities.
In some versions of those embodiments, update engine 155 may also analyze results of updates associated with a given entity and results of previous updates associated with the given entity to predict a future availability of the item at the given entity or a future amount of availability of the item at the given entity for a future time. The update engine 155 can predict the future availability of the item at the given entity or the future amount of availability of the item at the given entity for a future time using, for example, a machine-learned predictive model or rules generated by a machine-learned predictive model. For example, update engine 155 may determine that the given entity has no toilets available on the last three thursdays and fridays, but that the given entity has toilet paper available on each of the last three saturdays, based on analyzing the results of the updates associated with the given entity. Based on this determination, update engine 155 may predict that a given entity will not have toilet paper available on this upcoming thursday or friday, but will have toilet paper available on the next saturday. Thus, at the beginning of a week, update engine 155 may cause the results to be updated to also include an indication that a given entity is expected to have no toilet paper available on thursday or friday, but will have toilet paper available on saturday.
In embodiments where the request is based on received user input detected at client device 110 via user input engine 111, request execution engine 154 may initiate an automated phone call with an entity of the group of entities to perform the action included in the request. Request execution engine 154 may determine a call initiation time for initiating execution of additional automated telephone calls with additional entities of the group. In addition, request execution engine 154 may determine each call origination time before or during an automated telephone call. In some versions of those embodiments, the call origination time may be a static threshold duration (e.g., 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and/or other durations). For example, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to initiate a first automated phone call with a first entity of the group, initiate a second automated phone call with a second entity of the group 30 seconds after initiating the first automated phone call with the first entity, initiate a third automated phone call with a third entity of the group 30 seconds after initiating the second automated phone call with the second entity, and so on for each of the entities of the group.
In other versions of those embodiments, request execution engine 154 may determine each call origination time based on historical call data (e.g., stored in historical call database 154A) associated with a corresponding one of the entities of the group and/or the complexity of the request. The historical call data may include, for example, an indication of a duration of time that the corresponding entity is associated with and navigates the IVR system, an indication of a duration of a previous automatic telephone call with the corresponding entity, an indication of a duration of an initial hold time during the previous automatic telephone call with the corresponding entity, and/or other call data derived from the previous automatic telephone call with each corresponding entity of the group. As one non-limiting example, if the historical call data indicates that the first entity of the group is not associated with an IVR system or any hold time, but the second entity of the group is associated with an IVR system that takes 20 seconds to navigate, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to initiate a first automated phone call with the first entity of the group, initiate a second automated phone call with the second entity of the group, simultaneously (e.g., simultaneously or within a threshold amount of time (e.g., 500 milliseconds, 1 second, and/or other amount of time). As another non-limiting example, if the historical call data indicates that the first entity of the group is associated with an IVR system that takes 10 seconds to navigate and the second entity of the group is associated with an IVR system that takes 30 seconds to navigate, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to initiate a first automated phone call with the first entity of the group and to initiate a second automated phone call with the second entity of the group after 10 seconds. As another non-limiting example, if it is predicted based on the complexity of the request that it will take 45 seconds to execute the request, and if the historical call data indicates that the first entity of the group is not associated with an IVR system (or any hold time), but the second entity of the group is associated with an IVR system that takes 20 seconds to navigate, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to initiate a second automated phone call with the second entity 25 seconds after the first automated phone call is initiated with the first entity. In this example, the automated assistant may be provided with sufficient time to perform the request with the first entity (e.g., 45 seconds) and initiate a second automated phone call with the second entity such that the delegate associated with the second entity should be active for a second call after the performance of the first automated phone call based on 20 seconds for navigating the IVR and a 25 second delay for the call initiation time equal to 45 seconds for performing the request. In addition, this also provides the automated assistant with an opportunity to terminate a second automated phone call with the second entity if the first entity indicates that it can satisfy the request. In contrast to this example, assume that the first entity is associated with an IVR system that takes 20 seconds to navigate and the second entity is not associated with an IVR system or hold time. In this example, the call initiation time for the second automated phone call with the second entity may be 65 seconds to allow the automated assistant 20 seconds to navigate the IVR system and perform an action before initiating the second automated phone call with the second entity. The call origination time may be determined in this dynamic manner for each of the entities of the group.
In various implementations, the call origination time utilized in staggering automatic calls may be determined in view of seeking to reduce latency in providing notifications (e.g., as described below with respect to notification engine 113) and/or reduce the overall duration of user interaction with the automated assistant. In many of those embodiments, the call origination time is further determined in view of seeking to mitigate unnecessary calls and/or unnecessarily extended call durations with one or more later called entities (e.g., where an earlier called entity may satisfy the action). Determining the call origination time in this manner may balance technical benefits realized by reducing latency and/or interaction duration with resources utilized in performing automated telephone calls. For example, by staggering automated telephone calls, entities may be selectively called until the request included in the user input is satisfied, and automated telephone calls with each entity of the group need not be initiated and performed. Further, the automated assistant connects with the representatives associated with each of the entities at the appropriate time such that the automated assistant does not need to wait for the first automated phone call to end to initiate the second automated phone call and remain waiting or navigating the IVR, thereby reducing the duration of interaction in performing the automated phone calls.
In embodiments in which the request is based on received user input detected at client device 110 via user input engine 111, request execution engine 154 may continue to initiate automatic telephone calls with the entities of the group in any of the manners described above until one of the entities of the group satisfies the request. In some versions of those embodiments, once the representative associated with a given entity indicates that the given entity can satisfy the request, the request execution engine 154 can cause the automated assistant 115 to actively terminate automated phone calls with other entities. For example, assume that a delegate associated with a first entity of the group provides information indicating that the first entity may satisfy the request and has initiated a second automatic call with a second entity of the group. In this example, the request execution engine 154 can cause the automated assistant to terminate the second automated call with the second entity because the first entity can satisfy the request.
In other versions of those embodiments, the request execution engine 154 may continue to execute the additional automated phone calls rather than actively terminating the additional automated phone calls, even if a representative of a given entity of the automated phone indicates that the given entity may satisfy the request. For example, if the additional automated phone call has progressed beyond a threshold stage, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to continue executing the conversation with the additional entity. For example, the request is for a status update regarding the hand sanitizer, and further assume that automated assistant 115 is engaged in a conversation with a representative associated with the first entity during the first automated phone call and has initiated a second automated phone call with a second entity of the group. In this example, if the representative associated with the first entity indicates that the first entity has hand sanitizer available and the automated assistant 115 maintains or is navigating an IVR system associated with the second entity, the automated assistant 115 may terminate the second automated telephone call. However, if the automated assistant has already engaged in a conversation with a representative associated with the second entity, the automated assistant 115 can continue to perform the second automated phone call. Further, update engine 155 may cause search results associated with the second entity to be updated based on information received from a representative associated with the second entity, as described above.
Notably, the automated phone call initiated and executed in response to receiving user input detected at the client device 110 via the user input engine 111 may be initiated and executed by an automated assistant executing locally on the client device 110 or by a cloud-based automated assistant. By interleaving the initiation and execution of automatic telephone calls in response to requesting user input, the techniques described herein may conserve computing resources of client devices associated with the entity. For example, by staggering automatic telephone calls to identify a given entity that can satisfy a request, the techniques described herein avoid calling each of the entities of a group at the same time to identify a given one of the entities that can satisfy the request. Furthermore, by continuing to perform the active automatic telephone call after another entity has indicated that it can satisfy the request, the techniques described herein avoid wasting the computational resources consumed by the active automatic telephone call as compared to simply terminating the active telephone call.
In embodiments in which the request is based on received user input detected at client device 110 via user input engine 111, and in response to determining that the representative associated with the given entity indicates that the given entity is capable of satisfying the request included in the user input, request execution engine 154 may cause a synthesized speech including user data (e.g., stored in a user data database) to be rendered at the client device of the representative associated with the given entity. The user data may include name information of the user of client device 110, address information of the user of client device 110, contact information (e.g., phone number, email address, and/or other contact information) of the user of client device 110, monetary information of the user of client device 110, and/or other information of the user of client device 110. In some versions of those embodiments, the authorization engine 156 may cause a prompt to be rendered on a display of the client device 100 (e.g., using the rendering engine 112) to authorize the automated assistant 115 to provide user information to the representative. The prompt may also include a selectable element that, when selected, allows the user of the client device 100 to join the automatic telephone call. If the user of client device 110 authorizes the provision of user data to a representative of a given entity, the automated assistant can cause synthesized speech audio data including the user data to be audibly rendered at the client device of the representative associated with the given entity. However, if the user of the client device 110 does not authorize the provision of the user data, the automated assistant 115 will refrain from causing the synthesized speech audio data including the user data to be audibly rendered at the client device of the representative associated with the given entity. In other versions of those implementations, the user of the client device 110 may have previously authorized the provision of user data, and the automated assistant 115 may cause the synthesized speech audio data including the user data to be audibly rendered at the client device of the representative associated with the given entity without prompting the user for authorization.
In some versions of those embodiments in which the request included in the user input is a request for a status update regarding an item and the delegate associated with the given entity indicates that the item is available, the automated assistant 115 can request that the item be held for the user of the client device 110 at the given entity, or submit monetary information to the delegate to obtain the item on behalf of the user of the client device. The request execution engine 154 may determine whether to hold or retrieve an item based on user input (e.g., "find and order a disinfecting wipe for me," "find and retrieve a disinfecting wipe on behalf of me," etc.), or prompt the user as to whether the user of the client device 110 wants to hold or retrieve the item (e.g., via the rendering engine 112).
For example, assume that the request is for a status update regarding a disinfecting wipe, and further assume that the representative of the given entity indicates that the disinfecting wipe is available at the given entity. Further, in response to determining that the item is available at the given entity and in response to determining that the user of the client device 110 wants to obtain the item, the automated assistant 115 can cause synthesized speech audio data to be rendered at the client device of the representative associated with the given entity, the synthesized speech audio data including the user's name, contact information, and monetary information (if authorized). As another example, assume that the request is a request for availability of a pipe service for a given time and date, and further assume that a representative of a given entity indicates that the pipe service is available for the given time and date. Further, in response to determining that the conduit service is available at a given time and date and in response to determining that the user of the client device 110 wants to subscribe to the given time and date, the automated assistant 115 can cause synthesized speech audio data to be rendered at the client device of the representative associated with the given entity, the synthesized speech audio data including the user's name, address, and contact information (if authorized).
In embodiments where the request is based on received user input detected at the client device 110 via the user input engine 111, the automated assistant 115 can cause the notification engine 113 to generate a notification that includes the results of one or more of the automated phone calls. The notifications generated by notification engine 113 may be rendered visually via a display of client device 110 and/or audibly via speakers of client device 110 (e.g., using rendering engine 112). The results of the conversation may include, for example, an indication of whether the given entity is able to satisfy the request, an indication of whether an item or service has been held or subscribed to for the user of client device 110, an indication of whether an item has been obtained for the user of client device 100, an indication that authorization is required to submit user data for the user of client device 110 to obtain the item, an indication of a request that the user of client device 110 join an automated telephone call with the given entity, and/or other results of the conversation. The notifications generated by notification engine 113 can be banner notifications, pop-up notifications, email notifications, text message notifications, voice message notifications, and/or other types of notifications. Generating notifications based on the results of the dialog is described in more detail herein (e.g., with reference to fig. 5B-5D, 6B, and 6C).
In various implementations, the rendering engine 112 may cause a text record of a conversation between the automated assistant 115 and a representative of a given entity to be rendered at a display of the client device 110. Additionally, the display may also include one or more selectable elements that, when selected, allow a user of client device 110 to join a conversation, end an automated phone call with a given entity, and/or perform other actions. In embodiments where the automated assistant 115 participates in multiple conversations with multiple entities, a corresponding text record for each of the conversations may be rendered on a display of the client device 110. In some versions of those embodiments, each word record may be associated with a tab in the automated assistant interface that enables a user of the client device 110 to switch between word records of multiple conversations because the client device 110 may have limited screen space. In other implementations, the text record may not be displayed and the user of client device 110 may simply receive the notification.
In embodiments in which the request is based on analyzing query activity via the query analysis engine 151, the request execution engine 154 may cause the automated assistant 115 to initiate a corresponding automated phone call with a given entity of the group of entities to perform the action included in the request. In some implementations, the request execution engine 154 can cause multiple instances of the automated assistant 115 described herein to simultaneously initiate and execute multiple corresponding automated phone calls with corresponding ones of the entities of the group. For example, a first instance of the automated assistant 115 may initiate and execute a first automated phone call with a first entity of the group, a second instance of the automated assistant 115 may simultaneously initiate and execute a second automated phone call with a second entity of the group, and so on for each entity in the group. In other words, an instance of the automated assistant 115 can initiate and execute each automated phone call in parallel. In other embodiments, the corresponding automated phone calls may be initiated and executed in batches (e.g., with a subset of the group of entities) or sequentially. Notably, each instance of the automated assistant 115 can execute remotely at a server (e.g., a cloud-based automated assistant) with the automatic request system 180, and the client device 110 can be omitted.
Each of the instances of the automated assistant can engage in a corresponding conversation with a corresponding one of the entities to perform the action included in the request. The time delay engine 157 can determine a time delay before initiating performance of a subsequent corresponding automated phone call with a corresponding entity based on information received during each corresponding conversation. Further, the time delay engine 157 can assign various time periods as time delays based on information received during a corresponding automated phone call, hours of operation associated with a corresponding entity, laws restricting whether and/or when an automated phone can be executed, calculations, and/or network bandwidth considerations (e.g., a "slow" time period for a phone call, such as early morning). Further, time delay engine 157 may store the time periods assigned as time delays in time delay database 157A in association with corresponding entities. In embodiments where the request is for a status update regarding the item, the time period assigned to the time delay may be an indication based on the available number of items. For example, a first time period may be designated as a time delay if the available number of items falls within a first range of numbers, a second time period may be designated as a time delay if the available number of items falls within a second range of numbers, and so on for various ranges of numbers of items. As another example, a first time period may be assigned as a time delay if the available number of items meets a threshold number, and a second time period may be assigned as a time delay if the available number of items fails to meet the threshold number.
For example, assume that the request is a request for a status update regarding toilet paper, and further assume that the representative associated with the given entity indicates that toilet paper is available at the given entity. Further, assume that the representative associated with a given entity indicates that there is a sufficient number of toilet paper to last for the remainder of the day. In this example, the time delay engine 157 may assign a first time period to the time delay associated with the given entity such that the automated assistant 115 will not initiate a subsequent corresponding automated phone call with the given entity at least until the next day. Conversely, assume that the representatives associated with a given entity indicate that the amount of toilet paper will not last until the end of the day. In this example, the time delay engine 157 can assign the second time period to the time delay associated with the given entity such that the automated assistant 115 will initiate a subsequent corresponding automated phone call with the given entity later on the same day. Notably, these time delays will elapse at different times based on information received during the automatic telephone call. Further, the search results associated with a given entity may be updated based on information received during an automated telephone call, as described above with respect to update engine 155. In these and other ways, the corresponding time delay may be dynamically determined for each entity based on information received during an automated telephone call with the entity. Dynamically determining the time delay in this manner may balance the technical benefits realized by maintaining up-to-date information from the entity with the resources utilized in performing the automated telephone call. In other words, dynamically determining the time delay may prevent another automated telephone call to the entity from being performed too quickly, which may result in unnecessary utilization of computing and/or network resources — while ensuring that information from the entity is up-to-date.
By using the techniques described herein, various technical advantages may be realized. As one non-limiting example, the automated assistant 115 may successfully perform automated phone calls to satisfy requests in a faster and more efficient manner because the automated phone calls may be intelligently initiated using the automated request system 180. By intelligently initiating an automated telephone call, both network and computing resources may be saved, as the length of the conversation and the number of conversations may be reduced by using the techniques disclosed herein. As another non-limiting example, search results associated with an entity may be updated based on information received during a conversation. By updating the search results associated with the entity, the entity receives fewer phone calls from multiple other users, as each other user need not separately initiate phone calls with each entity to request status updates regarding various items and/or to query the availability of various services. Further, while FIG. 1 is described herein with respect to requesting status updates with respect to a single item or service, it should be understood that this is for purposes of example and is not meant to be limiting. For example, the automated assistant 115 can request status updates for a plurality of items during a corresponding automated phone call with a given entity of the group of entities.
Fig. 2 depicts a flow diagram illustrating an example method 200 of determining a time delay for a subsequent automated phone call with a given entity based on a status update regarding an item of interest received during the automated phone call with the given entity. For convenience, the operations of method 300 are described with reference to a system performing the operations. The system of method 300 includes one or more processors and/or other components of a computing device, such as client device 110 of fig. 1, computing devices 410A, 410B of fig. 4A-4D, computing device 510 of fig. 5A-5D, computing device 610 of fig. 6A-6C, computing device 710 of fig. 7, one or more remote servers, and/or other computing devices. Further, while the operations of method 300 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At block 252, the system identifies an item of interest. In some implementations, items of interest can be identified based on analyzing query activity of multiple users to identify a proliferation of submitted queries, as described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to query analysis engine 151 of fig. 1). In some versions of those embodiments, the explosion of submitted queries may originate from a particular geographic area. In other implementations, the items of interest may be identified based on user input from the user that causes the system to perform the method 200. At block 254, the system identifies a group of entities associated with the item of interest. The entities of the group may be stored in association with the item of interest in one or more databases (e.g., entity identification engine 153 and entity database 153A of FIG. 1). The system may retrieve entities from one or more databases. In embodiments where the surge in submitted queries may be from a particular geographic area, the entities in the group may be limited to entities located in the particular geographic area.
At block 256, the system initiates performance of a corresponding automatic phone call with each of the entities of the group to request a corresponding status update regarding the item of interest. The system may initiate an automated phone call by placing the automated phone call and rendering one or more corresponding instances of synthesized speech that request corresponding status updates for the item of interest. In some implementations, the system can initiate execution of multiple corresponding automated phone calls with each of the entities of the group simultaneously using a corresponding instance of an automated assistant (e.g., automated assistant 115). In other embodiments, the system may initiate execution with only a subset of the entities, such that automated phone calls with each entity are initiated in batches until automated phone calls with each entity of the group have been executed. In various implementations, an instance of an automated assistant can be an instance of a cloud-based assistant.
At block 258, during execution of the corresponding automatic phone call with the given entity of the group's entities, the system: a) Requesting a corresponding status update regarding the item of interest from a representative associated with the given entity, and B) receiving information regarding the item of interest from the representative. The system may perform a corresponding automated telephone call by participating in a conversation with a representative associated with a given entity. Further, the system may request a corresponding status update by rendering one or more corresponding instances of the synthesized speech during each automated phone call. For example, the system may cause a synthesized voice (e.g., "do you sell toilet paper. Further, the system may process audio data corresponding to information received during a corresponding automated telephone call using a speech recognition model (e.g., as described in more detail with respect to the speech recognition model of fig. 1). The information received from the delegate may be in response to rendering of synthesized speech. As described in more detail above with respect to fig. 1, the system may intelligently respond to the delegate during the conversation.
At block 260, the system updates the search results associated with the given entity to include information about the item of interest. The search results may be updated for each of the entities in the group in response to receiving the corresponding information from each of the entities. In some implementations, the updated search results can also include a time indicator of when the corresponding automated telephone call was performed and the information received. For example, assume that the received information indicates that the example store 1 has toilet paper available. The search results associated with the example store 1 may be updated to indicate the time and date that toilet paper is available and information was received at the example store 1.
At block 262, the system determines whether the given entity is still associated with the item of interest. The system may determine whether the given entity is still associated with the item of interest based on processing the information received from block 258 regarding the item of interest. If, in an iteration of block 262, the system determines that the given entity is still associated with the item of interest, the system proceeds to block 264. For example, suppose the system makes "do you sell toilet paper? "is rendered at a computing device associated with the representative to verify that the given entity is still associated with the item of interest. Assume further that the received information indicates that the example store 1 sells toilet paper. In this example, the system has verified that the given entity is still associated with the item of interest.
At block 264, the system determines a time delay before initiating execution of a corresponding subsequent automatic phone call with the given entity based on the received information about the item. Further, the system may assign the determined time delay to a given entity in one or more databases. The determined time delay may be a time period assigned to the given entity based on an available number of items of interest. For example, assume that the representative associated with the example store 1 indicates that there is a sufficient number of toilet paper for three days. In this example, the system may assign a three day period as the time delay based on the received information indicating that there is a sufficient number of toilet paper available for three days at the example store 1. In contrast, assume that the representative associated with the example store 1 expects only a sufficient amount of toilet paper for use in the morning. In this example, the system may assign a five hour period as the time delay based on the received information indicating that there is a sufficient number of toilet paper available for three days at the example store 1.
At block 266, the system determines whether the time delay assigned to the given entity determined at block 264 has elapsed. If, in the iteration of block 266, the system determines that the time delay has not elapsed, the system continues to monitor for the elapse of the time delay assigned to the given entity at block 266. It is noted that although the corresponding automatic telephone call may be performed initially in parallel, the corresponding subsequent automatic telephone call is initiated based on the passage of the determined time delay. However, if in the iteration of block 266, the system determines that the time delay determined at block 264 has elapsed, then the system proceeds to block 268.
At block 268, the system initiates performance of a corresponding subsequent automated phone call with the given entity to request further status updates regarding the item of interest. The system may request further status updates regarding the item of interest in a similar manner as described above with respect to block 258. Further, the system may return to block 264 to determine a further time delay based on information received during the corresponding subsequent automatic telephone call. The system may continue to determine a time delay corresponding to a further automated telephone call until one or more conditions are met. The one or more conditions may include, for example, a decline in a surge in submitted queries for the item of interest, a threshold duration (e.g., one week, two weeks, one month, etc.), and/or other conditions being met.
However, if in an iteration of block 262, the system determines that the entity is no longer associated with the item of interest, the system may refrain from determining the time delay and proceed to block 270 to remove the given entity from the set of entities associated with the item of interest. Thus, the system will not initiate subsequent automatic telephone calls with a given entity to request any further status updates regarding the item of interest. However, the system may still call the given entity later to request status updates regarding other items of interest.
Although the time delay depicted in fig. 2 is described with respect to a single entity, it should be understood that this is for illustration and is not meant to be limiting. As described above, the automated assistant can initiate the performance of multiple automated phone calls with the entities of the group simultaneously. During each of the automated telephone calls, a time delay may be assigned to a corresponding one of the entities, and the time delay for each of the entities may be different based on information received about the item of interest from a representative associated with the corresponding one of the entities.
Fig. 3 depicts a flow diagram illustrating an example method 300 of determining whether to initiate an additional automated phone call with an additional entity based on information received during the automated phone call with the given entity. For convenience, the operations of method 300 are described with reference to a system performing the operations. The system of method 300 includes one or more processors and/or other components of a computing device, such as client device 110 of fig. 1, computing devices 410A, 410B of fig. 4A-4D, computing device 510 of fig. 5A-5D, computing device 610 of fig. 6A-6C, computing device 710 of fig. 7, one or more remote servers, and/or other computing devices. Further, while the operations of method 300 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At block 352, the system receives a request from a computing device of a user to initiate performance of an automated telephone call on behalf of the user. The request may be based on user input received at the user's computing device. In some implementations, the user input can be a touch or typing input from a search interface or an automated assistant interface displayed on the user's computing device. For example, the user input may touch an input directed to a selectable element of the search interface that, when selected, causes the system to initiate an automated phone call to execute the request. In other implementations, the user input may be a verbal input detected via a microphone of the user computing device. The spoken input may be processed using a speech recognition model and/or NLU model to determine that the user input includes a request (e.g., as described above with respect to fig. 1).
At block 354, the system identifies an action to be performed during the automatic phone call based on the request. The action may be identified based on one or more terms included in the user input. The actions may include, for example, requesting a status update regarding the item of interest from the given entity or entities, subscribing to the item of interest at a location associated with the given entity, retrieving the item of interest at a location with the given entity, requesting availability of services from the given entity or entities, and/or other actions that may be performed using the automated phone calls described herein. For example, the action may include an action to obtain toilet paper at a particular entity, or an action to generally obtain toilet paper without specifying any particular entity. As another example, the action may include an action to find the cheapest electrician available during a given time period. Identifying actions to perform is described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to request handling engine 152 of FIG. 1).
At block 356, the system identifies groups of entities that are each capable of satisfying the request based on the actions to be performed during the automatic call. The entities of the group may be stored in one or more databases (e.g., entity identification engine 153 and entity database 153A of fig. 1) in association with the items or services included in the request. The system may retrieve entities from one or more databases. Further, the entities in the group may be limited to entities located within a threshold distance of the current location of the user's computing device. For example, assuming that the action included in the request is a request for a status update regarding the item, the system may include only entities associated with the item within a five mile radius of the group of entities.
At block 358, the system initiates performance of an automated phone call with a given entity of the group of entities. The system may initiate an automated phone call by placing the automated phone call and rendering one or more corresponding instances of synthesized speech that request corresponding status updates regarding the item of interest. In some implementations, the system can initiate execution of the automated phone call using an automated assistant operating locally on the computing device of the user providing the request. In other implementations, the system may initiate execution of the automated phone call using an automated assistant (e.g., a cloud-based automated assistant) operating remotely at the server. In still other implementations, the system may initiate execution of an automated phone call using an automated assistant operating in part on the user's computing device and in part on a server (e.g., automated assistant 115 as depicted in fig. 1).
At block 360, during execution of an automated telephone call with a given entity, the system engages in a conversation with a representative of the given entity to perform an action. During a conversation, the system may perform an action and receive information about the action (e.g., information about the availability of an item or service and/or other information described herein) from the representative. The system may perform this action by rendering one or more corresponding instances of synthesized speech during each automated telephone call. For example, the system may cause a synthesized voice (e.g., "do you sell toilet paper. Further, the system may process audio data corresponding to information received during a corresponding automated telephone call using a speech recognition model (e.g., as described in more detail with respect to the speech recognition model of fig. 1). The information received from the delegate may be in response to rendering of synthesized speech. As described in more detail above with respect to fig. 1, the system may intelligently respond to the delegate during the conversation.
At block 362, the system determines whether to initiate performance of additional automatic calls with additional entities in the entities of the group. The system may determine to initiate performance of an additional automatic call with the additional entity based on a call initiation time associated with the additional entity. The call origination time may be specific to the additional entity. In some implementations, the call origination time can be determined based on historical call data (e.g., historical call data database 154A of fig. 1) stored in association with the entity and/or additional entities. For example, the call initiation time of the additional entity may be determined based on whether the entity and/or the additional entity is associated with the IVR system, an average duration of previous automated telephone calls with the entity and/or the additional entity, an average hold time associated with the entity and/or the additional entity, and/or any other call data that may be collected from previous automated telephone calls with the entity and/or the additional entity. For example, if the determined call origination time is 30 seconds after the origination of the automated telephone call with the given entity, it may be based on determining that both the given entity and the additional entity are associated with a 30 second hold time. In these examples, the automated phone calls are staggered such that the automated assistant may engage with a representative associated with each of the entities 30 seconds apart, rather than both representatives at the same time. In some additional and/or alternative implementations, the call origination time may be determined based on results of an automated telephone call with the entity. Continuing with the example above, if the system only holds for 20 seconds, instead of the desired 30 seconds, the call origination time may be changed from 30 seconds to 20 seconds, so that a similar staggering of automatic telephone calls is achieved. If, in an iteration of block 362, the system determines that execution of an additional automatic call is not to be initiated, the system proceeds to block 366. Notably, this indicates that the request may be handled by the given entity, and the given entity indicates that it may handle the request prior to the call origination time. For example, this indicates that a given entity quickly indicates that it can satisfy the request. However, if in an iteration of block 362, the system determines to initiate performance of additional automatic calls with additional entities, the system may proceed to block 364. As described above with respect to block 358, the system can initiate additional automated phone calls using an automated assistant that is local to the user's computing device, remote at the server, and/or a combination thereof.
At block 364, the system determines whether to actively terminate automated phone calls to the given entity and/or additional automated phone calls to additional entities. The system may determine whether to actively terminate the automated phone call and/or attach the automated phone call based on information received during each automated phone call. For example, if an entity or additional entity indicates that an item or service is not available, the corresponding automated phone call may be terminated proactively. In embodiments where a given entity indicates that it can satisfy the request and additional representatives associated with additional entities have already engaged in a conversation with the automated assistant, the system may not actively terminate additional automated phone calls. In some versions of those embodiments, the system may still perform the action, and search results associated with the additional entity may be updated based on the performance of the action. In this manner, the computing resources of the representative additional computing device associated with the additional entity are not wasted by terminating the additional automated phone call without knowledge of any information related to the original request. If, in an iteration of block 364, the system does not determine to actively terminate automatic calls with the given entity and/or additional automatic calls with additional entities, the system may monitor one or more signals to actively terminate automatic calls with the given entity and/or additional automatic calls with additional entities at block 364. However, if in an iteration of block 364, the system determines to actively terminate automatic calls with the given entity and/or additional automatic calls with additional entities, the system proceeds to block 366.
At block 366, the system generates a notification based on the results of the dialog during the automatic call with the given entity and/or the additional automatic call with the additional entity. A notification may be generated for each automated telephone call initiated by the system. Further, the notification may include, for example, an indication of the availability of the item or service, whether the system subscribed to the item or service on behalf of the user, whether the system obtained other results of the item and/or the conversation on behalf of the user. In some implementations, the notification can include a prompt for the user. The prompt may include, for example, a prompt for the user to join an automated telephone call, a prompt for the user authorization system to provide name information, address information, contact information, monetary information, and/or other user data for the user of the computing device. At block 368, the system causes the notification to be rendered visually and/or audibly via the user's computing device. The notification may be visually rendered via a display of the computing device or another computing device associated with the user and/or audibly rendered via a speaker of the computing device or another computing device associated with the user. Generating and rendering notifications is described in more detail herein (e.g., with respect to fig. 1, 5B-5D, 6B, and 6C).
Although the method 300 is described herein with respect to a given entity and additional entities, it should be understood that this is by way of example only and is not meant as a limitation. It should be appreciated that the call origination time for each other entity of the group may be determined and each other entity of the group may be called until the request is satisfied. If no entity of the group can satisfy the request, additional groups of entities may be identified as described above (e.g., with respect to entity identification engine 153 of FIG. 1).
Referring now to fig. 4A through 4C, non-limiting examples of determining time delays for subsequent automated telephone calls with various entities are depicted. Notably, the textual record of the automated telephone call of fig. 4A-4C is depicted on the graphical user interface 480A of the computing device 410A. It should be understood that this is for the purpose of illustrating the techniques described herein and is not meant to be limiting. For example, for the sake of brevity, the automated phone calls described herein may be initiated and executed by an automated assistant (e.g., using the automatic request system 180 of fig. 1). The automated assistant can be a cloud-based automated assistant executing remotely at a server and/or other computing device.
In some implementations, and as described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to query analysis engine 151 and request handling engine 152 of fig. 1), the automated assistant can identify a request for a status update with respect to an item or service of interest based on analyzing query activities (e.g., stored in query activity database 151A of fig. 1) of a plurality of users. An automated phone call may be initiated and executed by the automated assistant in response to identifying a request for a status update regarding an item or service of interest. The automated assistant can identify the request based on, for example, determining whether a threshold number of queries have been submitted by a plurality of users for a given item or service. In some versions of those embodiments, the one or more conditions may include determining whether a threshold number of queries for a given item or service have been submitted by multiple users within a given time frame, as described above with respect to fig. 1. In some versions of those embodiments, query activity may be limited to only queries submitted by users in a particular geographic area.
In some implementations, the automated assistant can further identify a group of entities associated with the identified request, as described in more detail herein (e.g., with respect to entity identification engine 153 of fig. 1). The group of entities may be stored (e.g., in entity database 153A) in association with items or services included in the request along with other data (e.g., physical location, web page, and/or other data) related to each entity. A corresponding one of the automated phone calls may be initiated and executed by the automated assistant with a given entity in the group such that the automated assistant may initiate and execute a corresponding automated phone call with each individual entity in the entities of the group. In embodiments where the submitted query originates from a particular geographic region, the entities included in the group may also be limited to entities located within the particular geographic region. In response to identifying the item or service based on analyzing the query activity and in response to identifying the group of entities associated with the item or service included in the request, the automated assistant can begin initiating and executing an automated phone call. Further, the automated assistant can perform a corresponding one of the automated phone calls by rendering an instance of the synthesized speech at a computing device of a corresponding representation associated with a corresponding one of the entities. Further, the automated assistant can process audio data corresponding to information received from the corresponding representative during the corresponding automated phone call. In this manner, the automated assistant may engage in a conversation with a representative, and the subsequent synthesized speech may be based on information received from the corresponding representative.
For example, with respect to fig. 4A-4C, assume that the automated assistant identified 15,000 submitted queries across a six hour time period, which includes the term "toilet paper," and which originated from a geographic region in jackfison county, kentucky. In this example, the automated assistant may determine that 15,000 submitted queries spanning a six hour period satisfy one or more conditions to initiate a plurality of corresponding automatic telephone calls with a group of entities located in jackfizon county, kentucky to request corresponding status updates regarding availability of toilet paper. Thus, the automated assistant may access one or more databases (e.g., entity database 153A of fig. 1) to identify a plurality of entities located in jackfison county, kentucky that are stored in association with a toilet paper item, and may include the identified entities in a group of entities. As shown in fig. 4A to 4C, the group of entities includes at least an example store 1, an example store 2, and an example store 3.
More specifically, the automated assistant may initiate a first automated phone call with the example store 1 to request a status update regarding toilet paper at the example store 1, as shown in FIG. 4A, may initiate a first automated phone call with the example store 2 to request a status update regarding toilet paper at the example store 2, as shown in FIG. 4B, and may initiate a first automated phone call with the example store 3 to request a status update regarding toilet paper at the example store 3, as shown in FIG. 4C. Notably, each first automated phone call with each entity in fig. 4A-4C may be initiated and executed in parallel (e.g., as indicated by initiation at 6/11/2020 9. Further, each of the first automated phone calls can be initiated and executed using a corresponding instance of the automated assistant.
As described above, the automated assistant can execute each of the corresponding automated phone calls by causing an instance of the synthesized speech to be rendered at a computing device of a representative associated with a given one of the entities. In particular, the synthesized speech may include a request for a status update regarding toilet paper, and optionally other information. For example, as shown in fig. 4A, the automated assistant may cause rendering of synthesized speech 452A1 at the computing device represented by example store 1 that includes a request for a status update regarding toilet paper at example store 1 (e.g., "I'm telling to be there are any toilet papers available)" and also includes a request for an available quantity of toilet paper at example store 1 (e.g., "if you expect to run out today"). Further, the automated assistant may process audio data corresponding to the information 454A1 received in response to the synthesized speech (e.g., "We have had a sound available, but We will likely run out of this afternoon)") to determine whether toilet paper is available at the example store 1 and an indication of the amount of available. As another example, as shown in fig. 4B, the automated assistant may cause rendering of a synthesized speech 452B1 at the computing device represented by the example store 2 that includes a request for a status update regarding toilet paper at the example store 2 (e.g., "I'm telling to be located nearby healthy and paper available"), but the automated assistant may suppress the request for an available quantity of toilet paper at the example store 2 until the example store 2 represented confirms that the example store 2 has available toilet paper based on processing audio data (e.g., "yes") corresponding to the received information 454B1 from the example store 2 represented. In response to verifying that the example store 2 has available toilet paper, the automated assistant may then request a status update in the further synthesized speech 452B2 for the available quantity of toilet paper at the example store 2 (e.g., "Will you run out of today)") and may determine an indication of the available quantity of toilet paper at the example store 2 based on processing the further received information 454B2 (e.g., "no" indicating that the example store 2 Will not run out of toilet paper today). Further, the automated assistant can process audio data corresponding to the information 454A1 received in response to the synthesized speech (e.g., "We have been sound available, but will have been run out of this is after). As yet another example, as shown in fig. 4C, the automated assistant may cause rendering of synthesized speech 452C1 at the computing device represented by the example store 3 that includes a request for a status update regarding toilet paper at the example store 3 (e.g., "I'm telling to be located nearby healthy and toilet paper available") and further includes a request for an available quantity of toilet paper at the example store 3 (e.g., "the present near available running out today"). Further, the automated assistant may process audio data (e.g., "We do not sell tool paper") corresponding to the information 454C1 received in response to the synthesized speech to determine that the example store 3 should not be stored in association with toilet paper. In this example, the example store 3 may be removed from the group of entities based on the received information 454C 1.
For each of the corresponding automated phone calls in fig. 4A-4C, the automated assistant may assign a time period to each entity in the group as a time delay. When the time delay elapses, the automated assistant may initiate and execute, for a corresponding entity of the entities of the group, a subsequent corresponding automated phone call with the corresponding entity to request a corresponding further status update regarding the item. The time period assigned as the time delay may be determined based on information received from a representative associated with the given entity (e.g., as described in more detail above with respect to time delay engine 157). In some implementations, the automated assistant can provide an indication of a time period of a time delay assigned to the corresponding entity during each first automated telephone call.
For example, as shown in fig. 4A, the automated assistant may cause a further synthesized speech 452A2 (e.g., "I'll call back that is an afteron for an other update" that I will call back in the afternoon today) to be rendered at the computing device represented by the example store 1 that indicates a time period assigned as a time delay for the example store 1. In this example, the time period may be only a few hours (e.g., five hours as shown in fig. 4A), because the information 454A1 indicates that the example store 1 will "like run out of toilet paper is not (perhaps running out of toilet paper in the afternoon today)". Thus, when a time delay elapses (e.g., five hours after the first automated phone call with the example store 1 (e.g., 2 pm on the same day), the automated assistant may initiate and execute a second automated phone call to request a corresponding further status update regarding toilet paper by: causing rendering of yet further synthesized speech 452A3 at the computing device represented by the example store 1, processing audio data corresponding to the further information 454A2 received from the example store 1 representation in response to the yet further synthesized speech 452A3, and causing rendering of yet further synthesized speech 452A4 at the computing device represented by the example store 1, including an indication of a further time delay determined based on the further information 452A2 received during the second automated phone call with the example store 1 representation. For example, if the example store 1 representative indicated in the further information 452A2 that the example store 1 would not have toilet paper until the arrival of the good within three days, the time period assigned as the further time delay may be 72 hours to avoid calling the example store 1 within the next three days, as they have indicated that they would not have toilet paper until the arrival of the next good.
As another example, as shown in fig. 4B, the automated assistant may cause rendering of yet further synthesized speech 452B3 (e.g., "I'll call back tomorrow") at the computing device represented by the example store 2 that indicates a time period assigned as a time delay for the example store 2. In this example, the time period may be a 24 hour period since the information 454B2 indicated that the example store 2 would not run out of toilet paper that day. Thus, when a time delay elapses (e.g., 24 hours after the first automated phone call with the example store 2 (e.g., at 9 pm on the second day)), the automated assistant may initiate and execute a second automated phone call to request a corresponding further status update for toilet paper by: causing rendering of the further synthesized speech 452B4 at the computing device represented by the example store 2, processing audio data corresponding to the further information 454B3 received from the example store 2 representation in response to the further audio data 452B4, and causing rendering of the further synthesized speech 452A5 at the computing device represented by the example store 2, including an indication of a further time delay determined based on the further information 452B3 received during the second automated phone call with the example store 2 representation. Thus, as indicated by the time delays in fig. 4A and 4B, the automated assistant can determine the dynamic time period to assign to the time delay based on information received during the automated telephone call.
Notably, as shown in fig. 4C, the automated assistant can cause a further synthesized speech 452C2 to be rendered on the computing device represented by the example store 3, indicating that the automated assistant will avoid querying toilet paper from the example store 3 in the future. In this example, the automated assistant may also avoid determining the time period assigned to the example store 3 as a time delay because it has been removed from the group of entities associated with the item based on the received information 454C1, as described above. Thus, a second automated phone call with the example store 3 is not initiated or performed.
In various implementations, search results associated with entities of a group may be updated to include information received during a corresponding automated telephone call. In some versions of these embodiments, the search results may also be updated to include a time indicator of when the status update was requested. For example, fig. 4D illustrates, on the graphical user interface 480B of the user's computing device 410B, updated search results associated with each of the various entities based on the results of the automatic telephone calls from fig. 4A-4C. The graphical user interface 480B of fig. 4D further comprises: text reply interface element 484, which the user may select to generate user input via a virtual keyboard or other touch and/or typing input; and voice reply interface element 485 that the user may select to generate a user input via the microphone of client device 410. In some implementations, the user may generate the user input via a microphone without selecting voice reply interface element 485. For example, actively monitoring audible user input via a microphone may occur to avoid the need for the user to select voice reply interface element 485. In some of those embodiments and/or in other embodiments, voice reply interface element 485 may be omitted. Moreover, in some implementations, text reply interface element 484 may additionally and/or alternatively be omitted (e.g., the user may only provide audible user input). The graphical user interface 480 of fig. 4A-4D further includes system interface elements 481, 482, 483 with which a user can interact to cause the computing device 410 to perform one or more actions.
Referring to fig. 4D, assume that the user of computing device 410B is also located in jackson county, kentucky, and further assume that the user of computing device 410 has submitted a search query (e.g., spoken or typed via an automated assistant interface or search interface) that includes the term "toilet paper" (e.g., as indicated by URL 411) after the first automated phone call in 4A-4C but before the second automated phone call. Assume further that first search result 420 associated with example store 1, second search result 430 associated with example store 2, and third search result 440 associated with example store 3 are all responsive to a search query. In this example, the first search result 420 may be updated to include information 421 from the first automatic phone call with the example store 1 indicating that toilet paper is "available" at the example store 1 at "today 9 00", but the example store 1 may run out of toilet paper at "afternoon today". Further, the second search results 430 may be updated to include information 431 from the first automated phone call with the example store 2 indicating that "toilet paper" is available "at the example store 1" in the morning of this day "and that the example store 2 should" not run out of this day ". Further, the third search result 440 may be updated to include information 441 from the first automated phone call with the example store 3 indicating that the example store 3 "does not sell toilet paper". The information 421, 431 of the search results 420, 430 may be updated in a similar manner after the second automated phone call and any other subsequent automated phone calls thereafter. In this manner, when the automated assistant performs an automated telephone call, the search results associated with each entity of the group may be updated to reflect the availability of various items associated with each corresponding entity.
While fig. 4A through 4D are described herein with requests for status updates with respect to a single item of interest, it should be understood that this is by way of example and not meant as a limitation. For example, if the automated assistant identifies multiple items of interest for which status updates are to be requested, and a given entity of the entities in the group is associated with multiple items, the automated assistant can request status updates for each of the multiple items in a first automated phone call to avoid having to initiate and perform multiple automated phone calls with the given entity to request status updates for each of the multiple items. Further, it should be noted that when the automated assistant requests status updates with respect to multiple items, then different time periods may be assigned to the time delays of each of the multiple items. For example, if the automated assistant initially requests status updates regarding both toilet paper and hand sanitizer, and a representative associated with a given entity provides information indicating that there is sufficient toilet paper for the time remaining for the day but no hand sanitizer for the next four days, the automated assistant may assign a 24 hour time period to initiate and execute subsequent automated phone calls to request further status updates regarding toilet paper, and a 96 hour time period to initiate and execute subsequent automated phone calls to request further status updates regarding hand sanitizer.
Furthermore, although FIGS. 4A through 4D are described herein with respect to requesting status updates with respect to an item of interest, it should be understood that this is by way of example and not meant as a limitation. As one non-limiting example, the automated assistant may also request status updates regarding the availability of the service. For example, if the automated assistant determines that submitted queries for body repairs and/or roof repairs proliferate (e.g., after a hail storm), automated phone calls may be initiated and executed in a similar manner, and search results associated with entities providing these services may be updated in a similar manner.
Referring now to fig. 5A-5D, various non-limiting examples are depicted of initiating automated phone calls with various entities on behalf of a user and causing rendering of notifications associated with each of the various entities based on the results of the automated phone calls. Fig. 5A-5D each depict computing device 510 having a graphical user interface 580 associated with a user request to initiate and/or perform an automated telephone call on behalf of a user of computing device 510. One or more aspects of an automated assistant associated with a user of computing device 510 (e.g., automated assistant 115 of fig. 1) can be implemented locally on computing device 510 and/or in a distributed manner (e.g., via network 190 of fig. 1) on other computing devices in network communication with computing device 510. For simplicity, the operations of fig. 5A-5D are described herein as being performed by an automated assistant (e.g., using the automatic request system 180 of fig. 1). While the computing device 510 of fig. 5A-5D is depicted as a mobile phone, it should be understood that this is not meant to be limiting. Computing device 510 may be, for example, a server, a stand-alone speaker, a speaker connected to a graphical user interface, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and/or any other client device capable of making phone calls and operating instances of automated assistants.
The graphical user interface 580 of fig. 5A-5D further includes: a text reply interface element 584 that the user may select to generate user input via a virtual keyboard or other touch and/or typing input; and a voice reply interface element 585 that the user may select to generate a user input via a microphone of computing device 510. In some implementations, the user can generate the user input via the microphone without selecting voice reply interface element 585. For example, actively monitoring audible user input via a microphone may occur to avoid the need for the user to select voice reply interface element 585. In some of those implementations and/or in other implementations, the voice reply interface element 585 may be omitted. Moreover, in some implementations, the text reply interface element 584 may additionally and/or alternatively be omitted (e.g., the user may only provide audible user input). Graphical user interface 580 of fig. 5A-5D further includes system interface elements 581, 582, 583 with which a user may interact to cause computing device 510 to perform one or more actions.
In various implementations, an automated phone call may be initiated and executed in response to receiving user input requesting the automated assistant to initiate and execute the automated phone call. The user input may be verbal, touch, and/or key input including instructions to initiate and perform an automated telephone call. Further, the automated assistant may perform the actions included in the request on behalf of a given user of the computing device 510 during the automated phone call. As shown in fig. 5A, the graphical user interface 580 includes a first search result 520 associated with the hypothetical toy store 1 entity and a second search result 530 associated with the hypothetical toy store 2 entity displayed in response to the query of "hot christmas toy in 2020" (e.g., as indicated in text reply interface element 584). Further, the search results 520, 530 are displayed in a browser application accessible at the computing device (e.g., as indicated by the URL 511 of "www.exampleurl0.com/"). In addition, the search results 520, 530 may also include corresponding information 521, 531 relating to one or more items of interest (e.g., hit Christmas toys), for example. For example, the first information 521 associated with the first search result 520 indicates that the popular Christmas toy of the hypothetical toy shop 1 was out of stock six days ago, while the second information 531 associated with the second search result 530 indicates that the status of the popular Christmas toy of the hypothetical toy shop 2 is unknown and never updated.
In some implementations, the search results 520, 530 can be associated with various selectable graphical elements that, when selected, cause the computing device 510 to perform corresponding actions. For example, when the call graphical element 522, 532 associated with a given one of the search results 520, 530 is selected, the user input may indicate that a telephone call should be initiated and performed. As another example, when the orientation graphic element 523, 533 is associated with a given one of the search results 520, 530, the user input may indicate that a navigation action should be initiated and performed. In other embodiments, and although not depicted, when a generic automatic telephone call graphical element is selected, the user input may explicitly indicate that an automatic telephone call should be initiated and performed.
In some implementations, and as shown in fig. 5A, in response to receiving user input to initiate and perform a phone call action with either entity (e.g., in response to receiving a selected one of call interface elements 522, 532 or an automated phone call graphical element in general), a call details interface 570 may be rendered at computing device 510. In some versions of those embodiments, the call details interface 570 may be rendered at the computing device 510 as part of the graphical user interface 580. In some other versions of those embodiments, the call details interface 570 may be an interface overlaying the user interface separate from the graphical user interface 580, and may include an interface element 586 that allows the user to expand the call details interface 570 to display additional call details (e.g., by sliding up on the interface element 586) and/or close the call details interface 570 (e.g., by sliding down on the interface element 586). In other implementations, the call details interface 570 may be accessed and closed at any time using interface element 586. While the call details interface 570 is depicted at the bottom of the graphical user interface 580, it should be understood that this is for illustration and is not meant to be limiting. For example, the call details interface 570 may be rendered on top of the graphical user interface 580, on one side of the graphical user interface 580, or an interface completely separate from the graphical user interface 580.
In various embodiments, the call details interface 570 may include a plurality of selectable text segments (or graphical elements). In some implementations, the segments can be selectable such that when a given one of the segments is selected, the computing device 510 can perform the corresponding action. As shown in FIG. 5A, the call details interface 570 includes a first selectable text segment 571 of "automatic telephone call" and a second selectable text segment 572 of "regular call". Further, the first selectable text segment 571, when selected, can provide an indication to the automated assistant that it is desired to initiate an automated phone call using the automated assistant, and the second selectable text segment 572, when selected, can cause the automated assistant to initiate a normal phone call. Notably, in some versions of those embodiments, the selectable segments of text may include other associated selectable segments of text. For example, a first selectable text segment 571 of "automatic phone call" may include: a first further selectable text segment 571A of "toy status update" associated with the action of requesting a status update during an automatic telephone call; a second other selectable text segment 571B of "order toys" associated with an action to hold the toy to a user of computing device 510 during an automatic phone call; and a third other selectable text segment 571C of "buy toy" associated with the action of obtaining a toy during an automated phone call to a user of computing device 510. Although the automatic telephone calls described herein with respect to fig. 5A through 5D are initiated from a browser-based application, it should be understood that this is by way of example and not meant as a limitation. For example, an automated phone call may be initiated from various software applications accessible at computing device 510 (e.g., an automated assistant application, a contact application, an email application, a text or SMS messaging application, and/or other software applications), and, if the automated phone call is initiated using verbal input, from a home screen of computing device 510, from a lock screen of computing device 510, and/or other states of computing device 510.
For example, assume that a user input is detected at computing device 510 that initiates and executes an automated phone call with first search result 520 of "synthetic toy store 1". The user input may be, for example, a verbal input such as "find hit christmas toy 2020" or a touch input directed to call interface element 522 (and/or one of selectable text segments 571, 571A-571C). In various implementations, the automated assistant can identify groups of entities each stored in association with "hot christmas toys" in one or more databases (e.g., entity database 153A of fig. 1) based on user input indicating the "hot christmas toys". In some implementations, the automated assistant can limit the entities included in the group to entities stored in association with the trending christmas toy and within a threshold distance of the location of the computing device 510 (e.g., determined based on GPS data generated by a GPS sensor of the computing device 510). For example, the automated assistant may initially include all entities in the group of entities that are stored in association with the trending christmas toy and that are within four miles of the location of the computing device 510. If not, the automated assistant can increase the threshold distance to include all entities within eight miles of the location of the computing device 510, and so on. In some additional and/or alternative embodiments, the automated assistant can continue to identify entities for inclusion in the group until a threshold number of entities are identified for inclusion in the group. For example, the automated assistant may continually increase the threshold distance to identify entities to include in the group until five entities are included in the group. If more than a threshold number of entities are included in the group, entities meeting one or more criteria may be included in the group (e.g., as described in more detail above with respect to entity identification engine 153). Notably, even though the user input may involve initiating an automated telephone call with a particular entity, or no entity is specified, the group of entities associated with the trending christmas toy may still be identified.
The automated assistant can initiate and perform an automated phone call with one or more of the entities of the group until the request is satisfied. In some implementations, the automated assistant can initiate a first automated phone call with a first entity of the group in response to receiving the user input and determine a call initiation time to initiate performance of additional automated phone calls with corresponding additional entities of the group. In some versions of those embodiments the call initiation time for each additional automated telephone call may be a static threshold duration (e.g., 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and/or other durations). For example, the automated assistant may initiate a first automated phone call with a first entity of the group, initiate a second automated phone call with a second entity of the group 30 seconds after initiating the first automated phone call with the first entity, initiate a third automated phone call with a third entity of the group 30 seconds after initiating the second automated phone call with the second entity, and so on for each entity of the group. In other versions of those embodiments, the automated assistant may determine each call origination time based on historical call data (e.g., stored in historical call database 154A) associated with a corresponding one of the entities of the group. The historical call data may include, for example, an indication of a duration of time that the corresponding entity is associated with and navigates the IVR system, an indication of a duration of a previous automatic telephone call with the corresponding entity, an indication of a duration of an initial hold time during the previous automatic telephone call with the corresponding entity, and/or other call data derived from the previous automatic telephone call with each corresponding entity of the group. Determining a call origination time associated with each entity of the group is described in more detail herein (e.g., with respect to request execution engine 154 of fig. 1). Further, the automated assistant can cause a corresponding notification (e.g., audibly via speakers of computing device 510 and/or visually via graphical user interface 580 of computing device 510) to be rendered at computing device 510 that includes results of the automated phone call, a prompt to a user of computing device 510, and/or other information related to the automated phone call.
For example, with specific reference to fig. 5B, assume that user input is detected at computing device 510 to initiate an automated phone call to request a status update regarding a trending christmas toy (e.g., a touch input directed to first other selectable text segment 571A of fig. 5A or a verbal input "find trending christmas toy"). Assume further that the automated assistant recognizes at least imaginary toy store 1 and imaginary toy store 2 as entities in the group associated with the trending christmas toy. The automated assistant may initiate an automated phone call with the hypothetical toy store 1 and request a status update regarding the trending christmas toy as an action to be performed based on the user input. For example, the automated assistant may cause the synthesized speech 552B1 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the hypothetical Toy store 1 representative (e.g., "I'm telling to be there Hot Christmas tosis available at your store" (I do you want to see if your store has a Hot Christmas Toy) ") and may process audio data corresponding to the information 554B1 received in response to the synthesized speech 552B1 (e.g.," please just, I do you next) ").
Further, the automated assistant may process audio data corresponding to the further information 554A2 (e.g., "we are out of stock") when the synthetic toy store 1 representative returns an automated phone call, and may cause rendering of further synthesized speech 552B2 (e.g., "thank you for checking") at a computing device associated with the synthetic toy store 1 representative. Based on the results of the dialog, the automated assistant can cause the notification 579B to be visually rendered at the graphical user interface (e.g., via the notification interface 590, which can replace the call details interface 570, and can expand or close using the element interface 586 similar to the call details interface 570). Further, the automated assistant may cause the first search result 520 depicted in fig. 5A to be updated to indicate that the trending christmas toy of the hypothetical toy shop 1 is out of stock, and optionally include a time indicator indicating the time of the further information 554B2 that the trending christmas toy is out of stock (e.g., "12/1/2020at 9. Updating search results based on information received during an automatic telephone call is described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to fig. 1 and 4D).
During an automated phone call with the synthetic toy store 1, the automated assistant (or a separate instance thereof) may also initiate additional automated phone calls with the synthetic toy store 2 based on the determined call origination time associated with the synthetic store 2. In some embodiments, the call origination time associated with the synthetic toy store 2 may be zero, such that the automated assistant may perform automated phone calls in parallel with the synthetic toy store 1 and the synthetic toy store 2 (e.g., in a manner similar to that described above with respect to originating and performing the first automated phone call in fig. 4A-4C). In other embodiments, additional automated phone calls may be staggered such that an automated assistant (and/or separate instances thereof) typically engages with only one entity at a given time. In some versions of those embodiments, the call initiation time associated with the synthetic toy store 2 may be a set duration associated with each entity in the group such that each additional automated phone call is initiated 30 seconds after each other. In other versions of those embodiments, the call origination time associated with the synthetic toy store 2 may be based on historical call data associated with the synthetic toy store 1 and the synthetic toy store 2.
In some additional and/or alternative versions of those embodiments, the call initiation time associated with the synthetic toy store 2 may be dynamic and based on the progress of the conversation between the automated assistant and the synthetic toy store 1 representative. For example, assume that the call origination time associated with the synthetic toy store 2, determined according to one or more of the techniques described above, is 30 seconds. However, if the hold period described above with respect to FIG. 5A exceeds the original 30 second call origination time, the call origination time associated with the synthetic toy store 2 may be adjusted to a dynamic time when the conversation with the synthetic toy store 1 representation resumes (e.g., when the further information 554B2 is received). In contrast, assume that the hypothetical toy shop 1 representative indicated in the further information 554B2 (or immediately in the information 554B 1) that a hot christmas toy is available. In this example, additional automated phone calls with the synthetic toy store 2 may be actively terminated. However, if an additional automated phone call has been initiated with the synthetic toy store 2 and the automated assistant is engaged in an additional conversation with the synthetic toy store 2 representative, the automated assistant may continue the conversation but change the action to one that requests a status update regarding the trending christmas toy and update the search results associated with the synthetic toy store 2 accordingly. Determining a call origination time associated with an entity of a group is described in more detail herein (e.g., with respect to request execution engine 154 of fig. 1).
For example, with specific reference to fig. 5C, assume that user input is detected at computing device 510 to initiate an automated telephone call to acquire a hit christmas toy on behalf of the user of computing device 510. The user input may be, for example, a touch input or a spoken input "find Hot Christmas Toy Toy and buy it for me" directed to the second other selectable text segment 571B of FIG. 5A. Assume further that the result of an automated telephone call with the hypothetical toy store 1 representative indicates that the hypothetical toy store 1 is out of stock based on the dialog depicted in figure 5B. Assume also that the additional automated phone call with the hypothetical toy store 2 was initiated 30 seconds after the automated phone call with the hypothetical toy store 1. Similar to the dialog described above with reference to fig. 5B, the automated assistant may cause the synthesized speech 552C1 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the synthetic Toy store 2 representation (e.g., "I'm sealing to be where Hot holt Christmas to be available at your store") and may process audio data corresponding to the information 554C1 received in response to the synthesized speech (e.g., "yes, we have two available").
Moreover, the automated assistant can cause the further synthesized speech 552C2 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the synthetic toy store 2 representation (e.g., "May I purchase on a beat of Jane Doe (I can purchase it on behalf of Jane Doe)"), wherein Jane Doe is a user of the computing device 510), and process audio data corresponding to the further information 554C2 when the synthetic toy store 2 representation responds to the further synthesized speech 552C 2. Based on the results of the conversation, the automated assistant can cause notification 579C to be visually rendered at the graphical user interface (e.g., via notification interface 590, which can replace call details interface 570, and can be expanded or closed using interface elements 586 similar to call details interface 570).
Notably, the notification 579C may indicate that the hypothetical toy store 2 has a trending christmas toy, and may further include a prompt requesting that the user of the computing device 510 (e.g., jane Doe) authorize provision of monetary information to the hypothetical toy store 2 representative to obtain the trending christmas toy at the hypothetical toy store 2 on behalf of the user. Additionally, the notification interface 590 can also include selectable graphical elements responsive to the prompt, such as a first selectable graphical element 579C1, a second selectable graphical element 579C2 for authorizing the provision of money information, and a third selectable element 579C3 for the user to join in an additional automated phone call. In various implementations, the user of the computing device 510 may have previously authorized the provision of monetary information and the prompt may be omitted. If the user indicates that the automated assistant should provide monetary information (e.g., via selection of the first selectable graphical element 579C 1), the user may receive further notifications indicating that the user on behalf of the computing device 510 acquired a warm christmas toy at the hypothetical toy store 2, provide directions to the hypothetical toy store 2, create reminders to pick up the warm christmas toy at the hypothetical toy store 2, and/or perform other actions based on the results of the conversation during the additional automated phone call with the hypothetical toy store 2. In addition, once the automated assistant has acquired the trending christmas toy, it may actively terminate other ongoing automated phone calls with other entities of the group.
For example, with specific reference to fig. 5D, assume that user input is detected at computing device 510 to initiate an automated telephone call to hold a hot christmas toy on behalf of the user of computing device 510 (e.g., as opposed to a request to obtain the hot christmas toy in fig. 5C). The user input may be, for example, a touch input or a spoken input "find Hot Christmas say and place on hold for" pointing to the third other selectable text segment 571C of fig. 5A. Assume further that the result of an automated telephone call with the hypothetical toy store 1 representative indicates that the hypothetical toy store 1 is out of stock based on the dialog depicted in figure 5B. Assume also that an additional automated phone call is initiated with the hypothetical toy store 2 30 seconds after the automated phone call with the hypothetical toy store 1. Similar to the dialog described above with reference to fig. 5B and 5C, the automated assistant may cause the synthesized speech 552D1 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the synthetic Toy store 2 representation (e.g., "I'm telling to se where Hot hotspot is available at your store"), and may process audio data corresponding to the information 554D1 received in response to the synthesized speech (e.g., "yes, we have two more available").
Further, the automated assistant can cause the further synthesized speech 554D2 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the synthetic toy store 2 representation (e.g., "May I pure it on behalf of Jane Doe," where Jane Doe is a user of the computing device 510), and process audio data corresponding to the further information 554D2 when the synthetic toy store 2 representation responds to the further synthesized speech 552D 2. Based on the results of the conversation, the automated assistant can cause notification 579D to be visually rendered at the graphical user interface (e.g., via notification interface 590, which can replace call details interface 570, and can be expanded or closed using interface elements 586 similar to call details interface 570). Notably, the notification 579D may indicate that the hypothetical toy store 2 has a popular christmas toy and that the automated assistant has ordered it at the hypothetical toy store 2 on behalf of the user of the computing device 510. Although not depicted in fig. 5D, the automated assistant may further cause the computing device 510 to render navigation information to the synthetic toy store 2, pick instructions when a user of the computing device 510 arrives at the synthetic toy store 2 to pick a popular christmas toy, a link to a webpage associated with the synthetic toy store 2, an indication that a calendar entry or reminder has been created for picking a popular christmas toy at the synthetic toy store 2, and so forth.
In various implementations, the automated assistant may cause the first search result 520 depicted in fig. 5A to be updated to indicate that the trending christmas toy of hypothetical toy store 1 is out of stock, and optionally include a time indicator (e.g., "12/1/2020at 9. Further, the automated assistant may cause the second search result 530 depicted in fig. 5A to be updated to indicate that the trending christmas toy of hypothetical toy shop 2 is in short stock or has only one left, and optionally include a time indicator indicating the time of the information 554C1, 554D1 available for the trending christmas toy (e.g., "12/1/2020at 9. Updating search results based on information received during an automatic telephone call is described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to fig. 1 and 4D).
In addition, other automated assistants associated with other users located in the same geographic area may perform further actions utilizing information acquired by the automated assistant during the automated phone call. For example, if the neighbors of the user of computing device 510 provided user input to the respective automated assistants at 10 a.m. 00 to obtain a hit christmas toy on behalf of the neighbors, the respective automated assistants of the neighbors may analyze the updated search results and remove the hypothetical toy store 1 from any identified group because the hit christmas toy is not available at hypothetical toy store 1 at 9 a.m.:00 a.m. and the respective automated assistants of the neighbors may initiate an automated phone call with hypothetical toy store 2 to see if any are still available. By utilizing information obtained by automated assistants of computing devices 510, other automated assistants can conserve computing resources of their respective computing devices and computing devices associated with the entity.
While fig. 5A-5D are described herein as performing actions on behalf of a user of the computing device 510 with respect to an item of interest, it should be understood that this is by way of example only and is not meant to be limiting. For example, referring now to fig. 6A-6C, additional non-limiting examples are depicted of initiating automated phone calls with various entities on behalf of a user and causing notifications associated with each of the various entities to be rendered based on the results of the automated phone calls. However, in contrast to fig. 5A through 5D, fig. 6A through 6C are described herein with respect to availability of a requesting entity during a given time period. Similar to fig. 5A-5D, fig. 6A-6C each depict a computing device 610 having a graphical user interface 680 related to a user request to initiate and/or perform an automated telephone call on behalf of a user of the computing device 610. One or more aspects of an automated assistant (e.g., automated assistant 115 of fig. 1) associated with a user of computing device 610 can be implemented locally on computing device 610 and/or on other computing devices in network communication with computing device 610 in a distributed manner (e.g., via network 190 of fig. 1). For simplicity, the operations of fig. 6A-6C are described herein as being performed by an automated assistant (e.g., using the automatic request system 180 of fig. 1). While the computing device 610 of fig. 6A-6C is depicted as a mobile phone, it should be understood that this is not meant to be limiting. Computing device 610 may be, for example, a server, a stand-alone speaker, a speaker connected to a graphical user interface, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and/or any other client device capable of making phone calls and running an instance of an automated assistant.
The graphical user interface 680 of fig. 6A-6C further includes: text reply interface element 684 that the user may select to generate user input via a virtual keyboard or other touch and/or typing input; and a voice reply interface element 685 that the user may select to generate user input via the microphone of computing device 610. In some implementations, the user can generate user input via a microphone without selecting voice reply interface element 685. For example, actively monitoring audible user input via a microphone may occur to avoid the need for the user to select voice reply interface element 685. In some of those implementations and/or in other implementations, voice reply interface element 685 may be omitted. Moreover, in some implementations, text reply interface element 684 may additionally and/or alternatively be omitted (e.g., the user may only provide audible user input). The graphical user interface 680 of fig. 6A-6 CD further includes system interface elements 681, 682, 683 with which a user may interact to cause the computing device 610 to perform one or more actions.
In various implementations, an automated phone call may be initiated and executed in response to receiving user input directed to the automated assistant and requesting the automated assistant to initiate and execute the automated phone call. The user input may be verbal, touch, and/or key input including instructions to initiate and conduct an automated telephone call. Further, the automated assistant can perform the actions included in the request on behalf of a given user of the computing device 610 during the automated phone call. As shown in fig. 6A, the graphical user interface 680 includes a conversation between the automated assistant and a user of the computing device 610 (e.g., jane Doe). The dialog includes an initial user input 656A1 (e.g., typing or spoken) that requests (e.g., "can you find a plumber … … today 2 pm 00 to 4 00". The automated assistant may provide a response 652A1 (e.g., text or synthesized speech) that instructs the automated assistant to call some local plumbers to see if someone is available.
In some implementations, and as shown in fig. 6A, the call details interface 670 may be rendered at the computing device 610 in response to receiving the user input 656A 1. In some versions of those embodiments, the call details interface 670 may be rendered at the computing device 610 as part of the graphical user interface 680. In some other versions of those embodiments, the call details interface 670 may be an interface overlaying the user interface separate from the graphical user interface 680 and may include an interface element 686 that allows the user to expand the call details interface 670 to display additional call details (e.g., by sliding up on the interface element 686) and/or close the call details interface 670 (e.g., by sliding down on the interface element 686). In other implementations, the call details interface 670 may be accessed and closed at any time using interface element 686. While the call details interface 670 is depicted at the bottom of the graphical user interface 680, it should be understood that this is for illustration and is not meant to be limiting. For example, the call details interface 670 may be rendered on top of the graphical user interface 680, on a side of the graphical user interface 680, or an interface completely separate from the graphical user interface 680.
In various embodiments, the call details interface 670 may include a plurality of selectable text segments (or graphical elements). In some implementations, the segments can be selectable such that when a given one of the segments is selected, the computing device 610 can perform the corresponding action. As shown in fig. 6A, the call details interface 670 includes a first selectable text segment 671 for "automatic telephone call" and a second selectable text segment 672 for "regular call". Further, the first selectable text segment 671, when selected, can provide an indication to the automated assistant that it is desired to initiate an automated phone call using the automated assistant, and the second selectable text segment 672, when selected, can cause the automated assistant to initiate a normal phone call. Notably, in some versions of those embodiments, the selectable text segment may include associated information for an automated telephone call. For example, the first selectable text passage 671 of "automatic telephone call" may include: the "service: a first portion 671A of the plumber's associated information; the "time" associated with the time at which the user is requested to enter 656A1 the pipe service included during the automatic telephone call: 2; and a "date: a third part 671C of the associated information of 6/11/2020'. By displaying the portions 671A, 671B, 671C of the information associated with the automated telephone call, the user of the computing device 510 may be provided with information to modify the requested service, the requested request time, the requested request date for the requested service, and/or other information related to the service requested by the user of the computing device 610. While the automated phone call described herein with reference to fig. 6A-6C is initiated based on user input directed to the automated assistant, it is to be understood that this is by way of example and not meant to be limiting. For example, an automated phone call may be initiated from various software applications accessible at the computing device 610 (e.g., a browser-based application, a contact application, an email application, a text or SMS messaging application, and/or other software applications), and, if the automated phone call is initiated using verbal input, from a home screen of the computing device 610, from a lock screen of the computing device 610, and/or other states of the computing device 610.
For example, assume that a user input (e.g., as indicated by portions 671A, 671B, 671C of information) is detected at computing device 610 that initiates and executes an automated telephone call to request availability of a pipe service for a given time and date. In various implementations, the automated assistant can identify groups of entities that are each stored in association with a "pipe service" in one or more databases (e.g., entity database 153A of fig. 1) based on user input indicating the "pipe service. In some implementations, the automated assistant can limit the entities included in the group to entities stored in association with the pipe service and within a threshold distance of the location of the computing device 610 (e.g., determined based on GPS data generated by a GPS sensor of the computing device 610). For example, the automated assistant may initially include all entities in the group of entities that are stored in association with the pipe service and that are within 10 miles of the location of the computing device 610. If not, the automated assistant can increase the threshold distance to include all entities within 20 miles of the location of the computing device 610, and so on. In some additional and/or alternative embodiments, the automated assistant can continue to identify entities for inclusion in the group until a threshold number of entities are identified for inclusion in the group. For example, the automated assistant may continually increase the threshold distance to identify entities to include in the group until five entities are included in the group. If more than a threshold number of entities are included in the group, entities meeting one or more criteria may be included in the group (e.g., as described in more detail above with respect to entity identification engine 153). Notably, even though the user input may involve initiating an automated telephone call with a particular entity, or no entity is specified, the group of entities associated with the trending christmas toy may still be identified.
The automated assistant may initiate and execute an automated phone call with one or more entities of the group until the request is satisfied. In some implementations, the automated assistant can initiate a first automated phone call with a first entity of a group and determine a call initiation time to initiate performance of additional automated phone calls with corresponding additional entities of the group in response to receiving the user input 656A1 in fig. 6A. As described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to request execution engine 154 of fig. 1 and the call origination time of fig. 5A), the call origination time for each additional automated phone call may be a static threshold duration of time, determined based on historical call data (e.g., stored in historical call database 154A) associated with a corresponding entity of the group of entities, and dynamically modified based on the progress of the automated phone call. Further, the automated assistant can cause a corresponding notification including the results of the automated phone call, a prompt to a user of computing device 510, and/or other information related to the automated phone call to be rendered at computing device 510 (e.g., audibly via a speaker of computing device 510 and/or visually via graphical user interface 580 of computing device 510).
For example, with specific reference to fig. 6B, assume that a user input is detected at the computing device 510 to initiate an automated telephone call to request availability of a pipe service (e.g., a touch input directed to the first selectable graphical element 671 of fig. 6A or a verbal input corresponding to the user input 656A 1). Assume further that the automated assistant identifies at least the example plumber 1 and the example plumber 2 as entities in a group associated with the pipe service. The automated assistant may initiate an automated phone call with the example plumber 1 and request a status update of the availability of the pipe service regarding the action to be performed as based on the user input. For example, the automated assistant may cause the synthesized speech 652B1 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the example plumber 1 representation (e.g., "do you available to fix a burst pipe in a base between 2 and 4.
Further, the automated assistant may cause further synthesized speech 652B2 to be rendered at the computing device associated with the example plumber 1 representative in response to receiving the information 654B1 (e.g., "Let me check with Jane Doe to se if 5. Based on the results of the conversation, the automated assistant can cause notification 679B to be visually rendered at the graphical user interface (e.g., via notification interface 690, which can replace call details interface 670 and can be expanded or closed using interface element 686 similar to call details interface 670). Notably, the notification 679B can include an indication that the example plumber 1 is unavailable during a given time period (e.g., between 2 pm and 4 pm) but is available for a time period after the given time period (e.g., 5 pm available) and can also include a prompt (e.g., "do that work for you?. Further, the prompt may cause a selectable graphical element responsive to the prompt to be rendered in notification interface 590. The selectable graphical elements may include, for example: a first selectable graphical element 679B1 for authorizing a reservation for time 5 pm; a second selectable graphical element 679B2 for declining booking a time of 5 pm; and a third selectable element 679B3 for the user to join the additional automated telephone call. In various implementations, if the user of the computing device 610 selects the first selectable graphical element 679B1 (or otherwise confirms that the 5 pm time is 00), the automated assistant may further provide name information, contact information, and address information to the example plumber 1 representative. However, if the user does not respond to the prompt for a threshold duration (e.g., 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and/or other duration), the automated assistant may actively terminate the automated phone call with the example plumber 1 representative to avoid wasting further computing resources. More specifically, the automated assistant can cause further synthesized speech to be rendered at the computing device represented by example plumber 1 to indicate the user's response to the prompt (or lack thereof), and the automated assistant can optionally cause further notifications to be rendered via notification interface 590.
During an automated phone call with example plumber 1, the automated assistant (or a separate instance thereof) may also initiate additional automated phone calls with example plumber 2 based on the determined call initiation time associated with example plumber 2. In some implementations, the call initiation time associated with the example plumber 2 may be zero, such that the automated assistant may perform automated phone calls with the example plumber 1 and the example plumber 2 in parallel (e.g., in a similar manner as described above with respect to initiating and performing the first automated phone call in fig. 4A through 4C). In other embodiments, additional automated phone calls may be staggered such that an automated assistant (and/or separate instances thereof) typically engages with only one entity at a given time. In some versions of those embodiments, the call initiation time associated with the example plumber 2 may be a set duration associated with each entity in the group such that each additional automated phone call is initiated 30 seconds after each other. In other versions of those embodiments, the call origination time associated with example plumber 2 may be based on historical call data associated with example plumber 1 and example plumber 2. In some additional and/or alternative versions of those embodiments, the call initiation time associated with the example plumber 2 may be dynamic and based on the progress of the conversation between the automated assistant and the example plumber 1 representative, as described in more detail above (e.g., with respect to fig. 5B).
For example, with specific reference to fig. 6C, assume that user input is detected at the computing device 610 to initiate an automated telephone call to subscribe to the conduit service on behalf of the user of the computing device 610. Assume further that the results of the automated telephone call with the example plumber 1 representation indicate that the example plumber 2 is unavailable during a given time period based on the dialog depicted in fig. 6B. Assume also that an additional automated phone call is initiated with example plumber 2 15 seconds after the automated phone call with example plumber 1. Similar to the dialog described above with reference to fig. 6B, the automated assistant may cause synthesized speech 652C1 to be rendered at a computing device associated with the example plumber 2 representation (e.g., "are you available.. Beta een 2.
Further, the automated assistant may cause further synthesized speech 652C2 to be rendered at the computing device associated with the example plumber 2 representation (e.g., "Jan Doe's address is 401s.4th St. (Jan Doe is addressed to 401s.4th St.)", where Jane Doe is a user of computing device 610). Based on the results of the conversation, the automated assistant can cause notification 679C to be visually rendered at the graphical user interface (e.g., via notification interface 690, which can replace call details interface 670 and can be expanded or closed using interface element 686 similar to call details interface 670). Notably, notification 679C may indicate that example plumber 2 is available for a given time period (e.g., at 3 pm of the required time range of 2 pm to 4 pm. Further, the automated assistant can schedule a time for the user of the computing device 610 and render the notification 679C of fig. 6C before receiving any further user input in response to the prompt of fig. 6B. In this example, the automated assistant can automatically turn off the notifications and prompts of fig. 6B. In this manner, the automated assistant can also request the available time periods from various entities and subscribe the user of the computing device 610 to a given one of the available time periods.
In various implementations, and although not shown in fig. 4A-4C, 5B-5C, 6B, or 6C, upon initiating each corresponding automated phone call, the automated assistant may prompt representatives associated with the group of entities to agree to participate in a conversation with the automated assistant. For example, referring to FIG. 4A, the automated assistant may render the synthesized speech "Do you present to engaging in a conversation with an automated assistant" at the computing device represented by example store 1 before causing the synthesized speech 452A1 to be rendered. If the automated assistant receives information in response to a prompt indicating that the example store 1 representative agrees to participate in the conversation, the automated assistant may continue the conversation in the manner described above with respect to FIG. 4A. Further, because the example store 1 representative has agreed to participate in the conversation, the automated assistant may not request that the example store 1 representative agree to participate in the conversation with the example representative during the second automated phone call. However, if the automated assistant does not receive information in response to the prompt indicating that the example store 1 representative agrees to participate in the conversation, the automated assistant may terminate the first automatic call with the example store 1 representative.
Fig. 7 is a block diagram of an example computing device 710 that may optionally be used to perform one or more aspects of the techniques described herein. In some implementations, one or more of the client device, cloud-based automated assistant component, and/or other components can include one or more components of the example computing device 710.

Where the systems described herein collect or otherwise monitor personal information about a user or information that personal and/or monitoring may be used, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social behavior or activity, profession, user preferences, or the user's current geographic location), or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, some data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used in order to remove personally identifiable information. For example, the identity of the user may be processed so that personally identifiable information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be summarized where geographic location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) so that a particular geographic location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how information about the user is collected and/or used.
In some implementations, a method implemented by one or more processors is provided and includes: identifying an item of interest; identifying a group of entities associated with the item of interest; and initiating, by an automated assistant, execution of a corresponding automated phone call with each entity of the set of entities to render one or more corresponding instances of synthesized speech requesting corresponding status updates regarding the item of interest. The method further comprises: during performance of the corresponding automated phone call with a given entity of the entities of the group: requesting the corresponding status update regarding the item of interest from a representative associated with the given entity through rendering of one or more of corresponding instances of synthesized speech; and receiving information about the item of interest from the representative associated with the given entity in response to requesting the corresponding status update. The method further comprises: determining, based on the received information about the item of interest, a time delay before initiating performance of a subsequent corresponding automatic phone call with the given entity to request a further corresponding status update about the item of interest; and initiating, by the automated assistant, performance of the subsequent corresponding automated phone call with the given entity in response to the passage of the time delay.
These and other embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may optionally include one or more of the following features.
In some implementations, the received information about the item of interest indicates an availability of the item of interest at the given entity and an available quantity of the item of interest at the given entity.
In some versions of those embodiments, determining the time delay based on the received information about the item of interest includes: determining whether the available quantity of the item of interest at the given entity satisfies a quantity threshold; and assigning a first time period as the time delay in response to determining that the available number of the item of interest at the given entity satisfies the number threshold. In some further versions of those embodiments, the method further comprises: assigning a second time period as the time delay in response to determining that the available quantity of the item of interest at the given entity fails to satisfy the quantity threshold. The second time period has a shorter time duration than the first time period and, therefore, elapses before the first time period. In other versions of those embodiments, the second time period elapses on the same day that the automatic call is initiated, and the first time period elapses during a second day after the same day that the automatic call is initiated.
In some versions of those embodiments, the method further comprises: updating search results associated with the given entity to indicate one or more of: the availability of the item of interest at the given entity, or the available quantity of the item of interest at the given entity.

The method further comprises: determining, based on the received additional information regarding the item of interest, an additional time delay before initiating performance of a subsequent additional corresponding automatic phone call with the additional entity to request the further corresponding status update regarding the item of interest. A first time period is assigned to the time delay and a different second time period is assigned to the additional time delay. The method further comprises: initiating, by the automated assistant, execution of the subsequent additional corresponding automated phone call with the additional entity in response to the passage of the additional time delay.
In some implementations, identifying the group of entities associated with the item of interest includes: accessing one or more databases to identify the entities stored in association with the item of interest as the group of the entities. In some versions of those embodiments, each of the entities of the identified group is located within a particular geographic area.
In some implementations, the method of requesting the status update regarding the item of interest from the representative associated with the given entity further includes: generating synthesized speech audio data that captures one or more of the corresponding instances of synthesized speech that request the corresponding status update with respect to the item of interest; and rendering one or more of the corresponding instances of synthesized speech includes causing the synthesized speech to be rendered at an additional computing device of the representative associated with the given entity.
In some implementations, a method implemented by one or more processors is provided and includes: receiving, from a computing device of a user, a request to initiate performance of an automated telephone call on behalf of the user; identifying an action to be performed during the automatic telephone call based on the request; identifying groups of entities that are each capable of satisfying the request based on the action to be performed during the automatic call; and initiating, by an automated assistant, execution of the automated phone call with a given entity of the entities of the group. The method further comprises the following steps: during execution of the automated phone call with the given entity: engaging in a conversation with a representative associated with the given entity to perform the action through rendering of one or more corresponding instances of synthesized speech related to the request; and initiating, by the automated assistant, execution of additional automated phone calls with additional entities of the group.

In some embodiments, the method further comprises: during execution of a corresponding automated telephone call with the given entity: determining a call initiation time for initiating performance of the additional automated phone call with the additional entity based on historical call data associated with the entity; and initiating performance of the additional automated telephone call with the additional entity is in response to determining that the current time matches the call initiation time. In some versions of those embodiments, the historical call data associated with the additional entity includes one or more of: an indication that the entity is associated with an interactive voice response system and a duration of time to navigate the interactive voice response system; an indication of a duration of a previous automatic telephone call with the entity; or an indication of the duration of the initial hold time during a previous automatic telephone call with the entity.
In some implementations, the action to be performed during the automatic phone call includes requesting a status update regarding an item of interest associated with the entity of the group. In some implementations, participating in the conversation with the representative associated with the given entity to perform the action includes: requesting the status update regarding the item of interest from the representative associated with the given entity; and receiving information about the item of interest from the representative associated with the given entity in response to requesting the status update.
