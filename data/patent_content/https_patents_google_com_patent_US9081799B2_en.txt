- a capture device such as a mobile device having a camera and/or voice recorder, captures 700 text and/or other information from a rendered document, and processes 702 the captured data, for example to remove artifacts of the capture process, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and so on.
- the system via a recognition component (such as OCR device, speech recognition device, or autocorrelation device or a component that employs the system described herein) then optionally converts 704 the data into one or more signatures, such as segments of text, text offsets, or other symbols or characters, or the system described herein Alternatively, the system performs an alternate form of extracting one or more document signatures from the rendered document.
- a recognition component such as OCR device, speech recognition device, or autocorrelation device or a component that employs the system described herein
- the system performs an alternate form of extracting one or more document signatures from the rendered document.
- the signature represents a set of possible text transcriptions.
- the process may be influenced or constrained by feedback from other previously or subsequently performed steps. For example, the system may previously identify candidate documents from which the capture likely originates, thus narrowing the possible interpretations of the original capture.
- Post processing components may receive data from the recognition process and filter 706 the data, or perform other operations, as desired.
- the system may deduce, determine, identify, and/or perform direct actions 707 immediately and without proceeding to the following steps in the routine, such as when the system captures a phrase or symbol that contains sufficient information to convey the user's intent. In these cases, the system may not need to identify or reference a digital counterpart document in order to carry out the user's wishes.
- the system may then construct a query or a set of queries for use in searching for an electronic counterpart or other content associated with the capture.
- Some aspects of the query construction may depend on the search process used, and the system may perform them in a later step (such as after a search is performed), but there will typically be some operations, such as the removal of obviously misrecognized or irrelevant characters, the system can perform in advance.
- the system passes 710 the query or queries to a search and context analysis component.
- the system may attempt to identify the document from which the original data was captured. To do so, the system may use search indices and search engines 712 , knowledge about the user 714 and/or knowledge about the user's context or the context in which the capture occurred 716 .
- the system may interact with a search engine 712 that employs and/or indexes information specifically about rendered documents, about their digital counterpart documents, and/or about documents that have a web (internet) presence).
- the system may transfer information back and forth with these information sources, and may feed identified information into various other steps of the routine. For example, the system may receive information about the language, font, rendering and likely next words of a capture based on receiving knowledge of candidate documents during step 710 .
- the system may retrieve a copy of the document or documents identified earlier as being electronic counterparts to the rendered document.
- the system may have direct access to document sources and repositories 724 (e.g., a local filing system or database or a web server), or the system may contact an access service 722 to retrieve a document or documents.
- the access service 722 may enforce authentication, security or payments for documents, or may provide other services, such as conversion of the document into a desired format, among other things.
- the system may take advantage of the association of extra functionality or data with part or all of a document.
- advertising applications may associate particular advertising messages or subjects with portions of a document, such as keywords, phrases, or proximities to certain content.
- This extra associated functionality or data may be thought of as one or more overlays on the document, and is referred to herein as “markup.”
- the system identifies any markup relevant to the captured data and/or an identified electronic counterpart.
- the markup is provided by the user, the originator, the publisher of the document, other users of the document, and so on, and may be stored at a directly accessible source 732 , or dynamically generated by a markup service 734 .
- the markup can be associated with, and apply to, a rendered document and/or the digital counterpart to a rendered document, or to groups of either or both of these documents.

Abstract
Description
-
- Continuum from arrangement of articles, headlines, captions, images, etc. on a page or spread, to OCR-ed text or image match of small region of text.
- Text-based
- Use of character and/or word sequence
- Use of vertical alignment of characters and/or words
- Character Density Based
- Use of density of character sequence
- Use of vertical or orthogonal character densities
- Use of paired densities
- Image-based
- Word lengths and/or word spaces
- Use of relative or absolute word lengths in sequence
- Use of relative or absolute word lengths and vertical alignment
- Use of relative or absolute word lengths and vertical alignment seeing the vertical dimension as a sequence (disregarding line spacing details)
- Use of relative or absolute word lengths and their sequencing, line-to-line
- Use of relative or absolute word lengths and their proximity in sequence, especially when line breaks are not accurately known
- Textual Features
- Use of sequences of textual features a the word and/or character level—especially easily and reliably identifiable features such as vertical components, straight components, curved components, ascenders, descenders, density, moments (e.g. word centroids, sequences of vertical centroids), frequency (1St derivative), relative frequency (2nd derivative), edge-related features (e.g. edge density, connected-edge lengths, connected-edge region sizes, connected-edge region shapes), stroke-related features (stroke width, stroke width variance), serif-related features, line-related features (e.g. angles, curvature, line-joins (e.g. miter, rounded, beveled), line-caps (e.g. butt, round, projected square).
- Use of textual features at the line, paragraph, article, column, region, page, spread-level.
- Word lengths and/or word spaces
- Text-based
- Special Techniques
- Use of blurred version of original text and generating blurred version of captured image(s) to match the blur-level of the indexed copy.
- This optimizes the set of features extracted and indexed to match what will be encountered by a wide range of capture hardware, including cameras with no close-up focus capabilities.
- Iterative Processing and Context
- Use of context and inputs to generate a first estimated output at some level (e.g. estimated line height, character size, word space size, column width, etc.), then using this estimate to derive a second output, such as the word-space centroid-and-width pattern of a paragraph, then revising the first output, such as the estimated word space size, based on the likehood of the second estimate in the expected corpus of possibilities.
- Use of such iteration in navigating a tree of possibilities, from revising the context and corpus expectations (e.g. maybe the input is from a different customer, in a different country, in a different script, etc.) to realizing that a part of an image is an “e” even though it looks more like a “c”.
- Typically, input is expected to come from the same context as previous input, e.g. on the same page, in the same newspaper, etc. This provides strong bottom-up constraints, allowing few indications to quickly narrow in on an exact location or range. However, the iterative processing allows any given context to be falsified/rejected, for exploration of a larger context, etc. For example, a context may dictate that a character be interpreted in a certain way, but if too much counter-evidence is encountered, the context may be questioned. Similarly, multiple contexts may be explored, based on available time, processing, expense, etc., coupled with the degree to which a particular context seems questionable.
- Use of blurred version of original text and generating blurred version of captured image(s) to match the blur-level of the indexed copy.
- Continuum from arrangement of articles, headlines, captions, images, etc. on a page or spread, to OCR-ed text or image match of small region of text.
