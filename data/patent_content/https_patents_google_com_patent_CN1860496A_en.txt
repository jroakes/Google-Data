Description
The cross reference of related application
Submitted on July 22nd, 2003 and with Alex Carobus, Claire Cui, DeepakJindal, the U.S. Provisional Application sequence number 60/489 of Steve Lawrence and Narayanan Shivakumar classify as the inventor, 322 titles are " COLLECTION USERBEHAVIOR DATA SUCH AS CLICK DATA; GENERATING USERBEHAVIOR DATA REPRESENTATIONS; AND USING USERBEHAVIOR DATA FOR CONCEPT REINFORCEMENT FORCONTENT-BASED AD TARGETING ", and the application requires with it as basis for priority (its content is incorporated herein by reference).
The invention is not restricted to any specific embodiment of describing in this provisional application.
Technical field
The present invention relates to advertisement, especially relate to and improve content-targeted advertisement.
Background technology
Conventional ads
Use traditional media well-known such as the advertisement of TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine.Regrettably, even providing demographic achievement in research and to various media typical audience fully reasonably during hypothesis, advertiser will appreciate that also its advertising budget has many wasting.In addition, it is also very difficult to discern and reduce this waste.
Online advertisement
Recently, on interactive more media, advertise and catch on.For example, owing to use the number of the Internet rapidly to increase, the potential strong mode that advertiser media that provides by the Internet and service has been provided advertise.
Advertiser has formulated several strategies, attempts to make the value maximization of this advertisement.In a kind of strategy, advertiser uses popular demonstration or device, the channel that provides interactive media or service (being called " website " in instructions) conduct and numerous audients to link up with being without loss of generality.For example, advertiser can use this first mode, advertisement is placed on the homepage of New York Times website or USA Today website.In another kind of strategy, advertiser can attempt its advertisement is oriented in audient in the narrower and small field, thereby improves the possibility of these audient's active responses.For example, advance the travel agency of Costa Rica's rainforest tourism advertisement can be placed on the eco-tour sub-directory of Yahoo website.Under the normal condition, advertiser will determine this orientation by hand.
No matter adopt which kind of strategy, often present to its commercial audience with the form of " banner " based on the advertisement (being also referred to as " web advertisement ") of website---promptly comprise the rectangular box of figure composition.If certain member of commercial audience (being called " spectators " or " user " in this manual) selects it by clicking one of these banners with being without loss of generality, the hypertext link of Qian Ruing guides to gray website with spectators in typical case.Spectators select this process of advertisement to be commonly referred to " point advances " (" point advances " is intended to cover any selection of user).The ratio of putting the occurrence number (being the number of times that advertisement shows) of number of times and advertisement is commonly referred to " click-through rate " or " CTR " of described advertisement.
When the user finishes the transaction that the advertisement of previous appearance relates to, just say so " conversion " taken place.Constituting the things that transforms may change with situation, and can determine in diversified mode.For example, situation may be to click advertisement, when finishing purchase with reference to gray webpage and before leaving this webpage, conversion has taken place as the user.As an alternative, conversion can be defined as user's display ads and buy on gray webpage within preset time (as seven days).Substitute as another, conversion can be defined as by advertiser anyly to be estimated/observable user action, such as download white paper, browse to the website given depth at least, observe at least one fixed number purpose webpage, on website or webpage, spend time of scheduled volume at least or the like.Such situation is often arranged, if user's action does not show the purchase of finishing, they may show sells guiding, is not limited thereto although constitute the user action that transforms.Really, also have many other definition to constituting the things that transforms.The ratio that transforms number of times and advertisement occurrence number (being the number of times that advertisement shows) is commonly referred to conversion ratio.If transformation definition is to take place within the schedule time that occurs beginning from advertisement, a kind of possible definition of conversion ratio only considers that perhaps the advertisement above the described schedule time has appearred in the past so.
Regardless of the initial expectation of based on network advertisement, existing mode also has several problems.Although advertiser can touch numerous audients, they are often dissatisfied to the repayment of its investment in advertising.The improvement effect by following the tracks of the user's online custom has been attempted by some advertiser, but this mode has caused right of privacy concern.
Online key word targeted ads
Equally, the organizer's (being called " web site sponsor " or " ad consumer ") who presents the website of advertisement is in the face of following challenge: make the ad revenue maximization and do not damage its user's experience.Some web site sponsor has been selected ad revenue is placed on the user interest.This type of website is " Overture.com ", and it has sponsored so-called " search engine " service, and the response user inquiring returns the advertisement of pretending to be for " Search Results ".The Overture.com website allows advertiser to pay for the advertisement with its website (or targeted website) places the more anterior of the search result list of claiming.If implemented this type of scheme, have only the user to click that advertiser just pays after the advertisement (promptly each price of clicking), advertiser will lack the passion of effective its advertisement of orientation, because directed not good advertisement will can not clicked, so will not need to pay.Therefore, click at every turn that the high advertisement of price appears at or, but not necessarily be converted into advertising distributors' true earning, because spectators do not click near the top.Moreover, the advertisement that spectators will click is in the more below of tabulation, perhaps not in tabulation, so the relevance of advertisement has been taked compromise.
Search engine---such as Google---has made the advertiser can directed its advertisement, thus will present them together with search result web page, to respond the general relevant inquiry of advertisement therewith.The Google system keeps track is advanced statistics (it is an effect parameter) to the point of advertisement and key word.Given search key, the key word targeted ads number that can show is limited, makes problem space can tackle relatively.Though search result web page provides huge chance for advertiser to directed its advertisement of audient more accurately, search result web page only is a part of page views of WWW.
The online content targeted ads
Some online advertising system can be used ad related information and document content relevant information (as notion or theme, proper vector or the like), makes advertisement " coupling " comprise the document (and/or with its evaluate advertisements) of content, such as webpage.The case introduction of this type of online advertising system in:
-U.S. Provisional Application sequence number 60/413,536 (being incorporated herein by reference), title is " METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SERVING RELEVANTADVERTISEMENTS ", on September 24th, 2002 submitted to, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit classify as the inventor;

In general, this type of online advertising system can be used the two correlation information of some candidate's advertisements and certain document, determines the mark of each advertisement with respect to the document.This mark can be used to judge whether that therewith document presents advertisement (being also referred to as qualification judges) explicitly, and/or determine the association attributes (as screen position, size or the like) of one or more advertisements that document therewith presents explicitly.The judgement of this mark for example also is used for one or more effect parameter (as click-through rate, conversion ratio, user gradation or the like) of (1) this advertisement, (2) the associated gray relevant quality information of this advertisement, one or more in the associated pricing information of (3) this advertisement (as the ceiling price of each result (as each click, each conversion, each impression or the like)).
Improve the demand of online content targeted ads
Given document such as webpage, can be associated with many different notions or theme.But in general, ask the user of certain document generally speaking may pay close attention to a related subject or notion rather than other themes or notion more.So when presenting advertisement, the advertisement relevant with not too popular theme or notion compared, it can be useful giving preference to the theme of common concern more or the relevant advertisement of notion.Presenting with search result web page under the situation of key word targeted ads, this not too becomes challenge, because often can distinguish its interest according to user's search inquiry.In the document of request, distinguish that user's interest is much more difficult, especially when document has two or more themes or notion.
Summary of the invention

In § 4.2, introduce multiple example embodiment of the present invention now.
§ 4.2 example embodiment
Look back Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B, advertisement marking operation can be used advertising results information.The inventor recognizes, this effect information (as the click-through rate of advertisement) is subjected to often following the tracks of comprehensively and keeps, and spreads all over all documents and all notions.But, use this comprehensive effect information that optimal results may not can be provided in some cases.The present invention can be used for tracking, gathers and use the effect information on document (as webpage), organizer (as the website) and/or the notion rank, improves presenting of content-targeted ads.
The present invention can comprise one or more with in the next stage: (1) user behavior (as clicking) data collection phase, and (2) user behavior data pretreatment stage, (3) are determined or the adjusting stage based on the mark of user behavior data.Below introduce to carry out in these stages the example embodiment of each.Specifically, in § 4.2.2, introduced the demonstration methods and the data structure of collecting user behavior data and this user behavior data of pre-service.Then, in § 4.2.3, introduced the demonstration methods that uses this user behavior data to determine or adjust ad score.The invention is not restricted to the specific embodiment introduced.But, at first introducing the present invention in § 4.2.1 presents environment to content-targeted ads and uses such as 300 and 300 ' the many-side of Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B.
§ 4.2.1 presents in content-targeted advertisement and uses the present invention in the environment
As being appreciated that from following example, the click feedback (or some other user behavior of being followed the tracks of) of document specific (and/or the organizer is specific) can be used to improve content-targeted advertisement and present system, such as the system of being introduced in the above interim and utility patent application of listing and quoting as a reference.Consideration is being managed the weather webpage of different cities as the typical web site of www.wunderground.com.Consider three (3) individual webpages of relevant Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas and state of Wisconsin Hurley weather.
At first, click the quality that feedback can be used for improving advertisement.For example, content-targeted ad system can use boolean " OR " operation, makes the several notion series connection from certain webpage, produces inquiry in view of the above and presents advertisement.Therefore, about Lake Tahoe to the weather webpage on, use these notions of determining, can produce inquiry=" Lake Tahoe OR baromter ORSquaw Vally ".These all are different notions, can draw about air pressure, Lake Tahoe hotel and Squaw mountain valley graspen hire charge.In these cases, might be difficult to select " appropriate " advertisement (or set of advertisements) to go to present.In addition, the opinion with each webpage, described " appropriate " advertisement (or set of advertisements) is different probably.The webpage relevant to Las Vegas, the most reasonable advertisement may be hotels there.The webpage relevant to state of Wisconsin Hurley, the people who inquires about this place's weather not necessarily goes there probably and needs the hotel, and may more pay close attention to the instrument relevant with weather.The webpage relevant to Lake Tahoe, the user more likely selects the advertisement of cable car ticket and graspen hire charge.Shown in this example, the webpage of three similar may have different " clicking response ", is used for uncorrelated theme or notion.Advertising results parameter (as click-through rate (CTR)) is useful, and can be by keeping at each URL.The present invention can use this information, with the advertisement of selecting " better " and more paying close attention to, depends on the webpage at place and the information of using other people to click.
Click " correctly " auction that feedback also can be used for the characteristic of advertisement of location advertising/enhancing.For example, ad system can use the location advertising on search inquiry information (as key word) CTR (abbreviating " search CTR " as) the auction search results web page.But this is not relevant with content CTR especially.For example, be key word " barometer " if the user searching for, its search CTR just may be very high.But, under the situation of content-targeted ads system,, unlikely produce any click if be presented on the weather webpage of Las Vegas with the advertisement of barometer notion orientation.Directed and/or with the hotel notion with the advertisement of real estate notion orientation, if be presented on the weather webpage of this Las Vegas, then more may produce click.Therefore, the search CTR information that comes in handy during location advertising on the auction search results page may useless (as the price (CPC) for the estimated price (ECPM) of determining per thousand impression and each click) under the situation of location advertising on the auction content page.Use the CTR statistics of every URL, the present invention can be used to each advertisement (or advertisement group) to determine better CTR.
Clicking feedback also can be used for from instantaneous advertisement (or advertisement group) extrapolation effect information.It is instantaneous that advertiser, advertisement and/or advertisement group can be considered as, because they can reduce its budget, can determine to withdraw from and promptly finish its commercial activity etc.But, the click feedback information of the Bally hotel of Las Vegas or the advertisement that webpage presents of MGM Grand, can (perhaps with lower power) be applied to share other advertisements of similar characteristics (as having similar notion or notion orientation), when determining whether to present this advertisement with this webpage.The present invention can be used for being extrapolated to new advertisement and demonstration (the triggering same concept) " being correlated with " advertisement with clicking the advertisement of feedback information from previous click, with the advertisement inventory of compensation reduction.
Fig. 4 is the bubble formula figure of first embodiment of the invention 400 in such as the environment of Fig. 3 A.Situation as environment 300 among Fig. 3 A, advertisement marking operation 440 can be used the document relevance information 420 of document 410, and, determine a plurality of advertisements (or ad identifier) and associated ad score 455 to each advertisement correlation information 434 in one or more advertisements 432.Ad score 455 can be restricted to (with absolute and/or relative criterion) and it is believed that related person, and can sort 450.These ad score 455 can be used by advertisement qualification decision operation 460 and/or advertisement location/reinforcing property application operating 470 then.To specific document, can use advertising effect data 480 in the multiple operation shown in the phantom.Do not show some operations among the figure with each document, each organizer and/or collection of each notion and/or summarize route updates advertised effect data.No matter under any circumstance, indicated as table 480, by each document, to in many advertisements (or advertisement group) 482 each, can tracking advertising effectiveness information 484 (as click-through rate, conversion ratio etc.) and the essential part of this effect information (as impression count, select counting, transform counting etc.) (not shown).For example, as showing among Fig. 4, document 410 can related with table 480 (as using document identifier 412).To certain given document,, also can determine and store average advertisement (or average advertisement group) effect 484 for whole advertisements (or advertisement group) 482.
The present invention can carry out one or more that operate described in the phantom.These operations can be used the specific advertisement of document (or advertisement group) effect information 480.Candidate's set of advertisements extended operation 490 can be used for advertisement (or the advertisement group) effect information 480 of using document specific at least, increases the number of " relevant " or " qualified " advertisement.Ad score adjustment operation 491 can be used for advertisement (or the advertisement group) effect information 480 of using document specific at least, and the ad score of determining 455 is adjusted.Advertising results information adjustment operation 493 can be used for advertisement (or the advertisement group) effect information 480 of using document specific at least, advertising results information 436 is carried out (temporarily) adjust (perhaps replacement or in conjunction with advertising results information 436).At last, effect parameter estimates that (extrapolation) operation 496 can be used for the effect information 484 of filling and/or adjusting and additional advertisement (or advertisement group).The demonstration methods of carrying out these operations will be introduced in the back.
Fig. 5 is the bubble formula figure of second embodiment of the invention 500 in such as the environment of Fig. 3 A.Situation as environment among Fig. 3 300, advertisement marking operation 540 can be used the document relevance information 520 of document 510, and, determine a plurality of advertisements (or ad identifier) and associated ad score 555 to each advertisement correlation information 534 in one or more advertisements 532.Ad score 555 can be restricted to (with absolute and/or relative criterion) and it is believed that related person, and can sort 550.These ad score 555 can be used by advertisement qualification decision operation 560 and/or advertisement location/reinforcing property application operating 570 then.To specific document or organizer (as the website), can use the advertisement effectiveness data 584 of advertisement (or advertisement group) 582 and/or the effect data 588 of orientating function 587 in the multiple operation shown in the phantom.
Do not show some operations among the figure with each document, each organizer and/or collection of each notion and/or summarize route updates advertised effect data.No matter under any circumstance, indicated as table 580, by each organizer, to in many advertisements (or advertisement group) 582 each, can follow the tracks of essential part (as impression count, the select counting etc.) (not shown) of advertisement (or advertisement group) effect information 584 (as click-through rate, conversion ratio etc.) and this effect information.Equally, indicated as table 586, by each organizer,, can follow the tracks of the essential part (not shown) of advertisement (or advertisement group) effect information 588 and this effect information in many orientating functions 587 each.For example, as showing among Fig. 5, the organizer 514 of document 510 can be related with table 580 and 586.To certain given organizer,, also can determine and store average advertisement (or advertisement group) effect 584,588 for whole advertisements (or advertisement group) 582,587.
The present invention can carry out one or more that operate described in the phantom.These operations can be used the specific advertisement of organizer (or advertisement group) effect information 580 and/or the specific orientating function advertising results information 586 of organizer.(, do not indicate by the use of some operation to this information 580 and 586 in order to simplify accompanying drawing.) candidate's set of advertisements extended operation 590 can be used for advertisement (or the advertisement group) effect information 580 of using the organizer specific at least, increases the number of " relevant " or " qualified " advertisement.Ad score adjustment operation 591 can be used for advertisement (or the advertisement group) effect information 580 of using the organizer specific at least, and the ad score of determining 555 is adjusted.Advertising results information adjustment operation 593 can be used for advertisement (or the advertisement group) effect information 580 of using the organizer specific at least, advertising results information 536 is carried out (temporarily) adjust (perhaps replacement or in conjunction with advertising results information 536).The specific advertisement marking operation 594 of document/organizer can be used to select suitable marking function and/or adjust marking function component and/or the parameter of being used by advertisement marking operation 540 595.For example, different marking function may be used different advertisement directional technology (as based on key word, based on notion, based on document concepts, based on organizer's notion etc.) or different from the advertisement directional technology with various weights combinations.At last, effect parameter estimates that (extrapolation) operation 596 can be used for the effect information 584 of filling and/or adjusting and additional advertisement (or advertisement group).The demonstration methods of carrying out these operations will be introduced in the back.
As understanding from above argumentation, considered before advertisement marking, during or the specific effect information (as advertisement, advertisement group, orientating function etc.) of document used afterwards, can use multiple operation according to the invention.。
For example, Fig. 6 has showed ad score adjustment operation 691 (look back respectively as 491 and Fig. 5 of Fig. 4 591), and they use the specific advertising results information 680 of documents, from the adjusted mark 699 of initial score 655 generations.This initial score 655 may be to use (common) advertising results information 636, document information 620 and other advertising message (as directed information, pricing information, advertiser's quality information etc.) 632 before to produce by advertisement marking operation 640.Therefore, Fig. 6 has showed the use of the advertising results information that advertisement marking back document is specific.
Fig. 7 showed advertising results mixing (adjustment) operation 793 (look back respectively Fig. 4 493 and Fig. 5 593), they use the specific advertising results information 780 of document, adjust (common) advertising results information 736, with the advertising results information 798 after the generation mixing (promptly adjusting).Advertisement marking operation 740 can be used the advertising results information 798 of this mixing, and other advertising messages 732 and document information 720, to produce ad score 750.Therefore, Fig. 7 has showed the use of the advertising results information that the preceding document of advertisement marking is specific.
Fig. 8 has showed the use of the orientating function effect information of marking selection/adjustment 894 pairs of documents of operation specific (or the organizer is specific), to select the parameter 895 of marking function and/or adjustment marking function.Selected marking function and/or marking functional parameter and advertising message 832 and document information 820 are used in advertisement marking operation 840 then, produce ad score 850.Therefore, Fig. 8 has showed the use of the orientating function effect information that (as document, organizer etc.) during the advertisement marking are specific.
Though the specific effect information of reference documents has been introduced above some operations, this effect information also can be specific to certain document combination (, document cluster specific as the organizer be specific etc.).In addition, though introduced above some operations, also can use the effect information of certain advertisement combination (as the advertisement group) with reference to advertising results information.
§ 4.2.2 storage also gathers user behavior data
Fig. 9 is the process flow diagram of demonstration methods 900, collects and total data in mode according to the invention.When each and document presented advertisement explicitly, (square frame 910) can write down the document (and/or organizer's) identifier (as URL), can write down the identifier of this advertisement (and/or advertisement group), and can write down impression information.(square frame 920) can accept multiple user behavior information.For example, can accept document identifier, advertisement (or advertisement group) identifier, user behavior information and pricing information (as the price of each selection, each price that transforms).As an alternative or as a supplement, also can accept organizer's identifier, advertisement (or advertisement group) identifier, user behavior information and pricing information.As an alternative or as a supplement, also can accept organizer's identifier, orientating function (or some orientating functions), user behavior information and pricing information.Can accept continuously (as when it occurs) or (as with batch mode) incrementally accepts this user behavior information.(square frame 930) can be according to the information of accepting and writing down, more a New count and/or a statistics then.(square frame 940) can use some countings that information is carried out threshold process.(square frame 950) can use the data degree of confidence certain measure and adjust (as level and smooth) data.(square frame 960) can store the counting and/or the statistics of these renewals then.Document identifier (as URL) or organizer's identifier (as homepage URL) can be used as the counting stored and/or the search key (square frame 960) of statistics.
Later with reference to square frame 910, the present invention can use the off line process that the record of user behavior is gathered (as using front-end web servers, such as the Google webserver), and by each URL, each domain information records statistics.For example, can collect all clicks and the sample of advertising impression (as twice of every day).This data are hereinafter referred to as " record data of decoding every day ".
Later with reference to square frame 920 and 930, to the mapping of AdGroup, can produce the total data structure according to above data and AdGroupCreativeId.Following data structure to the contents advertising system that breaks away from the AdGroup granularity of great use, Here it is it as the reason that gathers the unit.Other to gather unit (as AdGroupCreativeId or similar units) also be possible, following data structure can corresponding modify." numimprs " is meant the number of impression hereinafter, and " numclicks " is meant that the user selects the number of times of (as clicking), and " avgcpc " is meant each selection average price of (as clicking), and " avgctr " is meant average selection (advancing as point) rate.
(1)URL:->{AdGroup,numimprs,numclicks,avgcpc}+avgctr
(2)Host:->{AdGroup,numimprs,numclicks,avgcpc}+aVgctr
(3)Host:->{targeting-feature,numimprs,numclicks,avgcpc}+aVgctr
(4)AdGroup:->{numimprs，numclicks，avgcpc}+avgctr
In order to produce above-mentioned data structure, the present invention can gather the record data of decoding the every day of last K days (as 2 months), and keeps numimprs〉threshold_num_imprs or numclicks〉all keyword messages of threshold_num_clicks.Also can produce and store average effect information.For example, can be to the advertisement group of all (a) each documents; (b) each organizer's advertisement group and (c) each organizer's orientating function determine the average user behavior.
Later with reference to square frame 940, this total is the example of " counting+threshold process " problem, and some inlets are arranged in the long-tail.In other words,, the counter of all URL/AdGroup can be kept, and the some counters that do not reach threshold value in gathering can be discarded in typical case.Because this can be considered as is typical iceberg inquiry, therefore the present invention can use known technology (referring to as paper M.Fang, N.Shivakumar, H.Garcia-Molina, R.Motwani, J.Ullman; " Computing Iceberg Queries Efficiently; " 24thInternational Conference on Very Large Databases, (August24-27,1998) (being incorporated herein by reference)) carry out threshold process as early as possible.
Later with reference to square frame 950, improvement embodiment of the present invention can adopt data smoothing." degree of confidence " of click statistics is to different advertisements and URL can great changes have taken place.For example, advertisement X can obtain 200 times and click from 1000 impression, and advertisement Y obtains 1 click from 5 impression.Though two kinds of advertisements have identical CTR, the level of confidence of advertisement X statistic is higher than advertisement Y.In order to reflect this degree of confidence parameter, the present invention can be to the described CTR value of direction " smoothly " near average contents advertising CTR, as shown in the formula:
Level and smooth CTR=(clicking number+1)/(the basic CTR in impression number+1/) also has the different modes of level and smooth described CTR value.A kind of alternative method is to use following formula:
Level and smooth CTR=CTR* degree of confidence+basic CTR* (1-degree of confidence)
Wherein degree of confidence is set according to the impression number.Degree of confidence also can be the function of this other characteristic of data, such as the life-span of data sample.
Except the option of statistic data structure is clicked in above-mentioned reservation, also have many diverse ways, collect and store the click statistic in mode according to the invention.Can be in the whole time cycle statistics collection amount.As an alternative, also can be with the mode statistics collection amount and the loading of increment.Statistic can be stored hereof and is loaded among the internal memory when operation.As an alternative or as a supplement, they can be stored in the database and retrieval when operation.Though what introduce is the off line mechanism of regularly calculating feedback, also can onlinely in real time carry out this feedback calculation.
By the agency of record with gather the exemplary teachings of user behavior data, to produce 580,586 data structure such as 480 and Fig. 5 of Fig. 4, below will in § 4.2.3, introduce several different methods, and can use one or more of these data structures in mode according to the invention.
§ 4.2.3 uses the user behavior data of being stored to determine and/or the adjustment ad score
The expansion of § 4.2.3.1 candidate advertising aggregator
Figure 10 is the process flow diagram of demonstration methods 1000, expands the set of candidate's advertisement (looking back as operation 490 and 590) in mode according to the invention.(square frame 1010) accepts document identifier (as URL).(square frame 1020) uses the user behavior data storing/gather, for the document is determined the advertisement (or advertisement group) (as K, the scope of K can from 0 to 500 in one embodiment), that effect is best of first predetermined number.(square frame 1030) determines candidate's advertising aggregator at last, comprises advertisement described first predetermined number, that effect is best (or advertisement group) at least.This candidate's advertising aggregator can be included in the advertisement that will determine in the normal process.Though do not show whether the original collection of advertisement is expanded, and/or the number of advertisements K of expansion may depend on the absolute and/or relative effect of primary advertising set.
As understanding from above-mentioned, this method of the present invention qualified advertisement that presents that allows to be associated with given document (or for given organizer) not necessarily has good especially comprehensive effect (as spreading all over all documents), and is still but effective really to given document.
In an example embodiment of the present invention, to each URL, additional K the highest AdGroup of CTR after the AdGroup candidate that normal marking mechanism obtains.Accomplish that this point can use following data structure: URL:-〉{ AdGroup, numimprs, numclicks, avgcpe}+avgctr.
§ 4.2.3.2 ad score adjustment technology
§ 4.2.3.2.1 ad score is adjusted
Figure 11 is the process flow diagram of demonstration methods 1100, adjusts ad score (looking back as operation 491 and 591) in mode according to the invention.(square frame 1110) accepts advertisement (or advertisement group) candidate and mark separately (looking back as 455 and 555) thereof.(square frame 1120) can accept document identifier (as URL) and/or organizer's identifier (site home page URL).1130-1160 is indicated as circulation, and each advertisement of accepting (or advertisement group) candidate has been carried out some actions.More particularly, (square frame 1140) accepts document advertisement specific and/or that the organizer is specific (or advertisement group) effect information.Also can accept to spread all over the average effect information of all advertisements (or advertisement group) to document and/or organizer.Then, (square frame 1150) uses the document effect information of being accepted specific and/or that the organizer is specific (and using average effect information) to adjust advertisement (or advertisement group) mark.After treated whole advertisements (or advertisement group) candidate, (node 1170) leaves method 1100.
As can understand the mark of advertisement from above-mentioned---document of not considering its advertisement and being presented can be the function of advertising results at least---can use the document effect information specific and/or that the organizer is specific of this advertisement to adjust.
In an example embodiment of the present invention, the candidate of AdGroup and notion (as the PHIL cluster) use its on given webpage or organizer's CTR carried out beating again branch.Accomplish that this point can use following data structure URL:-〉{ AdGroup, numimprs, numclicks, avgcpc}+avgctr.
The method 1100 of Figure 11 is application examples after the marking of the specific effect information of document (and/or organizer), (looking back as Fig. 6).
§ 4.2.3.2.2 advertising results are adjusted
Figure 12 is the process flow diagram of demonstration methods 1200, adjusts advertising results information (looking back as operation 493 and 593) in mode according to the invention (temporarily).(square frame 1210) accepts qualified advertisement (or advertisement group) candidate and advertisement (or advertisement group) effect information.(square frame 1220) accepts document identifier (as URL) and/or organizer's identifier.1230-1260 is indicated as circulation, and each advertisement of accepting (or advertisement group) candidate has been carried out some actions.More particularly, (square frame 1240) accepts document advertisement specific and/or that the organizer is specific (or advertisement group) effect information.Also can accept to spread all over the average effect information of all advertisements (or advertisement group) to document and/or organizer.Then, (square frame 1250) uses the document effect information of being accepted specific and/or that the organizer is specific (and using average effect information) to adjust the effect information of advertisement (or advertisement group).After treated whole advertisements (or advertisement group) candidate, (node 1270) leaves method 1200.
As understanding from above-mentioned,---do not consider its advertisement usually presented document---can use the document effect information specific and/or that the organizer is specific of this advertisement to adjust in order to determine the ad score about given document, described advertising effect.The method 1200 of Figure 12 is preceding application examples of the marking of document (and/or organizer) customizing messages (looking back as Fig. 7).
In an example embodiment of the present invention, the selection statistic that webpage, website or contents advertising is specific sends to Advertisement Server, so it can use these these information (as using) in distributing location advertising/characteristic of advertisement when determining ad score.Accomplish that this point can use following one or more data structures:
URL:->{AdGroup,numimprs,numclicks,avgcpc}+avgctr,
Host:->{AdGroup,numimprs,numclicks,avgcpc}+avgctr,
(AdGroup:->{numimprs,numclicks,avgcpc}+avgctr。
Each AdGroup in the AdGroup tabulation that sends to Advertisement Server adds described selection statistic with can meeting the present invention.If URL level statistic exists, the present invention just can use them.Otherwise the present invention can use organizer's level (as site home page URL level) statistic, and described AdGroup statistic is across all contents advertising character, or is the average A dCTR of described contents advertising under preferable case not too.
The specific advertisement marking function of § 4.2.3.2.3 document/organizer is determined
Figure 13 A has showed demonstration methods 1300, selects the specific marking function of advertisement (or organizer) (looking back as operation 594) in mode according to the invention.(square frame 1305) accepts document (or organizer) identifier.(square frame 1310) determines the best marking function of (described document has been presented advertisement) effect (looking back the information 586 as Fig. 5).(square frame 1315) uses determined marking function that one or more advertisements are given a mark then, and (node 1320) leaves method 1300 again.
Figure 13 B is the process flow diagram of demonstration methods 1350, carries out document advertisement marking specific or that the organizer is specific (looking back as operation 594) in mode according to the invention.Note, can use certain function to determine ad score.This function can comprise variable (as notion, key word, pricing information, effect information, similarity measurement and/or advertiser's quality information etc.) and constant (as be used for to as described in variable provide weight, make variable be increased to the numeral of index idempotent).
1355 accept document identifier (as URL) and/or organizer's identifier.1360-1375 is indicated as circulation, and each component/parameter of advertisement marking function has all been carried out some actions.More particularly, (square frame 1365) to given component/parameter accept document specific/the specific effect information of organizer.Also can accept to spread all over all parameter/components, to described document and/or organizer's average effect information.Then (square frame 1370) use the document of this acceptance specific/the specific effect information (and average effect information of being accepted) of organizer is adjusted at the importance of component/parameter in the marking.After treated one tangential component/parameter, leave method 1350 (node 1380).
The Demonstration Application of this feature of the present invention is provided now.Except other features, position and the time in one day can both use when supposing targeted ads.Further hypothesis is being current with particular webpage, and the advertisement of use location orientation is than the good advertising effect of using the time orientation in a day.In this case, when determining the advertisement that will present with this particular webpage, the weight of distributing to the orientating function location components is greater than the time component in the orientating function one day.
Note, among Figure 13 A among method 1300 and Figure 13 B the multiple aspect of method 1350 can be used in combination respectively.
As can understanding from above-mentioned, this aspect of the present invention is allowed and is used effect relevant with marking function and/or its component, that document (and/or organizer) is specific (effect that it may be more specific than relevant with given advertisement, document and/or organizer is more general).Therefore, for example for the webpage that relates to classification " automobile " and " Rolls Royce ", relate to the advertisement that effect that the advertisement of classification " deluxe real estate " has may be better than relating to " automobile ".Therefore, in the time that the document will being presented, can correspondingly adjust " automobile " and " deluxe real estate " corresponding weight.As another example, the effect of using the directed advertisement that is presented of organizer's association (as notion) to have may be better than using the directed advertisement that is presented of document associations (as notion), and the effect that the latter has only may be better than the advertisement by effect and pricing information orientation.This may affect and use which marking function, perhaps in final mark from the difference how weighting of mark that function draws of giving a mark.
In an example embodiment of the present invention, for certain URL (as default content, upper strata URL, URL key word), to this organizer and orientating function given the click statistic, just can from the possible space of orientating function, select concrete orientating function.Accomplish that this point can use following data structure: Host:-〉{ targeting-function.numimprs.numclicks.avgcpc}+avgctr.
The method of Figure 13 A and Figure 13 B is the example (look back as Fig. 8) of profile (and/or organizer) information specific during the marking.
§ 4.2.3.3 is based on the advertising results estimation/extrapolation of notion
Figure 14 is the process flow diagram of demonstration methods 1400, estimates and/or adjusts advertising results information in mode according to the invention.Document concepts (and/or organizer's notion) is accepted or extracted to (square frame 1405).1410-1465 is indicated as circulation, and each notion of accepting or extracting has been carried out some actions.More particularly, (square frame 1415) determines conceptual dependency first advertising aggregator.Then, 1420-1430 is indicated as circulation, to each conceptual dependency advertisement of determining, and specific (and/or the organizer the is specific) effect information of (square frame 1425) inquiry document.Then, (decision block 1435) judges whether to exist any advertisement and is not defined as conceptual dependency, yet specific (and/or the organizer is specific) of document is effective.Can use relative or absolute effect to determine effective.If exist, (square frame 1440) determines second set of advertisement, comprises described first set and other effective advertisements of advertisement, and method 1400 proceeds to square frame 1445 again.Yet if there is no any advertisement is not the conceptual dependency document, and specific (and/or the organizer is specific) is effective, and method 1400 just directly proceeds to square frame 1445.(square frame 1445) uses the conceptual dependency advertising effect to determine the notion effect.1450-1460 is indicated as circulation, to each advertisement of determining, if specific document (and/or organizer) is not had any effect information (perhaps as an alternative or as a supplement, to each advertisement of determining, if it is little that effect information amount statistics goes up, and/or in addition with all advertisements of described conceptual dependency), (square frame 1455) uses the notion effect of estimating, upgrades each this advertising effect information.Can use the specific effect of document (and/or organizer) that falls into advertisement in the described notion, determine estimated notion effect.In case after treated all advertisements and the notion, (node 1470) leaves method 1400.
Effect parameter estimates that (extrapolation) operation 496,596 can be based on notion.Because advertisement (or advertisement group) and/or advertiser can be instantaneous, so these operations are useful.In this case, for given document, for given advertisement (or advertisement group) even a large amount of user behavior datas is not impossible on the statistics collection, also may be very difficult.Owing to compare with the number of advertisement with document (identifying as its URL), the number of the user behavior of being followed the tracks of is less relatively, so user behavior (click) statistic matrix may be quite sparse.The click and the impression of some advertisement are considerably less, and most of advertisements do not have statistic at all.In order to use limited data point effectively, if do not have user behavior data or considerably less for document (or organizer), the present invention can result of use parameter estimation (extrapolation) operation 496,596 fill user behavior (click) statistic of advertisements.496,596 these operations can use notion as bridge, from some advertisement to other advertizing statistics.
Figure 15 is a synoptic diagram, has showed the operational instances of method among Figure 14.Consider document 1510, its URL is http://www.webshots.com/g/tr.html.Suppose document 1510 has been extracted notion C1, C2 and C31520.Use the notion 1520 of these extractions can produce some contents relevant advertisement A1, A2 ..., A9 (look back as Figure 14 square frame 1415).The present invention can use the URL of document 1510, the specific click statistical form of inquiry document.Use this table, the present invention can be used among advertisement A1, A4, A5, the A8 (each is all described with the thick line circle) each find is clicked statistic, and advertisement A2, A3, A6, A7, does not click statistic (looking back the square frame 1425 as Figure 14) when A9 is initial.
According to clicking statistical form, judge the CTR height of advertisement A10, even it is not at count-〉concepts-〉first leg of ads coupling returns.The described set of advertisement (or advertisement group) candidate can expand to and comprise advertisement A10 (looking back the square frame 1440 as Figure 14).
At least use click statistic and advertisement-notion connectedness with described conceptual dependency advertisement then, can estimate the click statistic (looking back square frame 1445) of each notion Ci as Figure 14.As among Figure 15 shown in the short dash line, the click statistic of notion C1 can be the function of the click statistic of advertisement A1 and A5, the click statistic of notion C2 can be the function of the click statistic of advertisement A4 and A5, and the click statistic of notion C3 can be the function of the click statistic of advertisement A8 and A10.In an example embodiment of the present invention, the click statistic of each notion Ci can be determined as follows:
clicks(Ci)=sum_Aj{clicks(Aj)*P(Ci|Aj)}
imprs(Ci)=sum_Aj{imprs(Aj)*P(Ci|Aj)}
ctr(Ci)=clicks(Ci)/imprs(Ci)
The probability of notion Ci when P in the formula (Ci|Aj) is given advertisement Aj.For example, the CTR of A8 and A10 is high, their also very relevant with notion C3 (as according to the PHIL cluster analysis).So the CTR estimated result that notion C3 obtains is also high.
As among Figure 15 shown in the long dotted line, the statistic from some notions can be propagated back to other advertisements (going up few advertisement as there being click data or click data statistics) in a similar manner then.Therefore, also high with the available CTR estimated result of advertisement of the high conceptual dependency of CTR, and with the available CTR estimated result of advertisement also low (looking back square frame 1455) of the low conceptual dependency of CTR as Figure 14.Therefore for example, because notion C2 and the C3 relevant with advertisement A7 has high relatively CTR estimated result, so give its high relatively CTR of 5%.Otherwise, because the notion C1 relevant with advertisement A3 have low relatively CTR estimated result, so give its low relatively CTR of 0.008%.
According to following hypothesis: if given notional some advertisement has realized good (or poor) effect to certain given document (or organizer), these notional other advertisements also have the effect of good relatively (or poor) probably so, so be the possibility of being clicked now bigger (little) with described given document (or organizer), the present invention can carry out the propagation of this click statistic between advertisement and notion thereof.When carrying out, can use multiple weighted sum decay factor based on notion additional.
In one embodiment of the invention, can adjust its mark according to the true of notion and advertisement or the CTR that estimates.For example, can use following formula to determine adjusted mark:
New_score-old_score* (CTR/ basis CTR)
Therefore, can promote advertisement/notion of CTR＞basic CTR, and make the low advertisement of CTR/notion degradation.Can optimize this used in ad system formula according to experimental result.
§ 4.2.3.4 combination operation

(Doc->concept)。For example, the content of webpage can offer the PHIL server, and it sends it back the tabulation of conform to cluster and startup.(in one embodiment,, then do not return advertisement if this page classifications is passiveness or pornographic.)
2. notion can be given a mark again.For example, can use the cluster CTR estimated result that conforms to of calculating, adjust the mark of the described cluster that conforms to according to the click statistic of clicking advertisement.
3. described then notion is used for determining the advertisement (Concept-〉ads) of conceptual dependency.
For example, the described cluster that conforms to can be used to retrieve the tabulation of advertisement candidate of conforming to.
4. advertisement predetermined number (K), that CTR is the highest can add the initial sets of candidate's advertisement.
5. can use then advertising message (as targeting criteria, login page content and/or advertisement text) meet as described in the tolerance of document (as webpage) contents level, determine the middle mark (using PHIL or metagrammar) of candidate's advertisement group.
6. use the CTR of its real/estimation of calculating then, adjust the mark of described advertisement according to the click statistic of described advertisement cluster estimation.
7. last, the advertisement that mark is the highest can send to certain facility (as ad mixer), makes up the content of described advertisement and described document.For example, can select the highest advertisement group of mark and send to described ad mixer.
The present invention can filtering classifies candidate's advertisement of rival's advertisement as.In addition, when only presenting the advertisement of household safe, can block porno advertisement.
