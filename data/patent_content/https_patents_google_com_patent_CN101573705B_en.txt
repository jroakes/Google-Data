Below will be about the method that is used for the analyzing medium material data shown in Figure 2 to media material analyzer 100 and comprise sectionaliser 110 and the operation of its assembly of article compositor 120 makes a more detailed description.
The operation of media material analyzer
According to further embodiment, provide a kind of method 200 (Fig. 2) that is used for analyzing from the data of media material.For briefly, 100 pairs of methods 200 of reference medium material analysis device are described, still need not to have a mind to be not limited to the structure of media material analyzer 100.
The piece segmentation
According to feature, in step 210, the piece segmentation that sign is associated with subfield main text in the media material.Fig. 3 shows the example procedure (step 305-320) of the piece segmentation that is used for execution in step 210 in more detail.For briefly, this piece segmented program is described with reference to the example image 410 of the newspaper page shown in Figure 4.In this example, data 105 comprise the pixel data of presentation video 410.Described pixel data is made of the pixel value of the image intensity that is illustrated in particular picture element (pixel) position.Pixel value can be the pixel value of any type, comprises the pixel data of gray scale, colour, scale-of-two or other type, but is not limited thereto.
In circulation 305, the pixel in sectionaliser 110 analysis of image data identifies has the zone that similar pixel value changes complexity.Can analyze all pixels or pixel samples.Sectionaliser 110 from each just analyzed pixel along level and vertical direction analyze pixel value and change.Pixel value changes these similar zones of complexity can comprise the piece segmentation.Particularly, for the zone that covering has the subfield main text of being arranged in the layout on blank or other border, obtain the piece segmentation of main text.
In one example, sectionaliser 110 is carried out texture (texture) method to find out the zone of complexity unanimity in scale-of-two (black the is white) image.For each location of pixels in the image, sectionaliser 110 calculates must be in the horizontal direction (about) see the logarithm that changes n time distance until color in both sides.Text filed will have consistent relatively little value, and blank and other simple region will have higher value.N=1 is set, provides exemplary stroke (run-length) method.In the example of Fig. 4, use n=2 and generation level to stride the piece segmentation (seeing image 420) that the page extends.The level and smooth more zone of the high more generation of the value of n, but also cause the border to be cut off.Repeat described calculating in vertical direction (up and down), and when n=2, produce along vertically extending segmentation of the page (seeing image 430).During leading (dominant) main text (for example title of the main text in the article rather than the page) in seeking article, can be with level added together with vertical calculating and then try to achieve threshold value to obtain final segmented image (seeing coloured image 440).In further example, when seeing the distinguishable region of different big small texts, sectionaliser 110 can begin and carries out the full water method with tolerance and fill (flood-fill) with minimum value.
Data 105 can also comprise the text data that is associated with the view data of media material layout.Optical character identification (OCR) data of the text in the presentation medium material for example, can be provided.As an alternative, media material analyzer 100 can comprise the OCR module (not shown) that produces the OCR data that are associated with the view data or the electronic image data of scanning.
In circulation 315, for OCR text data from image data extraction, sectionaliser 110 with described text data with in step 310, be identified as respective image zone and be associated with similar pixel value variation complexity.Sectionaliser 110 can also identify the size text in the text data, particularly, can identify the main text size that is associated with the subfield main text.By this way, can identify the piece segmentation of text data as the candidate who belongs to article with described main text size.
In further embodiment shown in Figure 5, use circulation 315 ' (step 510-550) to substitute circulation 315.In step 510, sectionaliser 110 is analyzed OCR text data from image data extraction to find out speech.The speech that sectionaliser 110 will find in described text data is mapped in the step 310 to be identified has the initial sets (step 520) that similar pixel value changes the zone of complexity.Size text in the text data in sectionaliser 110 definite described zones, and particularly, can identify the main text size (step 530) that is associated with the subfield main text.Which regional be associated with the subfield main text (step 540) sectionaliser 110 determines.
According to feature, sectionaliser 110 further is associated the final set of subfield main text data with corresponding image-region.For example, be main text in order to determine which text, can carry out the comparison that size text and given tolerance is compared at leading size text.
Above illustrative has described the segmentation that changes based on pixel value but it is not to be intended to the present invention is carried out necessary restriction.Can use other fragmentation technique known now or that research and develop in future to come data 105 are carried out segmentation.
Article is synthetic
According to feature, in step 220, article compositor 120 determines that based on language statistics information and layout transitional information which candidate blocks segmentation belongs to identical article.This combination of language statistics and layout conversion can improve precision, and this precision exceeds any precision that obtains separately.
Language statistics
In one embodiment, step 220 comprises program 600 (step 610-630).Language statistics analyzer 130 executive routines 600.The candidate blocks segmentation that 600 pairs of sectionalisers 110 of program are exported is to calculating the coupling score value.Calculate described coupling score value according to a minute value function.For particular text block (preferably having more than 30 speech), how frequent calculate each speech has in described with respect to whole collected works.If institute's predicate constitutes percent X of the speech in the article and percent Y of the speech in the collected works, the definite formula that then uses is log ((X/Y)+1).For each piece, the vector of the value of obtaining.Use these vectors draw piece between the cosine distance, provide scope from 1 (exact match) to 0 the score value of (do not have speech overlapping).
In step 620, language statistics analyzer 130 based on the coupling score value that is calculated and training data 135 calculated candidate piece segmentations to belonging to the language statistics Making by Probability Sets of identical article.This training data 135 comprises from training set and/or user to import the probability data of acquisition.If can obtain identical media material (for the example of Fig. 4), then can utilize this identical media material to carry out such training such as the view data of 1000 pages of other issue newspapers.Otherwise the training that is used for the language statistics purpose can utilize different media material to carry out.
For example, in step 620, given between branch value function (in step 610 calculate), language statistics analyzer 130 calculates the probability of two any pieces from identical article.If visit the large-scale article set of described language, then described article is divided into the piece of all size.Use from identical article to as sure example, and use from discrete article to as negating example.If there are not such data, then can instead use to pick out clearly to be the piece of identical article (identical sectional area) through the document self of OCR, and almost clear and definite different piece (the different page/issues, or away from).Given pair of block with specific word length and cosine distance is considered similar example and is found out the ratio of sure example.According to the quantity of data point, this is utilized kernel smoother (kernel smoother) or local the recurrence improved.
At last, in step 630, language statistics analyzer 130 belongs to the piece of identical article based on determined probability sign.For example, if probability is higher than 50%, then the piece segmentation can be designated and belongs to identical article.In an important relatively example of precision,, probability belongs to identical article if above 90%, then being designated described segmentation.These are illustrative.Can use other probability threshold value.
This can be automatic or automanual (partly supervising learning tasks), its more given text block, the output pair of block is from the probability of identical article.
It is illustrative that coupling is divided the use of value function and cosine distance and word frequency, is not to be intended to limit the invention.Can use other correlation techniques now known and research and development in the future to determine the correlativity of two text block or it is marked.
The layout conversion
According to feature, can in training mode or operational mode, carry out the layout transformational analysis.In one embodiment, step 220 comprises training mode program 700 and operational mode program 900.Layout transformational analysis device 140 can be operated in training mode or operational mode.In training mode, 140 pairs of aggregate data from a plurality of samples of media material of layout transformational analysis device are operated to make up layout conversion sorter 145.In operational mode, the data application layout conversion sorter 145 in the media material layout of 140 pairs of positive analysis of layout transformational analysis device.
Training mode
Layout transformational analysis device 140 is carried out training mode program 700.The media material layout of 140 pairs of vertical transition of layout transformational analysis device (Fig. 7 A, step 710-760) and level conversion (Fig. 7 B, step 770-796) is analyzed.
Vertical transition
In step 710, it is right that layout transformational analysis device 140 is found out the piece segmentation of vertically aligned main text, makes a piece be positioned on another piece, do not have main text piece (Fig. 7 A) between vertically aligned.It is right to find out these vertically aligned segmentation the piece segmentation of being exported from sectionaliser 110.For example, in the newspaper page shown in Figure 8,810,830 pairs of piece segmentations can be identified as perpendicular alignmnet.
The vertically aligned piece segmentation of sign in layout between insertion project (step 720).Then based in the insertion project any one or a plurality of to described segmentation to classify (step 730).For example, under the situation of vertically aligned segmentation 810,830, insertion project 820 is horizontal line, line of text, underscore, horizontal line, line of text, horizontal line.So a kind can be the piece that is separated by the particular conversion feature of these projects, such as line of text and the horizontal line of the line of text of horizontal line, 16pt, underscore, horizontal line, 24pt.
Next, layout transformational analysis device 140 is that converting characteristic set (step 740) is calculated in the piece segmentation of being classified.For example, under the situation of piece segmentation 810,830 with insertion project 820, the set of the converting characteristic that calculated can be that piece total vertical separated, block alignment how good, the line thickness with respect to the piece width, text font size are arranged, with respect to the line of text width of piece width etc.In the example of a newspaper topology data, can be used to the piece segmentation to (for example, the main text zone of approximately identical average size text and self location, be also called upper mass and bottom piece) the tabulation of vertical transition feature comprise: the mean breadth of (1) upper mass and bottom piece, (2) vertical range between upper mass and the bottom piece, (3) when between when having non-main text piece as poor between the width of upper mass and bottom piece of the part of mean breadth, (4) leftward space of upper mass and bottom piece (extent), (5) rightward space of upper mass and bottom piece, (6) top of upper mass and bottom piece, (7) bottom of upper mass and bottom piece, (8) distance between the upper and lower of upper mass and bottom piece, (9) left side of upper mass and bottom piece and the distance between the right side, (10) the average font size in these upper mass and the bottom piece, and the maximum font size in (11) these upper mass and the bottom piece.
These exemplary vertical converting characteristics are illustrative, are not to be intended to limit the invention.The sorter 145 needed complexities of wishing precision and media material of training are depended in the definite set of the converting characteristic that calculates.Comparatively simple layout can need to calculate less converting characteristic.The complicated relative important use with precision of layout guarantees to calculate bigger converting characteristic set possibly.The definite set of the feature of calculating can stand artificial or change automatically.Artificial variation can be based on carrying out from user's input by user interface 160.
In step 750, layout transformational analysis device 140 determines that the piece segmentation is in the probability in the identical article.For the set of each type in the step 730 and vertical transition feature, there are a plurality of vertical transition features of summarizing by Serial No..And, according to the output of language statistics analyzer 130, know the described probability that is converted to the part of article.
Can form the layout conversion sorter 145 (step 760) such as decision tree now automatically, so that make the possibility maximization that segmentation is divided to piece when segmentation is not in the identical article.This sorter 145 can be used to whether each vertical transition decision is merged two vertically aligned.By this way, vertically aligned segmentation is maximum subfield the analysis of level conversion is carried out in set and preparation now.Should can in the gathering that can obtain data, carry out based on the training of vertical transition feature formation layout conversion sorter 145, such as a plurality of segmentations from one or more images.In one example, can from such as same period not newspaper 100 or more carry out training to form layout conversion sorter 145 on the large-scale image collection the multipage face, it is not to be intended to limit the invention.
Level conversion
In step 770, it is right that layout transformational analysis device 140 is found out the piece segmentation of main text of horizontal aligument, makes a piece be in the next door of another piece, do not have main text piece (Fig. 7 B) between the piece of horizontal aligument.The piece segmentation that can find out these horizontal aliguments the piece segmentation of being exported from sectionaliser 110 is right.For example, in the newspaper page shown in Figure 8,840,850 pairs of piece segmentations can be identified as horizontal aligument.
Sign in the layout the piece segmentation of horizontal aligument between insertion project (step 780).Then based in the insertion project any one or a plurality of to described segmentation to classify (step 790).For example, under the situation of the piece segmentation 840,850 of horizontal aligument, the insertion project is blank.Then, the piece that the particular conversion feature that kind can be these projects is separated, all blank in this way of described particular conversion feature and width thereof.
Next, layout transformational analysis device 140 is that converting characteristic set (step 792) is calculated in the piece segmentation of being classified.For example, under the situation with its piece segmentation 840,850 of inserting project, the converting characteristic set of being calculated can be that the aggregate level of blank and width thereof, piece is separated, block alignment have how good etc.In the example of a newspaper topology data, the piece segmentation that can be used to approximately identical average size text and be positioned at next door each other to or the main text zone level conversion feature list of (being also called left side block and right side block) being comprised: the distance between the right side edge of (1) right side block and the left side edge of left side block, (2) perpendicular alignmnet on the top of left side block and right side block, (3) horizontal range between left side block and the right side block, poor and (5) between the width of (4) two left side blocks and right side block and the relation of the non-main text of closing on.Can comprise with this relation of the non-main text converting characteristic that closes on and for example to find out, and be that each non-main text piece that closes on calculates: one the vertical range farthest in non-main text piece to two left side block and the right side block near the non-main text piece on the top of left side block with near the piece on right side block top, nearest one vertical range of non-main text piece to two left side block and right side block, the leftward space of the non-main text piece of process left side block, the rightward space of the non-main text piece of process right side block, the distance at the average place on non-main text piece to two left side block and right side block top, the distance at the average place of non-main text piece to two left side block and right side block bottom, the width of non-main text piece, the height of non-main text piece, the speech number of the font size of non-main text piece and non-main text piece.
These exemplary horizontal converting characteristics are illustrative, are not to be intended to limit the invention.The sorter 145 needed complexities of wishing precision and media material of training are depended in the definite set of the converting characteristic that calculates.Comparatively simple layout can need to calculate less converting characteristic.The relative important use with precision of more complicated layout guarantees to calculate bigger converting characteristic set possibly.The definite set of the feature of calculating can stand artificial or change automatically.Artificial variation can be based on carrying out from user's input by user interface 160.
In step 794, layout transformational analysis device 140 determines that the piece segmentation is in the probability in the identical article.For the set of each type in the step 790 and level conversion feature, there are a plurality of vertical transition features of summarizing by Serial No..And, according to the output of language statistics analyzer 130, know the described probability that is converted to the part of article.Can form the layout conversion sorter 145 (step 796) such as decision tree now automatically, so that make the possibility maximization that segmentation is divided to piece when segmentation is not in the identical article.Whether this sorter 145 can be used to the decision of each level conversion the poly-group of the piece of two horizontal aliguments in identical article.By this way, the maximum subfield of piece segmentation is gathered group by further level when they belong to identical article.Should can in the gathering that can obtain data, carry out based on the training of level conversion feature formation layout conversion sorter 145, such as a plurality of segmentations from one or more images.In one example, can such as from same period not newspaper 100 or more carry out training to form layout conversion sorter 145 on the large-scale image collection the multipage face, it is not to be intended to limit the invention.
An advantage is that this layout transformational analysis can replenish to improve the precision of just synthetic article the language statistics analysis.Even use means that based on the vertical and level conversion feature sorter that segmentation is sorted out to piece 145 in the layout piece segmentation is to seeming under the independent situation based on language statistics under the not related situation, but with some very relevant right pattern fits, then combiner 150 still can be with described to being placed as the part of same text.By this way, the combination of language statistics and layout conversion can improve precision, and described precision exceeds wherein any precision that obtains separately.
How relevant as the above mentioned, used word frequency to move to have with two text block of assessment in some examples the inventor, media material routine analyzer 200 produces about 90% precision when providing two pieces whether from identical article.Media material routine analyzer 200 closes in conjunction with these predictions in large-scale page set, so that find out correct rule usually.For example, if two pieces have incoherent text usually when they are separated by the Helvetica text of 16-20pt, then this may be article separator (separator).
Because this method has formed the estimation of language statistics probability and has generated the Making by Probability Sets of approval based on the layout converting characteristic, therefore can repeat this process when analyzing new data, wherein each run adds some more information potentially to improve the sorter precision.
In case train and made up training classifier 145 in data gathering, it just can be made by the layout transformational analysis device of operating with operational mode 140 and be used for synthesizing article.

Further use-continue article
In the gathering of many pages, use language statistics and can be used to solve some other problems so that find the technology of joint rule.According to an embodiment, can carry out the piece segmentation in the article that further analysis determines to continue between the newspaper page.Use the language statistics and the layout transitional information that continues to carry out the analysis whether article on the different pages partly belongs to the identical article that continues.
As shown in figure 13, media material analyzer 1300 comprises the assembly of aforesaid media material analyzer 100, and further comprises the article compositor 1320 with continue the language statistics analyzer 1330 and the topological analysis's device 1340 that continues.As shown in figure 13, the continue language statistics analyzer 1330 and the topological analysis's device 1340 that continues can be included in the article compositor 1320.This is illustrative, is not to be intended to limit the invention.For example, the language statistics that the continues analyzer 1330 and the topological analysis's device 1340 that continues can be discrete or combination provide, perhaps can be added to the part that language statistics analyzer 130 and layout are changeed analyzer 140 respectively.The language statistics that the continues analyzer 1330 and the topological analysis's device 1340 that continues can be realized with software, firmware, hardware or its combination in any.For clear, the function of continue the language statistics analyzer 1330 and the topological analysis's device 1340 that continues is described discretely, but it can be combined in a module or equipment, perhaps strides a plurality of modules or equipment and distributes.
The data that 1300 pairs of expressions of media material analyzer have the media material of layout are analyzed, and comprise striding one or more articles that continue that a plurality of pages extend.Media material analyzer 1300 comprises controller 102, sectionaliser 110 and article compositor 1320.As mentioned above, the piece segmentation that is associated with subfield main text in the media material page of sectionaliser 110 sign.The piece segmentation that article compositor 1320 determines that based on the language statistics information and the transitional information that continues which identifies belongs to strides the article that continues that a plurality of pages in the described media material extend.
In one embodiment, article compositor 1320 comprises aforesaid language statistics analyzer 130, layout transformational analysis device 140 and combiner 150, and further comprises continue the layout transformational analysis device 1340 and the language statistics analyzer 1330 that continues.The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 is used decision trees 1345 and is picked out one or more converting characteristics that continue, and the described converting characteristic that continues indicates last and first segmentation of the candidate article part on the different pages to be in probability in the identical article that continues.The language statistics that continues analyzer 1330 is the different article part computational language statistical informations on the different pages, and determines the probability that first in candidate article part and last piece segmentation have the article part that continues based on the language statistics information of being calculated.By this way, article compositor 1320 can synthesize the continue article of striding a plurality of pages based on first with probability that last piece segmentation belongs to the identical article that continues with the language statistics of being calculated according to the layout converting characteristic of being analyzed that continues.Here the probability that is calculated can comprise be/not or Boolean indication, the numerical range representing probability or put the numerical value of letter data or represent probability or put letter data, but be not limited thereto.
To further be described with reference to the operation of the program 1400 (step 1402-1436) shown in the figure 14A-E to continue the layout transformational analysis device 1340 and the language statistics analyzer 1330 that continues.As above described sectionaliser 110 has identified piece segmentation in the data 105 with reference to figure 1-10, and language statistics analyzer 130, layout transformational analysis device 140 and combiner 150 have made up the described segmentation start program 1400 afterwards in the article on the page of media material.
In step 1402, the continue last piece segmentation of article part correlation connection of the layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 sign and candidate.For example, the layout transformational analysis device 1340 that continues can be considered the piece segmentation as last piece segmentation in the article of all subfield pieces and sign.The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 then identifies the following one or more projects (step 1404) of described last piece segmentation.Such project can be the speech that appears at last EOB (such as " continued (follow-up) ", " cont. (follow-up) ", " see (referring to) " or " go to (forwarding to) ") or layout project (such as arrow or lines, drawing frame).
The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 is sorted out (step 1406) based at least one feature in the one or more projects that identified to described last piece segmentation.The feature of described project can comprise project self or the characteristic relevant with layout with described project.For example, the feature that is used for speech " continued " can be font size, font type, interval or the placement of word " continued " and/or simply presenting of word " continued " self.These features are sorted out the piece that can help to have common trait to be placed in separately the group.For example, the piece that its below has the drawing frame can be sorted in the group, and the piece that its below has word " continued " is placed in another group.
The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 is then used decision tree and is picked out one or more converting characteristics (step 1408) that continue, and the described last piece segmentation of converting characteristic indication that continues is in the probability in the article that continues.According to specified arrangement, the converting characteristic that continues can be to have those features that the article high probability partly that continues on another page is associated with last piece.For example, the converting characteristic that continues in exemplary layout can be with the word of No. 12, italic " continued on (and ... continue) " and the feature that is associated of No. 12 arrow.These features and example are illustrative, are not to be intended to limit the invention.As conspicuous for those skilled in the art, can use further feature in the various combinations according to the layout of being analyzed and training data.
Last piece (step 1402-1408) has been learnt or identified to layout transformational analysis device 1340 in case continue, and the language statistics that continues analyzer 1330 is just from the search article part of the page subsequently (Figure 14 B, step 1410) of the page at last piece place.The language statistics that continues analyzer 1330 is the article part computational language statistical information (step 1412) from first page the page in succession of the described article that continues, and determines that based on the information of being calculated of language statistics in succession the last piece segmentation in candidate's the continuous article part has continuous article probability (step 1414) partly.For example, described language statistics information can be word frequency information, and connected speech statistical analyzer 1330 can based on the text in the last piece segmentation and in succession the word frequency in the text in the part of the article on the page calculate the coupling score value.Then can determine that last piece segmentation has the probability of the article part that continues based on described coupling score value.Can also use training data 1335 to determine probability from the coupling score value.
Carry out similar analysis whether learn piece be first and whether may be in the article part that continues.Shown in Figure 14 C, the layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 sign and candidate in the page in succession first segmentation (step 1416) that article is associated that continue.For example, the layout transformational analysis device 1340 that continues can consider that all subfield pieces and sign are as the piece segmentation of first segmentation in the article.One or more projects (step 1418) on described first segmentation of the layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 signs.Such project can be speech (such as " continued from (continuing certainly ...) " or " cont.from (continuing certainly ...) ") or the layout project (such as arrow, lines or other mark) that appears at first top.
The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 is then sorted out (step 1420) based on one or more institutes at least one feature of identification item purpose to first segmentation.The feature of described project can comprise project self or the characteristic relevant with layout with described project.For example, the feature that is used for speech " continued " can be font size, font type, interval or the placement of word " continued " and/or simply presenting of word " continued " self.These features are sorted out the piece that can help to have common trait to be placed in separately the group.For example, the piece that its top has the drawing frame can be sorted in the group, and the piece that its top has word " continued " is placed in another group.
The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 is used decision tree 1345 and is picked out one or more converting characteristics (step 1422) that continue, and described first segmentation of converting characteristic indication that continue is in the probability in the article that continues.The layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 then can determine that described first segmentation is in the probability (step 1424) in the article that continues based on applied decision tree 1345.According to specified arrangement, such converting characteristic that continues can be those features that are associated with first article high probability partly that continues that has on the previous page.For example, the converting characteristic that continues in exemplary layout can be the feature that is associated with the word " continued from " of No. 12, italic.These features and example are illustrative, are not to be intended to limit the invention.As conspicuous for those skilled in the art, can use further feature in the various combinations according to the layout of being analyzed and training data.
First (step 1416-1424) learnt or identified to layout transformational analysis device 1340 in case continue, and the language statistics that continues analyzer 1330 is just from the previous page search article part (Figure 14 D, step 1426) of the page at first place.The language statistics that continues analyzer 1330 is the article part computational language statistical information (step 1428) from the previous page of described first place page, and determines first probability (step 1430) that is segmented into the article part that continues in candidate's the article part that continues based on the language statistics information of the previous page that is calculated.For example, described language statistics information can be word frequency information, and the language statistics analyzer 1330 that continues can calculate the coupling score value based on the word frequency in the text in the article part on the text in first segmentation and the previous page.Then can determine first probability that is segmented into the article part that continues based on described coupling score value.Can also use training data to determine probability from the coupling score value.
At last, in case, just can learn whether between the part of the article on the separator page, to continue for candidate's the article that continues has identified last piece and first.As described in Figure 14 E, the layout that continues transformational analysis device 1340 identifies the candidate of last and first segmentation to (step 1432), for described last and first segmentation to determining the converting characteristic set (step 1434) that continues, and use decision tree 1345 and determine that based on the set of the determined converting characteristic that continues the candidate of last and first segmentation is to belonging to the probability (step 1436) of the identical article that continues of striding the page in the media material.The set of the described converting characteristic that continues can by with partly proceed to the relevant attribute of another article part from an article and expand.For example, consider last speech, the speech below the last piece or figure, first speech in first in the last piece segmentation, the speech or the figure of first top, and consider overlapping speech between the various piece.When forming decision tree 1345, if can find out exist comprise " continued " and have with second portion in first three speech in first paragraph of a speech that is complementary below bold text, then this may be correctly continuing of specified arrangement.
Conspicuous as those skilled in the art to this description, can be by using training data 1335 or not using training data 1335 to move the above embodiment of media material analyzer 1300.Do not use training data 1335, continuing decision-making can be only based on specific that is considered.For example, media material analyzer 1300 can take out the last piece in certain article, and finds out the begin block in certain article on the different pages, makes the maximization of language score value.This works sometimes, but it is easy to make the mistake relatively, and reason is to exist many possible answers, and correct option may not have the best text matches in these paragraphs.
In order to improve precision, media material analyzer 1300 can be operated or can operate in training mode to obtain training data 1335 or it is replenished with the benefit of predetermined training data 1335.Described training is used above with reference to the described method of the operational mode among Figure 14 in essence, and with the result combinations on many pages so that create more accurate decision tree or sorter 1345.Therefore there be regional right on the different pages more than, the description of conversion, and the example of described right language score value from one to another (feature of being mentioned).These score values are combined (or even low-down score value), can extract trend and it is used for making up decision tree or sorter 1345.For example, can find that the speech that wherein has specified quantitative between the piece is overlapping if exist under first and have speech " cont ' d " among little triangle or first, then these must be effectively to continue.
Because the right correspondence of each piece of test can be unnecessarily complicated, therefore in one example this is divided into three tasks for efficient.
Alternatively, exist three to divide or test:
Will (1) given be continued?
Is (2) given to continue?
(3) given this piece of two types is right, are they identical articles?
Attempt to carry out simultaneously it and mean that sorter 1345 not only needs to understand (3), and (1) and (2) must be attached in two half ways.Single classifier methods is possible, but above enforcement is safer and be easier to test.
