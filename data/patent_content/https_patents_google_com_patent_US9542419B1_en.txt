- FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified system for performing similarity searching of persons using various kinds of information, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- a similarity search engine 110 is adapted or programmed to perform similarity searches of images, and of persons in particular.
- a query image input 102 is used as a basis of comparison for finding other persons that have an appearance that is programmatically determined to be similar.
- search criteria may be generated to correspond to the query image input 102 .
- the query image input 102 may correspond to an image of a face of a person that is to serve as the basis for comparison. For example, a user of a social network site may use his own image as input, for comparison and identification of other persons who share similarities.
- the engine 110 may use query image input 102 to generate result images 114 , comprising a set of images that are programmatically determined to be similar to the face of the query image input 102 .
- result images 114 comprising a set of images that are programmatically determined to be similar to the face of the query image input 102 .
- An embodiment of FIG. 1 assumes engine 110 includes or accesses a collection of images 120 in order to generate or identify the result images 114 .
- the query image input 102 is used to identify classifications or types of visual characteristics such as hair or eye color, or facial type.
- the query image input 102 is based on recognition signatures, which can substantially uniquely identify persons.
- a feature vector that corresponds to a signature of a face may be compared against, for example, an index or library of other signatures for other faces.
- Vector distance algorithms may be used to compare one face against another face.
- one or more embodiments provide for use of computer vision and analysis to detect additional visual features from the face of the query image input 102 .
- face similarity or “facial similarity” refer the act of retrieving a set of pictures of “result” faces which look similar to a given “query” face picture.
- face similarity relies on visual features extracted from the query face, matching those features to similar features of the result faces.
- Those features can include skin tone, hair color, hair length, or a face model such as those used for face recognition (PCA (Principal Component Analysis), or LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)) as described in U.S.
- PCA Principal Component Analysis
- LDA Linear Discriminant Analysis
- eye color can be obtained by applying eye detection, followed by looking at color profiles around the detected eye.
- hair color and length can be obtained by applying segmentation first. Segmentation groups face regions into three classes: (i) skin, (ii) hair, and (iii) background.
- a hair color may be obtained by determining color features such as color histogram, or dominant color descriptor on the pixels that are assigned as part of hair within segmentation.
- the hair length can be obtained by looking at the span of the pixels that are assigned as part of the hair by segmentation.
- another facial feature that may be used by engine 110 to perform similarity searching may correspond to a type of face shape contained by the face of the query image input 102 .
- the height and the width of a face, as well as a generalization or quantitative description of an overall head-shape (elongated or round shape) may provide another basis for identifying results 114 .
- This information can be extracted using various means.
- segmentation output is used in analyzing the query image input 102 .
- the width and height can be determined using the span of the pixels that are assigned as skin during segmentation.
- a classifier-based approach can be used.
- a training set of elongated and round faces is collected.
- a learning algorithm such as Adaboost, or support vector classifier or nearest neighbor classifier can be used to learn how to classify a face as elongated or round based on the training set.
- a segmentation output can be used to determine the skin color.
- the skin color can be obtained by getting color features such as color histogram, or dominant color descriptor on the pixels that are assigned as part of skin within segmentation.
- another facial feature that may be used by engine 110 to perform similarity searching is a classification corresponding to whether the person of the query image input 102 is wearing eyeglasses.
- a classifier-based approach can be used.
- a training set of faces with and without glasses is collected.
- a learning algorithm such as Adaboost, or support vector classifier or nearest neighbor classifier can be used to learn how to classify a face as with or without glasses based on the training set.
- another facial feature that may be used by engine 110 to perform similarity searching is a classification corresponding to whether the person of the query image input 102 has facial hair, such as a mustache or beard.
- Numerous algorithms may be used to detect the facial fair.
- key points are detected in the face. Such key points may correspond to the tip of the nose, or the mouth corners. Then, the pixels between the mouth and the nose are analyzed. The color and the texture of this region can be compared to an obviously skin region, such as the forehead, nose, or cheeks. The difference between the color and texture is an indication of a mustache.
- a classifier-based approach can be used. A training set of faces with and without facial hair is collected. As an example, a learning algorithm such as Adaboost, or support vector classifier or nearest neighbor classifier can be used to learn how to classify a face as with or without facial hair based on the training set.
- Embodiments described herein further recognize that certain classifications about a person's appearance may also be inferred from other sources of information, rather than the query image input 102 .
- biographic information may yield clues to classifications about a person's appearance, and these clues may enable similarity searching to be performed in a manner that a viewer deems to be more reliable. For example, programmatic analysis of images of faces may be unreliable in determining gender.
- Embodiments described herein recognize that visual features are not always representative of classifications that people would consider important when viewing similarity searches. Specifically, the use of visual features in similarity searching may not always be reliable in determining ethnicity, age classification, or gender. For example, on a social network, a person seeking a similarity match to a male is not interested in seeing a female. As another example, similarity matching amongst persons of different ethnicity may not result in matches that the human eye would consider similar. Moreover, the accuracy of some inferences of classification may be hindered if the query image input 102 has low quality or contains ambiguous cues (presence of sunglasses, hat, etc.)
- biographical information 104 may have the role of forming a criteria or parameter by which images are filtered when determining whether images from collection 120 or sufficiently similar.
- biographical information 114 may be determined from, for example, user-input and/or the context of environment in which the image is placed. For example, on a social networking or match making site, the biographical information 114 may have been provided by the user when his or her account or profile were established. In such embodiments, the biographical information may be retrieved from the text of the person's profile.
- biographical information 104 may take several forms, some of which can be used independently or in conjunction with each other to create additional features to assist in enhancing similarity matching algorithms.
- the biographical information 104 and its relationship to the face of the query image input 102 can be obtained through a combination of factors or processes, such as through the use of a face recognition system which associates the set of recognized faces to identities known to the system.
- elements of an identity can incorporate one or more of the following: (i) the first name of the person; (ii) the last name of the person; (iii) external biographical data about the person: gender, age, ethnicity, place of living, hair color, style and length; (iv) a nickname for that person (“cutechick”, “dad”); (v) a set of example face images for that person, possibly tagged with the date at which the picture was taken; (vi) the person's relationship to a social network comprising his/her friends and/or family members; (vii) a geographically labeled photo album belonging to that person; and (viii) a location obtained from the IP address of the computer that he/she uses or uploads his photographs to a server.
- biographical information 104 may be used by the engine 110 in order to perform similarity searching of a face and/or person in the query image input 102 .
- the resulting images 114 may be determined by using the biographical information to either (i) filter an initial set of resulting images that are identified from similarity searching the collection of images 120 , or (ii) by filtering the collection of images 120 before performing the similarity searching.
- biographical information 114 may be used to rank images of result 114 , and/or to weight parameters representing visual similarities (e.g. hair color, face type) when the similarity search is performed.
- FIG. 2 illustrates components for use in enabling similarity searches of persons, according to one or more embodiments of the invention.
- a system such as described with an embodiment of FIG. 2 may be used to provide some or all of the functionality of engine 110 , as well as to provide data (query image input 102 and collection 120 ) used by engine 110 .
- a system 200 may include modules that correspond to analysis 215 , characteristic determination 230 , and comparison 245 .
- the analysis module 215 may include sub-modules or components of feature extraction 210 and text/metadata extraction 220 .
- the input for system 200 may include records 202 that are associated with individuals. For each person, record(s) 202 may include a set of one or more images and text and/or metadata.
- the input records 202 may be used as part of a backend process to build the collection of records 120 ( FIG. 1 ) that is searched. Additionally, input records 202 may correspond to the query input image 102 ( FIG. 1 ).
- System 200 may process records 202 as query input image 102 on either a backend process or as a front end process (e.g. on-the-fly).
- system 200 outputs a profile data set 230 for individual persons.
- the profile data sets 230 are searched for similarities against the query input image 102 .
- the profile data set 230 may include (i) image data that represents the image of the record 202 , such as images in the form of features as extracted by the extraction module 210 ; (ii) classifications of gender, ethnicity, age or other biographical classification; and (iii) optionally an identity of the person that is the subject of the record.
- the profile data set 230 of a given person or face is created and/or retrieved as the query image input 102 when similarities are desired for that face or person.
- the comparison module 245 may perform the operations of comparing the profile data set 230 for the query image input 102 (whether retrieved from data store or determined on the fly) against the profile data sets 230 of images in the collection 120 .
- various parameters may be used as criteria in determining whether individual records or images of collection 120 satisfy a similarity threshold for the query image input 102 .
- One or more embodiments also rank any images in the collection 120 that satisfy the similarity threshold, meaning those images that are deemed most similar may rank higher than other images that satisfy the threshold but are less similar. In one implementation, higher ranked images are displayed first or otherwise more prominently.
- the input record 202 may correspond to one or more of an image, a collection of images, labels or tags provided with the image, and/or profile information provided in connection with a context or source of that image.
- system 200 may be implemented for individuals who upload or submit a collection of personal images as part of a photo-sharing site.
- the images of the input record 202 have not previously been processed or recognized, and feature extraction 210 identifies image data 212 that corresponds to features of the person or persons in the images of the records 202 .
- the images of the input records 202 may be associated with, for example, previously determined vector signatures that are then identified and used by system 200 .
- the text/metadata extraction 220 identifies and/or extracts text or metadata information that includes biographical information 222 .
- embodiments recognize that not all extracted text/metadata may be biographical information 222 .
- extracted words or phrases may initially be viewed as candidates for determining subsequent classifications.
- the biographical information 222 along with image data 212 (if present), is used by the characteristic determination 230 to generate the profile data set 240 for a person.
- One or more embodiments provide that the characteristic determination 230 determines gender, ethnicity, and/or age classification.
- gender component 232 makes a gender determination for a subject of a person in a given input record 202 using a combination of biographical information 222 and image data 212 .
- the biographical information 222 used may correspond to a first name of the person, or a nickname derived from label or text in other content (e.g. name of person who created a file or is named on a blog of a social network).
- certain names or labels may be associated with one gender or another (e.g. “Mark” for male, “Emily” for female).
- Other biographical data may also be used (e.g. the image of the person is labeled “I'm pregnant”).
- the image data 212 may correspond to pixels or image elements of the image in the input record 202 being subjected to a gender classifier.
- a person provides numerous input images as part of record(s) 202 , and the gender classifier is applied to each face in a set of example faces (that are determined to be of the same person), combined using, for example, a voting scheme.
- the ethnicity component 234 of the characteristic determination 230 may use biographical information 222 to programmatically and/or automatically learn or determine an ethnicity of a person.
- Ethnicity determination may use biographical information such as (i) a combination of the first and last name of that person; (ii) ethnicity of people in the person's social network; (iii) the most frequent geographic location of the person's pictures; (iv) an ethnicity classifier applied to the image data 212 representing each face in an set of example faces, combined for using, for example, a voting scheme.
- the first name and the last name can be used as a whole, or they can be syllables of the first name or the second name.
- the words can be broken into syllables along with position markers: beginning, middle, end of word.
- ethnicity statistics may be collected for each syllable.
- a naive Bayes classifier may be used to come up with a posterior for each ethnicity.
- An age component 232 of the characteristic determination 230 may automatically learn an age classification of a person that is the subject of records 202 , using biographical information corresponding to, for example, (i) the first name or nickname of that person (for example: “dad” implies an adult . . . ); (ii) the age of persons in the person's social network; (iii) the span of image capture dates in an image library provided by that person (for example, if that person has pictures taken 20 years ago, then it implies an adult); and (iv) an age group classifier applied to the image data 212 representing each face in an example set, combined taking into account aging based on the picture timestamps.
- Classifiers that operate on image data 212 to determine gender, ethnicity, and age classification are described in more detail with, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/246,742, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING THE USE OF CAPTURED IMAGES THROUGH RECOGNITION, filed on Oct. 7, 2005; now U.S. Pat. No. 7,519,200.
- One or more embodiments also provide for use of an optimization module 244 that implements one or more optimization functions or processes for use with system 200 .
- the optimization module 230 includes functionality for automatically determining a ‘goodness’ (or degree of suitability for image searching) of an image of a face.
- the optimization module discards images that are deemed unsuitable for the similarity searching. The determination may be made on a so-called goodness measure.
- a goodness measure may quantify clarity, lighting, and pose in determining whether a given image is usable in either the collection 120 ( FIG. 1 ) or as the query image input 102 ( FIG. 1 ).
- a goodness measure can also be made specific to a set of images of a particular person or to a classification of a type of person using learned algorithms.
- the goodness measure may be determined automatically using regression techniques, such as least square fitting to linear and quadratic functions of visual features.
- regression techniques such as least square fitting to linear and quadratic functions of visual features.
- any types of feature vectors can be used for this purpose. For instance, bad/good lighting classifiers, bad/good pose classifiers, face appearance models (PCA, LDA, etc) can all be used to learn a generic goodness metric for each face.
- the optimization module 244 may also be configured to automatically determine an optimal set of visual features to use to drive a similarity search. Such an embodiment recognizes that it is more difficult to find similarity results for an image of a face that, for example, has a non-frontal pose, bad lighting, has the person/face off in the distance, is blurry, or otherwise partially occludes the subject of the image.
- the optimizer may execute functionality for determining which subset of examples in a set of face examples to use to extract features.
- This determination may be based on: (i) the quality of the face pictures, (ii) the distance in time to the query image to ensure that the selected query face is not too dissimilar in terms of age and facial features (such as facial hair or haircut), (iii) a pose, and (iv) lighting variations on a face of an image.
- optimizer 244 may incorporate metrics for programmatically learning a degree of ethnic/demographic relationship between people based on their names. For example, two people with similar names have a better chance of (i) being part of the same ethnic group (some Asian countries have little variability in their last name); (ii) being of the same gender (same first name); (iii) being of similar age (same first name); (iv) being part of the same family (same last name); and (v) being the same person (same first and last name).
- a measure of the degree of closeness between two names which can be based for example on an edit distance, is an additional hint that the faces of these people might be perceived as more similar.
- the optimizer 244 may incorporate these relationships in the profile data sets 240 for subsequent use.
- the characteristic determination may incorporate the functionality described in this paragraph when analyzing the record 202 , either on the backend or front-end and on-the-fly.
- Embodiments recognize that some records 202 incorporate identity information, meaning information (e.g. full name) that uniquely identifies that person. This information is useful for a variety of purposes. However, if identity information is not available for either the query or result images, automatic labeling can be used as a fall back mechanism. Automatic labeling improves the quality of the similarity features, thereby simplifying indexing and improving the result quality, especially for low quality query images.
- identity information meaning information (e.g. full name) that uniquely identifies that person. This information is useful for a variety of purposes.
- identity information is not available for either the query or result images
- Automatic labeling improves the quality of the similarity features, thereby simplifying indexing and improving the result quality, especially for low quality query images.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a method for enabling a similarity search to be performed on an image of a face, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- a method such as described may be implemented using, for example, a system such as described with FIG. 1 or FIG. 2 .
- reference to elements of an embodiment of FIG. 2 is made for purpose of illustrating a suitable component for performing a step or sub-step being described.
- the query input image 102 ( FIG. 1 ) is determined or identified.
- a face in the image is detected, and an identity is established for the face in the image. This identity may be determined either through user-tagging or through a face recognition process (which can be semi-supervised by the user).
- a suitable facial recognition system or process is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/246,742, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING THE USE OF CAPTURED IMAGES THROUGH RECOGNITION, filed on Oct. 7, 2005; now U.S. Pat. No. 7,519,200.
- biographical information for the face of the query image input is determined or retrieved.
- the text/metadata extraction module 220 may be used to determine the biographical information on-the-fly.
- the query image input 102 may already have that information associated with it. From the biographical information available for that face, one or more embodiments provide that the person's identity is optionally established (if not already known). Additionally, as described with an embodiment of FIG. 2 , a gender, ethnicity and age classification of a person in the query image input 102 is determined.
- the output of engine 110 may be restricted to provide results which share at least some (if not all) similar biographical information 222 .
- Step 330 provides that (i) images depicting a face of a person with the same identity as the query image input 102 are identified, (ii) from the identified images, a subset (‘Set A’) of faces which are the best query faces are identified.
- the similarity search is performed using the subset of images of the same person.
- a good subset could be a set of frontal shots which are close in time to the original query image, or faces with high ‘goodness’ score as described in the earlier section.
- Step 340 provides that a similarity search is performed with the subset of images of the query image input 102 , taking into account the biographical information 222 associated with the person or identify of the input.
- a result set of faces is identified, where persons of the result set share some or all (or have similar) biographical information 222 . These persons may also have faces that are deemed to be similar to that of the query image input 102 .
- the visual similarity may be performed using, for example, a PCA model in combination with models for facial hair, glasses, hair color and haircut.
- a weighted distance combination can be used using these features.
- the weighting itself can be learnt using statistical classification techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
- LDA Linear Discriminant Analysis
- the retrieval can be performed using a nearest neighbor algorithm which selects a subset of the faces expected to be the closest to the target set of faces, followed by shortest distance search within that subset.
- the outcome of this process may correspond to the result images 114 , or otherwise a list of result faces which are most similar to the query face.
- one or more embodiments provide for a method such as described to further determine an identity of persons shown in the result image set 114 . If a person has multiple images in the result set 114 , it is more likely that the two persons (i.e. the person of the query image input 102 and the person having multiple images depicted in the result set 144 ) or the same person.
- one or more embodiments provide for reordering images in the result set 114 based on a combination of the similarity distance and the degree of closeness of the names of the people they belong to.
- the name of the person may provide key biographic information 222 for use in the similarity searching.
- one or more embodiments provide finding identities of persons in the result set 114 , then scanning the collection for images of those identified persons sharing the same pose of the face or person of the query image input 102 . Rather than return the original image, the image with the matching pose of the person deemed to be similar is returned. This image may look more similar to the user, given the matching pose.
- a human team may review the results of visual features as extracted or determined by system 200 .
- the results of ethnicity can be reviewed and corrected by human beings.
- U.S. Patent Application No. 60/864,781 describes a manual editor interface (“manual enrichment”) that presents recognition or image analysis images to editors in cascade (numerous panels shown at once, with each panel containing the subject image and the determined information about that image). The editor or human is offered to uncheck the determined result if it is not correct. For example, if an Asian person is marked white as a result of recognition performed on the face of the image, the editor may simply uncheck “Caucasian” in a panel where the Asian person is shown.
- One or more embodiments provide for a fast editor user-interface. For instance, the user-interface may group images of persons in one cascade or sheet, that are all deemed blonde and male. A dozen or tens of images may be listed. The editor simply marks (or unmarks) the image of the person that is not blonde and male.
- one or more embodiments provide for a data flow that includes establishing an identify of a given face in the query image input 102 .
- the identity may be determined either through user tagging or through a face recognition process (which can be semi-supervised by the user).
- computer vision algorithms may be executed on the test images to calculate the visual features, such as gender, ethnicity, hair color, hair length, eye color, with/without eye glasses.
- An editor interface may be provided to review the results. As described above, the results may be reviewed in groups or clusters.
- one or more embodiments provide for establishing the person's identity (if not already available), gender, and age characteristics.
- a good subset could be a set of frontal shots which are close in time to the original query image, or faces with high ‘goodness’ score as described in the earlier section.
- one or more embodiments determine, from within the set of faces which share similar biographical data as well as visual features, which faces are the closest based on visual features.
- the determination may be made through, for example, a PCA model in combination with models for facial hair, glasses, hair color and haircut.
- a weighted distance combination can be used using these features.
- the weighting itself can be learnt using statistical classification techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
- LDA Linear Discriminant Analysis
- the retrieval can be performed using a nearest neighbor algorithm which selects a subset of the faces expected to be the closest to the target set of faces, followed by shortest distance search within that subset. The outcome of this process is a list of result faces which are most similar to the query face.
- any of the embodiments described with FIG. 1 thru FIG. 3 may be performed by computers, including general purpose computers, connected (to a network or the Internet) computers, or combinations of client-server computers and/or peer-to-peer terminals.
- system 200 is provided on a server, and accessed by a user through a web interface.
- alternatives are possible, including use of standalone computers to provide system 200 .
- biographical image in the form of text can be determined from the contents of the image. For example, an image of a person may show text imprint on a shirt or on an associated sign in the image. This text may be detected, then recognized and used to decipher clues about classifications (e.g. gender, ethnicity and age classification) of the person.
- classifications e.g. gender, ethnicity and age classification
- U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/246,742 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING THE USE OF CAPTURED IMAGES THROUGH RECOGNITION, filed on Oct. 7, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,519,200; describes techniques for detecting, recognizing and using such text from images of persons.
