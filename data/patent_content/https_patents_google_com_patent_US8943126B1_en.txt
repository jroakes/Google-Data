- a method in a general aspect, includes receiving, at a server, a dynamic current geographic location of a mobile computing device, and in response accumulating in a buffer, over a first accumulation time period, individual push notifications relevant to the dynamic current location of the mobile computing device.
- the method further includes sending a limited number of individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device over a computer network.

- Push technology is a style of Internet-based communication where a request for a given transmission of information is initiated by a publisher or a central server. Push technology may be contrasted with pull technology, where a request for transmission of information is initiated by a receiver or client.
- HTTP server push also known as HTTP streaming
- HTTP server push is a way to send data from a web server to a web browser. HTTP server push can be achieved by several techniques. In some cases, a web server does not terminate a connection after response data has been served to a client. The web server leaves the connection open so that if an event is received, it can immediately be sent to one or multiple clients. Otherwise, the data would have to be queued until the client's next request is received.
- Push notifications may use a constantly-open IP connection to provide notifications from servers (e.g., notifications related to third party web applications or browser extensions) to client computing devices (e.g., smart phones used by users who have installed the web applications or browser extensions).
- the notifications may, for example, include sounds, images, or custom text alerts.
- a location-aware service may be an application that delivers location-based information to a subscriber of the service.
- the location-aware service may, for example, be accessed by mobile phone, PDA, pager, laptop, desktop of other device.
- the location-aware service may be a part of a larger location-based solution framework that includes, for example, GPS-enabled mobile computing services (e.g., communication and computation via mobile devices), location-enabling services (e.g., services for user-locating), and other location-aware services (e.g., IP-based applications).
- the location-based information in the notifications may be information that is relevant to the current geographic location of the mobile computing device.
- the relevant information may, for example, relate to nearby places of interest (e.g., a bus route, a neighborhood pizza parlor, a grocery store, etc.).
- the current geographic location (hereinafter interchangeably “current location”) of a mobile computing device may be determined using an on-board location sensor (e.g., a GPS receiver in communication with GPS satellites) or by other location-determining techniques (e.g., Cellular tower triangulation (Cell ID), or Wi-Fi (802.11) access point triangulation) that use other resources.
- an on-board location sensor e.g., a GPS receiver in communication with GPS satellites
- location-determining techniques e.g., Cell ID), or Wi-Fi (802.11) access point triangulation
- Cell ID Cellular tower triangulation
- Wi-Fi 802.11 access point triangulation
- the cell tower information may include cell tower-identifying data (e.g., a cell tower code, an area code, and an international dialing code, etc.), which allows determination of the location of the cell tower using published maps of cell towers and, thus, determination, at least approximately, of the current location of the phone.
- cell tower-identifying data e.g., a cell tower code, an area code, and an international dialing code, etc.
- the mobile computing device may be associated with a device-based or network-based “location-awareness” or “location-determining” software solution to process one or more of Wi-Fi, cell, GPS signals, ISP data and other data, to determine device location (e.g., a latitude/longitude reading of device location).
- the location-determining software solution may be integrated with device OS or other device or network applications. Location-based notifications that may be provided by the location-aware services of interest here may be responsive to the device location provided by the location-determining software solution associated with the mobile computing device.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system 10 that may be used by a location-aware service to provide location-based notifications at a controlled rate to a mobile computing device user, in accordance with the principles of the disclosure herein.
- System 10 includes a “notifications” push server 100 coupled to a notifications database 120 , which may be a store of location-based notifications that may have been previously prepared, for example, for different geographic areas covered by location-aware service 15 .
- Notifications push server 100 may host a location-aware service 15 , which may be made available to the user of mobile computing device 140 .
- the user may subscribe to location-aware service 15 using, for example, a unique mobile device ID or other identifier, to receive location-based notifications.
- Notifications push server 100 may be communicatively linked to a mobile computing device 140 and configured to send push location-based notifications for location-aware service 15 to mobile computing device 140 , for example, over a computer network 130 .
- the location-based notifications which are sent by notifications push server 100 , may be selected from notifications stored in notifications database 120 .
- Notifications push server 100 may be configured, for example, to dynamically send or push location-based notifications specifically to the user of mobile computing device 140 at a controlled rate.
- notifications push server 100 may include a mobile device location receiver 102 , a location-based notifications selector 104 , a notification buffer 106 and a notification transmitter 108 .
- notifications transmitter 108 may be used by location-aware service 15 to send notifications to mobile computing device 140 over computer network 130 .
- Mobile device location receiver 102 may be configured to retrieve or receive device location information and other information associated with mobile device 140 .
- Mobile device location receiver 102 may, for example, be configured to retrieve device location information from a mobile device location-determining solution 150 that may be hosted on mobile computing device 140 or on computer network 130 .
- Mobile device location-determining solution 150 may be configured to process one or more of Wi-Fi, cell, and GPS signals and data from other sources (e.g., ISPs) to determine the current location of mobile computing device 140 .
- FIG. 1 shows, for example, a GPS receiver 141 attached to mobile computing device 140 .
- GPS receiver 141 which may be in communication with a GPS satellite system 142 , may supply GPS signals that mobile device location-determining solution 150 can process to determine a current device location of mobile computing device 140 .
- FIG. 1 also shows, for example, cellular tower 131 and Wi-Fi access points 132 in computer network 130 , which can be used by mobile device location-awareness solution 150 to triangulate the current location of mobile computing device 140 .
- Mobile device location-determining solution 150 may be communicatively linked to server 100 to provide mobile device location receiver 102 with its determination of the current location of mobile computing device 140 .
- location-based notifications selector 104 may be configured to select location-based notifications that are appropriate or relevant to the dynamic current location of mobile computing device 140 as retrieved or received by mobile device location retriever 102 .
- Location-based notifications selector 104 may use pre-established criteria to select the appropriate or relevant notifications from notifications database.
- the criteria may, for example, involve selection based on distance and/or notification type. For example, in the case where the selected notifications relate to nearby places of interest, location-based notifications selector 104 's selection of the notifications may be based on a distance criterion (e.g., nearby places of interest that are within a quarter mile of the current location) and a type criterion (e.g., fine dining restaurants).
- the criteria may be system or user established.
- location-aware service 15 may not immediately send the notifications selected by location-based notifications selector 104 to mobile computing device 140 to avoid, for example, inundating the user of mobile computing device 140 with an overwhelming number of notifications. Instead, location-aware service 15 may limit a number of selected notifications that are sent or control the rate at which the selected notifications are sent to mobile computing device 140 .
- system 10 may be configured to accumulate the selected notifications as they are selected by location-based notifications selector 104 in notifications buffer 106 .
- System 10 may accumulate the selected notifications over a first accumulation time interval, which may be preset (e.g., two minutes). It will be understood that accumulating the selected notifications may involve transferring actual copies of notifications (e.g., from notifications database 120 ) to notifications buffer 106 or simply involve maintaining a list of the selected notifications, which can be later retrieved from notifications database 120 .
- System 10 may rank the notifications accumulated in buffer 106 by relevancy to the current location of mobile device 140 . As the current location of mobile device 140 changes or is updated during the first accumulation time interval, system 10 may dynamically re-rank the accumulated notifications for relevancy to the changed current location of mobile device 140 . At the end of the first accumulation time interval, location-aware service 15 may send only a small number of the most relevant notifications accumulated in notifications buffer 106 to mobile computing device 140 . The number of notifications that are sent may be sufficiently small (e.g., one to two) so that they can be meaningfully perused by the user of mobile computing device 140 . System 10 may utilize notifications transmitter 108 to send the small number of the most relevant notifications to mobile computing device 140 over computer network 130 .
- System 10 may be further configured to clear and reset notifications buffer 106 after the small number of notifications have been sent at the end of the first accumulation time interval.
- System 10 may then begin another round of selecting location-based notifications that are relevant or appropriate to the then current location of mobile computing device 140 as retrieved or received by mobile device location receiver 102 , and accumulating the selected notifications in notifications buffer 106 over a second accumulation time interval.
- System 10 may again select and send a small number of the most relevant accumulated notifications to mobile computing device 140 at the end of the second accumulation time interval in the same manner as the small number of the most relevant notifications sent at the end of the first accumulation time interval.
- System 10 may repeat the process of accumulating selected location-based notifications over one or more accumulation time intervals and pushing a small number of the accumulated location-based notifications to mobile computing device 140 .
- the process may be repeated as long as required by location-aware service 15 or the user of mobile computing device 140 .
- Mobile computing device 140 which is described in the foregoing as a subscriber of location-aware service 15 , may take the form of any of a number of different device types, for example, a personal computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, netbook computer, or a web-enabled phone.

- notifications push server 100 has been described only with respect to elements (e.g., 102 - 108 ) that relate to some functions of location-aware service 15 .
- notifications push server 100 may be a server which also has other functions.
- Notifications push server 100 may, for example, may be a central server including a central processing unit (CPU) 111 , memory 112 , operating system (O/S) 113 , and applications 115 .

- CPU 111 may be any general processor or microprocessor which can execute code (e.g., executable code stored in memory 112 ) to cause system 10 (e.g., components 102 - 108 ) to perform as described above to provide location-based notifications at a controlled rate to a mobile computing device user.
- code e.g., executable code stored in memory 112
- system 10 e.g., components 102 - 108
- a setup process may be used, for example, to allow a user of mobile computing device 140 to establish permissions, policies, and criteria for notifications from location-aware service 15 .
- the setup process may allow the user to opt-in to receive particular types of notifications.
- the setup process may also allow the user to customize the relevancy criteria used by system 10 to select notifications to send to the user. For example, the user may be interested in finding prepared food in a neighborhood and may accordingly use the setup process to establish criteria for system 10 to select notifications with information about restaurants in the neighborhood.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 200 for providing location-based notifications to a mobile computing device user, in accordance with the principles of the disclosure herein.
- Method 200 may be utilized, for example, by a location-aware service (e.g., location-aware service 15 ) to provide location-based information to the mobile computing device user.
- Method 200 may be implemented over a computer network using a computer or server (e.g., notifications push server 100 described above) and utilize notifications for different geographic areas that may have been prepared and made available in one or more databases (e.g., notification database 120 ).
- Method 200 includes accumulating individual push notifications in a buffer at a server in response to receiving a dynamic current geographic location of the mobile computing device ( 210 ), and sending a limited number of the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device ( 220 ).
- the controlled rate which may be dependent at least in part on a rate of change of the dynamic current geographic location of the mobile computing device, may amount to sending the individual push notifications at a rate of no more than about one individual push notification per minute.
- Accumulating individual push notifications in a buffer at the server 210 may include selecting for accumulation notifications from a notifications database that are relevant to the dynamic current geographic location of the mobile computing device ( 212 ). Selecting for accumulation notifications 212 may include selecting individual push notifications having information on sites of interest within a defined geographic area proximate to the dynamic current geographic location of the mobile computing device ( 214 ). The sites of interest may, for example, include one or more of tourist attractions, eating places, and lodgings within the defined geographic area proximate to the dynamic current location of the mobile computing device.
- accumulating individual push notifications in a buffer at the server 210 may include accumulating the individual push notifications over a first accumulation time interval.
- a duration of the first accumulation time interval may be pre-set (e.g., two minutes).
- the first accumulation time interval may be automatically triggered by location-aware service 15 , for example, when the mobile computing device enters a pre-defined geographic region, or upon user request for information related to the geographic area.
- sending a limited number of the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device 220 may include sending the limited number of the individual push notifications at the end or about the end of the first accumulation time interval.
- Sending a limited number of the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device 220 may include sending the individual push notifications at a rate of that is sufficiently low so that the user of the mobile computing device is not inundated or overwhelmed by the notifications and can meaningfully peruse the notifications.
- the controlled rate at which the push notifications are sent may depend on how fast or quickly the current geographic location of the mobile computing device is changing, which may be an indication of how fast or quickly the user is moving through a geographic area.
- Sending a limited number of the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device 220 may include sending the limited number of the individual push notifications at rate, which, for example, is inversely proportional to a rate of change of the dynamic current geographic location of the mobile device. Fewer notifications may be sent out if the mobile device user is moving quickly through the geographic area as the accumulated location-based notifications may become geographically less relevant with changes in the current location of the mobile device user, or because the user may not have time to peruse a large number of the notifications while moving.
- the push notifications may be sent, for example, at a rate of no more than about one to two push notifications every minute.
- sending a limited number of the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device 220 may include assigning priority by relevancy to the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer ( 222 ), and selecting the limited number of individual push notifications to be sent according to their assigned priority ( 224 ). Assigning priority to individual push notifications in the buffer 222 may involve using user- and/or system-established relevancy criteria to prioritize the individual push notifications. The user may, for example, have communicated interest in receiving informative notifications about restaurants serving a particular type of food (e.g., take-out food) or within a certain distance.
- a particular type of food e.g., take-out food
- Method 200 may accordingly assign priority to individual push notifications in the buffer, which provide information relating to fast food outlets and restaurants with take-out food menus, and which are within the certain distance from the current location of the mobile computing device.
- a notification about a restaurant at a center of a geographic area may become less relevant if the current location of the mobile computing device indicates that the user is moving out of the geographic area or moving away from the center.
- method 200 may also include re-prioritizing the individual push notifications accumulated in the buffer for relevancy in response to dynamic changes in the current geographic location of the mobile computing device during the accumulation time interval ( 226 ).
- Method 200 may further include clearing and resetting the buffer after a first accumulation time interval and re-accumulating individual push notifications relevant to the dynamic current location of the mobile computing device for a second accumulation time interval ( 230 ), and again sending a limited number of the accumulated individual push notifications in the buffer at a controlled rate to the mobile computing device 220 as described above.
- the location-aware service (e.g., location-aware service 15 ) may continue utilizing method 200 to iteratively accumulate individual push notifications relevant to the dynamic current location in the buffer and send a limited number of them at a controlled rate as described above.
- the location-aware service may stop the iterative process of sending a limited number of notifications to the user, for example, when the mobile computing device moves outside a pre-defined geographic area of interest, or when the user turns off or otherwise instructs the location-aware service to discontinue the notifications.
- Location-aware or location-based services may use a concept of geo-fence.
- a geo-fence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area.
- the geo-fence may, for example, be dynamically generated (e.g., a radius around a store or point location), or a predefined set of boundaries (e.g., school attendance zones or neighborhood boundaries).
- the geo-fence may be custom digitized.
- a notification may be triggered when a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user enters or exits a geo-fence.
- the triggered notification might contain information about the location of the device.
- the device (or service server) may receive the triggered notification, for example, over the computer network linking the device.
- a method In response to a location-aware mobile computing device crossing into a geo-fenced region, a method involves receiving, at a server, a location-based push notification for each of a multiplicity of relevant places in the geo-fenced region and holding the multiplicity of the location-based push notifications in a buffer for a first predefined holding time period (e.g., a minute or more). The method further involves ranking the multiplicity of the location-based push notifications in the buffer at the server by relevance to a current location of the location-aware mobile computing device, and selecting a most relevant location-based push notification to send to the location-aware mobile computing device at its current location after the first predefined holding time period.
- a first predefined holding time period e.g., a minute or more
- the method may involve re-ranking the multiplicity of the location-based push notifications in the buffer at the server by relevance to the then current location of the location-aware mobile computing device, in response to changes in the current location of the location-aware mobile computing device.
- the method may involve sending only the selected most relevant location-based push notification to the location-aware mobile computing device at its current location.
- the method may also involve clearing and resetting the buffer after sending the selected most relevant location-based push notification to the location-aware mobile computing device, and receiving, at the server, a next set of location-based push notifications relevant to the then current location of the location-aware mobile computing device.
