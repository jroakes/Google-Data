- the advertiser can target advertisements to the videos based on the categories.
- an advertisement is selected by using a data store for
- advertisement presentment information including information that identifies
- the data store for video viewer information is
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, identifying a second video that has been viewed by at least one viewer of the first video may include identifying a second video that has been viewed by more viewers of the first video than other videos that have been viewed by at least one viewer of the first video.
- the advertisement may be a first advertisement
- the data store for video viewer information may be accessed to identify a third video that has been viewed by at least one viewer of the first video.
- the data store for advertisement presentment information may be accessed to identify a second advertisement that has been presented with the third video.
- the first advertisement for presentation with the first video may be identified conditioned upon a determination that the second video has been viewed by more viewers of the first video than the third video.
- a first viewer-strength value may be assigned to the second video where the first viewer-strength value represents a number of viewers who viewed both the second video and the first video.
- a second viewer-strength value may be assigned to the third video where the second viewer-strength value represents a number of viewers who viewed both the third video and the first video.
- the first advertisement may be identified for presentation with the first video based on Ae first viewer-strength value and the second viewer-strength value.
- a first normalizing value may be determined by dividing the number of viewers who viewed both the third video and the first video by the number of viewers who viewed either the third video and the first video.
- a second normalizing value may be determined by dividing the number of viewers who viewed both the second video and the first video by the number of viewers who viewed either the second video and the first video.
- the first advertisement for presentation with the first video may be identified based on a ratio of the second viewer-strength value to the second normalizing value.
- the data store for advertisement presentment information may be accessed to identify an advertisement comprises accessing the data store for advertisement presentation to identify advertisements that has been presented with the second video. Selecting the identified advertisement to be presented with the first video may include selecting one or more of the identified advertisements to be presented with the first video based on a number of available advertising slots associated with the first video. [0009] Accessing the data store for advertisement presentment information to identify an advertisement may include accessing the data store for advertisement presentation to identify advertisements that has been presented with the second video. A value may be associated with each of the identified advertisements, where the value representing a number of times the advertisement has been presented with the second video.
- Selecting the identified advertisement to be presented with the first video may include selecting one or more of the identified advertisements to be presented with the first video based on number of times the advertisement has been presented with the second video.
- An advertisement may be extracted from a third video.
- the advertisement presentment information may be modified to reflect information about the extracted advertisement, which may include matching the extracted advertisement to an advertisement in the advertisement presentment information.
- the first video may be identified to an advertiser associated with selected advertisement, and presentation of the selected advertisement with the first video may be enabled only after the advertiser indicates the selected advertisement is to be presented with the first video.
- a request to select sponsored content to be presented with a first content item including video is received.
- a second content item including video is identified.
- the video included in the second content item has been viewed by at least one viewer of the video included in the first content item.
- Sponsored content that has been presented with the second content item is identified and selected to be presented with the first content item is selected. Implementations may include one or more of the features noted above or any of the features noted below.
- information defining a graph representing relationships between videos is accessed from computer-accessible storage. The graph includes nodes where a node represents a video and one or more of the nodes are associated with one or more advertisements.
- the graph includes edges where an edge is connected to two videos and represents a number of viewers who saw both videos to which the edge is connected.

- FIG. I shows an example of an environment 100 for providing content
- content can include various forms of electronic media.
- content items can include various forms of electronic media. For example,
- the content can include text, audio, video, advertisements, configuration parameters, documents, video files published on the Internet, television programs, podcasts, video
- podcasts live or recorded talk shows, video voicemail, segments of a video conversation, and other distributable resources.
- the environment 100 includes, or is communicably coupled with, an advertisement system 102, a content provider 104, and one or more user devices 106, at
- the advertisement includes at least some of which communicate across a network 108.
- the advertisement includes at least some of which communicate across a network 108.
- system 102 can relate content for presentation with other identified content and provide relevant advertising content ("ad content”) or other relevant content based upon the ad
- the presented content can be provided by the content provider 104 from a
- the ad content can be distributed through the network 108 to one or more user devices 106 before, during, or after
- the advertisement system 102 may be coupled with an ad repository 110.
- the ad repository 1 10 stores advertisements that can be presented with various types of content, including audio and/or video content.
- the advertisement system 102 in some implementations, may also be coupled with an advertisement presentment information repository 112 and/or a video viewer information repository 114.
- the environment 100 may be used to identify relevant advertising content according to a particular selection of a video or audio content item (e.g., one or more segments of video or audio).
- the advertisement system 102 can use information about the number of viewers who viewed both a first and a second video (which may be referred to as a video preference mapping) and store the video preference mappings, for example, within the video viewer information repository 114.
- the video content item may be available through the content provider 104 from within the content repository 116 using a user access identifier (e.g., user identification and password, etc.).
- the content provider 104 could, in this example, track the video content items requested by each user (e.g., within the content repository 116 or another local, external, or remote storage device). Using this information, data can be generated on the number of viewers who requested both a first and a second video. These video pair mappings, anonymous of identity of the individual viewers, can be shared with the advertisement system 102 and stored within the video viewer information repository 114 for use in targeting advertisements. In some implementations, the number of times that a video content item was viewed by a particular (though anonymous) viewer can also be calculated into the video pair mappings data.
- Information regarding the advertisement content associated with the video content items can be stored within the ad presentment information repository 112,
- the ad presentment information repository 112 can include mapping information between individual video content items and one or more advertisement content items associated with the video content item.
- advertisements can be detected within video content items, extracted, and matched to known advertisements and/or advertisers.
- advertisement detection and extraction can be performed using any suitable manual or automatic means, such as by detecting silence and/or blank images that occur before the start of a commercial segment in television broadcasts, matching visual and acoustic representations within a video to detect advertisements that are repeated during the video.
- advertisements can be matched to known advertisements and/or advertisers using manual and/or automatic methods (e.g., using machine comparison of video images, audio track, and/or closed captioning text, video metadata identification, manual identification, audio fingerprinting techniques, etc.).
- An ad extraction module 120 within the advertisement system 102 can extract ads from video content items and match them with the advertisements stored within the ad repository 110.
- the information associating advertisements with videos and the users who have viewed particular videos can be used, in some implementations, to select relevant advertisements from the ad repository 110 for appropriate placement with a video content item or to include with other video content items which share relevance with the video content item mapped to the advertisements.
- an ad selection module 118 can associate ads with a video content item based upon records within the ad presentment information repository 112.
- one or more advertisement items associated with a second video content item can be provided along with a first video content item based upon the likelihood that a viewer of the second video content item would also be interested in viewing the first video content item (e.g., based upon information within the video viewer information repository 114).
- the ad selection module 118 may select one or more advertisements and/or advertisers associated with one or more video content items which are identified as being relevant to the requested video content item.
- the selected advertisements can then be presented with the requested video content item, for example by an ad presentment module 122.
- the relevant advertisements can be placed in proximity to or overlaid with the presented video content item, such as in a banner, sidebar, or frame.
- the ad presentment module 122 can correlate advertisements within or in proximity of the requested video content item.
- the selection of advertisements for presentation with a video content item can be determined, in part, by identifying the video content items most frequently viewed by the same viewers selecting to view the video content item to be presented. For example, a portion of the viewers who viewed a first video containing dog training tips may have also chosen to view a second video containing dog obedience training. If the first video contains advertisements and the second video does not, the second dog obedience training video could be associated with one or more advertisements from the first dog training video for display or presentment with the second dog obedience training video. [0035] A portion of the viewers of the second dog obedience video may, as a further example, have also viewed a third video containing dog agility demonstrations.
- the second video may additionally be associated with one or more advertisements from the third video.
- association of advertisements from multiple sources can depend upon the shared number of viewers of each video pair (first-second, third-second).
- a normalized weighting of the number of shared viewers of each video pair, a threshold percentage of viewers shared, and/or a weighting by number of times viewed by number of viewers could be used to determine the number of advertisements to receive from (or otherwise associate with) each video source. Any number of videos can contribute advertisements to a related video.
- Advertisers may be offered to purchase placement of advertisements in videos, in some implementations, based upon advertisement association with relevant video content.
- the offer to purchase placement of an advertisement in a video may be referred to as marketing the advertiser.
- a portion of the viewers of a first baseball bloopers video may also choose to view a second sports bloopers video. If a sports drink advertisement presented with the first baseball bloopers video is associated with a beverage advertiser, the beverage advertiser can be marketed to include the sports drink advertisement or another advertisement during presentment of the second sports bloopers video, in some implementations, the marketing can be applied automatically, for example within a computer-based advertiser bidding system.
- the bidding system can provide one or more additional video content items for the advertiser to bid on based upon user preference associated with the video pairs.
- the system 100 may contain more or fewer elements, and the elements within the system 100 can be organized in a different manner than illustrated.
- the video viewer information repository 114 can be stored by the content provider 104.
- the content provider 104 within a request for advertisement content, could include one or more additional video content items related to the requested video content item.
- the ad selection module 118 could identify advertisements associated with the related videos (e.g., within the ad presentment information repository 112) and present one or more of those advertisements using the ad presentment module 122.
- the ad extraction module 120 may be included within the content provider 104. The extracted advertisement information, for example, could be shared with the advertisement system 102 by the content provider 104 (e.g., to populate the ad presentment information repository 112).
- a "video content item” is an item of content that includes content that can be perceived visually when played, rendered, or decoded.
- a video content item includes video data, and optionally audio data and metadata.

- the network 108 may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network.
- the network 108 may be a virtual private network (VPN) between the content provider 104 and the user device 106 across a wireline or a wireless link. While illustrated as a single or continuous network, the network 108 may be logically divided into various sub-nets or virtual networks without departing from the scope of this disclosure, so long as at least a portion of the network 108 may facilitate communications between the advertisement system 102, content provider 104, and at least one client (e.g., user device 106). In certain implementations, the network 108 may be a secure network associated with the enterprise and certain local or remote clients 106.
- Examples of the network 108 include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless phone network, a Wi-Fi network, and the Internet.
- the content item is combined with one or more of the advertisements provided by the advertisement system 102. This combined information including the content of the content item and advertisements) is then forwarded toward a user device 106 that requested the content item or that configured itself to receive the content item for presentation to a user.
- the content provider 104 may transmit information about the ads and how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered, and /or information about the results of that rendering (e.g., ad spot, specified segment, position, selection or not, impression time, impression date, size, temporal length, volume, conversion or not, etc.) back to the advertisement system 102 through the network 108. Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the advertisement system 102 by some other means.
- the content provider 104 includes advertisement media as well as other content. In such a case, the advertisement system 102 can determine and inform the content provider 104 which advertisements to send to the user device 106, for example.
- FIG. 2 A is an example of data 200 associating pairs of videos to the number of viewers who have viewed both videos in a pair of videos.
- the example data 200 is presented for five videos identified as A, B, C, D, and £.
- For the five videos in the example data 200 there are ten possible combinations of two videos, which may be referred to as a video pair or pair.
- the ten pairs of videos in the data 200 are shown in column 210: A-B, A-C, A-D, A-E, B-C, B-D, B-E, C-D, C-E, and D-E.
- the data 200 includes, as shown in column 220, the number of viewers who have viewed both of the videos within each pair.
- the total number of viewers who have viewed both videos within a pair can also be referred to as the viewer-strength value of the pair.
- the data 200 describes data stored within the video viewer information repository 114 (FlG 1).
- the data may be stored, for example, within a relational database management system (RDBNfS) accessible through queries.
- RBNfS relational database management system
- the viewer-strength value weighs the number of times each viewer viewed both videos.
- the video pair B-D share a common viewership of 327,899 viewers (as illustrated in row 230A), the largest number of the possible video pair combinations shown in the data 200. Based upon the viewer-strength value of video pair B-D, a viewer who enjoys video B may be likely to also be interested in video D and vice-versa. Conversely, the video pair D-E share the least number of common viewers, 83,224, as illustrated in row 230B. Considering the relatively low number of viewers who have viewed both video D and video E, it may be unlikely that viewers interested in video D will also be interested in video E and vice-versa. [0058] The relationship of the viewers interested in particular types of videos can be described as the viewership demographic.
- viewers interested in children's cartoons are in a different demographic (e.g., a young age range demographic) compared to viewers interested in videos related to retirement investing.
- Advertisers may try to market certain advertisements to certain demographics. For example, an advertisement for a new toy could be presented to the young age range demographic rather than the retirement demographic.
- advertisements presented with a first video can be selected to be presented with a second video based upon viewers' shared interest of the two videos.
- advertisements associated with video E could be selected for presentment with video A, because the largest number of shared viewers of any video with video A is video E at 275,921 , as illustrated by row 23OC.
- the shared interest value can, in some implementations, be weighted by the number of times each viewer viewed both of the videos within the pair.
- the advertisements can be selected for presentment using the information stored within the ad presentment information repository 112 (FIG 1).
- FIG 2B is an example of data 2S0 associating advertisements and advertisers with videos.
- the example data 250 may be referred to as mapping advertisements and advertisers with videos.
- six advertisements (identified as Ad-I through Ad-6) are shown in column 260
- five advertisers (identified as Advertiser 1 through Advertiser 5) are shown in column 270
- four videos (identified as A through D) are shown in column 280.
- the example data 250 shows the association, relationship or mapping between five advertisers (i.e., Advertiser I through Advertiser 5) and four videos (i.e., A through D), For example, a particular advertisement associated with a particular advertiser is mapped as being presented within one or more videos.
- the advertisements associated with a particular video can be located.
- the data 250 describes data stored within the ad presentment information repository 112 (FIG 1). The data may be stored, for example, within an RDBMS accessible through queries.
- advertisement presentment information may not include the advertiser associated with each advertisement (as illustrated in column 270 of the data 250). The number of times each ad is presented within a particular video, in some implementations, can also be tracked within the advertisement presentment information. [0061 ] Using the data 250, advertisements associated with a first video can be selected for presentment with a second video.
- the advertisements associated with video B can be selected for presentment with video E, because the largest number of shared viewers for any video pair including video B is video B.
- the B-E video pair share 325,747 viewers, as illustrated in row 230D (FlG 2A).
- the data 250 indicates that advertisements Ad-I and Ad-5 are presented within the video B (as illustrated by rows 290A and 290B).
- the advertisements Ad-I and Ad-5 can be selected for presentment based on the relationship between video B with Ad- i and Ad-5.
- video E contains three available slots for advertisements
- a second video correlation can be used to select additional advertisements for video E.
- the second largest number of viewers of both video E and another video is the A-E video pair with 275,921 shared viewers, as illustrated by row 230C (FiG 2A).
- both Ad-2 and Ad-6 arc presented with video A, as illustrated by rows 290C and 290D.
- either Ad-2 or Ad-6 can be selected for presentment with video E along with Ad- 1 and Ad-5. Because both Ad-5 and Ad-6 are associated with the same advertiser (e.g., Advertiser 5), preference could be given to the selection of Ad-2.
- ads can be selected from multiple associated videos using a normalized ratio of viewer preferences.
- video pair C-E share 83,224 viewers as illustrated in row 230E (FIG 2A)
- video pair D-E share 126,573 viewers as illustrated in row 230B (FIG 2A).
- the ratio of each video pair to the total number of viewers between both video pairs provides a weighted value to apply to advertisement selection.
- the total number of viewers who viewed both video C and video E e.g., 83,224
- added to the total number of viewers who viewed both video D and video E e.g., 126,573 generates a normalizing value (e.g., 209,797).
- the normalizing value in general, is the sum of all viewer-strength values of the videos being considered for contributing advertisements to the advertising slots of the identified related video. Individual viewer-strength values can be divided by the normalizing value to generate a ratio. In terms of the C-E pair, the ratio of viewer- strength value to normalizing value can be rounded to 0.4. Similarly, the ratio of the viewer-strength value of the D-E pair to the normalizing value can be rounded to 0.6.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example process 300 for selecting advertisements to present with videos.
- the process 300 can, in some implementations, be carried out by the system 100 as described in PIG. 1.
- the process 300 begins at step 302 by receiving a request to select an advertisement to be presented with a first video.
- the advertisement system 102 could receive an advertisement request from the content provider 104.
- the advertisement request can contain information regarding the first video (e.g., identification, category, length, number of advertisement slots, the video itself, etc.).
- the advertisement request in some implementations, may also contain information regarding the advertisements) desired (eg., length, placement, capabilities, etc.).
- a second video is identified that has been viewed by one or more of the viewers who has also viewed the first video (step 304).
- the ad selection module 118 could locate viewer-strength values associated with the first video and one or more additional videos within the video viewer information repository 114. The second video could be chosen based upon the highest viewer-strength value identified amongst all videos which share viewers with the first video.
- Advertisements are identified that have been presented with the second video (step 306).
- the ad selection module 118 could locate the advertisements j associated with the second video within the ad presentment information repository 112. Any number of advertisements may be associated with the second video.
- the advertiser associated with the advertisement may be identified and/or the number of times the advertisement is displayed within the second video.
- An identified advertisement is selected to be presented with the first video (step 308).
- the selected advertisement may be associated with the second video.
- the selected advertisement may, in another example, be associated with the advertiser of an advertisement being presented with the second video. For example, a more recent advertisement may be available for the same advertiser. Rather than using (he advertisement associated with the second video, the most recent advertisement associated with the advertiser can be selected for presentation with the first video. More than one advertisement can be selected for presentation with the first video. If there are multiple advertisements associated with the second video, selection of an advertisement for presentation with the first video can be based, in part, upon the advertiser's bid price, the advertisement slot available within the first video, information regarding the first video (e.g., keyword match, etc.), etc.
- the selection of which ad to show may be based on the success of the advertisement. For example, an ad that was more successful may be selected over less successful ads. Success of an ad can be measured, for example, based on the number of sales or another type of response, such as a viewer clicking on a link provided in or with the advertisement to obtain additional information or view an advertiser's web site.
- advertiser approval for presenting the advertisement with the first video is received (step 310).
- the advertiser can be notified (e.g., over network 108) of an advertisement being selected for presentation within an additional video. The advertiser, for example, may be given the opportunity to select a different advertisement for presentation with the first video.
- the advertiser may choose to instead present an advertisement containing reference to summer activities.
- the advertiser may, in another example, be given the opportunity to bid on the placement of the advertisement within an the identified video.
- presentation of the selected advertisement with the first video is enabled (step 312).
- the first video receives the selected advertisement from the second video for presentation when the first video is viewed.
- the first video could be associated with the selected advertisement for a certain period of time (e.g., one week, thirty days, etc.), In other examples, the first video could gain an association with the advertiser of the selected advertisement, and the selected advertisement can be enabled for presentation.
- the advertisement could receive a placement within the identified video (e.g., timeslot, spatial positioning), the advertisement and/or the advertisement information may be forwarded to a content provider, etc
- information such as the records described in the video viewer information data 200 (FIG.2A) can be used to identify a second video which has been viewed by one or more viewers who also viewed the first video. Once the second video has been identified, information such as the records described within the advertisement presentment information data 250 (FIG. 2B) can be used to associate Ate identified video with one or more advertisements and/or advertisers.
- an advertisement can be chosen, for example by the ad selection module 118 of the advertisement system 102, to be included within the presentation of the first video.
- steps in the process 300 have been presented linearly, the steps may occur in more than one communication or computing session or otherwise asynchronously.
- steps 302 to 308 may occur in one session and the selected advertisement may be presented to an advertiser in another session, during which approval is received (step 310).
- the advertisement may be placed within or otherwise associated with the first video, or the advertisement may be transmitted for presentation to a viewer of the first video (step 312).
- FlG. 4A depicts a mapping 400 of users to videos viewed.
- a first user A 402 is connected to a video X 412 and a video Y 414, as shown by solid lines 420 and 422, respectively.
- a line also may be referred to as an edge
- a second user B 404 is connected to a video W 410 and the video X 412, as shown by dashed lines 424 and 426, respectively.
- a third user C 406 is connected to the video X 412 and the video Y 414, as shown by lines 428 and 430, respectively.
- a fourth user D 408 is connected to the video Y 414, as shown by line 432.
- mapping 400 Based upon the mapping 400, some information can be discerned regarding the shared interests of the viewers. For example, user A 402 and user C 406 each viewed both video X 412 and video Y 414. The videos X 412 and Y 414 could share a common viewer demographic. In this case, because user D 408 also viewed video Y 414, it could be suggested, for example, that user D 408 may also enjoy video X 412.
- the mapping 400 could be a visualization generated from information similar to the records contained within hie video viewer information data 200 (FIG. 2A).
- FfG. 4B shows a graphical representation 450 for a video receiving (or otherwise being associated or related to) advertisements from another video based upon shared viewers.
- the nodes W 410, X 412, and Y 414 (e.g., representing corresponding videos also shown in PIG. 4A) are connected by a series of lines (e.g., edges) 452.
- Each edge 452a, 452b and 452c represents, for example, a user who viewed of the both videos which are connected by one of the edges 452a, 452b or 452c.
- the first edge 452a, connecting node W 410 to node X 412 represents the User B 404.

- nodes W 410 and Y 414 are illustrated as shaded circles. The shading represents videos associated with advertisements.
- the node X 412 is not shaded.
- a dotted arrow 454 points from node Y 414 towards node X 412. Because node X 412 and node Y 414 are connected by two edges 452b and 452c, node Y 414 is the a candidate for advertisement sharing with node X 412.
- One or more advertisements can be selected from the advertisements associated with the video represented by node Y 414 for presentation with the video represented by node X 412.
- both the video represented by node Y 414 and the video represented by node W 410 can share advertisements with the video represented by node X 412.
- the total number of edges 452a, 452b and 452c connected to node X 412 is three. Two thirds of the three edges 452 (i.e., edges 452b and 452c) are connected between node X 412 and node Y 414, while one third of the edges 452 (i.e., edge 452a) are connected between node X 412 and node W 410.
- FlG. 5A illustrates a mapping 500 of users to videos viewed.
- Four users (identified as User A 502, User B 504, User C 506 and User D 50S) are mapped to the viewing of four videos (identified as video W 510, video X 512, video Y 514 and video Z 516).
- a first user A 502 is connected to a video X 512 and a video Y 514, as illustrated by solid lines 520 and 522, respectively.
- a second user B 504 is connected to a video W 510, the video X 512, and the video Y 514, as shown by dashed lines 524, 526 and 527, respectively.
- a third user C 506 is connected to the video X 512 and a video Z 516, as depicted by lines 528 and 529, respectively.
- a fourth user D 508 is connected to the video X 512 and the video Z 516, as illustrated by lines 531 and 533, respectively.
- the mapping 500 could be a visualization generated from information similar to the records contained within the video viewer information data 200 (FlG. 2A). [0079] Using the relationships between users and videos within the mapping 500, FIG.
- the nodes (e.g., representing videos) W 510» X 512, Y 514, and Z 516 are connected by a series of lines (e.g., edges) 552a, 552b, 552c, 552d and 552e.
- Each edge 552a, 552b, 552c, 552d and 552e represents, for example, a user who viewed both of the videos which are connected by the edge 552a, 552b, 552c, 552d or 552e.
- the first edge 552a, connecting node W 510 to node X 512 represents the User B 504.
- the second edge 552b and the third edge 552c, each connecting node X 512 to node Y 514, represent user A 502 and user B 504.
- the fourth edge 552d and the fifth edge 552e, each connecting node X 512 to node Z 516 represent user C 506 and user D 508.
- the nodes W 510 and Y 514 are illustrated as shaded circles. The shading represents videos associated with advertisements.
- the nodes X 512 and Z 516 are not shaded.
- a dotted arrow 554a points from node Y 514 towards node X 512.
- node Y 514 is a candidate for advertisement sharing with node X 512.
- One or more advertisements can be selected from the video represented by node Y 514 for presentation with video represented by node X 512.
- Node X 512 and node Z 516 are also connected by two edges, 552d and 552e. Neither node X 512 nor node Z 516 are associated with advertisements, but if the video represented by node X 512 receives advertisement associations from node Y 514 (and/or node W 510), the video represented by node Z 516 also may inherit the same advertisement associations through the relationship with node X 512.
- a dotted arrow 554b illustrates the inheritance relationship from node X S 12 to node Z S 16. Any number of videos can receive advertisement associations for presentment in this manner.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an example process 600 for relating advertisers to video content.
- the process 600 can, in some implementations, be carried out by the system 100 as described in FlG. 1 ,
- the process 600 begins at step 602 by extracting advertisements from a group of videos.
- the videos for example, can include television episodes and/or other video types containing advertising content. Any number of advertisements can be embedded within a video.
- the advertisements can be located by any advertisement recognition method and extracted (e.g., placed within a separate video content item).
- the extracted advertisements for example, can be stored within an advertisement repository. In some implementations, duplicate advertisements can be recognized, for example such that an advertisement is only stored once.
- the associations between the videos and each advertisement formerly included within the video is stored (e.g., within a database, etc.).
- a graph representing the relationship between the videos within the group based upon viewers having viewed both of a set of videos is generated (step 604).
- the graph may be similar to the graphical representations 400 of FlG. 4A and 500 of FlG. SA.
- the generated graph may be depicted visually (such as representations 400 and 500) or mathematically. For example, if a viewer has viewed bom a first video of a hospital drama and a second video of a police drama, the graph indicates a relationship between the hospital drama and the police drama. For example, the relationship can indicate how many viewers have viewed both the hospital drama and the police drama. In another example, the relationship also may represent the number of times an individual viewer viewed bom the hospital drama and the police drama.
- the graph may indicate a relationship between a series (e.g., a collection of television episode series, a season of television episodes, or a movie trilogy) in addition to or in lieu of a relationship between individual videos.
- Advertisement candidates are selected from the group of videos for any videos which did not contain advertisements (step 606).
- the hospital drama may not be associated with any advertisements. Because a relationship exists between the hospital drama and the police drama, advertisements associated with the police drama may be relevant to the hospital drama as well (e.g., share a common viewer demographic). In this situation, the hospital drama may receive advertisement candidates from the police drama. Any number of advertisement candidates can be selected for a particular video.
- advertisement candidates are selected from multiple related videos. For example, if viewers of a news parody also tend to view the hospital drama, the hospital drama can receive advertisement candidates from both the news parody and the hospital drama.
- a video may not share a relationship with any other videos which are associated with advertisements. Ia this situation, in some implementations, the video can receive advertisement candidates from a video which shares a relationship with a video which is associated with advertisements. For example, if the police drama is also not associated with advertisements, but a law drama associated to the police drama is associated with advertisements, the hospital drama may receive advertisement candidates from the law drama through the relationship with the police drama. Other relationship associations are possible.
- the advertisers associated with the advertisement candidates are determined (step 608).
- Each advertisement (e.g., extracted during step 602) is matched to an advertiser.
- the matching can be done in any manual or automatic manner. For example, logo recognition, product recognition within closed-captioning text, file comparison, etc. can be used to relate an advertisement with the advertiser.
- advertisers may provide advertisements (e.g., within an advertisement repository) for matching purposes.
- the relationship between advertisements and advertisers can be stored, for example, within a relational database management system (RDBMS).
- RDBMS relational database management system
- the advertisers associated with the candidate advertisements can be determined. For example, the hospital drama may have received two advertisement candidates from the law drama.
- the first advertisement candidate for example, may provide information regarding a cough medicine.
- the cough medicine advertisement may have been matched to a drug company advertiser.
- the second advertisement candidate may, for example, include information regarding a stage performance.
- the stage performance advertisement may have been matched to a theater group.
- the best video matches are presented to an advertiser (step 610).
- the advertiser could be using an automated program to bid on placing advertisements within videos.
- the advertiser is a theater group. Because one of the theater group's advertisements is associated with the police drama and the police drama shares a relationship with the hospital drama, the advertiser can be presented with the hospital drama as a match for advertisement placement. Any number of videos can be presented to an advertiser as a potential demographic match.
- the presentation of one or more advertisements with the video(s) is enabled based upon instructions from the advertiser associated with the advertisements) (step 612).
- the theater group chooses to enable advertisement presentment with the hospital drama.
- the advertiser in some implementations, can also choose an advertisement to associate with the video. For example, if the advertisement associated with the police drama contains reference to a performance for a previous season, the theater group may choose to associate a different advertisement with the hospital drama (e.g., containing reference to an upcoming or current performance).
- the advertiser can enable presentation of more than one advertisement with a particular video or enable a single advertisement to be presented more than one time during the presentment of the video.
- the drug company advertiser may choose to associate both a cough medicine advertisement and a pain relief medicine advertisement with the hospital drama.
- the advertiser in some implementations, may provide guidelines in presenting the advertisements. For example, the advertiser could select a position for the advertisement within the timeframe of the video presentment (e.g., before, during, after, etc.) or within the visual layout of the video presentment (e.g., banner, crawler, etc.). Other advertiser instructions are possible.
- the steps within the process 600 may, in some implementations, occur in a different order, and/or one or more steps could be excluded.
- the association between advertisers and advertisements could be determined at the time of advertisement extraction.
- the relationship between videos could be determined prior to advertisement extraction.
- information such as that found within the video viewer information data 200 could be used to generate the graph of relationships (e.g., graph 450 in FIG. 4B) between videos.
- Information such as that found within the advertisement presentment information data 250, for example, could be used to present best matches to an advertiser.
- the steps in the process 600 have been presented linearly, the steps may occur in more than one communication or computing session or otherwise asynchronously.
- steps 602 to 606 may occur in one session; advertisers may be determined and the selected advertisement may be presented to the determined advertisers in another session (step 608 and 610).
- the advertisement may be placed within the video (or the advertisement is otherwise enabled to be presented with the videos) (step 612).
- FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram of an example of a generic computer system 700.
