Definitions
- Implementations described herein relate generally to advertising and, more particularly, to the detection of violations in advertisements.
- An on-line advertising system may provide advertising links (also referred to as “impressions” hereinafter) to users when they perform web searches or visit certain web pages.
- advertising links also referred to as “impressions” hereinafter
- a user may select (or click) the advertising link, which may cause the user's web browser to visit a web page belonging to the advertiser associated with the advertising link. This selection of an advertising link by a user is referred to hereinafter as a “click.”
- an advertiser it would be beneficial for an advertiser to have its advertisements presented when a user searches for a competitor's product or service. Sometimes, an advertiser will use a competitor's trademark either in the advertisement itself or as a keyword that triggers display of the advertisement.
- a trademark owner can request that competitor's advertisements not be shown when the trademark term is searched by a user.
- the trademark “Sheraton” is owned by The Sheraton Corporation for use in the hotel industry.
- Sheraton may request that no advertisements related to the hotel industry be shown when the user performs a search for “Sheraton.”
- the amount of trademark protection varies from country to country. To comply with the trademark laws, advertisements that contain unauthorized trademarks should be disabled.
- a system may include a set of catch filters to determine whether an advertisement, which includes intellectual property in a content of the advertisement or a keyword associated with the advertisement, contains a potential intellectual property violation; and a set of release filters to determine whether the advertisement contains an actual intellectual property violation when the advertisement is determined to contain a potential intellectual property violation by the set of catch filters.
- a system may include means for identifying occurrences of potential violations in a set of advertisements, means for identifying ones of the advertisements that contain one or more occurrences of one of the potential violations or a spelling variation of the one of the potential violations, and means for sequentially processing each of the identified advertisements in a plurality of stages to determine whether the one of the potential violations in the advertisement is an actual violation.
- a method may include determining whether an advertisement does not infringe intellectual property based on whether there is an overlap between a first set of countries to which the advertisement is targeted and a second set of countries where the intellectual property is registered; determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether a catch keyword in a set of catch keywords that relate to a topic associated with the intellectual property matches a content or a keyword associated with the advertisement; determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether an account identifier corresponding to an advertiser associated with the advertisement matches an account identifier in a list of account identifiers; determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether an address pointed to by the advertisement matches an address in a list of addresses; and determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether a release keyword in a set of release keywords that are unrelated to a topic associated with the intellectual property matches a content or a keyword associated with the advertisement.
- a system may include an ad system capable of reviewing millions of advertisements and hundreds of millions of keywords associated with the advertisements to detect ones of the advertisements that include violations.

- FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented;
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of an entity that may correspond to one or more of the clients, servers, or ad system of FIG. 2 ;
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary functional block diagram of a portion of the ad system of FIG. 2 ;
- FIG. 5 is an exemplary functional block diagram of the filter pipeline of FIG. 4 ;
- FIG. 6 is an exemplary functional block diagram of the catch and release filters of FIG. 5 ;
- FIGS. 7 and 8 are flowcharts illustrating an exemplary operation for processing advertisements according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- FIGS. 9 and 10 are diagrams that facilitate description of the exemplary operation of FIGS. 7 and 8 .
- Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are directed to detecting violations in advertisements.
- a “violation” can relate to an unauthorized use of a trademark, copyright, service mark, trade name, or another form of intellectual property, or use of a restricted word (e.g., a word that violates a policy of an advertising system (e.g., profanity)).
- Implementations described herein can detect violations that appear in the advertisement text itself and in the keywords used to trigger the display of the advertisement text.
- FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a concept consistent with the principles of the invention.
- a user has performed a search for “Sheraton,” which is a trademark of The Sheraton Corporation.
- the user may be presented with a set of advertisements.
- one of the advertisements may include an authorized use of the Sheraton trademark, whereas the other advertisement may include an unauthorized use of the Sheraton trademark.
- the advertisement of Priceline.com may include an authorized use of the Sheraton trademark. Assume that the Priceline.com advertisement may list as one of its keywords the Sheraton trademark to cause the advertisement to be displayed when the user performs a search for “Sheraton.” Further assume that The Sheraton Corporation gives permission to Priceline.com to use its trademark. Therefore, use of the Sheraton trademark by Priceline.com might qualify as an authorized use of the Sheraton trademark.
- the advertisement of Hilton may include an unauthorized use of the Sheraton trademark.
- the Hilton advertisement may list as one of its keywords the Sheraton trademark to cause the advertisement to be displayed when the user performs a search for “Sheraton.”
- the Sheraton Corporation does not give permission to its competitors (e.g., Hilton) to use its trademark. Therefore, use of the Sheraton trademark by Hilton might qualify as an unauthorized use of the Sheraton trademark.
- Implementations described herein are capable of reviewing millions of advertisements and hundreds of millions of keywords to detect advertisements in which advertisers use trademarks that they are not authorized to use.
- One thing that makes this task difficult is that often a trademark has multiple meanings.
- the word “Hertz” may be used in advertisements for radios and televisions where it has the meaning of a unit of frequency.
- the word “Budget” may refer to a car rental company, or it may refer to a person or company's financial budget.
- the word “Sheraton” might be the name of a hotel, but it might also mean a type of guitar.
- the trademark “Pergo” refers to a type of flooring material, but it is also part of the name of a city in Italy, and it is also a common misspelling of the word “Perego” which is a brand of baby-stroller.
- Implementations described herein may provide an efficient way to separate authorized uses from unauthorized uses of trademarks so that advertisements containing unauthorized uses can be disabled without disabling advertisements containing authorized uses of trademarks.
- FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network 200 in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented.
- Network 200 may include multiple clients 210 , multiple servers 220 - 240 , an ad system 250 , and a network 260 . While network 200 has been shown to include a particular number and arrangement of components (e.g., clients 210 , servers 220 - 240 , ad system 250 , and network 260 ), in practice, there may be more or fewer components and/or differently arranged components.
- Clients 210 may include client entities.
- An entity may be defined as a device, such as a personal computer, a wireless telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices.
- Servers 220 - 240 may include server entities that gather, process, search, and/or maintain documents in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention.
- server 220 may include a search engine 225 usable by clients 210 .
- Server 220 may crawl a corpus of documents (e.g., e-mails, web sites, web pages, files, news group postings, blogs, business listings, electronic versions of printed text, advertisements, etc.), index the documents, and store information associated with the documents in a repository of documents.
- Search engine 225 may provide search results or individual documents to clients 210 .
- Ad server 230 may serve advertisements for search results or individual documents provided to clients 210 .
- Server 240 may store or maintain documents that may be crawled or analyzed by server 220 .
- servers 220 - 240 are shown as separate entities, it may be possible for one or more of servers 220 - 240 to perform one or more of the functions of another one or more of servers 220 - 240 .
- servers 220 - 240 may be possible that two or more of servers 220 - 240 are implemented as a single server. It may also be possible for a single one of servers 220 - 240 to be implemented as two or more separate (and possibly distributed) devices.
- Ad system 250 may include an entity that detects authorized and unauthorized uses of trademarks within advertisements.
- ad system 250 may use a pipeline of filters to separate authorized trademark use from unauthorized trademark use, as described in more detail below. While ad system 250 is shown as separate from servers 220 and 230 , it may be possible for server 220 and/or server 230 to perform one or more of the functions of ad system 250 .
- ad system 250 might be implemented within server 220 or server 230 in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- Network 260 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, or a combination of networks.
- Clients 210 and servers 220 - 240 may connect to network 250 via wired, wireless, and/or optical connections.
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of an entity that may correspond to one or more of clients 210 , servers 220 - 240 , or ad system 250 of FIG. 2 .
- the entity may include a bus 310 , a processor 320 , a main memory 330 , a read only memory (ROM) 340 , a storage device 350 , an input device 360 , an output device 370 , and a communication interface 380 .
- Bus 310 may include a path that permits communication among the elements of the entity.
- Processor 320 may include a processor, microprocessor, or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions.
- Main memory 330 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor 320 .
- ROM 340 may include a ROM device or another type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use by processor 320 .
- Storage device 350 may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.
- Input device 360 may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to the entity, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc.

- the software instructions may be read into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 350 , or from another entity via communication interface 380 .
- the software instructions contained in memory 330 may cause processor 320 to perform processes that will be described later.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary functional block diagram of a portion of ad system 250 of FIG. 2 .
- Ad system 250 may include text indexing engine 410 , variation aggregator 420 , variation design tool 430 , filter pipeline 440 , filter design tool 450 , release pile 460 , and catch pile 470 .
- text indexing engine 410 , variation aggregator 420 , variation design tool 430 , filter pipeline 440 , and/or filter design tool 450 may be implemented by software and/or hardware within ad system 250 .
- Text indexing engine 410 may receive a set of advertisements and identify occurrences of trademarks. For example, text indexing engine 410 may use a text matching technique to determine whether the text of an advertisement or the keywords associated with the advertisement match a list of trademarks to identify any trademarks in the advertisement.
- the list of trademarks may include possible spelling variations (including common misspellings) for each of the trademarks. For example, for the trademark “center parc,” the following spelling variations may also be included in the list of trademarks: center pares, center park, center parks, centerparc, centre parc, centre pares, centre park, and centre parks. Text indexing engine 410 may consider each trademark (including each spelling variation) in the list separately when identifying occurrences of trademarks in the advertisements.
- Text indexing engine 410 may create an index for each trademark in the list. For example, text indexing engine 410 may create one index for “center parc,” another index for “center park,” yet another index for “center parks,” and so on. Each index may identify all advertisements that contain the trademark. Text indexing engine 410 may provide the indexes it creates to variation aggregator 420 .
- Variation aggregator 420 may take possible spelling variations (including common misspellings) of a given trademark and produce a merged set of advertisements having one or more occurrences of the trademark or any of its spelling variations. For example, for the center parc trademark, variation aggregator 420 may produce a merged set of advertisements having one or more occurrences of center parc, center pares, center park, center parks, centerparc, centre parc, centre pares, centre park, or centre parks. Variation aggregator 420 may identify the advertisements for the merged set of advertisements from the indexes provided by text indexing engine 410 . Variation aggregator 420 may then provide each advertisement in the merged set of advertisements to filter pipeline 440 .
- Variation design tool 430 may provide an interface that permits a human operator to define the set of spelling variations that are applicable for a given trademark. For example, the operator may add the spelling variations center pares, center park, center parks, centerparc, centre parc, centre parcs, centre park, and centre parks for the center parc trademark.
- Filter pipeline 440 may execute for each trademark and apply a set of filtering rules to the advertisements that contain that trademark (or any of its spelling variations).
- FIG. 5 is an exemplary functional block diagram of filter pipeline 440 .
- Filter pipeline 440 may include a set of catch filters 510 and a set of release filters 520 . Each of catch filters 510 and release filters 520 may include sequential stages of filters.
- the filter stages may be executed sequentially to either move an advertisement to release pile 460 or pass the advertisement along to the next filter stage. If an advertisement is moved to release pile 460 , then it is deemed to be non-infringing (i.e., not a trademark violation). If an advertisement is caught by a filter stage, then it is passed to the next filter stage. If the advertisement is caught by the final filter stage of filter pipeline 440 , then it may be moved to catch pile 470 . If an advertisement is moved to catch pile 470 , then it is deemed to be infringing (i.e., a trademark violation).
- FIG. 6 is an exemplary functional block diagram of catch filter 510 and release filter 520 .
- catch filter 510 may include catch country filter 610 , catch advertiser identifier (ID) filter 620 , catch address filter 630 , and catch phrase filter 640 .
- ID catch advertiser identifier
- catch country filter 610 a human operator may identify the specific set of countries where the trademark owner has registered the trademark. For example, if The Sheraton Corporation registered the trademark “Sheraton” in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, then the operator may identify these countries in catch country filter 610 .
- Each advertisement may include a set of target countries for which the advertisement is targeted.
- Catch country filter 610 may examine the set of target countries which are listed for an advertisement. If there is no overlap between the targeted countries and the countries provided by the operator, the advertisement may be moved to release pile 460 . Otherwise, the advertisement may be passed to catch advertiser ID filter 620 and/or catch address filter 630 .
- catch advertiser ID filter 620 a human operator may provide a list of advertiser account IDs that are known to be misusing a trademark. For example, a trademark owner may identify a specific advertiser's advertisements that are infringing its trademark. The operator may include the account IDs corresponding to this advertiser in catch advertiser ID filter 620 . Catch advertiser ID filter 620 may determine whether the advertiser account ID associated with an advertisement matches one of the advertiser account IDs provided by the operator.
- a human operator may provide a list of addresses (e.g., URLs) that are known to be misusing a trademark.
- addresses e.g., URLs
- a trademark owner may identify a small set of advertisements that are infringing its trademark by identifying the specific web sites or domains pointed to by the advertisements.
- the operator may include the addresses associated with these web sites or domains in catch address filter 630 .
- catch advertiser ID filter 620 or catch address filter 630 is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one advertiser account ID in the case of catch advertiser filter 620 or contains at least one address in the case of catch address filter 630 ), then only advertisements caught by one or both of these filters may pass along to the next stage of filter pipeline 440 . All other advertisements may be moved to release pile 460 . If both catch advertiser ID filter 620 and catch address filter 630 are empty, then the advertisements may be passed to catch phrase filter 640 .
- catch phrase filter 640 a human operator may provide a set of words or phrases (“catch keywords”) that relate to a topic with which the trademark is associated. For example, if the operator is building filter pipeline 440 for the trademark “Budget” (a trademark of the car rental company Budget), the operator may provide words, such as car, automobile, truck, rental, rent, and hire into catch phrase filter 640 . If catch phrase filter 640 determines that an advertisement contains none of the catch keywords (either in the content of the advertisement or its keywords), then catch phrase filter 640 may move the advertisement to release pile 460 . Otherwise, catch phrase filter 640 may pass the advertisement to release filter 520 .
- catch phrase filter 640 may move the advertisement to release pile 460 . Otherwise, catch phrase filter 640 may pass the advertisement to release filter 520 .
- release filter 520 may include release advertiser ID filter 650 , release address filter 660 , and release phrase filter 670 .
- release advertiser ID filter 650 a human operator may identify advertiser accounts of the trademark owner and specific advertiser accounts that have been granted permission to use the trademark by the trademark owner. For example, the car rental company Budget (i.e., the owner of the Budget trademark) may permit expedia.com (an advertiser of travel accommodations) to use its trademark. The operator may include the account IDs corresponding to the trademark owner and the permitted advertisers in release advertiser ID filter 650 . Release advertiser ID filter 650 may determine whether the advertiser associated with an advertisement matches one of the advertiser account IDs provided by the operator.
- release advertiser ID filter 650 may move the advertisement to release pile 460 . Otherwise, release advertiser ID filter 650 may pass the advertisement to release address filter 660 .
- release address filter 660 a human operator may provide a list of addresses (e.g., URLs that are visible on the screen to the end user) that are associated with the trademark owner or are known to be unrelated to the business of the trademark owner. For example, in the case of Hertz, the operator could include the addresses hertz.com and hertzaudio.de in release address filter 660 . This may cause advertisements pointing at the Hertz audio store to be removed from further consideration since any advertisement displaying this address is almost certainly unrelated to car rentals. The operator may include these addresses in release address filter 660 . Release address filter 660 may determine whether the address associated with an advertisement matches one of the addresses provided by the operator. If release address filter 660 contains an address that matches the address associated with an advertisement, then release address filter 660 may move the advertisement to release pile 460 . Otherwise, release address filter 660 may pass the advertisement to release phrase filter 670 .
- addresses e.g., URLs that are visible on the screen to the end user
- release phrase filter 670 a human operator may provide a set of words or phrases (“release keywords”) that are unrelated to a topic with which the trademark is associated. For example, if the operator is building filter pipeline 440 for the trademark “Sheraton” (a trademark of the hotel company The Sheraton Corporation), the operator may provide a word, such as guitar (Sheraton is a type of guitar) into release phrase filter 670 . If release phrase filter 670 determines that an advertisement contains any of the release keywords (either in the content of the advertisement or its keywords), then release phrase filter 670 may move the advertisement to release pile 460 . Otherwise, release phrase filter 670 may move the advertisement to catch pile 470 .
- release phrase filter 670 may move the advertisement to catch pile 470 .
- a catch filter 610 - 640 is empty (i.e., the human operator did not provide any items), then it is assumed that the operator intends for the filter to have no effect and so advertisements are passed to the next stage in filter pipeline 440 . If a release filter 650 - 670 is empty, then it is assumed that the operator intends for the filter to have no effect and so advertisements are passed to the next stage in filter pipeline 440 or to catch pile 470 .
- filter design tool 450 may permit human operators to edit the contents of each of the filters of filter pipeline 440 .
- Filter design tool 450 may also permit operators to experiment with different filter combinations. The operator may examine the output of each filter in filter pipeline 440 , and can iteratively refine each filter to give optimal results for a particular trademark. Once the operator is satisfied with the performance of filter pipeline 440 , the operator can run filter pipeline over all advertisements containing a particular trademark.
- Release pile 460 may represent the collection of advertisements that were found to not contain trademark violations (i.e., non-infringing advertisements). These advertisements may be identified to an advertisement serving system, such as ad server 230 ( FIG. 2 ). The advertisement serving system may display these advertisements to end users that perform searches using a search engine, such as search engine 225 ( FIG. 2 ), or access a document via a server, such as server 220 .
- a search engine such as search engine 225 ( FIG. 2 )
- server 220 such as server 220 .
- Catch pile 470 may represent the collection of advertisements that were found to contain trademark violations (i.e., infringing advertisements). These infringing advertisements may be submitted to a disapproval system. The disapproval system may change the status of these advertisements (e.g., deactivate them) so they may no longer be displayed to end users. The disapproval system may also notify the advertisers associated with these advertisements of deactivation of their advertisements.
- infringing advertisements may be submitted to a disapproval system.
- the disapproval system may change the status of these advertisements (e.g., deactivate them) so they may no longer be displayed to end users.
- the disapproval system may also notify the advertisers associated with these advertisements of deactivation of their advertisements.
- FIGS. 7 and 8 are flowcharts illustrating an exemplary operation for processing advertisements according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- FIGS. 9 and 10 are diagrams that facilitate description of the exemplary operation of FIGS. 7 and 8 .
- Processing may begin with the receipt of a group of advertisements to be processed for potential trademark violations (block 710 ) ( FIG. 7 ).
- the group of advertisements may include advertisements served by an ad server, such as ad server 230 , and/or advertisements newly submitted for serving by the ad server.
- the advertisements may be analyzed to identify any trademarks contained in the advertisements (including their keywords) (block 720 ).
- each of the advertisements may be analyzed to determine whether its content or keywords include a trademark included in a list of trademarks.
- the list of trademarks may include known trademarks and possible spelling variations of the trademarks.
- Each trademark (including each spelling variation) in the list may be considered separately when identifying occurrences of trademarks in the advertisements.
- a set of advertisements to analyze for each trademark may be determined (block 730 ). For each trademark, possible spelling variations (including common misspellings) may be identified. The advertisements containing the trademark or one of its spelling variations may be determined and merged into the set of advertisements associated with the trademark.
- advertisement 910 is associated with the provider of travel accommodations Expedia and advertisement 920 is associated with the car rental company Avis. Assume that advertisements 910 and 920 contain identical keywords: car, automobile, truck, auto, rent, rental, Hertz, Budget, and Avis, and both are targeted to the United States.
- the advertisement may be processed by the catch filters (block 810 ).
- the advertisement may be processed by catch country filter 610 ( FIG. 6 ), catch advertiser ID filter 620 , catch address filter 630 , and catch phrase filter 640 .
- the processing by the catch filters may indicate whether a particular advertisement contains a possible trademark violation (block 820 ).
- catch country filter 610 indicates that the Hertz trademark is registered in the United States and Canada
- catch advertiser ID filter 620 and catch address filter 630 are empty
- catch phrase filter 640 includes the following catch keywords: car, automobile, truck, rental, rent, hire, auto, car rental, automobile rental, truck rental, rental cars, and rental trucks, as shown in FIG. 10 .
- advertisements 910 and 920 are processed by catch country filter 610 , catch advertiser ID filter 620 , catch address filter 630 , and catch phrase filter 640 , both advertisements 910 and 920 may be identified as containing possible trademark violations.
- catch country filter 610 may determine that both advertisements 910 and 920 are targeted to a country in which the Hertz trademark is registered. For example, advertisements 910 and 920 are both targeted to the United States, which is a country in which the Hertz trademark is registered. Catch country filter 610 may then pass both advertisements to catch advertiser ID filter 620 and/or catch address filter 630 . Because both catch advertiser ID filter 620 and catch address filter 630 are empty, advertisements 910 and 920 may be passed to catch phrase filter 640 . Catch phrase filter 640 may determine that both advertisements 910 and 920 contain one or more of the catch keywords. For example, advertisements 910 and 920 contain the catch keywords: car, rental, automobile, truck, rent, auto, and rental cars.
- the advertisement may be moved to the release pile (block 830 ). Otherwise, the advertisement may be processed by the release filters (block 840 ). For example, the advertisement may be processed by release advertiser ID filter 650 ( FIG. 6 ), release address filter 660 , and release phrase filter 670 . The processing by the release filters may indicate whether a particular advertisement contains a trademark violation (block 850 ).
- release advertiser ID filter 650 contains the advertiser account ID 123567 associated with Expedia
- release address filter 660 contains the addresses hertz.com and hertzaudio.de
- release phrase filter 670 includes the following release keywords: audio, radio, frequency, and electronics, as shown in FIG. 10 .
- release advertiser ID filter 650 may determine that it contains the account ID associated with Expedia, but not Avis. Therefore, release advertiser ID filter 650 may move advertisement 910 to the release pile and may pass advertisement 920 to release address filter 660 .
- Release address filter 660 may determine that the address associated with advertisement 920 (i.e., install.com) does not match one of its addresses (i.e., hertz.com or hertzaudio.com) and, therefore, may pass advertisement 920 to release phrase filter 670 .
- Release phrase filter 670 may determine that advertisement 920 does not match any of its release keywords. In other words, release phrase filter 670 may determine that the content and/or keywords of advertisement 920 do not match its release keywords. Accordingly, release phrase filter 670 may move advertisement 920 to the catch pile.
- the advertisement may be moved to the release pile (block 860 ).
- the advertisement may be moved to the catch pile (block 870 ).
- an advertisement that is identified as containing a trademark violation may be deactivated (block 750 ).
- an infringing advertisement may be submitted to a disapproval system that may change the status of the advertisement (e.g., deactivate it) so it may no longer be displayed to end users.
- the disapproval system may notify the advertiser associated with this advertisement of deactivation of the infringing advertisement.
- the advertiser may be given the option of revising the text in the infringing advertisement, or submitting an explanation of why it believes the use of the trademark should be permitted. If the explanation is satisfactory, the human operator may revise the corresponding filter pipeline so that similar advertisements in the future will not be incorrectly identified as containing trademark violations.

Abstract
A system identifies occurrences of potential violations in a set of advertisements and identifies ones of the advertisements that contains one or more occurrences of one of the potential violations or a spelling variation of the one of the potential violations. The system sequentially processes each of the identified advertisements in a number of stages to determine whether the one of the potential violations in the advertisement is an actual violation.
Description
- Implementations described herein relate generally to advertising and, more particularly, to the detection of violations in advertisements.
- An on-line advertising system may provide advertising links (also referred to as “impressions” hereinafter) to users when they perform web searches or visit certain web pages. When a particular advertising link is of interest to a user, a user may select (or click) the advertising link, which may cause the user's web browser to visit a web page belonging to the advertiser associated with the advertising link. This selection of an advertising link by a user is referred to hereinafter as a “click.”
- It would be beneficial for an advertiser to have its advertisements presented when a user searches for a competitor's product or service. Sometimes, an advertiser will use a competitor's trademark either in the advertisement itself or as a keyword that triggers display of the advertisement.
- In some countries, depending on local trademark laws, a trademark owner can request that competitor's advertisements not be shown when the trademark term is searched by a user. For example, the trademark “Sheraton” is owned by The Sheraton Corporation for use in the hotel industry. In some countries, Sheraton may request that no advertisements related to the hotel industry be shown when the user performs a search for “Sheraton.” The amount of trademark protection varies from country to country. To comply with the trademark laws, advertisements that contain unauthorized trademarks should be disabled.
- Manual systems exist that require examination of each advertisement one at a time. In a typical system, a human operator reads each advertisement individually and makes a decision about whether the use of the trademark is authorized or unauthorized. This is very labor-intensive and, therefore, very expensive.
- According to one aspect, a system may include a set of catch filters to determine whether an advertisement, which includes intellectual property in a content of the advertisement or a keyword associated with the advertisement, contains a potential intellectual property violation; and a set of release filters to determine whether the advertisement contains an actual intellectual property violation when the advertisement is determined to contain a potential intellectual property violation by the set of catch filters.
- According to another aspect, a system may include means for identifying occurrences of potential violations in a set of advertisements, means for identifying ones of the advertisements that contain one or more occurrences of one of the potential violations or a spelling variation of the one of the potential violations, and means for sequentially processing each of the identified advertisements in a plurality of stages to determine whether the one of the potential violations in the advertisement is an actual violation.
- According to yet another aspect, a method may include determining whether an advertisement does not infringe intellectual property based on whether there is an overlap between a first set of countries to which the advertisement is targeted and a second set of countries where the intellectual property is registered; determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether a catch keyword in a set of catch keywords that relate to a topic associated with the intellectual property matches a content or a keyword associated with the advertisement; determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether an account identifier corresponding to an advertiser associated with the advertisement matches an account identifier in a list of account identifiers; determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether an address pointed to by the advertisement matches an address in a list of addresses; and determining whether the advertisement does not infringe the intellectual property based on whether a release keyword in a set of release keywords that are unrelated to a topic associated with the intellectual property matches a content or a keyword associated with the advertisement.
- According to a further aspect, a system may include an ad system capable of reviewing millions of advertisements and hundreds of millions of keywords associated with the advertisements to detect ones of the advertisements that include violations.

The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
- Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are directed to detecting violations in advertisements. A “violation” can relate to an unauthorized use of a trademark, copyright, service mark, trade name, or another form of intellectual property, or use of a restricted word (e.g., a word that violates a policy of an advertising system (e.g., profanity)). Implementations described herein can detect violations that appear in the advertisement text itself and in the keywords used to trigger the display of the advertisement text.
-
FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a concept consistent with the principles of the invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , a user has performed a search for “Sheraton,” which is a trademark of The Sheraton Corporation. Along with the search results, the user may be presented with a set of advertisements. In the example ofFIG. 1 , one of the advertisements may include an authorized use of the Sheraton trademark, whereas the other advertisement may include an unauthorized use of the Sheraton trademark. - The advertisement of Priceline.com, for example, may include an authorized use of the Sheraton trademark. Assume that the Priceline.com advertisement may list as one of its keywords the Sheraton trademark to cause the advertisement to be displayed when the user performs a search for “Sheraton.” Further assume that The Sheraton Corporation gives permission to Priceline.com to use its trademark. Therefore, use of the Sheraton trademark by Priceline.com might qualify as an authorized use of the Sheraton trademark.
- The advertisement of Hilton, on the other hand, may include an unauthorized use of the Sheraton trademark. Assume that the Hilton advertisement may list as one of its keywords the Sheraton trademark to cause the advertisement to be displayed when the user performs a search for “Sheraton.” Further assume that The Sheraton Corporation does not give permission to its competitors (e.g., Hilton) to use its trademark. Therefore, use of the Sheraton trademark by Hilton might qualify as an unauthorized use of the Sheraton trademark.
- Implementations described herein are capable of reviewing millions of advertisements and hundreds of millions of keywords to detect advertisements in which advertisers use trademarks that they are not authorized to use. One thing that makes this task difficult is that often a trademark has multiple meanings. For example, the word “Hertz” may be used in advertisements for radios and televisions where it has the meaning of a unit of frequency. Similarly, the word “Budget” may refer to a car rental company, or it may refer to a person or company's financial budget. The word “Sheraton” might be the name of a hotel, but it might also mean a type of guitar. The trademark “Pergo” refers to a type of flooring material, but it is also part of the name of a city in Italy, and it is also a common misspelling of the word “Perego” which is a brand of baby-stroller.
- Implementations described herein may provide an efficient way to separate authorized uses from unauthorized uses of trademarks so that advertisements containing unauthorized uses can be disabled without disabling advertisements containing authorized uses of trademarks.
-
FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of anetwork 200 in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented. Network 200 may includemultiple clients 210, multiple servers 220-240, anad system 250, and anetwork 260. Whilenetwork 200 has been shown to include a particular number and arrangement of components (e.g.,clients 210, servers 220-240,ad system 250, and network 260), in practice, there may be more or fewer components and/or differently arranged components. -
Clients 210 may include client entities. An entity may be defined as a device, such as a personal computer, a wireless telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices. Servers 220-240 may include server entities that gather, process, search, and/or maintain documents in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention. - In an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention,
server 220 may include asearch engine 225 usable byclients 210.Server 220 may crawl a corpus of documents (e.g., e-mails, web sites, web pages, files, news group postings, blogs, business listings, electronic versions of printed text, advertisements, etc.), index the documents, and store information associated with the documents in a repository of documents.Search engine 225 may provide search results or individual documents toclients 210.Ad server 230 may serve advertisements for search results or individual documents provided toclients 210.Server 240 may store or maintain documents that may be crawled or analyzed byserver 220. - While servers 220-240 are shown as separate entities, it may be possible for one or more of servers 220-240 to perform one or more of the functions of another one or more of servers 220-240. For example, it may be possible that two or more of servers 220-240 are implemented as a single server. It may also be possible for a single one of servers 220-240 to be implemented as two or more separate (and possibly distributed) devices.
-
Ad system 250 may include an entity that detects authorized and unauthorized uses of trademarks within advertisements. In one implementation,ad system 250 may use a pipeline of filters to separate authorized trademark use from unauthorized trademark use, as described in more detail below. Whilead system 250 is shown as separate fromservers server 220 and/orserver 230 to perform one or more of the functions ofad system 250. For example,ad system 250 might be implemented withinserver 220 orserver 230 in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. -
Network 260 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, or a combination of networks.Clients 210 and servers 220-240 may connect to network 250 via wired, wireless, and/or optical connections. -
FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of an entity that may correspond to one or more ofclients 210, servers 220-240, orad system 250 ofFIG. 2 . The entity may include abus 310, aprocessor 320, amain memory 330, a read only memory (ROM) 340, astorage device 350, aninput device 360, anoutput device 370, and acommunication interface 380.Bus 310 may include a path that permits communication among the elements of the entity. -
Processor 320 may include a processor, microprocessor, or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions.Main memory 330 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution byprocessor 320.ROM 340 may include a ROM device or another type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use byprocessor 320.Storage device 350 may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive. -
Input device 360 may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to the entity, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc.Output device 370 may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc.Communication interface 380 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables the entity to communicate with another entity. For example,communication interface 380 may include mechanisms for communicating with another entity via a network, such asnetwork 260. - As will be described in detail below, the entity may perform certain operations relating to the detection of unauthorized uses of trademarks. The entity may perform these operations in response to
processor 320 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such asmemory 330. A computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave. - The software instructions may be read into
memory 330 from another computer-readable medium, such asdata storage device 350, or from another entity viacommunication interface 380. The software instructions contained inmemory 330 may causeprocessor 320 to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. -
FIG. 4 is an exemplary functional block diagram of a portion ofad system 250 ofFIG. 2 .Ad system 250 may includetext indexing engine 410,variation aggregator 420,variation design tool 430,filter pipeline 440,filter design tool 450,release pile 460, and catchpile 470. In one implementation,text indexing engine 410,variation aggregator 420,variation design tool 430,filter pipeline 440, and/orfilter design tool 450 may be implemented by software and/or hardware withinad system 250. -
Text indexing engine 410 may receive a set of advertisements and identify occurrences of trademarks. For example,text indexing engine 410 may use a text matching technique to determine whether the text of an advertisement or the keywords associated with the advertisement match a list of trademarks to identify any trademarks in the advertisement. In one implementation, the list of trademarks may include possible spelling variations (including common misspellings) for each of the trademarks. For example, for the trademark “center parc,” the following spelling variations may also be included in the list of trademarks: center pares, center park, center parks, centerparc, centre parc, centre pares, centre park, and centre parks.Text indexing engine 410 may consider each trademark (including each spelling variation) in the list separately when identifying occurrences of trademarks in the advertisements. -
Text indexing engine 410 may create an index for each trademark in the list. For example,text indexing engine 410 may create one index for “center parc,” another index for “center park,” yet another index for “center parks,” and so on. Each index may identify all advertisements that contain the trademark.Text indexing engine 410 may provide the indexes it creates tovariation aggregator 420. -
Variation aggregator 420 may take possible spelling variations (including common misspellings) of a given trademark and produce a merged set of advertisements having one or more occurrences of the trademark or any of its spelling variations. For example, for the center parc trademark,variation aggregator 420 may produce a merged set of advertisements having one or more occurrences of center parc, center pares, center park, center parks, centerparc, centre parc, centre pares, centre park, or centre parks.Variation aggregator 420 may identify the advertisements for the merged set of advertisements from the indexes provided bytext indexing engine 410.Variation aggregator 420 may then provide each advertisement in the merged set of advertisements to filterpipeline 440. -
Variation design tool 430 may provide an interface that permits a human operator to define the set of spelling variations that are applicable for a given trademark. For example, the operator may add the spelling variations center pares, center park, center parks, centerparc, centre parc, centre parcs, centre park, and centre parks for the center parc trademark. -
Filter pipeline 440 may execute for each trademark and apply a set of filtering rules to the advertisements that contain that trademark (or any of its spelling variations).FIG. 5 is an exemplary functional block diagram offilter pipeline 440.Filter pipeline 440 may include a set of catch filters 510 and a set of release filters 520. Each of catch filters 510 and release filters 520 may include sequential stages of filters. - The filter stages may be executed sequentially to either move an advertisement to release
pile 460 or pass the advertisement along to the next filter stage. If an advertisement is moved to releasepile 460, then it is deemed to be non-infringing (i.e., not a trademark violation). If an advertisement is caught by a filter stage, then it is passed to the next filter stage. If the advertisement is caught by the final filter stage offilter pipeline 440, then it may be moved to catchpile 470. If an advertisement is moved to catchpile 470, then it is deemed to be infringing (i.e., a trademark violation). -
FIG. 6 is an exemplary functional block diagram ofcatch filter 510 andrelease filter 520. As shown inFIG. 6 ,catch filter 510 may includecatch country filter 610, catch advertiser identifier (ID)filter 620, catchaddress filter 630, and catchphrase filter 640. - For
catch country filter 610, a human operator may identify the specific set of countries where the trademark owner has registered the trademark. For example, if The Sheraton Corporation registered the trademark “Sheraton” in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, then the operator may identify these countries incatch country filter 610. Each advertisement may include a set of target countries for which the advertisement is targeted.Catch country filter 610 may examine the set of target countries which are listed for an advertisement. If there is no overlap between the targeted countries and the countries provided by the operator, the advertisement may be moved to releasepile 460. Otherwise, the advertisement may be passed to catchadvertiser ID filter 620 and/or catchaddress filter 630. - For catch
advertiser ID filter 620, a human operator may provide a list of advertiser account IDs that are known to be misusing a trademark. For example, a trademark owner may identify a specific advertiser's advertisements that are infringing its trademark. The operator may include the account IDs corresponding to this advertiser in catchadvertiser ID filter 620. Catchadvertiser ID filter 620 may determine whether the advertiser account ID associated with an advertisement matches one of the advertiser account IDs provided by the operator. - For
catch address filter 630, a human operator may provide a list of addresses (e.g., URLs) that are known to be misusing a trademark. For example, a trademark owner may identify a small set of advertisements that are infringing its trademark by identifying the specific web sites or domains pointed to by the advertisements. The operator may include the addresses associated with these web sites or domains incatch address filter 630. - If either catch
advertiser ID filter 620 or catchaddress filter 630 is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one advertiser account ID in the case ofcatch advertiser filter 620 or contains at least one address in the case of catch address filter 630), then only advertisements caught by one or both of these filters may pass along to the next stage offilter pipeline 440. All other advertisements may be moved to releasepile 460. If both catchadvertiser ID filter 620 and catchaddress filter 630 are empty, then the advertisements may be passed to catchphrase filter 640. - For
catch phrase filter 640, a human operator may provide a set of words or phrases (“catch keywords”) that relate to a topic with which the trademark is associated. For example, if the operator is buildingfilter pipeline 440 for the trademark “Budget” (a trademark of the car rental company Budget), the operator may provide words, such as car, automobile, truck, rental, rent, and hire intocatch phrase filter 640. Ifcatch phrase filter 640 determines that an advertisement contains none of the catch keywords (either in the content of the advertisement or its keywords), then catchphrase filter 640 may move the advertisement to releasepile 460. Otherwise, catchphrase filter 640 may pass the advertisement to releasefilter 520. - As shown in
FIG. 6 ,release filter 520 may include releaseadvertiser ID filter 650,release address filter 660, and releasephrase filter 670. For releaseadvertiser ID filter 650, a human operator may identify advertiser accounts of the trademark owner and specific advertiser accounts that have been granted permission to use the trademark by the trademark owner. For example, the car rental company Budget (i.e., the owner of the Budget trademark) may permit expedia.com (an advertiser of travel accommodations) to use its trademark. The operator may include the account IDs corresponding to the trademark owner and the permitted advertisers in releaseadvertiser ID filter 650. Releaseadvertiser ID filter 650 may determine whether the advertiser associated with an advertisement matches one of the advertiser account IDs provided by the operator. If releaseadvertiser ID filter 650 contains an advertiser account ID that matches the advertiser associated with an advertisement, then releaseadvertiser ID filter 650 may move the advertisement to releasepile 460. Otherwise, releaseadvertiser ID filter 650 may pass the advertisement to releaseaddress filter 660. - For
release address filter 660, a human operator may provide a list of addresses (e.g., URLs that are visible on the screen to the end user) that are associated with the trademark owner or are known to be unrelated to the business of the trademark owner. For example, in the case of Hertz, the operator could include the addresses hertz.com and hertzaudio.de inrelease address filter 660. This may cause advertisements pointing at the Hertz audio store to be removed from further consideration since any advertisement displaying this address is almost certainly unrelated to car rentals. The operator may include these addresses inrelease address filter 660.Release address filter 660 may determine whether the address associated with an advertisement matches one of the addresses provided by the operator. Ifrelease address filter 660 contains an address that matches the address associated with an advertisement, then releaseaddress filter 660 may move the advertisement to releasepile 460. Otherwise,release address filter 660 may pass the advertisement to releasephrase filter 670. - For
release phrase filter 670, a human operator may provide a set of words or phrases (“release keywords”) that are unrelated to a topic with which the trademark is associated. For example, if the operator is buildingfilter pipeline 440 for the trademark “Sheraton” (a trademark of the hotel company The Sheraton Corporation), the operator may provide a word, such as guitar (Sheraton is a type of guitar) intorelease phrase filter 670. Ifrelease phrase filter 670 determines that an advertisement contains any of the release keywords (either in the content of the advertisement or its keywords), then releasephrase filter 670 may move the advertisement to releasepile 460. Otherwise,release phrase filter 670 may move the advertisement to catchpile 470. - If a catch filter 610-640 is empty (i.e., the human operator did not provide any items), then it is assumed that the operator intends for the filter to have no effect and so advertisements are passed to the next stage in
filter pipeline 440. If a release filter 650-670 is empty, then it is assumed that the operator intends for the filter to have no effect and so advertisements are passed to the next stage infilter pipeline 440 or to catchpile 470. - Returning to
FIG. 4 ,filter design tool 450 may permit human operators to edit the contents of each of the filters offilter pipeline 440.Filter design tool 450 may also permit operators to experiment with different filter combinations. The operator may examine the output of each filter infilter pipeline 440, and can iteratively refine each filter to give optimal results for a particular trademark. Once the operator is satisfied with the performance offilter pipeline 440, the operator can run filter pipeline over all advertisements containing a particular trademark. -
Release pile 460 may represent the collection of advertisements that were found to not contain trademark violations (i.e., non-infringing advertisements). These advertisements may be identified to an advertisement serving system, such as ad server 230 (FIG. 2 ). The advertisement serving system may display these advertisements to end users that perform searches using a search engine, such as search engine 225 (FIG. 2 ), or access a document via a server, such asserver 220. -
Catch pile 470 may represent the collection of advertisements that were found to contain trademark violations (i.e., infringing advertisements). These infringing advertisements may be submitted to a disapproval system. The disapproval system may change the status of these advertisements (e.g., deactivate them) so they may no longer be displayed to end users. The disapproval system may also notify the advertisers associated with these advertisements of deactivation of their advertisements. -
FIGS. 7 and 8 are flowcharts illustrating an exemplary operation for processing advertisements according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.FIGS. 9 and 10 are diagrams that facilitate description of the exemplary operation ofFIGS. 7 and 8 . - Processing may begin with the receipt of a group of advertisements to be processed for potential trademark violations (block 710) (
FIG. 7 ). The group of advertisements may include advertisements served by an ad server, such asad server 230, and/or advertisements newly submitted for serving by the ad server. - The advertisements may be analyzed to identify any trademarks contained in the advertisements (including their keywords) (block 720). For example, each of the advertisements may be analyzed to determine whether its content or keywords include a trademark included in a list of trademarks. As explained above, the list of trademarks may include known trademarks and possible spelling variations of the trademarks. Each trademark (including each spelling variation) in the list may be considered separately when identifying occurrences of trademarks in the advertisements.
- A set of advertisements to analyze for each trademark may be determined (block 730). For each trademark, possible spelling variations (including common misspellings) may be identified. The advertisements containing the trademark or one of its spelling variations may be determined and merged into the set of advertisements associated with the trademark.
- For the discussion to follow, assume that the set of advertisements associated with the Hertz trademark owned by the Hertz rental car company includes two advertisements. As shown in
FIG. 9 ,advertisement 910 is associated with the provider of travel accommodations Expedia andadvertisement 920 is associated with the car rental company Avis. Assume thatadvertisements - For each advertisement in the set of advertisements, it may be determined whether the advertisement contains a trademark violation (block 740). As shown in
FIG. 8 , the advertisement may be processed by the catch filters (block 810). For example, the advertisement may be processed by catch country filter 610 (FIG. 6 ), catchadvertiser ID filter 620, catchaddress filter 630, and catchphrase filter 640. The processing by the catch filters may indicate whether a particular advertisement contains a possible trademark violation (block 820). - Assume that
catch country filter 610 indicates that the Hertz trademark is registered in the United States and Canada, catchadvertiser ID filter 620 and catchaddress filter 630 are empty, and catchphrase filter 640 includes the following catch keywords: car, automobile, truck, rental, rent, hire, auto, car rental, automobile rental, truck rental, rental cars, and rental trucks, as shown inFIG. 10 . Whenadvertisements catch country filter 610, catchadvertiser ID filter 620, catchaddress filter 630, and catchphrase filter 640, bothadvertisements - For example, catch
country filter 610 may determine that bothadvertisements advertisements Catch country filter 610 may then pass both advertisements to catchadvertiser ID filter 620 and/or catchaddress filter 630. Because both catchadvertiser ID filter 620 and catchaddress filter 630 are empty,advertisements phrase filter 640. Catchphrase filter 640 may determine that bothadvertisements advertisements - If the advertisement does not contain a trademark violation, the advertisement may be moved to the release pile (block 830). Otherwise, the advertisement may be processed by the release filters (block 840). For example, the advertisement may be processed by release advertiser ID filter 650 (
FIG. 6 ),release address filter 660, and releasephrase filter 670. The processing by the release filters may indicate whether a particular advertisement contains a trademark violation (block 850). - Assume that release
advertiser ID filter 650 contains theadvertiser account ID 123567 associated with Expedia,release address filter 660 contains the addresses hertz.com and hertzaudio.de, and releasephrase filter 670 includes the following release keywords: audio, radio, frequency, and electronics, as shown inFIG. 10 . Whenadvertisements advertiser ID filter 650,release address filter 660, and releasephrase filter 670,advertisement 910 may be identified as not containing a trademark violation andadvertisement 920 may be identified as containing a trademark violation. - For example, release
advertiser ID filter 650 may determine that it contains the account ID associated with Expedia, but not Avis. Therefore, releaseadvertiser ID filter 650 may moveadvertisement 910 to the release pile and may passadvertisement 920 to releaseaddress filter 660.Release address filter 660 may determine that the address associated with advertisement 920 (i.e., avis.com) does not match one of its addresses (i.e., hertz.com or hertzaudio.com) and, therefore, may passadvertisement 920 to releasephrase filter 670.Release phrase filter 670 may determine thatadvertisement 920 does not match any of its release keywords. In other words, releasephrase filter 670 may determine that the content and/or keywords ofadvertisement 920 do not match its release keywords. Accordingly,release phrase filter 670 may moveadvertisement 920 to the catch pile. - As explained above, when the release filters determine that an advertisement does not contain a trademark violation, the advertisement may be moved to the release pile (block 860). When the release filters determine that an advertisement does contain a trademark violation, the advertisement may be moved to the catch pile (block 870).
- Returning to
FIG. 7 , an advertisement that is identified as containing a trademark violation (i.e., an advertisement in the catch pile) may be deactivated (block 750). In one implementation, an infringing advertisement may be submitted to a disapproval system that may change the status of the advertisement (e.g., deactivate it) so it may no longer be displayed to end users. - The disapproval system may notify the advertiser associated with this advertisement of deactivation of the infringing advertisement. The advertiser may be given the option of revising the text in the infringing advertisement, or submitting an explanation of why it believes the use of the trademark should be permitted. If the explanation is satisfactory, the human operator may revise the corresponding filter pipeline so that similar advertisements in the future will not be incorrectly identified as containing trademark violations.
- An advertisement that is identified as not containing a trademark violation (i.e., an advertisement in the release pile) may be provided for serving (block 760). For example, the advertisement may be provided to an advertisement serving system, such as ad server 230 (
FIG. 2 ). The advertisement serving system may display the advertisement to end users that perform searches using a search engine, such as search engine 225 (FIG. 2 ), or access a document via a server, such asserver 220. The advertisement serving system may use existing techniques to determine which advertisements to display in connection with a set of search results or an accessed document. - Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention may detect violations in advertisements. Implementations described herein can detect violations that appear in the advertisement text itself and in the keywords used to trigger the display of the advertisement text. While the preceding description focused on trademark violations, the description equally applies to other types of violations, such as unauthorized use of copyrights, service marks, trade names, and/or other forms of intellectual property, or the use of restricted words.
