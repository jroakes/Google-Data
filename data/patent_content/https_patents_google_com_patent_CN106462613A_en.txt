The associated all users of symbol.Then, querying attributes engine 130 can be directed to those users to determine the weight of user property.
For example, as described above, the one or more user properties being associated with user can be associated with weight.For example, based on user
The weight of user property for determining through indicating interaction can based on the one or more documents being associated with user property and/
Or position through indicate interaction.In some embodiments, the weight of the user property of user can be based on and user and document
Larger set such as all documents interactive quantity compare, user and be associated with user property one or more
Document and/or the interactive quantity of position.For example, the weight of the user property of user can be based on following formula：
Weight=the interaction (document, user property) of user property/interaction (document)；
Wherein, interaction (document, user property) instruction user and the document that be associated with user property through indicating to interact
Amount；And wherein, interaction (document) instruction user is with another set such as all documents of document through indicating interactive quantity.
Such weight can be utilized as being associated and have submitted with user property being associated with query identifier
Inquiry user set user property weight.For example, weight can be represented as vector, wherein each in the vector
Value indicates the weight of the user property of a user in the user in set.Additionally, for example, weight can be that user's collection is fated
In user property weight and, average, median, and/or other statistical measures.For example, weight can be user's collection
The average of the weight of the user property in the middle of all users in conjunction.
At step 520, the weighting tolerance of the query identifier of user property is determined.Lay particular stress on tolerance to be based in step 510
The tolerance and the weight for being recognized based on the user property for recognizing at step 515 of the submission of the inquiry of place's identification.Typically
Ground, the weighting tolerance of the query identifier of user property indicates that the user with the user property is submitted to by the query identifier mark
The probability of the inquiry of knowledge.Usually, the probability of submission is by with the tolerance institute of the submission of the inquiry of identification at step 510
The submission number of instruction increases, and increases (wherein higher as the weight of the user property for recognizing at step 515 increases
Weight indicate attribute associate with user stronger).In some embodiments, lay particular stress on tolerance to be based in step 510
The tolerance of the submission of the inquiry of place's identification is with the weight of the user property of identification at step 515 relatively determining.For example, exist
The weight of the tolerance of the submission of the inquiry of step 510 place identification and the user property for recognizing at step 515 is the reality of vector
Apply in mode, laying particular stress on tolerance can be based on two vectorial dot product.Additionally, for example, the submission of the inquiry for recognizing at step 510
In the embodiment of the statistical measures that the weight of tolerance and the user property for recognizing at step 515 is such as average, partially
Severe amount can be based on the product of two tolerance.
In some embodiments, the weighting tolerance of query identifier Q1 of user property A can be based on following formula：
(submitting to (Q1, A)) * ((interaction (Dl, A)/interaction (A)),
Wherein：
(Q1, A)=user pair associated with attribute A (for example, as recognized in step 510) is submitted to be associated with Q1
Inquiry submission amount；
The user of interaction (Dl, A)=be associated with attribute A and the one or more texts being associated with user property A (D1)
The interactive quantity of shelves；And
The associated user of interaction (A)=and attribute A (for example, as recognized in step 515) is interacted with all documents
Amount.
Based on two formulas above, weighting tolerance is bigger, and user property will be stronger with associating for query identifier.Conversely, partially
Severe amount is less, and user property is weaker with associating for query identifier.Other equatioies, wherein, larger weighting degree can be utilized
The relatively weak rigidity of amount instruction user property and query identifier, and the less tolerance that lays particular stress on indicates relatively strong association.Additionally, being based on
Two formulas above, the weighting tolerance of query identifier Q1 of user property can take into account and be associated with user property one or
Multiple documents through indicating interaction (interaction (D1, A)), including may not identified in response to query identifier Q1 one or
Multiple queries and/or and the relevant document of one or more inquiries for being identified with query identifier Q1 not otherwise.?
