Abstract
Co-selected images are labeled based on a topic score that is a measure of relevance of the co-selected image to a first topic to which a reference image belongs. The first topic to which the reference image belongs is identified based on a reference label associated with the reference image. The co-selected images are images that are selected for presentation subsequent to selection of the reference image during a user session. The co-selected images are identified based on selection data for user sessions in which the reference image was selected for presentation. The topic score is generated based on a frequency of selection of the co-selected image. Image search results for a second topic can be filtered to remove images that are labeled as belonging to the first topic or the image search results can be reordered to adjust the presentation positions at which images are referenced based on the topic to which the images belong.
Description
Technical field
The disclosure relates to data processing, relates to particularly Images Classification.
Background technology
User can be positioned at obtainable image on the Internet by search inquiry being submitted to search engine.Search inquiry can be text query, and it comprises that describing user is just attempting the word of the image subject of location.Search system is identified the image corresponding to this theme, and the picture search result of quoting comprising identified image is provided.Image can be for example based on the label of image correlation connection and/or the webpage that therewith represents at image on image near the text that occurs identify.
The image of identifying can be the image for example representing together with webpage.Many different classes of webpages can comprise the image of identifying in response to search inquiry.For example, image provides together with the webpage that can be issued by many Different Individual, described webpage such as web blog (" blog "), social network page and newsgroup.For example, in individual domain (, www.example.com), may there are thousands of webpages, wherein many have different independent authors.
Because a large amount of different authors create the webpage that is arranged in same territory, may difficulty, by the Images Classification providing by this territory for belonging to common theme.For example, in single blog territory, user may issue for scope from moving to politics, bring up the blog of the theme of suggestion or even undisguised (for example, pornographic) theme.Therefore,, if be classified as and belonged to common theme by obtainable each image in common territory, image may accurately not classified.
And the label of image correlation connection and/or near the text occurring image inaccurately Description Image theme or between different themes, have ambiguity.The image of the Babe Ruth for example, occurring in blog can be associated with text " shellfish ratio ".Although the text and image-related, the piggy that likely, image may be Babe Ruth, play the part of the performer of Babe Ruth, act the leading role in the film of " shellfish ratio " by name, or even undisguised image.
The quality that may reduce picture search result with the more incoherent image of theme of user's inquiry is provided.For example, in the time comprising that the image of undisguised content (, warm description) is cited in the Search Results to the inquiry for this undisguised content does not respond, this is especially true.For example, align the user of the image of search Babe Ruth, comprise that the Search Results in response to the search inquiry to " shellfish is than film " of undisguised image may significantly reduce the quality of Search Results.
Accurately classified when image, while making to inquire about incoherent image and can be filtered or suppress with user, can be improved the quality of picture search result.
Summary of the invention
Images Classification system is selected the theme that belongs to the image based on previous selection of data analysis to Images Classification and tag (to label) to image.Then can carry out filtering image Search Results with these labels, with remove to except search inquiry for theme the quoting of the more relevant image of theme.In addition, can filter for example, all images for theme (, undisguised content) with label, unless user selects to make quoting of these images represent.The position that represents that image quotes in picture search result adjusted in the theme that can also belong to based on image with label.
Generally speaking, an aspect of theme of describing in this manual can realize in the method that comprises following action: quote label for quoting Image Acquisition, quote label and be and specify the label of quoting the first theme that image belongs to; In data handling system, be identified in and quote image during it and be selected for the user conversation representing, each user conversation is the period that the selection of image is associated into session collection; In data handling system, be selected for for quoting image recognition the co-selected image representing during user conversation, co-selected image is selecteed image after to the selection of quoting image; For each co-selected image, in data handling system, based on the frequency of selection about the co-selected image of quoting image is generated to theme score value, theme divides the tolerance of the correlativity of value representation co-selected image and the first theme; And the co-selected image with the theme score value that meets threshold value theme score value is tagged as belonging to the first theme.This of this aspect and other embodiment comprise corresponding system, device and computer program.
These and other embodiment can comprise one or more in following characteristics alternatively.The method may further include following action: for user conversation is identified quoting the first select time of image; The subsequently select time of identification to the co-selected image of selecting during user conversation; And be only co-selected image by the image recognition with the select time subsequently in the threshold time section with respect to the first select time, wherein user conversation has Session Time section, and threshold time section is less than Session Time section.
Theme score value can generate by obtain initial theme score value for co-selected image, and each initial theme score value is the initial relativity measurement of image and the first theme; For co-selected image obtains common choice data, common choice data are specified with respect to the selection to co-selected image to the selection of quoting image or other co-selected images; Function based on initial theme score value and common choice data calculates for co-selected image the theme score value upgrading; Determine whether to occur stop condition; In the time not yet there is stop condition, the theme score value based on common choice data and the previously renewal of calculating calculates the theme score value of other renewal; In the time there is stop condition, the theme score value based on upgrading is classified to co-selected image; And the theme score value wherein tagging based on upgrading.
Specific embodiment of the present invention can be implemented, to realize one or more in following advantage.Based on the common choice data of quoting image with respect to referenced subject matter, the theme that non-classified image can be belonged to is identified as and belongs to referenced subject matter.The image that is identified as belonging to referenced subject matter can be filtered out from picture search result.With respect to the image that is not identified as belonging to referenced subject matter, belong to the higher or lower position that represents that the image of referenced subject matter can be selected in picture search result and represent.Based on the common choice data of quoting image with respect to referenced subject matter, can be that image tags with the label corresponding to referenced subject matter.Based on to have for pornographic compared with the selection subsequently to image after the selection of the image of high likelihood, can and tag as pornographic image image recognition.Each image in image corpus can be classified based on it in the selection with respect to the selection of quoting image of referenced subject matter.

Embodiment
Images Classification system is selected the theme that belongs to the image based on previous selection of data analysis to Images Classification and tags image.Then can carry out filtering image Search Results with these labels, with remove to except search inquiry for theme the quoting of the more relevant image of theme.In addition, can filter for example, all images for theme (, undisguised content) with label, unless user selects to make quoting of these images represent.
Be described below provide therein search service at thread environment.About this at thread environment, by based on selecting data to be described as the subsystem of search system for the tagged Images Classification system of image.But Images Classification subsystem can be independent of image search system to be realized.
Fig. 1 is that search system 110 provides the block diagram of the example context 100 of search service therein.Example context 100 comprises network, and such as LAN (Local Area Network) (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet or its combination, it connects website 104, subscriber equipment 106 and search system 110.Can comprise thousands of website 104 and subscriber equipment 106 at thread environment 100.
Resource is any data that can be provided and be associated with resource address by network 102 by website 104.Resource comprises html page, word processing document and Portable Document format (PDF) document, image, video and the source of feeding, and only lists.Resource can comprise content, for example word, phrase, image and sound, and can comprise embedded information (such as metamessage and hyperlink) and/or embedded instruction (such as JavaScript script).
Each resource has can be by addressable memory location of unique identification.Addressable position is by the URLs addressing such as URL(uniform resource locator) (URL).
For the ease of searching for these resources, search system 110 is carried out recognition resource by the resource crawling and index publisher provides on webpage 104.The resource that can answer in contrast based on data about the data of resource is carried out index.The index of resource and alternatively the copy of buffer memory be stored in indexed cache 112.
For the search of content of text, the relevant score value of the resource of Search Results based on identifying with Search Results carrys out rank, described score value such as information retrieval (" IR ") score value, and alternatively each resource with respect to the independent rank (" page rank " score value) of other resources.In some embodiments, IR score value calculates from the dot product of the proper vector corresponding with search inquiry 109 and resource, and the rank of Search Results is based upon the relevance score of the combination of IR score value and page quality score.Search Results 111 sorts according to these relevance score, and offers subscriber equipment according to this order.
For for image and use the search of text query as input, search system 110 can be by the relevance score of resource with to be embedded in the relevance feedback score value of the image in resource combined.Example relevance feedback score value is the score value obtaining from the selection rate of this image in the time that image is quoted in Search Results.Then represent for the Search Results that is embedded in the image in resource with these combination score values.
The search inquiry 109 of submitting to during user conversation is stored in the data storage such as history data store 114.The selection data of the action that specified response is taked in the Search Results providing during user conversation are also stored in the data storage such as history data store 114.These actions can comprise " residence time " that whether Search Results is selected and/or be associated with selection (i.e. time period between selecting and selecting subsequently).Can the search inquiry submitting to during user conversation 109 be mapped to the resource of identification in Search Results 111 and the action that user takes by the data that are stored in history data store 114, for example, during user conversation, select the Resources list of the sequence for representing.
User conversation specifies the data of the action of taking about resource to be associated with common Session ID period during being.The period of this user conversation can be described to measure by the quantity of time, the action taked or some of user action.For example, user conversation can be included in one minute, one hour, one day or during any other time period about the user action of resource.Similarly, user conversation can comprise that the user to resource of number of thresholds selects.
Each user conversation can be associated with unique Session ID.For example one or more generation the based on following of unique Session ID: other data (for example, user conversation produces geographic area certainly) of the persond eixis symbol of user equipment identifiers, user conversation and the linguistic context of indicating user session.User equipment identifiers can be the anonymous identifier that the subscriber equipment 106 of for example answering in contrast with user conversation is associated, such as by anonymous cookie (, useing the anonymous text string of the identifier of user conversation as).Therefore, can make the action that occurs during user conversation and action produce from special user equipment 106 lose associated.
By the action occurring during specific user's session, such as the selection to image, be associated with identical unique Session ID.The other time data of the time that each action occurring during specific user's session can be occurred with indication action in addition, is associated.This time can be absolute time, the GMT (Greenwich mean time) occurring such as action, or with respect to the time of the beginning of user conversation or with respect to time of another user action.
The user session data that specifies in the action occurring during each user conversation can be stored in the data storage such as historical data 114.Can be identified in the image of selecting in order during specific user's session by user's session data, and identify the image that belongs to common theme based on its select progressively.
The image that user selects during specific user's session more may belong to same subject conventionally.Therefore be, more may belong to the theme identical with quoting image about the image of the co-selected image of quoting image about the co-selected image of quoting image than not.For example, not may be more pornographic image about the image of the co-selected image of pornographic image for quote the image ratio of co-selected image of image about pornographic.Similarly, may be more non-pornographic image for quote image about non-pornographic by the image of common choice.Therefore, for being classified as the theme that belongs to identical with quoting image with high confidence level about the image of quoting image or quoting the frequent co-selected image of image set.
In some embodiments, Images Classification subsystem 120 generates theme score value, and this theme divides value representation co-selected image to belong to the possibility of the theme identical with quoting image.The theme score value of co-selected image can be for example based on generating below: this image with quote image by the frequency of common choice with for example, with respect to the degree of approach (, time or the action between selecting) of the common choice to this image to the selection of quoting image.Referring to figs. 2 and 6-7, the method that generates theme score value is described respectively.
The co-selected image with threshold value theme score value is identified as belonging to the theme identical with quoting image.Threshold value theme score value for example can be designated as the theme score value of absolute theme score value or for example, the highest N number percent among other threshold values (, having the image of the highest M theme score value).
In some embodiments, the picture search result 111 search inquiry 109 being responded can be based on being filtered or resequencing to represent via the classification of Images Classification system 120.The grouped data (for example, label or theme mark) that for example, can make identification be identified as the image of pornographic image can be used search system 110.Search system 110 can be analyzed the picture search result in response to search inquiry 109 by this grouped data, to determine whether any image of being quoted by picture search result is pornographic image.Quoting of pornographic image can be removed or be represented in the not too significant position of Search Results, to increase the quality of Search Results.Such modification can subject in user preference.
Similarly, the picture search result generating for search inquiry 109 can be got rid of or select to treat the image of quoting in picture search result based on label.For example, search system 110 can be obtained the image relevant with search inquiry 109 with the label data that is stored in the memory location place joining to the image correlation in indexed cache 112.The image being associated to the label more relevant with search inquiry 109 can be identified as than more relevant with search inquiry 109 with the image of the image correlation connection of being not too correlated with search inquiry 109.
For example, if Images Classification subsystem 120 use text datas " baseball " tag for the image of Babe Ruth, will to compare the search inquiry 109 of " piggy film " more relevant to the search inquiry 109 to " baseball " for the image of Babe Ruth.Therefore, it is higher that the quoting of the image to Babe Ruth will occur in the picture search result to " baseball ", and can in the picture search result of search inquiry " piggy film ", not occur.
Fig. 2 is the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 200 for sorting images into theme.Process 200 can for example be realized by the Images Classification subsystem 120 of Fig. 1.
Quote label (202) for quoting Image Acquisition.In some embodiments, quoting label is to specify the label of quoting the referenced subject matter that image belongs to.Quoting label can be for example text label or the theme mark of indication referenced subject matter.For example, quoting label and can be represented by the data bit corresponding with referenced subject matter of binary value that is set to specify corresponding to referenced subject matter.As an alternative, quoting label can be the text data corresponding with quoting label.For example, can tag for pornographic image by text " undisguisedly " or " pornographic ".
In some embodiments, Manpower Estimate's device can be identified pornographic image, and to use this image recognition be pornographic image quotes label and tag for this pornographic image.In other embodiments, machine can be identified pornographic image, and correspondingly tags for it with quoting label.And then evaluator can be to quoting label checking accuracy.
Quoting label can obtain corresponding to the data storage of the label of image from storage, or based on generating with the data of image correlation connection.The label of image can determine that whether the visual signature of image is indicated pornographic image and/or determined with the text of image correlation connection whether indicate pornographic image with text analyzing, generates by image processing techniques.
Quote quoting label and can for example generating based on image processing techniques of image.In some embodiments, can be by the visual signature of image (, color and/or texture) with previously for example, compared with the visual signature of quoting that label tags or being identified as belonging to the image of the theme (, being identified as pornographic image) of quoting label and representing.For example, a kind of method of identification pornographic image is the pixel portion (for example, quantity or number percent) for " skin pixels " (that is, having the pixel of the color-values corresponding with the colour of skin) of recognition image.In the time that this pixel portion exceedes threshold value, can be pornographic image by image recognition, and use corresponding to the label of quoting of pornographic theme and tag for it.
Quoting label can also be for example generate based on being located near the text data of quoting image of quoting on the webpage that image therewith represents.For example, can analyze the text occurring in the pixel of number of thresholds of quoting image, with identify may with the theme of quoting image correlation.Quoting label can also be based on generating with other texts of quoting image correlation connection.For example, quoting label can be based on being included in text in the filename of quoting image, point to image link anchor text or with quote the text that image is clearly associated and generate.
Publisher can clearly be associated text with quoting image, so that be relevant to the search inquiry to particular topic by image recognition.For example, publisher can be to baseball player's image specify text " baseball ", the possibility being identified in comprising the search inquiry of word " baseball " to increase this image response.
In some embodiments, require to quote the threshold value possibility of quoting label and there is accurate description and quote the content of image of image.The accuracy of the label of image can for example be determined based on tag feedback.Tag feedback is obtained, is specified and quote label or provide at label and quote the data of the tolerance of the correlativity between image for image from user.
Tag feedback can from requested for image tag or confirm image existing label user receive.As an alternative, tag feedback can receive from being provided image and requested selection image anonymous the most relevant to it and/or the most incoherent theme.The list of image and M theme for example, can be provided to user.User can select of content of the most relevant to image or the accurate description image in M theme.Can assemble with the user of the maximally related theme of content of image and select the theme of determining that image belongs to.For example, the most relevant to image if the user of threshold percentage is chosen as particular topic, this particular topic can be chosen as to the theme that image belongs to.
Can also analyze to determine that the existing label of quoting image is possibility accurately to tag feedback.The existing label of image is that possibility can be based on being a part for the user feedback of the accurate label of image accurately by existing tag recognition.For example, be the accurate label for image if existing label is indicated in the user feedback of threshold percentage, can be the label of quoting of quoting image by existing tag recognition.And then, can be to belong to quote the theme that label is specified by quoting image recognition.
In some embodiments, by image recognition be belong to quote the certain customers feedback of the theme that image specifies can be as quoting the tolerance of image for the intensity of theme.For example, label is that possibility can be the probability of quoting image that belongs to the theme of label appointment as image accurately.Image is that the possibility of quoting image can and then be used as the weight of recognition image as the intensity of quoting image of the specified theme of label.With reference to as described in figure 4, in the time generating theme score value for other images, can use image as the intensity of quoting image as below.
Be identified in and quote image during it and be selected for the user conversation (204) representing.During it, image is selected for this user conversation of representing and can identifies with the unique Session ID being associated about the selection data of quoting image by identification.For example, can be for quoting the selection data in the historical data 114 that Image Acquisition is stored in Fig. 1.And then, can be selected for the user conversation representing to quoting image during being identified in it with unique Session ID analysis of selecting data to be associated.With reference to figure 3, the generation about the selection data of user conversation is described in more detail.
Be identified in be selected for during user conversation represent about the co-selected image (206) of quoting image.The selection data of the image that in some embodiments, co-selected image can be based on about being associated with unique Session ID of user conversation are identified.For example, can obtain in the historical data 114 of Fig. 1 with the selection data that are associated about unique Session ID of quoting image.To selecting data analysis with identification and the image of quoting image common choice.For example, can determine that image is before to the selection of quoting image or is selected for and represents afterwards to being included in about the time data analysis in the selection data of image.After to the selection of quoting image, be selected for the image representing and be identified as co-selected image.
Whether during another user conversation, be selected and make definite (208) quoting image.This determines for example whether to be associated to make with another unique Session ID about the selection data of quoting image by determining.In the time being associated with another unique Session ID about the selection data of quoting image, quoting image and can be identified as during another user conversation selected.If it is selected during another user conversation to quote image, be identified in be selected for during this user conversation represent about the co-selected image (206) of quoting image.
When quoting image when selected during another user conversation or after all other user conversations have been identified, based on generating theme score value (210) with respect to the selection to co-selected image of the selection of quoting image is come for each co-selected image.In some embodiments, theme score value is the tolerance of the correlativity of co-selected image and theme.Continue each selection to co-selected image after the selection of quoting image having been increased to co-selected image and having quoted image correlation, therefore belong to the possibility of the theme identical with quoting image.For example, the co-selected image of more frequently being selected than another co-selected image after to the selection of quoting image is than still less the frequent co-selected image of selecting may be more relevant with the theme identical with quoting image.
Co-selected image and the possibility of quoting image correlation can also be based on being associated with the selection of co-selected image the residence time.For example, the co-selected image with the residence time longer than another co-selected image more may with the Topic relative identical with quoting image check co-selected image because user spends the more time with long residence time more.
Co-selected image with quote image correlation possibility can also based on to the selection of co-selected image with to the degree of approach of selection of quoting image.The degree of approach of selecting can be described to measure with any other of the quantity of chronomere, user action or user conversation.
For example, for the co-selected image of selecteed the first image after to the selection of quoting image than another co-selected image for selecteed the 4th image after to the selection of quoting image more may with the Topic relative identical with quoting image.Therefore the co-selected image of, first being selected after to the selection of quoting image more may belong to the theme identical with quoting image than the co-selected image of selecting after a while.
In some embodiments, image must be selected in the threshold time section with respect to the selection of quoting image, to be identified as co-selected image.For example, when user conversation lasts longer than therein the image of selecting subsequently while being identified as the period of co-selected image, can determine whether selecteed image is the co-selected image of quoting image about this after to the selection of quoting image by threshold time section.
In some embodiments, the theme score value of co-selected image can be the result with respect to the function of the frequency to the selection of quoting image and/or the degree of approach to the selection of co-selected image.For example, theme score value can be the summation in the total selection to co-selected image to after the selection of quoting image.Similarly, theme score value can be corresponding to image with respect to it by the quantity of quoting image of common choice.For example, be the theme score value can about ten images of quoting the co-selected image of image with " 10 ", but can there is the theme score value of " 5 " about five images of quoting the co-selected image of image.
Each selection of co-selected image can be given weight with respect to the factor of the degree of approach to the selection of quoting image by this selection of indication.For example, each selection can be given weight by the factor 1/ (selection quantity), makes immediately to having the weight of 1 (, 1/1) to the selection of co-selected image after the selection of quoting image.Similarly, to second after the selection of quoting image and the 3rd co-selected image by the weight respectively with 1/2 and 1/3.For example object, provide described weight factor.Weight factor can be that co-selected image is selected any ratio or the function with respect to the degree of approach to the selection of quoting image.
In some embodiments, can be by shining upon with weighted graph with respect to the selection to co-selected image to the selection of quoting image, be convenient to generate theme score value for co-selected image.Quote image and co-selected image and represented by the node in weighted graph, and represent the limit connected node of the select progressively of co-selected image.With reference to figure 4-5, weighting map generalization is described in more detail.
For thering is the co-selected image of the theme score value that meets threshold value theme score value tag (212).In some embodiments, in the time that theme score value meets or exceedes threshold value theme score value, meet threshold value theme score value.Threshold value theme score value for example can be designated as the theme score value of absolute theme score value or for example, the highest N number percent among other threshold values (, having the image of the highest M theme score value).
In some embodiments, be the co-selected image theme that belongs to identical with quoting image so that co-selected image is identified as that tags.For example, coupling can be quoted to the text data of quoting label and the common choice image correlation connection of image.The theme mark that as an alternative, can be provided for co-selected image is identified as co-selected image the theme that belongs to identical with quoting image.Can by tag storage with the memory location place of common choice image correlation connection, and it can be used to the other system such as search system or subsystem.
Fig. 3 generates the also example context 300 of index user session data therein.Images Classification subsystem 120 and search system 110 are represented as direct communication in Fig. 3, but Images Classification subsystem 120 can be realized as by network 102 and communicate by letter with search system 110.
User conversation is generally initiated by subscriber equipment 106.For example, subscriber equipment 106 can be submitted picture search inquiry or another request to Search Results to by network 102.Request can be associated with unique Session ID, and is for example processed by search engine 110.Search engine 110 provides the picture search result 302 that search inquiry is responded to subscriber equipment 106.Picture search result 302 comprises result images 302-1-302-N, and it is quote (for example, the thumbnail) that searched system 110 is identified as to the image relevant to search inquiry.
The user session data of identification search inquiry and the image of being quoted by picture search result are associated with unique Session ID of user conversation, and are stored in historical data 114.User session data can comprise time data, time (for example, received time of search inquiry) that its indicating user session is initiated and/or time of Search Results 111 is provided to subscriber equipment 106.
The user of subscriber equipment 106 can be from picture search result 302 selection result image 302-1-302-N one or more.Each selection to result images 302-1-302-N generates the request to the specified resource location of selected result images.For example, can generate the request of the webpage that image that result images 302-1 is quoted therewith represents to the selection of result images 302-1.And then, can provide webpage for representing to subscriber equipment 106.
By network, each selection to result images 302-1-302-N is offered to image search system 110 as selection data 304.Select data 304 to comprise to specify unique Session ID data (for example, ID1, ID2 ..., ID3), described unique Session ID identification is corresponding to the user conversation of selection.Select data 304 also comprise for example selection based on to image result 302-1-302-N, identification be selected for the image representing data (for example, IS11, IS12 ..., IS1N).Select data 304 to may further include each in specify image to be selected for the time data of the time representing.
In some embodiments, Images Classification subsystem 120 use selection data build weighted graph 400, select to shine upon with respect to the total to co-selected image to the selection of quoting image.And then, can classify to co-selected image with weighted graph 400.
Fig. 4 is the diagram of the weighted graph 400 that generates by selection data.In some embodiments, weighted graph 400 is generated by Images Classification system 120.For example, Images Classification system 120 can be obtained selection data from historical data 120, and it specifies in during multiple user conversations quoting the selection of image and to the selection of co-selected image about quoting image.Images Classification subsystem 120 defines the node in weighted graph 400, and image and co-selected image are quoted in its expression.And then Images Classification subsystem 120 is based on selecting data to generate and increasing progressively the limit weight between the node that represents the node of selecting subsequently.Once weighted graph 400 is generated, it can be for representing that based on being connected to node to other common choices and the weighting limit of node to the co-selected image of quoting image classify to this co-selected image.
Weighted graph also comprises node 410-420, and it represents about the co-selected image of quoting image.For example, each in node 410-420 is expressed as about the image of co-selected image of quoting image 402.
The node that represents the image of selecting is in order connected by limit in weighted graph.For example, node 402 is connected to node 410 by limit 450, and its expression is selected the order user of the co-selected image of quoting image and represented by node 410.Similarly, limit 451 represents continue the select progressively to the co-selected image being represented by node 411 to after the selection of the co-selected image being represented by node 410.
Limit is worked the node being derived from and is called as source node, and the node that Bian Qi stops is called as destination node.Continue example above, the source node on limit 450 is reference nodes 402, and destination node is node 410.Similarly, node 410 is the source nodes on limit 451, and node 411 is destination nodes.Each limit in weighted graph 400 is represented by the arrow that points to destination node.
The mutual select progressively to the image being represented by node is indicated on two-way limit.For example, reference node 402 is connected by two-way limit 452 with 418.Two-way limit 452 indicates user to quoting image to select, the selection of the co-selected image that heel represents node 418 and selecting quoting second of image.As an alternative, substitute two-way limit, can use a pair of unidirectional limit.
Each in limit can have weight, the quantity of the select progressively of the image that its indication is represented by source and destination node respectively.For example, if the image being represented by node 410 is selected 10 times after to the selection of quoting image, limit 450 can have and 10 weights that selection is corresponding.
The selection that the weight on limit can be identified in response to each and be increased for example increment constant, or the function of the quantity that weight can be based on selecting increases.For example, the weight on limit can be logarithmic function or the index of the quantity of select progressively corresponding to the quantity of the select progressively by the represented image of source and destination node or weight.
Immediately to the selection of co-selected image can more be indicated and the image of quoting image correlation than selecteed image after to the selection of one or more other co-selected images after the selection of quoting image.For example, node 412 is illustrated in selecteed co-selected image after the selection to quoting the co-selected image that image 402 and node 410 represent.Therefore,, owing to selecting the action between two parties of the image that represents of node 410, the selection of the image that node 412 is represented can be compared the more not indicating image and the correlativity of quoting image 402 of selection of the image that node 410 represents.
In some embodiments, the weight on each limit can be adjusted based on itself and the degree of approach of quoting image.For example, limit weight can the degree of approach based on itself and reference node 402 promote by lifting factor.For example, for the limit that reference node 402 is connected to the node 510,417,418 and 419 that represents common choice node, lifting factor can be the highest.The for example quantity of the node based between limit and reference node, for the limit of keeping off with reference node 402, can reduce lifting factor.
In some embodiments, the weight on limit or reference node that can be based on about co-selected image in response to the amount of selecting limit weight to increase quote weight.Quote weight and be standardization or be adjusted at the factor of the importance that the image after the selection to quoting image selects.Quoting weight can be based on determining that to analyzing about the tag feedback of quoting image quoting image is accurately identified the possibility for belonging to referenced subject matter.
For example, based on tag feedback, quote image 402 and can for example, be identified as pornographic image with 0.7 probability (, 70% in tag feedback will be quoted image 402 and be identified as pornographic image), can be identified as pornographic image with 0.6 probability and quote image 460.Therefore, quote image 402 and can be assigned with 0.7 the weight of quoting, can be assigned with 0.6 the weight of quoting and quote image 480.
The incremental change that for example can be increased by the limit weight of quoting weight and adjust to co-selected image.Possibility based on quoting image and belong to theme is adjusted the incremental change that limit weight is increased, and is convenient to the direct comparison of the limit weight of the co-selected image to quote image about the difference with the different possibilities that belong to referenced subject matter.
Continue example above, quote image 402 than quoting image 460 and there is the higher possibility for pornographic image.Therefore, immediately the selection to image to after the selection of quoting image 402 than immediately to after the selection of quoting image 460 the selection of another image is more indicated to selected image is pornographic image.Therefore, about the co-selected image of quoting image 402 (for example, 418) limit (for example, 452) weight in response to single selection by the co-selected image than about quoting image 460 (for example, 560) weight on limit (for example, 570) is more in response to single selection increase.Limit weight these increase represent these quote in image 402 and 460 each be accurately identified the relative possibility into pornographic image.
In some embodiments, once build figure, the machine processes that just belongs to the possibility of referenced subject matter based on the represented image of recognition node to distribute initial weight for each in node.Then adjust initial weight based on common choice data.
As mentioned above, each in image belongs to visual signature that the possibility of referenced subject matter can be based on to image, the analysis of other data of the theme that belongs to text and the indicating image of image correlation connection determines.In these embodiments, for it, node is that the limit in source can the weight of quoting based on this node be endowed weight in the mode that is similar to aforesaid way.
Fig. 5 is the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 500 for generating weighted graph.Weighted graph is for carrying out the relation between recognition image based on the selecteed image selecting sequence of image and the degree of approach during common user conversation.Weighted graph is generated to comprise the node that represents to quote the reference node of image and represent co-selected image.Weighted graph comprises the limit that is illustrated in the select progressively to image during common user conversation.Selection data about many different user sessions can be focused and represent in weighted graph.Process 500 is described with reference to the single image of quoting, but can utilize many differences to quote image realizes.Process 500 can for example be realized by the Images Classification subsystem 120 of Fig. 1.
In weighted graph, will quote image representation is reference node (502).In some embodiments, quoting image is the image that is identified as belonging to referenced subject matter.For example, quote image can be based on corresponding with the pornographic theme of the quoting image correlation connection image of quoting label and be identified as pornographic image.Quoting image can be for example store to identify from memory image with corresponding to the data of the label of image.Spread all over the description of process 500, the node of presentation video can for example, be characterized by the feature identical with the image of its expression (, quote label and select data).Therefore, alternatively mention node and the image self of presentation video.
Between recognition phase, quote the selecteed user conversation of image (504).In some embodiments, user conversation can be based on identifying about the selection data of quoting image.For example, can be from the selection data identification about quoting image to the selection of quoting image.And then, can be with identifying other images with the selection data that are associated with identical unique Session ID with the unique Session ID being associated about the selection data of quoting image.Can for example obtain from history data store 114 about the selection data of quoting image.
Quote therein the selecteed user conversation of image once identify, be just identified in the selection subsequently (506) to co-selected image during user conversation.As mentioned above, the selection subsequently of co-selected image can the selection data based on being associated with unique Session ID identical with quoting image be identified.Can comprise the time data of specifying the time that the selection of co-selected image is occurred with respect to the selection to quoting image about the selection data of user conversation.Therefore, can service time data co-selected image is identified as during common user conversation at selecteed image of the time to after the selection of quoting image.
For example, if quote image the morning on January 1st, 2009 12:00 selected, each image that has the selection data that are associated with unique Session ID identical with quoting image and have a time data of specifying another time that is later than 12:00 in the morning on January 1st, 2009 is about the co-selected image of quoting image.
In some embodiments, only in the threshold time section to after the selection of quoting image, selecteed co-selected image is identified as about the co-selected image of quoting image.Threshold time section easy to use for have be longer than during the selection data obtained of the user conversation of duration of co-selected image time period to be identified.
For example, may be that the user conversation with the duration of one hour has obtained selection data.But in application-specific, co-selected image can be defined as only selecteed those images in to 10 of the selection of quoting image minutes.In this case, can determine whether selecteed image can be identified as about the co-selected image of quoting image during this hour user conversation by threshold time section.For example, can compare by the selection to this image with to time and the threshold time section quoted between the selection of image.If the time between relatively selecting is less than or equal to threshold value, this image is identified as about the co-selected image of quoting image.
In some embodiments, can be included in the list of selecteed image during user conversation about the selection data of specific user's session.This list can for example be sorted according to image selecteed order during user conversation.Therefore,, once identification is to quoting the selection of image in the selection data about user conversation, the each image being cited after quoting image just can be identified as co-selected image.
Identification represents the node (508) of co-selected image.In some embodiments, for example, in computer memory, define the node that represents co-selected image in response to the selection of the first identification.In these embodiments, after in computer memory, definition represents the node of co-selected image, this node of computer memory location recognition that can be defined within from this node.For example, node can define in response to being chosen in weighted graph of initial identification, then for being chosen in weighted graph of identification subsequently of co-selected image identified.In other embodiments, each image in image corpus is represented by the node in weighted graph at first, and does not consider whether image is co-selected image.
When identification is during to the selection of co-selected image, node can for example for example, be identified based on unique identifier corresponding with co-selected image and that be associated with node (, URL).For example, unique image identifier can generate for each co-selected image, and is associated with image and its corresponding node.When identification is during to the selection of co-selected image, the node being associated with unique identifier can be identified as representing co-selected image.Each in co-selected image represents by the isolated node in weighted graph, and node in weighted graph can be illustrated in during single or multiple user conversations about the co-selected image of quoting image.
For co-selected image increases progressively limit weight (510).In some embodiments, in the time generating weighted graph, can be initialized to 0 (, not having limit between node) in each internodal limit weight.Therefore, the first select progressively of co-selected image had generation the limit of the weight (for example, weight 1) corresponding with standard unit.The other select progressively of co-selected image will be increased progressively to the weight on the limit of connected node similarly with the incremental change corresponding with standard unit.As mentioned above, the weight that limit weight is incremented can be based on the adjustment of getting off: lifting factor, node quote weight or for adjusting another factor that just it is increased progressively the relative importance of the selection of limit weight.
Whether the other selection of co-selected image is still made to definite (512) about this user conversation.Selecting in addition can be immediately in the selection to after the selection of quoting image or continue the selection to after the selection of other images.Select in addition to be for example associated to identify with the unique Session ID corresponding to user conversation based on selecting.
When to the other selection of co-selected image during still about this user conversation, identification represents the node (508) of another co-selected image.When to the other selection of co-selected image during no longer about this user conversation, to quoting, whether image is selected during another user conversation makes optional selection (514).As mentioned above, can be for example based on identifying about the selection data of quoting image to another selection of quoting image.In the time that another selection of quoting image is identified, be identified in the selection subsequently (506) to co-selected image during user conversation.When be not identified to quote image another select time, process 500 finishes (516).
Once generation weighted graph, just can upgrade to represent other selection to quoting image and about the co-selected image of quoting in addition image to it.Weighted graph can be satisfied to periodically update based on update condition.Update condition can be for example time, user action, user conversation or other tolerance of the specified amount from final updating.
The limit of the node that is connected to presentation video that can be based in weighted graph is come to generate theme score value for co-selected image.As described with reference to figure 2, in some embodiments, the theme score value of specific image can be the summation that is connected to the limit weight of the node of presentation video.In the time that the theme score value of image meets threshold value theme score value, this image is tagged as belonging to theme.And then this image can be identified as the new image of quoting, and in weighted graph, be defined so.
In other embodiments, each in can the image represented for the node in weighted graph generates theme score value iteratively, until stop condition occurs.As described below, generate iteratively theme score value so that spread all over weighted graph and propagate theme score value.
For example, in the time that each the change of theme score value in image during one or more iteration is less than threshold value and changes (that is, convergent), stop condition can occur.In these embodiments, theme score value can belong to the possibility of referenced subject matter and generate iteratively about the common choice data of image based on quoting image and/or other images.The possibility that each in image belongs to referenced subject matter can be represented as the vector of theme score value.Initial theme score value for example can be corresponding to the above-mentioned weight of quoting.
Fig. 6 A wherein can store the also sample table 600 of the theme score value of tracing figure image set.Table 600 comprises row 602, the node identifier of each node in the weighted graph of storage identification therein.Table 600 also comprises row 604, therein the storage theme score value corresponding with the node of identification in row 602.The theme score value providing in table 600 is the initial theme score value of corresponding with node identifier 702a-702e respectively node.
Initial theme divides each represented image of node of identification in value representation row 602 to belong to the initial possibility of referenced subject matter.Theme score value can be from 0.00 to 1.00 value, and the image wherein with theme score value 0.00 is the known image that does not belong to referenced subject matter, and the image with theme score value 1.00 is known images that belong to referenced subject matter.
In some embodiments, be identified as belonging to the image of referenced subject matter (, quote image) initial theme score value in each can be set at first 1.0, and the initial theme score value of other images is set to 0.0 or some other default values.By following iterative process, can calculate final theme score value for each being not recognized as in the image that belongs to referenced subject matter at first.
In other embodiments, based on each the initial possibility that belongs to referenced subject matter in image, for each in image is specified initial theme score value.Each in image belongs to the initial possibility of referenced subject matter can be for example based on definite to get off: tag feedback, image analysis technology and text analysis technique, its each be described with reference to figure 2 in the above.
In some embodiments, can be co-selected image definition common choice matrix during one or more user conversations about the common choice data of image.For example, can be the value in N × N common choice matrix about the right common choice data of each image, wherein N is the quantity of the image selected during one or more user conversations.
About the right common choice data of image in for example can specify image one select tolerance (for example, amounting to select progressively) in the select progressively rate to after the selection of another image or for right another of image.Common choice data can be directed or unidirectional.In some embodiments, can be corresponding to the weight on the right limit of the node of the connection presentation video in weighted graph about the right common choice data of image.
Fig. 6 B is the sample table 650 that wherein can store the common choice data of definition common choice matrix.Table 650 comprises for example, row and column about each node of selecting during one or more user conversations (, 702a-702e).About each image, the common choice data of (for example, node 702a and node 702c) are occupied and each corresponding cell in the image of this centering.When common choice data to image to can not obtain time, can be by value " 0.00 " input with the node of presentation video in corresponding cell.As described with reference to figure 2 in the above, identify about for example selection data based on about user conversation of common choice data that image is right.
Can use from the theme score value of table 600 with from the common choice data of common choice matrix 650 to come for the final theme score value of the image recognition of common choice in one or more user conversations.For example, the theme score value of computing node and the product of common choice matrix iteratively, until stop condition occurs.
Fig. 7 A-7D is the exemplary weights figure at the difference place of the theme score value generative process of iteration.Iterative process can for example be carried out by the Images Classification subsystem 120 of Fig. 1.Fig. 7 A-7D illustrates the identification with respect to the single theme score value of the image of single referenced subject matter.But, calculate in can or thering is another figure of the node corresponding with node in weighted graph 700 at weighted graph 700 about the theme score value of other referenced subject matter.
With reference to figure 7A, weighted graph 700 is generated by Images Classification subsystem 120, and it comprises the initial theme score value of the node 702a-e corresponding with the initial theme score value of Fig. 6 A.For example, weighted graph 700 comprises the initial theme score value " 0.00 " and " 1.00 " that are respectively used to node 702a and 702b.Each has initial theme score value " 0.50 " node 702c-e.Similarly, each node between limit have and the corresponding weight of common choice data of specifying in the table 650 of Fig. 6 B.Use these initial theme score value and common choice data, for example product based on initial theme score value and common choice data of Images Classification subsystem 120 carrys out the theme score value upgrading for each generation in the represented image of node 702a-702e.
With reference to figure 7B, weighted graph 700 shows the theme score value of the renewal of each in node 702a-e after an iteration of the theme score value generative process of iteration.In this example, the theme score value of node 702a-b is separately fixed at " 0.00 " and " 1.00 ".The theme score value of node 702a is fixed on " 0.00 ", because the image that node 702a represents is identified as not belonging to referenced subject matter at first.The theme score value of node 702b is fixed on " 1.00 ", because the image that node 702b represents is identified as belonging to referenced subject matter (, referenced subject matter quote image) at first.
For example, based on the vectorial value being produced by the product of common choice matrix and initial theme score value, the theme score value of the renewal of node 702c-e is now respectively " 0.25 ", " 0.73 " and " 0.53 ".The theme score value (" 0.25 ") that the common choice data of node 702a relatively high-amplitude compared with other nodes (" 0.7 ") with 702c cause the renewal of node 702c is the theme score value (" 0.00 ") closer to node 702a than the initial theme score value (" 0.5 ") of node 702c.The common choice data of the relative high value (" 0.7 ") that similarly, node 702b compares with other nodes with 702d give node 702d than the theme score value of other nodes the theme score value (" 0.73 ") closer to the theme score value (" 1.00 ") of node 702b.The value (" 0.5 ") of the common choice data of each in node 702e and node 702b and 702d is higher a little than each the value (" 0.4 ") of common choice data in node 702e and node 702a and 702c.Therefore, the theme score value increase of the renewal of node 702e approaches the theme score value of node 702b and 702d a little.
In some embodiments, the theme score value of the renewal of Images Classification subsystem 120 use Fig. 7 B is replaced the initial theme score value of node 702a-e.For example, can rewrite the initial theme score value in the table 600 that is stored in Fig. 6 B with the theme score value upgrading.Then the theme score value that comes for example to upgrade by calculating by the theme score value upgrading and common choice data and the product of common choice data, for node generates the theme score value upgrading in addition.
With reference to figure 7C, weighted graph 700 shows the theme score value of the renewal of node 702a-e after twice iteration of the theme score value generative process of the iteration via Images Classification subsystem 120.The theme score value of the renewal of node 702c has increased " 0.01 " to " 0.26 ".The theme score value of the renewal of node 702d has increased " 0.01 " to " 0.74 ".The theme score value of the renewal of node 702e has increased " 0.01 " to " 0.54 ".In some embodiments, when in the change of the theme score value of the renewal of each between iteration subsequently during lower than specific threshold such as " 0.01 ", the theme score value that Images Classification subsystem 120 stops iteration generating.
With reference to figure 7D, weighted graph 700 shows the theme score value of the renewal of node 702a-e after four iteration of the theme score value generative process of the iteration via Images Classification subsystem 120.The theme score value of the renewal of node 702d has increased " 0.01 " to " 0.75 ".Each is convergent in " 0.01 " after the 4th iteration for the theme score value of the renewal of node 702a-e.Therefore, Images Classification subsystem 120 stops the theme score value generative process of iteration, and the theme score value of the represented image of output node 702a-e.
As an alternative, Images Classification subsystem can stop iterative process after the iteration of number of thresholds.The iteration of number of thresholds can be for example function of the quantity of the node between two specific nodes in weighted graph.
Fig. 8 is the instantiation procedure 800 for generating iteratively theme score value.Process 800 can for example be realized by the Images Classification subsystem 120 of Fig. 1.
For image sets is obtained initial theme score value (802).In some embodiments, image sets is included in during one or more user conversations by the image of common choice.The initial theme score value of each image is to specify this image to belong to the value of the possibility of referenced subject matter.As described with reference to figure 2, initial theme score value can be for example based on to image, obtain with the text of image correlation connection and/or about the analysis of the tag feedback data of image.
Can specify initial theme score value for each or image subset in image.In the time specifying initial theme score value for each in image, value can be between " 0.00 " and " 1.00 ", and its intermediate value " 0.00 " is indicated the known image that does not belong to referenced subject matter, and value " 1.00 " is indicated the known image that belongs to referenced subject matter.
In the time specifying initial theme score value for image subset, image subset can only comprise known those images that belong to referenced subject matter.For example, each (that is, referenced subject matter quote image) that known in image belongs to referenced subject matter can have the initial theme value of " 1.00 ", and each other images have the initial theme value of " 0.00 ".The vector that can define with initial theme score value theme score value, wherein each initial theme score value is vectorial component.
Obtain the common choice data (804) of image sets.In some embodiments, the right relative selection rate of each image in common choice data specify image group.For example, if to every 10 selections of another image, selected eight times of specific image, this specific image can be designated as " 0.8 " with respect to the relative selection rate of another image.As described with reference to figure 2, for example selection data based on about user conversation of common choice data are obtained.As described with reference to figure 6B, can define common choice matrix by common choice data in the above.
For image sets is calculated the theme score value (806) upgrading.In some embodiments, the theme score value of each image is the result of the function of theme score value and common choice data.The product that for example, can calculate theme score value vector sum common choice matrix generates theme score value vector, the theme score value of the renewal of each in its specify image.
Whether stop condition has been made to definite (808).In some embodiments, when each the change in the theme score value upgrading is changed when (that is, theme score value is convergent) lower than threshold value, stop condition occurs.Change to the theme score value upgrading can be with respect to the theme score value in one or more previous iteration.For example, on average change in the absolute change to each theme score value during an iteration or the window during multiple iteration.As mentioned above, in other embodiments, stop condition can be the iteration of number of thresholds.
In the time that stop condition occurs, the theme score value based on upgrading is to image sets classify (810).In some embodiments, having at least the image of threshold value theme score value is classified as and belongs to referenced subject matter.In other embodiments, the image that has a number of thresholds of the theme score value among the theme score value of the highest part is classified as and belongs to referenced subject matter.The theme score value of high part can be for example the highest theme score value of integer amount or the theme score value of high number percent.
Belong to the image of referenced subject matter be associated with the label corresponding to referenced subject matter (812) by being classified as.In some embodiments, label is the text data corresponding with referenced subject matter.For example, the image that is identified as pornographic image can be associated with text " undisguised " or " pornographic ".In other embodiments, the image that is identified as belonging to referenced subject matter can have and is set to indicate this image to belong to the Data Labels of the binary value of theme.
Some example values about node have been described in the above.For example, represent that the node of the image that belongs to referenced subject matter can be assigned with the value of " 1.0 ", and represent that the node of the image that does not belong to referenced classes can be assigned with the initial value of " 0.0 ".In addition, node can be assigned with the corresponding value of possibility that the image represented with node belongs to referenced subject matter.Although for example object provides these values, other values can be distributed to the node of presentation video.For example, represent that the node of image that belongs to referenced subject matter can be assigned with the value of " 1.0 ", and the image that does not belong to referenced subject matter can be assigned with the value of " 1.0 ".The alternative value that similarly, presentation video can be belonged to the possibility of referenced subject matter is distributed to node.Superincumbent description is equally applicable to value to distribute to any mode of node.
