- the visual query is a drawing produced by a content authoring program (736, Fig. 5).
- the user "draws" the visual query, while in other embodiments the user scans or photographs the visual query.
- Some visual queries are created using an image generation application such as Acrobat, a photograph editing program, a drawing program, or an image editing program.
- a visual query could come from a user taking a photograph of his friend on his mobile phone and then submitting the photograph as the visual query to the server system.
- the visual query could also come from a user scanning a page of a magazine, or taking a screen shot of a webpage on a desktop computer and then submitting the scan or screen shot as the visual query to the server system.
- the visual query is submitted to the server system 106 through a search engine extension of a browser application, through a plug-in for a browser application, or by a search application executed by the client system 102.
- Visual queries may also be submitted by other application programs (executed by a client system) that support or generate images which can be transmitted to a remotely located server by the client system.
- the visual query can be a combination of text and non-text elements (208).
- a query could be a scan of a magazine page containing images and text, such as a person standing next to a road sign.
- a visual query can include an image of a person's face, whether taken by a camera embedded in the client system or a document scanned by or otherwise received by the client system.
- a visual query can also be a scan of a document containing only text.
- the visual query can also be an image of numerous distinct subjects, such as several birds in a forest, a person and an object (e.g., car, park bench, etc.), a person and an animal ⁇ e.g., pet, farm animal, butterfly, etc.).
- Visual queries may have two or more distinct elements.
- a visual query could include a barcode and an image of a product or product name on a product package.
- the visual query could be a picture of a book cover that includes the title of the book, cover art, and a bar code.
- one visual query will produce two or more distinct search results corresponding to different portions of the visual query, as discussed in more detail below.
- the server system processes the visual query as follows.
- the front end server system sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems for simultaneous processing (210).
- Each search system implements a distinct visual query search process, i.e., an individual search system processes the visual query by its own processing scheme.
- one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is an optical character recognition (OCR) search system.
- OCR optical character recognition
- one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is a facial recognition search system.
- the plurality of search systems running distinct visual query search processes includes at least: optical character recognition (OCR), facial recognition, and another query-by-image process other than OCR and facial recognition (212).
- OCR optical character recognition
- the other query-by-image process is selected from a set of processes that includes but is not limited to product recognition, bar code recognition, object-or-object- category recognition, named entity recognition, and color recognition (212).
- named entity recognition occurs as a post process of the OCR search system, wherein the text result of the OCR is analyzed for famous people, locations, objects and the like, and then the terms identified as being named entities are searched in the term query server system (118, Fig. 1).
- images of famous landmarks, logos, people, album covers, trademarks, etc. are recognized by an image- to-terms search system.
- a distinct named entity query-by-image process separate from the image-to-terms search system is utilized.
- the object-or-object category recognition system recognizes generic result types like "car.”
- this system also recognizes product brands, particular product models, and the like, and provides more specific descriptions, like "Porsche.”
- Some of the search systems could be special user specific search systems. For example, particular versions of color recognition and facial recognition could be a special search systems used by the blind.
- the front end server system receives results from the parallel search systems
- the results are accompanied by a search score.
- some of the search systems will find no relevant results. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a flower, the facial recognition search system and the bar code search system will not find any relevant results.
- a null or zero search score is received from that search system (216).
- the front end server does not receive a result from a search system after a pre-defined period of time (e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 seconds), it will process the received results as if that timed out server produced a null search score and will process the received results from the other search systems.
- one of the predefined criteria excludes void results.
- a pre-defined criterion is that the results are not void.
- one of the predefined criteria excludes results having numerical score (e.g., for a relevance factor) that falls below a pre-defined minimum score.
- the plurality of search results are filtered (220).
- the results are only filtered if the total number of results exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
- all the results are ranked but the results falling below a pre-defined minimum score are excluded.
- the content of the results are filtered. For example, if some of the results contain private information or personal protected information, these results are filtered out.
- the visual query server system creates a compound search result
- the term query server system (118, Fig. 1) may augment the results from one of the parallel search systems with results from a term search, where the additional results are either links to documents or information sources, or text and/or images containing additional information that may be relevant to the visual query.
- the compound search result may contain an OCR result and a link to a named entity in the OCR document (224).
- the OCR search system (112-B, Fig. 1) or the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) recognizes likely relevant words in the text. For example, it may recognize named entities such as famous people or places.
- the named entities are submitted as query terms to the term query server system (118, Fig. 1).
- the term query results produced by the term query server system are embedded in the visual query result as a "link.”
- the term query results are returned as separate links. For example, if a picture of a book cover were the visual query, it is likely that an object recognition search system will produce a high scoring hit for the book.
- the term query results are presented in a labeled group to distinguish them from the visual query results.
- the results may be searched individually, or a search may be performed using all the recognized named entities in the search query to produce particularly relevant additional search results.
- the visual query is a scanned travel brochure about Paris
- the returned result may include links to the term query server system 118 for initiating a search on a term query "Notre Dame.”
- compound search results include results from text searches for recognized famous images.
- the visual query server system then sends at least one result to the client system (226).
- the visual query processing server receives a plurality of search results from at least some of the plurality of search systems, it will then send at least one of the plurality of search results to the client system.
- only one search system will return relevant results.
- the OCR server's results may be relevant.
- only one result from one search system may be relevant.
- only the product related to a scanned bar code may be relevant. In these instances, the front end visual processing server will return only the relevant search result(s).
- a plurality of search results are sent to the client system, and the plurality of search results include search results from more than one of the parallel search systems (228). This may occur when more than one distinct image is in the visual query. For example, if the visual query were a picture of a person riding a horse, results for facial recognition of the person could be displayed along with object identification results for the horse. In some embodiments, all the results for a particular query by image search system are grouped and presented together. For example, the top N facial recognition results are displayed under a heading "facial recognition results" and the top N object recognition results are displayed together under a heading "object recognition results.” Alternatively, as discussed below, the search results from a particular image search system may be grouped by image region.
- the search results may include both OCR results and one or more image-match results (230).
- the user may wish to learn more about a particular search result. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a dolphin and the "image to terms" search system returns the following terms “water,” “dolphin,” “blue,” and “Flipper;” the user may wish to run a text based query term search on "Flipper.”
- the query term server system 118, Fig. 1 is accessed, and the search on the selected term(s) is run.
- the corresponding search term results are displayed on the client system either separately or in conjunction with the visual query results (232).
- the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) automatically (i.e., without receiving any user command, other than the initial visual query) chooses one or more top potential text results for the visual query, runs those text results on the term query server system 118, and then returns those term query results along with the visual query result to the client system as a part of sending at least one search result to the client system (232).
- the front end server runs a term query on "Flipper" and returns those term query results along with the visual query results to the client system.
- results are displayed as a compound search result (222) as explained above.
- the results are part of a search result list instead of or in addition to a compound search result.
- Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the process for responding to a visual query with an interactive results document.
- the first three operations (202, 210, 214) are described above with reference to Figure 2.
- an interactive results document is created (302).
- the interactive results document includes one or more visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of the visual query.
- Each visual identifier has at least one user selectable link to at least one of the search results.
- a visual identifier identifies a respective sub-portion of the visual query.
- the interactive results document has only one visual identifier with one user selectable link to one or more results.
- a respective user selectable link to one or more of the search results has an activation region, and the activation region corresponds to the sub-portion of the visual query that is associated with a corresponding visual identifier.
- the visual identifier is a bounding box (304).
- the bounding box encloses a sub-portion of the visual query as shown in Figure 12 A.
- the bounding box need not be a square or rectangular box shape but can be any sort of shape including circular, oval, conformal (e.g., to an object in, entity in or region of the visual query), irregular or any other shape as shown in Figure 12B.
- the bounding box outlines the boundary of an identifiable entity in a sub-portion of the visual query (306).
- each bounding box includes a user selectable link to one or more search results, where the user selectable link has an activation region corresponding to a sub-portion of the visual query surrounded by the bounding box.

- the labels are color coded.
- each respective visual identifiers is formatted for presentation in a visually distinctive manner in accordance with a type of recognized entity in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. For example, as shown in Figure 13, bounding boxes around a product, a person, a trademark, and the two textual areas are each presented with distinct cross-hatching patterns, representing differently colored transparent bounding boxes.
- the visual identifiers are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and border color.
- the user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a document or object that contains one or more results related to the corresponding sub-portion of the visual query (308).
- at least one search result includes data related to the corresponding sub-portion of the visual query.
- a visual query was a photograph of a bar code
- the interactive results document may include a bounding box around only the bar code.
- the bar code search result is displayed.
- the bar code search result may include one result, the name of the product corresponding to that bar code, or the bar code results may include several results such as a variety of places in which that product can be purchased, reviewed, etc.
- the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include results from a term query search on at least one of the terms in the text.
- the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: name, handle, contact information, account information, address information, current location of a related mobile device associated with the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, other images of the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, and potential image matches for the person's face.
- the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: product information, a product review, an option to initiate purchase of the product, an option to initiate a bid on the product, a list of similar products, and a list of related products.
- a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document includes anchor text, which is displayed in the document without having to activate the link.
- the anchor text provides information, such as a key word or term, related to the information obtained when the link is activated.
- Anchor text may be displayed as part of the label (307), or in a portion of a bounding box (304), or as additional information displayed when a user hovers a cursor over a user selectable link for a pre-determined period of time such as 1 second.
- a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a search engine for searching for information or documents corresponding to a text-based query (sometimes herein called a term query).
- Activation of the link causes execution of the search by the search engine, where the query and the search engine are specified by the link (e.g., the search engine is specified by a URL in the link and the text- based search query is specified by a URL parameter of the link), with results returned to the client system.
- the link in this example may include anchor text specifying the text or terms in the search query.
- the interactive results document produced in response to a visual query can include a plurality of links that correspond to results from the same search system.
- a visual query may be an image or picture of a group of people.
- the interactive results document may include bounding boxes around each person, which when activated returns results from the facial recognition search system for each face in the group.
- a plurality of links in the interactive results document corresponds to search results from more than one search system (310). For example, if a picture of a person and a dog was submitted as the visual query, bounding boxes in the interactive results document may outline the person and the dog separately.
- the interactive results document contains an OCR result and an image match result (312).
- the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for the person and for the text in the sign.
- the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for photographs or trademarks in

- the server system receives from the client system information regarding the user selection of a visual identifier in the interactive results document (316).
- the link is activated by selecting an activation region inside a bounding box.
- the link is activated by a user selection of a visual identifier of a sub-portion of the visual query, which is not a bounding box.
- the linked visual identifier is a hot button, a label located near the sub-portion, an underlined word in text, or other representation of an object or subject in the visual query.
- the search results list is presented with the interactive results document (315)
- the search result in the search results list corresponding to the selected link is identified.
- the cursor will jump or automatically move to the first result corresponding to the selected link.
- selecting a link in the interactive results document causes the search results list to scroll or jump so as to display at least a first result corresponding to the selected link.
- the results list is reordered such that the first result corresponding to the link is displayed at the top of the results list.
- the visual query server system when the user selects the user selectable link (316) the visual query server system sends at least a subset of the results, related to a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query, to the client for display to the user (318).
- the user can select multiple visual identifiers concurrently and will receive a subset of results for all of the selected visual identifiers at the same time.
- search results corresponding to the user selectable links are preloaded onto the client prior to user selection of any of the user selectable links so as to provide search results to the user virtually instantaneously in response to user selection of one or more links in the interactive results document.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating the communications between a client and a visual query server system.
- the client 102 receives a visual query from a user/querier (402).
- visual queries can only be accepted from users who have signed up for or "opted in” to the visual query system.
- searches for facial recognition matches are only performed for users who have signed up for the facial recognition visual query system, while other types of visual queries are performed for anyone regardless of whether they have "opted in” to the facial recognition portion.
- the format of the visual query can take many forms.
- the visual query will likely contain one or more subjects located in sub-portions of the visual query document.
- the client system 102 performs type recognition pre-processing on the visual query (404).
- the client system 102 searches for particular recognizable patterns in this pre-processing system. For example, for some visual queries the client may recognize colors.
- the client may recognize that a particular sub-portion is likely to contain text (because that area is made up of small dark characters surrounded by light space etc.)
- the client may contain any number of pre-processing type recognizers, or type recognition modules.
- the client will have a type recognition module (barcode recognition 406) for recognizing bar codes. It may do so by recognizing the distinctive striped pattern in a rectangular area.
- the client will have a type recognition module (face detection 408) for recognizing that a particular subject or sub-portion of the visual query is likely to contain a face.
- the recognized "type" is returned to the user for verification.
- the client system 102 may return a message stating "a bar code has been found in your visual query, are you interested in receiving bar code query results?"
- the message may even indicate the sub-portion of the visual query where the type has been found.
- this presentation is similar to the interactive results document discussed with reference to Figure 3. For example, it may outline a sub- portion of the visual query and indicate that the sub-portion is likely to contain a face, and ask the user if they are interested in receiving facial recognition results.
- the client 102 After the client 102 performs the optional pre-processing of the visual query, the client sends the visual query to the visual query server system 106, specifically to the front end visual query processing server 110.
- the client if pre-processing produced relevant results, i.e., if one of the type recognition modules produced results above a certain threshold, indicating that the query or a sub-portion of the query is likely to be of a particular type (face, text, barcode etc.), the client will pass along information regarding the results of the pre-processing. For example, the client may indicate that the face recognition module is 75% sure that a particular sub-portion of the visual query contains a face.
- the pre-processing results include one or more subject type values (e.g., bar code, face, text, etc.).
- the pre-processing results sent to the visual query server system include one or more of: for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, information identifying a sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to the subject type value, and for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, a confidence value indicating a level of confidence in the subject type value and/or the identification of a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query.
- the front end server 110 receives the visual query from the client system
- the visual query received may contain the pre-processing information discussed above.
- the front end server sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems (210). If the front end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, the front end server may pass this information along to one or more of the parallel search systems. For example, it may pass on the information that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face so that the facial recognition search system 112- A can process that subsection of the visual query first. Similarly, sending the same information (that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face) may be used by the other parallel search systems to ignore that sub-portion or analyze other sub-portions first. In some embodiments, the front end server will not pass on the pre-processing information to the parallel search systems, but will instead use this information to augment the way in which it processes the results received from the parallel search systems.
- the front end server 110 receives a plurality of search results from the parallel search systems (214). The front end server may then perform a variety of ranking and filtering, and may create an interactive search result document as explained with reference to Figures 2 and 3. If the front end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub- portion contained a subject of a certain type, it may filter and order by giving preference to those results that match the pre-processed recognized subject type. If the user indicated that a particular type of result was requested, the front end server will take the user's requests into account when processing the results.
- the front end server may filter out all other results if the user only requested bar code information, or the front end server will list all results pertaining to the requested type prior to listing the other results. If an interactive visual query document is returned, the server may pre-search the links associated with the type of result the user indicated interest in, while only providing links for performing related searches for the other subjects indicated in the interactive results document. Then the front end server 110 sends the search results to the client system (226).
- the client 102 receives the results from the server system (412). When applicable, these results will include the results that match the type of result found in the preprocessing stage. For example, in some embodiments they will include one or more bar code results (414) or one or more facial recognition results (416). If the client's pre-processing modules had indicated that a particular type of result was likely, and that result was found, the found results of that type will be listed prominently.
- the user will select or annotate one or more of the results (418).
- the user may select one search result, may select a particular type of search result, and/or may select a portion of an interactive results document (420). Selection of a result is implicit feedback that the returned result was relevant to the query. Such feedback information can be utilized in future query processing operations.
- An annotation provides explicit feedback about the returned result that can also be utilized in future query processing operations. Annotations take the form of corrections of portions of the returned result (like a correction to a mis-OCRed word) or a separate annotation (either free form or structured.)
- the user's selection of one search result is a process that is referred to as a selection among interpretations.
- the user's selection of a particular type of search result generally selecting the result "type" of interest from several different types of returned results (e.g., choosing the OCRed text of an article in a magazine rather than the visual results for the advertisements also on the same page), is a process that is referred to as disambiguation of intent.
- a user may similarly select particular linked words (such as recognized named entities) in an OCRed document as explained in detail with reference to Figure 8.
- the user may alternatively or additionally wish to annotate particular search results.
- This annotation may be done in freeform style or in a structured format (422).
- the annotations may be descriptions of the result or may be reviews of the result. For example, they may indicate the name of subject(s) in the result, or they could indicate "this is a good book” or "this product broke within a year of purchase.”
- Another example of an annotation is a user-drawn bounding box around a sub-portion of the visual query and user-provided text identifying the object or subject inside the bounding box. User annotations are explained in more detail with reference to Figure 5.
- the user selections of search results and other annotations are sent to the server system (424).
- the front end server 110 receives the selections and annotations and further processes them (426). If the information was a selection of an object, sub-region or term in an interactive results document, further information regarding that selection may be requested, as appropriate. For example, if the selection was of one visual result, more information about that visual result would be requested. If the selection was a word (either from the OCR server or from the Image-to-Terms server) a textual search of that word would be sent to the term query server system 118. If the selection was of a person from a facial image recognition search system, that person's profile would be requested.
- the server system receives an annotation, the annotation is stored in a query and annotation database 116, explained with reference to Figure 5. Then the information from the annotation database 116 is periodically copied to individual annotation databases for one or more of the parallel server systems, as discussed below with reference to Figures 7 - 10.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a client system 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the client system 102 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 702, one or more network or other communications interfaces 704, memory 712, and one or more communication buses 714 for interconnecting these components.
- the client system 102 includes a user interface 705.
- the user interface 705 includes a display device 706 and optionally includes an input means such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input buttons 708.
- the display device 706 includes a touch sensitive surface 709, in which case the display 706/709 is a touch sensitive display.
- a physical keyboard is optional (e.g., a soft keyboard may be displayed when keyboard entry is needed).
- client systems use a microphone and voice recognition to supplement or replace the keyboard.
- the client 102 includes a GPS (global positioning satellite) receiver, or other location detection apparatus 707 for determining the location of the client system 102.
- visual query search services are provided that require the client system 102 to provide the visual query server system to receive location information indicating the location of the client system 102.
- the client system 102 also includes an image capture device 710 such as a camera or scanner.
- Memory 712 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.
- Memory 712 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 702.
- Memory 712, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 712, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium.
- memory 712 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 712 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof: • an operating system 716 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks;
- a network communication module 718 that is used for connecting the client system 102 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 704 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on;
- a image capture module 720 for processing a respective image captured by the image capture device/camera 710, where the respective image may be sent (e.g., by a client application module) as a visual query to the visual query server system;
- client application modules 722 for handling various aspects of querying by image, including but not limited to: a query-by-image submission module 724 for submitting visual queries to the visual query server system; optionally a region of interest selection module 725 that detects a selection (such as a gesture on the touch sensitive display 706/709) of a region of interest in an image and prepares that region of interest as a visual query; a results browser 726 for displaying the results of the visual query; and optionally an annotation module 728 with optional modules for structured annotation text entry 730 such as filling in a form or for freeform annotation text entry 732, which can accept annotations from a variety of formats, and an image region selection module 734 (sometimes referred to herein as a result selection module) which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation;
- a query-by-image submission module 724 for submitting visual queries to the visual query server system
- a region of interest selection module 725 that detects a selection (such as a gesture on the touch
- an optional content authoring application(s) 736 that allow a user to author a visual query by creating or editing an image rather than just capturing one via the image capture device 710; optionally, one or such applications 736 may include instructions that enable a user to select a sub-portion of an image for use as a visual query;
- the local image analysis may recognize particular types of images, or sub-regions within an image. Examples of image types that may be recognized by such modules 738 include one or more of: facial type (facial image recognized within visual query), bar code type (bar code recognized within visual query), and text type (text recognized within visual query); and
- client applications 740 such as an email application, a phone
- the application corresponding to an appropriate actionable search result can be launched or accessed when the actionable search result is selected.
- the image region selection module 734 which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation, also allows the user to choose a search result as a "correct" hit without necessarily further annotating it.
- the user may be presented with a top N number of facial recognition matches and may choose the correct person from that results list.
- more than one type of result will be presented, and the user will choose a type of result.
- the image query may include a person standing next to a tree, but only the results regarding the person is of interest to the user. Therefore, the image selection module 734 allows the user to indicate which type of image is the "correct" type - i.e., the type he is interested in receiving.
- the user may also wish to annotate the search result by adding personal comments or descriptive words using either the annotation text entry module 730 (for filling in a form) or freeform annotation text entry module 732.
- the optional local image analysis module 738 is a portion of the client application (108, Fig. 1). Furthermore, in some embodiments the optional local image analysis module 738 includes one or more programs to perform local image analysis to pre-process or categorize the visual query or a portion thereof. For example, the client application 722 may recognize that the image contains a bar code, a face, or text, prior to submitting the visual query to a search engine. In some embodiments, when the local image analysis module 738 detects that the visual query contains a particular type of image, the module asks the user if they are interested in a corresponding type of search result.
- the local image analysis module 738 may detect a face based on its general characteristics (i.e., without determining which person's face) and provides immediate feedback to the user prior to sending the query on to the visual query server system. It may return a result like, "A face has been detected, are you interested in getting facial recognition matches for this face?" This may save time for the visual query server system (106, Fig. 1). For some visual queries, the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) only sends the visual query to the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 738.
- the visual query to the search system 112 may send the visual query to all of the search systems 112A-N, but will rank results from the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 738.
- the manner in which local image analysis impacts on operation of the visual query server system depends on the configuration of the client system, or configuration or processing parameters associated with either the user or the client system.
- the actual content of any particular visual query and the results produced by the local image analysis may cause different visual queries to be handled differently at either or both the client system and the visual query server system.
- bar code recognition is performed in two steps, with analysis of whether the visual query includes a bar code performed on the client system at the local image analysis module 738. Then the visual query is passed to a bar code search system only if the client determines the visual query is likely to include a bar code. In other embodiments, the bar code search system processes every visual query.
- the client system 102 includes additional client applications 740.
- FIG 6 is a block diagram illustrating a front end visual query processing server system 110 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

- a network communication module 818 that is used for connecting the front end server system 110 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 804 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on;
- a query manager 820 for handling the incoming visual queries from the client system 102 and sending them to two or more parallel search systems; as described elsewhere in this document, in some special situations a visual query may be directed to just one of the search systems, such as when the visual query includes an client-generated instruction (e.g., "facial recognition search only");
- a results filtering module 822 for optionally filtering the results from the one or more parallel search systems and sending the top or "relevant" results to the client system 102 for presentation;
- a results ranking and formatting module 824 for optionally ranking the results from the one or more parallel search systems and for formatting the results for presentation;

- a query and annotation database 116 which comprises the database itself 834 and an index to the database 836.
- the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks the results returned from the one or more parallel search systems (112-A - 112-N, Fig. 1). As already noted above, for some visual queries, only the results from one search system may be relevant. In such an instance, only the relevant search results from that one search system are ranked. For some visual queries, several types of search results may be relevant. In these instances, in some embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks all of the results from the search system having the most relevant result (e.g., the result with the highest relevance score) above the results for the less relevant search systems. In other embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks a top result from each relevant search system above the remaining results.
- the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks the results in accordance with a relevance score computed for each of the search results.
- augmented textual queries are performed in addition to the searching on parallel visual search systems.
- textual queries are also performed, their results are presented in a manner visually distinctive from the visual search system results.
- the results ranking and formatting module 824 also formats the results.
- the results are presented in a list format.
- the results are presented by means of an interactive results document.
- both an interactive results document and a list of results are presented.
- the type of query dictates how the results are presented. For example, if more than one searchable subject is detected in the visual query, then an interactive results document is produced, while if only one searchable subject is detected the results will be displayed in list format only.
- the results document creation module 826 is used to create an interactive search results document.
- the interactive search results document may have one or more detected and searched subjects.
- the bounding box creation module 828 creates a bounding box around one or more of the searched subjects.
- the bounding boxes may be rectangular boxes, or may outline the shape(s) of the subject(s).
- the link creation module 830 creates links to search results associated with their respective subject in the interactive search results document. In some embodiments, clicking within the bounding box area activates the corresponding link inserted by the link creation module.
- the query and annotation database 116 contains information that can be used to improve visual query results.
- the user may annotate the image after the visual query results have been presented.
- the user may annotate the image before sending it to the visual query search system. Pre-annotation may help the visual query processing by focusing the results, or running text based searches on the annotated words in parallel with the visual query searches.
- annotated versions of a picture can be made public (e.g., when the user has given permission for publication, for example by designating the image and annotation(s) as not private), so as to be returned as a potential image match hit.
- the information from the query and annotation database 116 is periodically pushed to the parallel search systems 112, which incorporate relevant portions of the information (if any) into their respective individual databases 114.

- Touch sensitive displays are also helpful in interacting with the visual query results as explained in more detail below.
- the client system 102 also includes an image capture mechanism such as a camera 710.
- Figure 11 illustrates a visual query 1102 which is a photograph or video frame of a package on a shelf of a store.
- the visual query is a two dimensional image having a resolution corresponding to the size of the visual query in pixels in each of two dimensions.
- the visual query 1102 in this example is a two
- the visual query 1102 includes background elements, a product package 1104, and a variety of types of entities on the package including an image of a person 1106, an image of a trademark 1108, an image of a product 1110, and a variety of textual elements 1112.
- the visual query 1102 is sent to the front end server 110, which sends the visual query 1102 to a plurality of parallel search systems (112A-N), receives the results and creates an interactive results document.
- Figures 12A and 12B each illustrate a client system 102 with a screen shot of an embodiment of an interactive results document 1200.
- the interactive results document 1200 includes one or more visual identifiers 1202 of respective sub-portions of the visual query 1102, which each include a user selectable link to a subset of search results.
- Figures 12A and 12B illustrate an interactive results document 1200 with visual identifiers that are bounding boxes 1202 (e.g., bounding boxes 1202-1, 1202-2, 1202-3).
- the user activates the display of the search results corresponding to a particular sub-portion by tapping on the activation region inside the space outlined by its bounding box 1202.
- the user would activate the search results corresponding to the image of the person, by tapping on a bounding box 1306 ( Figure 13) surrounding the image of the person.
- the selectable link is selected using a mouse or keyboard rather than a touch sensitive display.
- the first corresponding search result is displayed when a user previews a bounding box 1202 (i.e., when the user single clicks, taps once, or hovers a pointer over the bounding box).
- the user activates the display of a plurality of corresponding search results when the user selects the bounding box (i.e., when the user double clicks, taps twice, or uses another mechanism to indicate selection.)

- active hot links 1204 for some of the textual terms.
- Figure 12B shows an example where "Active Drink” and "United States" are displayed as hot links 1204.
- the search results corresponding to these terms are the results received from the term query server system 118, whereas the results corresponding to the bounding boxes are results from the query by image search systems.
- Figure 13 illustrates a client system 102 with a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 that is coded by type of recognized entity in the visual query.
- the visual query of Figure 11 contains an image of a person 1106, an image of a trademark 1108, an image of a product 1110, and a variety of textual elements 1112.
- the interactive results document 1200 displayed in Figure 13 includes bounding boxes 1202 around a person 1306, a trademark 1308, a product 1310, and the two textual areas 1312.
- the bounding boxes of Figure 13 are each presented with separate cross-hatching which represents differently colored transparent bounding boxes 1202.
- the visual identifiers of the bounding boxes are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and bounding box border color.
- the type coding for particular recognized entities is shown with respect to bounding boxes in Figure 13, but coding by type can also be applied to visual identifiers that are labels.
- Figure 14 illustrates a client device 102 with a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 with labels 1402 being the visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of the visual query 1102 of Figure 11.
- the label visual identifiers 1402 each include a user selectable link to a subset of corresponding search results.
- the selectable link is identified by descriptive text displayed within the area of the label 1402.
- Some embodiments include a plurality of links within one label 1402. For example, in Figure 14, the label hovering over the image of a woman drinking includes a link to facial recognition results for the woman and a link to image recognition results for that particular picture (e.g., images of other products or advertisements using the same picture.)
- the labels 1402 are displayed as partially transparent areas with text that are located over their respective sub-portions of the interactive results document.
- a respective label is positioned near but not located over its respective sub-portion of the interactive results document.
- the labels are coded by type in the same manner as discussed with reference to Figure 13.
- the user activates the display of the search results corresponding to a particular sub-portion corresponding to a label 1302 by tapping on the activation region inside the space outlined by the edges or periphery of the label 1302.
- the same previewing and selection functions discussed above with reference to the bounding boxes of Figures 12A and 12B also apply to the visual identifiers that are labels 1402.
- Figure 15 illustrates a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 and the original visual query 1102 displayed concurrently with a results list 1500.
- the interactive results document 1200 is displayed by itself as shown in Figures 12-14. In other embodiments, the interactive results document 1200 is displayed
- the list of visual query results 1500 is concurrently displayed along with the original visual query 1102 and/or the interactive results document 1200.
- the type of client system and the amount of room on the display 706 may determine whether the list of results 1500 is displayed concurrently with the interactive results document 1200.
- the client system 102 receives (in response to a visual query submitted to the visual query server system) both the list of results 1500 and the interactive results document 1200, but only displays the list of results 1500 when the user scrolls below the interactive results document 1200. In some of these embodiments, the client system 102 displays the results
- the list of results 1500 is organized into categories
- Each category contains at least one result 1503.
- the categories titles are highlighted to distinguish them from the results 1503.
- the categories 1502 are ordered according to their calculated category weight.
- the category weight is a combination of the weights of the highest N results in that category. As such, the category that has likely produced more relevant results is displayed first. In embodiments where more than one category 1502 is returned for the same recognized entity (such as the facial image recognition match and the image match shown in Figure 15) the category displayed first has a higher category weight.
- the cursor when a selectable link in the interactive results document 1200 is selected by a user of the client system 102, the cursor will automatically move to the appropriate category 1502 or to the first result 1503 in that category.
- the list of results 1500 is reordered such that the category or categories relevant to the selected link are displayed first. This is accomplished, for example, by either coding the selectable links with information identifying the corresponding search results, or by coding the search results to indicate the corresponding selectable links or to indicate the corresponding result categories.
- the categories of the search results correspond to the query-by-image search system that produce those search results.
- some of the categories are product match 1506, logo match 1508, facial recognition match 1510, image match 1512.
- the original visual query 1102 and/or an interactive results document 1200 may be similarly displayed with a category title such as the query 1504.
- results from any term search performed by the term query server may also be displayed as a separate category, such as web results 1514.
- more than one entity in a visual query will produce results from the same query-by-image search system.
- the visual query could include two different faces that would return separate results from the facial recognition search system.
- the categories 1502 are divided by recognized entity rather than by search system.
- an image of the recognized entity is displayed in the recognized entity category header 1502 such that the results for that recognized entity are distinguishable from the results for another recognized entity, even though both results are produced by the same query by image search system.
- the product match category 1506 includes two entity product entities and as such as two entity categories 1502 - a boxed product 1516 and a bottled product 1518, each of which have a plurality of corresponding search results 1503.
- the categories may be divided by recognized entities and type of query-by-image system. For example, in Figure 15, there are two separate entities that returned relevant results under the product match category product.
- the results 1503 include thumbnail images.
- thumbnail images For example, as shown for the facial recognition match results in Figure 15, small versions (also called thumbnail images) of the pictures of the facial matches for "Actress X" and "Social Network Friend Y" are displayed along with some textual description such as the name of the person in the image.
