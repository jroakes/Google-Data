Definitions
- This specification relates to presenting online content items in combination with online publications, and more particularly to a network-based system and method for pre-fetching online content items for low latency display to a user during a presentation of an online publication.
- Internet users are able to view publications (e.g., video publications) on user devices. At least some of these publications include movies, television programs, and other videos that the user views with, for example, their mobile computing device.
- These publications may be online publications (e.g., Internet-streaming videos) or offline publications (e.g., videos stored on the mobile computing device), and are displayed along with online content items (e.g., video advertisements) where the online content item is displayed at a predetermined time during the display of the publication (e.g., before, during, or after).
- online publications e.g., Internet-streaming videos
- offline publications e.g., videos stored on the mobile computing device
- online content items e.g., video advertisements
- a video publication is displayed on a user device, and the video publication reaches a point when a video advertisement is to be displayed to the user, the user device transmits a call to an online content provider.
- the online content provider serves an appropriate online content item to the user device for displaying.
- the online content provider may not have an appropriate online content item to provide to the user and instead may have to instruct the user device to request online content items from one or more other content providers.
- Each time a call is made by the user device to a content provider, or by the online content provider to other online content providers these operations cause further delay in serving and displaying the online content item to the user.
- some formats of online content items e.g., video advertisements
- a computer-implemented method for pre-fetching online content items uses a first computing device including a processor in communication with an output device and a memory.
- the method includes displaying an online publication to a user using the output device.
- the method also includes identifying a break point associated with the online publication.
- the method further includes determining, by the processor, a pre-fetch point prior to the break point.
- the method also includes initiating transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point.
- a computer system in another aspect, includes an output device and at least one memory.
- the computer system also includes one or more processors configured to display an online publication to a user using said output device.
- the one or more processors are also configured to identify a break point associated with the online publication.
- the one or more processors are further configured to determine a pre-fetch point prior to the break point.
- the one or more processors are also configured to initiate transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point.
- computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided.
- the computer-executable instructions When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to display an online publication to a user using an output device.
- the computer-executable instructions also cause the at least one processor to identify a break point associated with the online publication.
- the computer-executable instructions further cause the at least one processor to determine a pre-fetch point prior to the break point.
- the computer-executable instructions also cause the at least one processor to initiate transmission of a content item from a second computing device to the processor at the pre-fetch point.
- a computer device comprising one or more processors.
- the computer device is in communication with a client device including a memory and an output device.
- the computer device is configured to display an online publication to a user using said output device.
- the computer device is also configured to identify a break point associated with the online publication.
- the computer device is further configured to determine a pre-fetch point prior to the break point.
- the computer device is also configured to initiate transmission of a content item from the computer device into the memory of the client device at the pre-fetch point.
- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable low latency display of online content items (e.g., "ads” or “advertisements") during the presentation of online publications such as Internet videos or videos stored on a user's computing device. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein facilitate pre-fetching content items from an online content provider such that at the time of presentation, some or all of the upcoming ads are stored locally and available for immediate presentation.
- the pre-fetch system includes a server computing device in communication with a client device and a memory device.
- a user may be watching online publications on the client device (e.g., mobile tablet computer or smartphone) through, for example, an online video sharing web site in which users are able to upload, download, and stream video content.
- the pre-fetch system presents the user with one or more video ads.
- the user may be presented on the client device with an ad prior to the start of the video, and/or at one or more points during the video (collectively referred to herein as "ad break points").
- the pre-fetch system pre-fetches an ad.
- pre-fetch system retrieves the next ad from an online content provider and stores the ad locally on the client device for display during the upcoming ad slot.
- the pre-fetch system identifies an ad break point within a video being displayed to the user, and determines a time prior to the ad break point to begin pre-fetching the ad (a "pre-fetch point").
- the next ad is pre-fetched at a pre-determined amount of time prior to the ad break point, (i.e., a "pre-fetch gap time" between the beginning of the pre-fetch and the ad break point, such as 10 seconds before the next ad is due to be displayed).
- this pre-fetch gap time may be computed based on a variety of factors such as: (a) the bandwidth quality of the mobile device or the mobile device's current connection; (b) the available disk space on the mobile device; (c) the user's configuration profile; and (d) historical user behavior.
- the pre-fetch system may determine that the mobile device presently has a low-quality (i.e., low bandwidth) connection, and thus may increase the pre-fetch gap to allow for more pre-fetching time. Further, the pre-fetch system may pre-fetch only a portion of the next ad (a partial pre-fetch). More specifically, according to the invention, the pre-fetch system determines a portion of the next ad that will be pre-fetched (e.g., a "pre-fetch length" representing the first X seconds of the ad).
- This pre-fetch length is computed based on the user's behavior history, and how long the user is likely to view the ad, or on bandwidth quality of the user's mobile device or the mobile device's current connection, or on the available disk and/or memory space on the mobile device. As such, the system may increase the amount of the ad that is pre-fetched when the user is more likely to watch most or all of the ad.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) displaying an online publication to a user using the output device; (b) identifying a break point associated with the online publication; (c) determining, by a processor, a pre-fetch point prior to the break point; (d) initiating transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point; (e) displaying the online content item to the user using the output device; (f) determining a pre-fetch point that is a pre-determined amount of time prior to the break point; (g) computing a pre-fetch gap time based on one or more of a link quality of the first computing device, a bit rate of the first computing device, a size of the content item, and a download rate of the first computing device; (h) determining a pre-fetch length of the content item that is less than a total
- startup and streaming of ad content may take several seconds of processing before the displaying of the ad begins (e.g., "latency").
- This latency is often dependent upon the time required to transfer a few seconds of video from a server to the client device (e.g., the user's device).
- the pre-fetch system described herein retrieves ads just prior to the time they are needed.
- Overall technical effects of this pre-fetch system include at least improving the latency issue of prior systems by pre-fetching and storing the next ad locally on the client device, and reducing abandonment rates for advertisements (i.e., the number of ads that are retrieved but not watched) by pre-fetching the next ad just prior to its display.
- this improved (e.g., lower latency) system the user may be less likely to feel that the system is slow and, thus, may be more likely to view more content and for a longer duration.
- FIG. 1 is a dataflow diagram showing a known synchronous data flow 20 between a video player 22 operating on a user device (e.g., "client device", not separately shown in FIG. 1 ), an ad server 24, and a plurality of ad networks 26, 28, and 30.
- video player 22 displays video content such as movies, television programs and other videos (e.g., publications), as well as video ads (e.g., content items), to a user.
- video ads e.g., content items
- the video player 22 generates and transmits a video ad request to the first ad network 26.
- the video player 22 then starts a timer and waits for a response from the first ad network 26. If no response is received by the time the timer reaches the time-out value (e.g., four seconds later), the video player 22 generates and transmits a video ad request to the second ad network 28. The video player 22 then starts a timer and waits for a response from the second ad network 28. If no response is received by the time the timer reaches the time-out value (e.g., four seconds later), the video player 22 generates and transmits a video ad request to the third ad network 30. The video player 22 then starts a timer and waits for a response from the third ad network 30. In this case, the video player 22 receives a video ad from the third ad network and begins to play the video ad.
- the time-out value e.
- video advertisements do not always fill.
- the video player 22 has to wait long periods of time before it can display a video advertisement (e.g., "latency").
- a video advertisement e.g., "latency”
- users are likely to lose interest in the video advertisement and the video that they were originally watching.
- the pre-fetching system described below addresses the latency problem of the synchronous system.

- Time rule 412 is aligned with display timeline 410 to facilitate discussion of event timings associated with online content presentation during the display of the video publication.
- Ad 1 420 may be a pre-fetched video ad.
- pre-fetched indicates that some or all of the content item was downloaded (i.e., transmitted) to the presentation device (e.g., computing device 404) prior to the beginning of display of that content item.
- the term "completely pre-fetched" indicates that the content item has been downloaded in its entirety prior to the beginning of display of that content item.

- ad break point 434 is identified by a marker or other meta-data associated with publication 422 (e.g., a pre-defined break point that is defined within the publication as a suitable time to interrupt the publication for an ad).
- ad break point 434 is determined to be at a time corresponding to the end of display of publication 422. Any system or method for computing, identifying, or otherwise determining ad break points that enable the systems and methods described herein may be used.
- computing device 404 also determines a "pre-fetch point" 432.
- pre-fetch point is used generally to refer to the point at which pre-fetching of a content item such as Ad 2 424 begins.
- pre-fetch gap time is used generally to refer to an amount of time or a time window between a pre-fetch point and an ad break point (e.g., the 2 minutes between pre-fetch point 432 and ad break point 434).
- pre-fetch point 432 is a fixed amount of time prior to an ad break point.
- pre-fetch gap time 430 is a pre-defined amount of time, such as 15 seconds.
- computing device computes pre-fetch point 432 by subtracting a pre-defined pre-fetch gap time 430 from ad break point 434.
- pre-fetch gap time 430 and/or pre-fetch point 432 are computed values based on one or more factors. Some factors may be attributes of the next ad to be displayed (e.g., Ad 2 424), such as a file size (e.g., the size of Ad 2 424 in bytes) or a display length (e.g., how long Ad 2 takes to be displayed) of the next ad.
- Ad 2 424 attributes of the next ad to be displayed
- a file size e.g., the size of Ad 2 424 in bytes
- a display length e.g., how long Ad 2 takes to be displayed
- computing device 404 may compute pre-fetch point 432 to be 30 seconds before ad break point 434 if Ad 2 is a 15-second ad, or may compute pre-fetch point 432 to be 60 seconds before ad break point 434 if Ad 2 is a 30-second ad.
- Other factors for computing pre-fetch gap time 430 and/or pre-fetch point 432 may be one or more attributes related to computing device 404, such as, for example: (a) a link quality or network latency between computing device 404 and a wireless network (not shown); (b) a download bandwidth rate between computing device 404 and the providers of online content (e.g., to the source of Ad 2 424); (c) available disk space or other memory on computing device 404; (d) user profile preference settings; (e) user behavior, such as how long the user is likely to watch the next ad, or how likely the user is to skip the next ad; (f) video quality of the next ad (e.g., resolution), which may take into account demographics, interests, gender, and/or watch history of the user; and (g) bitrate of computing device 404.
- attributes related to computing device 404 such as, for example: (a) a link quality or network latency between computing device 404 and a wireless network (not shown); (b)
- computing device 404 may monitor the status of the wireless link and/or the download bandwidth associated either in general with the network or specifically with content providers. Presume, in scenario 450, that computing device 404 has a low bandwidth rate at a time leading up to the pre-fetching of Ad 2 424. Under this low bandwidth scenario 450, computing device 404 takes almost two minutes to download Ad 2 424. In other words, the pre-fetch download time 452 for Ad 2 424 is estimated to be approximately 1.8 minutes. As such, computing device 404 sets pre-fetch point 444 for Ad 2 424 in scenario 450 to begin at the 5.5 minute mark. In a higher bandwidth scenario 440, Ad2 424 has a pre-fetch download time 442 of less than 30 seconds. As such, computing device 404 sets pre-fetch point 454 for Ad 2 424 in scenario 440 to begin at the 6.5 minute mark.
- computing device 404 may compute pre-fetch gap time 430 and/or pre-fetch point 432 based on multiple factors such as, for example, the size of Ad 2 combined with the download bandwidth. Such factors allow computing device 404 to, for example, approximate download times for ads and delay the pre-fetch point (i.e., the point at which the next ad download is initiated) to be nearer the ad break point. In some embodiments, computing device 404 may compute pre-fetch gap time 430 such as to have the pre-fetch of Ad 2 424 finish at the time of ad break point 434.
- the next ad (e.g., Ad 2 424) is only partially pre-fetched.
- a first portion of Ad 2 424 is pre-fetched, such as the first five seconds of Ad 2 424.
- the length or size of this partial portion of the next ad is generally referred to herein as a "pre-fetch length.”
- computing device 404 may begin streaming or downloading the remainder of the next ad. As such, computing device 404 may start the pre-fetched ad with low latency, then simultaneously fetch or buffer the remainder for use as the displaying of the next ad continues.
- Partial pre-fetching may provide several benefits such as, for example, reducing unnecessary downloads in the case of abandoned views, reduced bandwidth consumption, and reducing the pre-fetch gap time (e.g., moving pre-fetch point 432 closer to ad break point 434).
- one or more of the above factors for computing pre-fetch gap time 430 may be used to determine values associated with partial pre-fetching of ads.
- available disk space on computing device 404 may be used to limit the partial pre-fetch length of Ad 2 424 when disk space is constrained.
- user preferences may determine the partial pre-fetch length of Ad 2 424.
- user behavior may influence the partial pre-fetch length of Ad 2 424. For example, if user 402 regularly abandons (e.g., dismisses without fully viewing) ads within the first few seconds, then the partial pre-fetch length of Ad 2 424 may be reduced, or in some cases set to approximately the average viewing time before abandonment or slightly more. As such, only the portion that user 402 is likely to view will be pre-fetched by computing device 404.
- which ad to be displayed next may be selected based at least in part on the publication currently being displayed (e.g., publication 422).
- computing device 404 may identify attributes of publication 422, such as a category for the publication (e.g., publication 422 is related to automobiles), and may request the next ad to be related to automobiles (e.g., Ad 2 424 is for a car company).
- Ad 2 424 may be weighted or otherwise incorporated with other known data such as a long-term profile of the user, or of the computing device, or a short-term profile or session information, or other data associated with user 402 such as search results history or online browsing history.
- computing device 404 may identify a relevant next ad to pre-fetch.
- the next ad to be displayed is a "midroll ad", or an add that is displayed within a single video publication (e.g., video publication 422, parts of which are presented before and after display of Ad 2 424).
- the ad break point may be at or after the end of the video currently being displayed (e.g., video publication 422).
- the ad being pre-fetched may not be used until the beginning of the display of the next publication, such as, for example, in a sequential play or later play of two different video publications.
- presume video publication 422 is the next publication to be displayed to user 402 such as, for example, through a later user choice, or in an auto-play sequence such as a playlist.
- Ad 1 is, thus, the "next ad" to be pre-fetched during the display of a prior video publication.
- the end of a publication may be used as an ad break point, thereby enabling the pre-fetching of the next ad (e.g., the pre-fetching of Ad 1 420).
- Ad 1 is pre-fetched during the display of the prior video publication, stored locally on computing device 404, and available for low latency display to user 402 upon initiation of video publication 422.

- the server device may identify ads 420, 424 to be displayed to user 402, compute ad break points 434, pre-fetch gap times 430, and/or pre-fetch points 432, and transmit these elements of information to computing device 404 for use during the presentation of publication 422.
- multiple remote computing devices may perform one or more of the steps described herein.
- CMS 106 acts as a central server for coordinating ad pre-fetching on computing device 404, and may retrieve content items and/or presentations from content providers 102 (shown in FIG. 2 ) and/or publishers 104 (shown in FIG. 2 ) via network 110.
- Content providers 102 and/or publishers 104 may also provide data associated with content items and publications that may be used by CMS 106 and/or computing device 404 to compute or otherwise determine one or more of ad break points 434, pre-fetch gap times 430, pre-fetch points 432, sizes or display times for ads 420, 424, and/or download times 442, 452 for content items.

- determining 530 a pre-fetch point further includes computing a pre-fetch gap time based on one or more of a link quality of the first computing device, a bit rate of the first computing device, a size of the content item, and a download rate of the first computing device.
- method 500 also includes initiating 540 transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point.
- method 500 further includes determining 532 a pre-fetch length of the content item that is less than a total length of the content item, and initiating 540 transmission of a content item further includes initiating transmission of a first portion of the content item approximately equal to the pre-fetch length.
- determining a pre-fetch length further includes determining a pre-fetch length based on one or more of historical user behavior of the user, a user profile, a bit rate of the content item, and available storage space in the memory.
- method 500 also includes displaying 550 the online content item to the user using the output device. In other embodiments, selecting the content item based at least in part on one or more attributes of the online publication.
- the first computing device is a client device that includes the memory and the output device, and initiating 540 transmission of a content item includes initiating transmission of the content item from a second computing device to the first computing device, wherein the second computing device is a server device.

Description
- This specification relates to presenting online content items in combination with online publications, and more particularly to a network-based system and method for pre-fetching online content items for low latency display to a user during a presentation of an online publication.
- Internet users are able to view publications (e.g., video publications) on user devices. At least some of these publications include movies, television programs, and other videos that the user views with, for example, their mobile computing device. These publications may be online publications (e.g., Internet-streaming videos) or offline publications (e.g., videos stored on the mobile computing device), and are displayed along with online content items (e.g., video advertisements) where the online content item is displayed at a predetermined time during the display of the publication (e.g., before, during, or after).
- In some known systems, a video publication is displayed on a user device, and the video publication reaches a point when a video advertisement is to be displayed to the user, the user device transmits a call to an online content provider. The online content provider serves an appropriate online content item to the user device for displaying. However, in some cases, the online content provider may not have an appropriate online content item to provide to the user and instead may have to instruct the user device to request online content items from one or more other content providers. Each time a call is made by the user device to a content provider, or by the online content provider to other online content providers, these operations cause further delay in serving and displaying the online content item to the user. In addition, some formats of online content items (e.g., video advertisements) may require a longer buffer time, which may cause additional delays. These delays can frustrate the user.
- In one aspect, a computer-implemented method for pre-fetching online content items is provided. The method uses a first computing device including a processor in communication with an output device and a memory. The method includes displaying an online publication to a user using the output device. The method also includes identifying a break point associated with the online publication. The method further includes determining, by the processor, a pre-fetch point prior to the break point. The method also includes initiating transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point.
- In another aspect, a computer system is provided. The computer system includes an output device and at least one memory. The computer system also includes one or more processors configured to display an online publication to a user using said output device. The one or more processors are also configured to identify a break point associated with the online publication. The one or more processors are further configured to determine a pre-fetch point prior to the break point. The one or more processors are also configured to initiate transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point.
- In yet another aspect, computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided. When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to display an online publication to a user using an output device. The computer-executable instructions also cause the at least one processor to identify a break point associated with the online publication. The computer-executable instructions further cause the at least one processor to determine a pre-fetch point prior to the break point. The computer-executable instructions also cause the at least one processor to initiate transmission of a content item from a second computing device to the processor at the pre-fetch point.
- In yet another aspect, a computer device comprising one or more processors is provided. The computer device is in communication with a client device including a memory and an output device. The computer device is configured to display an online publication to a user using said output device. The computer device is also configured to identify a break point associated with the online publication. The computer device is further configured to determine a pre-fetch point prior to the break point. The computer device is also configured to initiate transmission of a content item from the computer device into the memory of the client device at the pre-fetch point.

FIG. 5 is an example method for pre-fetching content items for low latency display to a user using the networked environment shown inFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 6 shows an example configuration of a database within a computing device, along with other related computing components, that may be used to pre-fetch content items such as video ads for presentation to a user during the presentation of a publication such as the viewing of an online video. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable low latency display of online content items (e.g., "ads" or "advertisements") during the presentation of online publications such as Internet videos or videos stored on a user's computing device. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein facilitate pre-fetching content items from an online content provider such that at the time of presentation, some or all of the upcoming ads are stored locally and available for immediate presentation. The pre-fetch system includes a server computing device in communication with a client device and a memory device.
- For example, a user may be watching online publications on the client device (e.g., mobile tablet computer or smartphone) through, for example, an online video sharing web site in which users are able to upload, download, and stream video content. During presentation of the online publication (e.g., online video), the pre-fetch system presents the user with one or more video ads. The user may be presented on the client device with an ad prior to the start of the video, and/or at one or more points during the video (collectively referred to herein as "ad break points"). As the video presentation approaches an ad break point, the pre-fetch system pre-fetches an ad. More specifically, pre-fetch system retrieves the next ad from an online content provider and stores the ad locally on the client device for display during the upcoming ad slot. The pre-fetch system identifies an ad break point within a video being displayed to the user, and determines a time prior to the ad break point to begin pre-fetching the ad (a "pre-fetch point").
- In some embodiments, the next ad is pre-fetched at a pre-determined amount of time prior to the ad break point, (i.e., a "pre-fetch gap time" between the beginning of the pre-fetch and the ad break point, such as 10 seconds before the next ad is due to be displayed). In other embodiments, this pre-fetch gap time may be computed based on a variety of factors such as: (a) the bandwidth quality of the mobile device or the mobile device's current connection; (b) the available disk space on the mobile device; (c) the user's configuration profile; and (d) historical user behavior. For example, the pre-fetch system may determine that the mobile device presently has a low-quality (i.e., low bandwidth) connection, and thus may increase the pre-fetch gap to allow for more pre-fetching time. Further, the pre-fetch system may pre-fetch only a portion of the next ad (a partial pre-fetch). More specifically, according to the invention, the pre-fetch system determines a portion of the next ad that will be pre-fetched (e.g., a "pre-fetch length" representing the first X seconds of the ad). This pre-fetch length is computed based on the user's behavior history, and how long the user is likely to view the ad, or on bandwidth quality of the user's mobile device or the mobile device's current connection, or on the available disk and/or memory space on the mobile device. As such, the system may increase the amount of the ad that is pre-fetched when the user is more likely to watch most or all of the ad.
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) displaying an online publication to a user using the output device; (b) identifying a break point associated with the online publication; (c) determining, by a processor, a pre-fetch point prior to the break point; (d) initiating transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point; (e) displaying the online content item to the user using the output device; (f) determining a pre-fetch point that is a pre-determined amount of time prior to the break point; (g) computing a pre-fetch gap time based on one or more of a link quality of the first computing device, a bit rate of the first computing device, a size of the content item, and a download rate of the first computing device; (h) determining a pre-fetch length of the content item that is less than a total length of the content item, wherein initiating transmission of a content item further includes initiating transmission of a first portion of the content item approximately equal to the pre-fetch length; (i) determining a pre-fetch length base on one or more of historical user behavior of the user, a user profile, a bit rate of the content item, and available storage space in the memory; (j) selecting the content item based at least in part on one or more attributes of the online publication; (k) initiating transmission of the content item from a second computing device to the first computing device, wherein the second computing device is a server device; and (1) initiating transmission of the content item from the first computing device to a second computing device, wherein the second computing device is a client device that includes the memory and the output device.
- In some known systems, startup and streaming of ad content may take several seconds of processing before the displaying of the ad begins (e.g., "latency"). This latency is often dependent upon the time required to transfer a few seconds of video from a server to the client device (e.g., the user's device). In contrast, the pre-fetch system described herein retrieves ads just prior to the time they are needed. Overall technical effects of this pre-fetch system include at least improving the latency issue of prior systems by pre-fetching and storing the next ad locally on the client device, and reducing abandonment rates for advertisements (i.e., the number of ads that are retrieved but not watched) by pre-fetching the next ad just prior to its display. With this improved (e.g., lower latency) system, the user may be less likely to feel that the system is slow and, thus, may be more likely to view more content and for a longer duration.
- The following detailed description illustrates embodiments of the disclosure by way of example and not by way of limitation. It is contemplated that the disclosure has general application to the presentation of content items such as online advertisements during presentation of online content items.
- As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and proceeded with the word "a" or "an" should be understood as not excluding plural elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited. Furthermore, references to "one embodiment" of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.

FIG. 1 is a dataflow diagram showing a knownsynchronous data flow 20 between avideo player 22 operating on a user device (e.g., "client device", not separately shown inFIG. 1 ), anad server 24, and a plurality ofad networks video player 22 displays video content such as movies, television programs and other videos (e.g., publications), as well as video ads (e.g., content items), to a user. When thevideo player 22 determines that a video ad is to be displayed (e.g., an ad breakpoint), thevideo player 22 requests a video ad from thead server 24. Thevideo player 22 generates and transmits a video ad request to thefirst ad network 26. Thevideo player 22 then starts a timer and waits for a response from thefirst ad network 26. If no response is received by the time the timer reaches the time-out value (e.g., four seconds later), thevideo player 22 generates and transmits a video ad request to thesecond ad network 28. Thevideo player 22 then starts a timer and waits for a response from thesecond ad network 28. If no response is received by the time the timer reaches the time-out value (e.g., four seconds later), thevideo player 22 generates and transmits a video ad request to thethird ad network 30. Thevideo player 22 then starts a timer and waits for a response from thethird ad network 30. In this case, thevideo player 22 receives a video ad from the third ad network and begins to play the video ad. - As seen in the known
synchronous data flow 20, video advertisements do not always fill. In some situations, thevideo player 22 has to wait long periods of time before it can display a video advertisement (e.g., "latency"). In these situations, users are likely to lose interest in the video advertisement and the video that they were originally watching. The pre-fetching system described below addresses the latency problem of the synchronous system. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram showing an example networked environment for pre-fetching and displaying content items to users in combination with publications, such as through video player 22 (shown inFIG. 1 ). With reference toFIG. 2 , an examplenetworked environment 100 may include one or more content providers 102 (alternatively referred to herein as merchants), one ormore publishers 104, a content management system (CMS) 106, and one or more user access devices 108 ("client computing devices" or just "client devices"), which may be coupled to anetwork 110. User access devices are used byusers elements FIG. 1 may be implemented or associated with hardware components, software components, or firmware components or any combination of such components.

A content impression refers to any form of presentation of content such that it is viewable/receivable by a user. In some examples, a content impression may occur when content is displayed on a display device of a user access device (i.e., a "client computing device"). A content group refers, for example, to an entity that represents a group of creatives that share a common characteristic, such as having the same content selection and recommendation criteria. Content groups can be used to create a content campaign.
- In some embodiments, one or more ads are affiliated with an "ad group." An ad group includes one or more ads along with other associated information related to those ads, such as, for example and without limitation, a title, a headline, a budget, targeting criteria, and keywords. In the example embodiment, an ad group includes one ad and associated information. As used herein, the term "ad" and "ad group" may be used interchangeably, as some operations that are performed relative to an ad may also be performed relative to an ad group, and vice versa.

Such content space may be populated with content items from thecontent providers 102, and may be presented to theuser - As noted above, one or more of the
publishers 104 may represent a publication network. In such an implementation, thecontent providers 102 may be able to present content to users through this publication network. Further, in some embodiments,content providers 102 bid on online content items, for example, throughCMS 106. - The
publishers 104 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 114, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. They may include or maintain one or more processes that run on data processing systems. In some examples, thepublishers 104 may include one ormore publication repositories 124 for storing publications and other information. Additionally, in some embodiments,publishers 104 and/orcontent providers 102 may review online content items using, for example,system 114 and/orCMS 106. - The
CMS 106 manages content and provides various services to thecontent providers 102, thepublishers 104, and the user access devices 108. TheCMS 106 may store content in acontent repository 126 and facilitate the distribution or selective provision and recommendation of content through theenvironment 100 to the user access devices 108. - The
CMS 106 may include one or moredata processing systems 116, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. It can also include one or more processes, such as server processes. In some examples, theCMS 106 may include acontent serving system 120 and one or morebackend processing systems 118. Thecontent serving system 120 may include one or moredata processing systems 116 and may perform functionality associated with delivering content to publishers or user access devices 108. Thebackend processing systems 118 may include one or moredata processing systems 116 and may perform functionality associated with identifying relevant content to deliver, processing various rules, performing filtering processes, generating reports, maintaining accounts and usage information, auctioning online content items, and other backend system processing. TheCMS 106 can use thebackend processing systems 118 and thecontent serving system 120 to selectively recommend and provide relevant content from thecontent providers 102 through thepublishers 104 to the user access devices 108. - The
CMS 106 may include or access one or more crawling, indexing and searching modules (not shown). These modules may browse accessible resources (e.g., the World Wide Web, publisher content, data feeds, etc.) to identify, index and store information. The modules may browse information and create copies of the browsed information for subsequent processing. The modules may also check links, validate code, harvest information, and/or perform other maintenance or other tasks. - Searching modules may search information from various resources, such as the World Wide Web, publications, intranets, newsgroups, databases, and/or directories. The search modules may employ one or more known search or other processes to search data. In some implementations, the search modules may index crawled content and/or content received from data feeds to build one or more search indices. The search indices may be used to facilitate rapid retrieval of information relevant to a search query. Searching modules may also store search results including one or more of search query terms, search results elements, and ads impressions served.
- The
CMS 106 may include one or more interface or frontend modules for providing the various features to content providers, publishers, and user access devices. For example, theCMS 106 may provide one or more publisher front-end interfaces (PFEs) for allowing publishers to interact with theCMS 106. TheCMS 106 may also provide one or more content provider front-end interfaces (CPFEs) for allowing content providers to interact with theCMS 106. In some examples, the front-end interfaces may be configured as web applications that provide users with network access to features available in theCMS 106. - The
CMS 106 provides various content management features to thecontent providers 102. TheCMS 106 features may allow users to set up user accounts, set account preferences, create content, select keywords for content, create campaigns or initiatives for multiple products or businesses, view reports associated with accounts, analyze costs and return on investment, selectively identify customers in different regions, selectively recommend and provide content to particular publishers, analyze financial information, analyze content performance, estimate content traffic, access keyword tools, add graphics and animations to content, and review content items as described herein. - The
CMS 106 may allow thecontent providers 102 to create content and input keywords for which the content will appear. In some examples, theCMS 106 may provide content to user access devices or publishers when keywords associated with that content are included in a user request or a requested publication. TheCMS 106 may also allow thecontent providers 102 to set bids for content. A bid may represent the maximum amount a content provider is willing to pay for each content impression, user click-through of content or other interaction with content. A click-through can include any action a user takes to select content. Thecontent providers 102 may also choose a currency and monthly budget. - The
CMS 106 may also allow thecontent providers 102 to view information about content impressions, which may be maintained by theCMS 106. TheCMS 106 may be configured to determine and maintain the number of content impressions relative to a particular website or keyword. TheCMS 106 may also determine and maintain the number of click-trough's for content as well as the ratio of click-trough's to impressions. - The
CMS 106 may also allow thecontent providers 102 to select and/or create conversion types for content. A "conversion" may occur when a user consummates a transaction related to given content. A conversion could be defined to occur when a user clicks on content, for example a specific content item, is referred to the content provider's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. In another example, a conversion could be defined as the display of content to a user and a corresponding purchase on the content provider's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days). TheCMS 106 may store conversion data and other information in aconversion data repository 136. - The
CMS 106 may allow thecontent providers 102 to input description information associated with content. This information could be used to assist thepublishers 104 in determining content to publish. Thecontent providers 102 may additionally input a cost/value associated with selected conversion types, such as a five dollar credit to thepublishers 104 for each product or service purchased. - The
CMS 106 may provide various features to thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 may deliver content (associated with the content providers 102) to the user access devices 108 when users access publications from thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 can be configured to deliver content that is relevant to publisher sites, publications, and publisher audiences. - In some examples, the
CMS 106 may crawl publications provided by thepublishers 104 and deliver content that is relevant to publisher sites, publications and publisher audiences based on the crawled publications. TheCMS 106 may also selectively recommend and/or provide content based on user information and behavior, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website. In some examples, theCMS 106 can add search to a publisher site and deliver content configured to provide appropriate and relevant content relative to search results generated by requests from visitors of the publisher site. A combination of these and other approaches can be used to deliver relevant content. - The
CMS 106 may allow thepublishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated content to be displayed with publications provided by thepublishers 104. For example, thepublishers 104 may search through content in thecontent repository 126 and select certain content for display with their publications. - The
CMS 106 may be configured to selectively recommend and provide content created by thecontent providers 102 to the user access devices 108 directly or through thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide content to a particular publisher 104 (as described in further detail herein) or a requesting user access device 108 when a user requests search results or loads a publication from thepublisher 104. - In some implementations, the
CMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in theenvironment 100. For example, theCMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of thecontent providers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by theCMS 106. - "Computing devices", for example user access devices 108, may include any devices capable of receiving information from the
network 110. The user access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks. Examples of user access devices include personal computers (e.g., desktop computers), mobile computing devices, cell phones, smart phones, head-mounted computing devices, media players/recorders, music players, game consoles, media centers, media players, electronic tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), television systems, audio systems, radio systems, removable storage devices, navigation systems, set top boxes, other electronic devices and the like. The user access devices 108 can also include various other elements, such as processes running on various machines. - The
network 110 may include any element or system that facilitates communications among and between various network nodes, such aselements network 110 may include one or more telecommunications networks, such as computer networks, telephone or other communications networks, the Internet, etc. Thenetwork 110 may include a shared, public, or private data network encompassing a wide area (e.g., WAN) or local area (e.g., LAN). In some implementations, thenetwork 110 may facilitate data exchange by way of packet switching using the Internet Protocol (IP). Thenetwork 110 may facilitate wired and/or wireless connectivity and communication. - For purposes of explanation only, certain aspects of this disclosure are described with reference to the discrete elements illustrated in
FIG. 2 . The number, identity and arrangement of elements in theenvironment 100 are not limited to what is shown. For example, theenvironment 100 can include any number of geographically-dispersedcontent providers 102,publishers 104 and/or user access devices 108, which may be discrete, integrated modules or distributed systems.

The software instructions may be read intomemory 206 from another computer-readable medium, such asdata storage device 210, or from another device viacommunication interface 216. The software instructions contained inmemory 206 may causeprocessor 204 to perform processes described herein. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the subject matter herein.

Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating oncomputing device 200. -
Computing device 200 may be implemented in a number of different forms. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone, or as part of a smart phone, personal digital assistant, a computer tablet, or other similar mobile device. - To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system (e.g., computing device 200) that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- In the example embodiment,
computing device 200 is configured to pre-fetch and display content items to a viewer of publications such as video presentations. In some embodiments,computing device 200 is a mobile computing device that displays the publications and pre-fetched content items to a user. In other embodiments,computing device 200 is a remote computing device in communication with the user's display device and manages pre-fetching of content items to the user's device. -
FIG. 4 is a diagram showing anexample timeline 400 in which online content items (e.g., ads) are pre-fetched for low latency display to a user. In the example embodiment, auser 402 consumes apublication 422, such as an online video publication, using acomputing device 404 such as a mobile phone or tablet computer. In some embodiments,user 402 is similar tousers FIG. 1 ), andcomputing device 404 is similar to user access devices 108 (shown inFIG. 1 ). Further, in some embodiments, publications and content items are served and/or displayed in a networked environment similar to networked environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ). In other embodiments, publications and content items are served and/or displayed in an offline environment, for example wherecomputing device 404 retrieves publications and content items stored on internal memory. - In the example illustrated in
FIG. 4 , adisplay timeline 410 illustrates the display ofvideo publication 422 touser 402 along with two ads, "Ad 1" 420 and "Ad 2" 424. Atime rule 412 is provided inFIG. 4 , representing units of time in minutes, and beginning at a reference point t = 0 seconds.Time rule 412 is aligned withdisplay timeline 410 to facilitate discussion of event timings associated with online content presentation during the display of the video publication. As used herein, times referred to with variable t refer to times, in minutes from t = 0, ontime rule 412 and an associated point ondisplay timeline 410. - In the example embodiment,
user 402 initiates display of the video publication oncomputing device 404 at time t = 0. Prior to beginning the display ofpresentation 422,computing device 404displays Ad 1 420 from time t = 0 to 0.5 minutes. In some embodiments,Ad 1 420 may be a pre-fetched video ad. As used herein, the term "pre-fetched," as used in reference to content items and video ads, indicates that some or all of the content item was downloaded (i.e., transmitted) to the presentation device (e.g., computing device 404) prior to the beginning of display of that content item. As such, the term "completely pre-fetched" indicates that the content item has been downloaded in its entirety prior to the beginning of display of that content item. Further, the term "partially pre-fetched" indicates that less than all of the content item has been downloaded prior to the beginning of display. For example, in some embodiments,Ad 1 420 is completely pre-fetched prior to time t = 0, where in other embodiments,Ad 1 420 has a beginning portion (e.g., the first 5 seconds ofAd 1 420) pre-fetched prior to time t = 0. SinceAd 1 420 is pre-fetched (e.g., stored locally),computing device 404 is able to being display ofAd 1 420 with low latency (e.g., with little delay waiting for the display ofAd 1 420 to begin). - At time t = 0.5, in the example embodiment, the display of
Ad 1 420 ends andcomputing device 404 begins displayingpublication 422. In some embodiments,publication 422 is displayed until finished (e.g., completely displayed). In the example embodiment, the display ofpublication 422 is interrupted (e.g., displayed in segments) at an "ad break point" 434 at time t = 7.5. As used herein, the term "ad break point", or just "break point", is used generally to refer to the point at which display of a publication ends or is otherwise paused, stopped, segmented, or interrupted, and a content item such as a pre-fetched ad may then be presented or displayed to the viewing user. - Further, in some embodiments,
ad break point 434 is computed or otherwise determined by computingdevice 404. For example, and in the example embodiment,ad break point 434 is computed by computingdevice 404 as a point intime 7 minutes after the beginning of the display of publication 422 (e.g., 7 minutes after time t = 0.5). In other embodiments,ad break point 434 is identified by a marker or other meta-data associated with publication 422 (e.g., a pre-defined break point that is defined within the publication as a suitable time to interrupt the publication for an ad). In still other embodiments,ad break point 434 is determined to be at a time corresponding to the end of display ofpublication 422. Any system or method for computing, identifying, or otherwise determining ad break points that enable the systems and methods described herein may be used. - In the example embodiment,
computing device 404 also determines a "pre-fetch point" 432. As used herein, the term "pre-fetch point" is used generally to refer to the point at which pre-fetching of a content item such asAd 2 424 begins. Further, as used herein, the term "pre-fetch gap time" is used generally to refer to an amount of time or a time window between a pre-fetch point and an ad break point (e.g., the 2 minutes betweenpre-fetch point 432 and ad break point 434). - In some embodiments,
pre-fetch point 432 is a fixed amount of time prior to an ad break point. In other words,pre-fetch gap time 430 is a pre-defined amount of time, such as 15 seconds. In other embodiments,pre-fetch gap time 430 is computed based on the display time of the video publication (e.g., publication 422). For example, pre-fetch point may be computed to be half of the time of the segment of video publication (e.g., half of the time between t = 0.5 minutes, the start ofvideo publication 422, and t = 7.5 minutes, the time of ad break point 434), resulting in apre-fetch point 432 of t = 4.0. In some embodiments, computing device computespre-fetch point 432 by subtracting a pre-definedpre-fetch gap time 430 fromad break point 434. In other embodiments,pre-fetch point 432 may be computed relative to the beginning of the presentation of publication 422 (e.g., from time t = 0.5 minutes) or relative to the beginning of the prior ad presentation (e.g.,Ad 1 420 and time t = 0.0 minutes). In still other embodiments,pre-fetch point 432 may be the beginning of display of the prior ad (e.g.,Ad 1, at time t = 0.0). - In other embodiments,
pre-fetch gap time 430 and/orpre-fetch point 432 are computed values based on one or more factors. Some factors may be attributes of the next ad to be displayed (e.g.,Ad 2 424), such as a file size (e.g., the size ofAd 2 424 in bytes) or a display length (e.g., howlong Ad 2 takes to be displayed) of the next ad. For example,computing device 404 may computepre-fetch point 432 to be 30 seconds before ad break point 434 (e.g., pre-fetch gap time = 30 seconds) ifAd 2 is X bytes in length, or may computepre-fetch point 432 to be 60 seconds beforead break point 434 ifAd 2 is X*2 bytes in length. Similarly,computing device 404 may computepre-fetch point 432 to be 30 seconds beforead break point 434 ifAd 2 is a 15-second ad, or may computepre-fetch point 432 to be 60 seconds beforead break point 434 ifAd 2 is a 30-second ad. - Other factors for computing
pre-fetch gap time 430 and/orpre-fetch point 432 may be one or more attributes related tocomputing device 404, such as, for example: (a) a link quality or network latency betweencomputing device 404 and a wireless network (not shown); (b) a download bandwidth rate betweencomputing device 404 and the providers of online content (e.g., to the source ofAd 2 424); (c) available disk space or other memory oncomputing device 404; (d) user profile preference settings; (e) user behavior, such as how long the user is likely to watch the next ad, or how likely the user is to skip the next ad; (f) video quality of the next ad (e.g., resolution), which may take into account demographics, interests, gender, and/or watch history of the user; and (g) bitrate ofcomputing device 404. - For example,
computing device 404 may monitor the status of the wireless link and/or the download bandwidth associated either in general with the network or specifically with content providers. Presume, inscenario 450, thatcomputing device 404 has a low bandwidth rate at a time leading up to the pre-fetching ofAd 2 424. Under thislow bandwidth scenario 450,computing device 404 takes almost two minutes to downloadAd 2 424. In other words, thepre-fetch download time 452 forAd 2 424 is estimated to be approximately 1.8 minutes. As such,computing device 404 setspre-fetch point 444 forAd 2 424 inscenario 450 to begin at the 5.5 minute mark. In ahigher bandwidth scenario 440,Ad2 424 has apre-fetch download time 442 of less than 30 seconds. As such,computing device 404 setspre-fetch point 454 forAd 2 424 inscenario 440 to begin at the 6.5 minute mark. - Further,
computing device 404 may computepre-fetch gap time 430 and/orpre-fetch point 432 based on multiple factors such as, for example, the size ofAd 2 combined with the download bandwidth. Such factors allowcomputing device 404 to, for example, approximate download times for ads and delay the pre-fetch point (i.e., the point at which the next ad download is initiated) to be nearer the ad break point. In some embodiments,computing device 404 may computepre-fetch gap time 430 such as to have the pre-fetch ofAd 2 424 finish at the time ofad break point 434. In other words,computing device 404 may attempt to have the pre-fetch start at a time such that pre-fetching is completing just in time to start the presentation ofAd 2 424. For example, if computingdevice 404 computes a pre-fetch gap time of 430 of 15 seconds based on one or more of the factors described herein,computing device 404 may begin pre-fetching at time t = 7.25 minutes (i.e., ad break point t = 7.5 minutes minus 0.25 minutes). As such,computing device 404 minimizes the amount of time between the conclusion of the pre-fetch operation and the beginning of presentation of the next ad (e.g., ad break point 434). - According to the invention, the next ad (e.g.,
Ad 2 424) is only partially pre-fetched. In other words, and for example, only a first portion ofAd 2 424 is pre-fetched, such as the first five seconds ofAd 2 424. The length or size of this partial portion of the next ad is generally referred to herein as a "pre-fetch length." During or contemporaneous with the start of the display of the pre-fetched portion,computing device 404 may begin streaming or downloading the remainder of the next ad. As such,computing device 404 may start the pre-fetched ad with low latency, then simultaneously fetch or buffer the remainder for use as the displaying of the next ad continues. Partial pre-fetching may provide several benefits such as, for example, reducing unnecessary downloads in the case of abandoned views, reduced bandwidth consumption, and reducing the pre-fetch gap time (e.g., movingpre-fetch point 432 closer to ad break point 434). - In other embodiments, one or more of the above factors for computing
pre-fetch gap time 430 may be used to determine values associated with partial pre-fetching of ads. For example, available disk space oncomputing device 404 may be used to limit the partial pre-fetch length ofAd 2 424 when disk space is constrained. Further, for another example, user preferences may determine the partial pre-fetch length ofAd 2 424. And according to the invention, user behavior may influence the partial pre-fetch length ofAd 2 424. For example, ifuser 402 regularly abandons (e.g., dismisses without fully viewing) ads within the first few seconds, then the partial pre-fetch length ofAd 2 424 may be reduced, or in some cases set to approximately the average viewing time before abandonment or slightly more. As such, only the portion thatuser 402 is likely to view will be pre-fetched by computingdevice 404. - In some embodiments, which ad to be displayed next (e.g.,
Ad 2 424) may be selected based at least in part on the publication currently being displayed (e.g., publication 422). For example,computing device 404 may identify attributes ofpublication 422, such as a category for the publication (e.g.,publication 422 is related to automobiles), and may request the next ad to be related to automobiles (e.g.,Ad 2 424 is for a car company). This relevance ofpublication 422 to the next ad to be served,Ad 2 424, may be weighted or otherwise incorporated with other known data such as a long-term profile of the user, or of the computing device, or a short-term profile or session information, or other data associated withuser 402 such as search results history or online browsing history. As such,computing device 404 may identify a relevant next ad to pre-fetch. - In the example embodiment shown in
FIG. 4 , the next ad to be displayed (e.g.,Ad 2 424) is a "midroll ad", or an add that is displayed within a single video publication (e.g.,video publication 422, parts of which are presented before and after display ofAd 2 424). In other embodiments, the ad break point may be at or after the end of the video currently being displayed (e.g., video publication 422). In other words, the ad being pre-fetched may not be used until the beginning of the display of the next publication, such as, for example, in a sequential play or later play of two different video publications. For example, presumevideo publication 422 is the next publication to be displayed touser 402 such as, for example, through a later user choice, or in an auto-play sequence such as a playlist. Presume thatAd 1 is, thus, the "next ad" to be pre-fetched during the display of a prior video publication. In some embodiments, the end of a publication may be used as an ad break point, thereby enabling the pre-fetching of the next ad (e.g., the pre-fetching ofAd 1 420). As such,Ad 1 is pre-fetched during the display of the prior video publication, stored locally oncomputing device 404, and available for low latency display touser 402 upon initiation ofvideo publication 422. - In the examples described herein, many of the steps are illustrated as being performed by the computing device that is displaying publications and content items (a "client device", e.g., computing device 404). However, it should be understood that many of these steps may in addition, or alternatively, be performed by a remote computing device (a "server device" or "server system", e.g.,
CMS 106, or a cloud computing device) in communication with the client device. In other words, and in the example embodiment, the pre-fetch system includes at least one "client device" in communication with at least one "server device", but many of the particular steps may be performed by either the "client device" or the "server device." For example, the server device may identifyads user 402, computead break points 434,pre-fetch gap times 430, and/orpre-fetch points 432, and transmit these elements of information tocomputing device 404 for use during the presentation ofpublication 422. Further, multiple remote computing devices may perform one or more of the steps described herein. For example, in one embodiment,CMS 106 acts as a central server for coordinating ad pre-fetching oncomputing device 404, and may retrieve content items and/or presentations from content providers 102 (shown inFIG. 2 ) and/or publishers 104 (shown inFIG. 2 ) vianetwork 110.Content providers 102 and/orpublishers 104 may also provide data associated with content items and publications that may be used byCMS 106 and/orcomputing device 404 to compute or otherwise determine one or more ofad break points 434,pre-fetch gap times 430, pre-fetch points 432, sizes or display times forads times -
FIG. 5 is anexample method 500 for pre-fetching content items for low latency display to a user. In the example embodiment,method 500 is a computer-implemented method practiced in environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ) using one or more computing devices such as user access devices 108 (shown inFIG. 1 ), ad serving system 120 (shown inFIG. 1 ), content provider system 112 (shown inFIG. 1 ),publisher system 114, and/or computing device 404 (shown inFIG. 4 ), and includes at least one processor and a memory.Method 500 includes displaying 510 an online publication to a user using the output device.Method 500 also includes identifying 520 a break point associated with the online publication. - In the example embodiment,
method 500 further includes determining 530, by the processor, a pre-fetch point prior to the break point. In some embodiments, determining 530 a pre-fetch point further includes determining a pre-fetch point that is a pre-determined amount of time prior to the break point. In some embodiments, determining 530 a pre-fetch point further includes computing a pre-fetch gap time based on one or more of a link quality of the first computing device, a bit rate of the first computing device, a size of the content item, and a download rate of the first computing device. - In the example embodiment,
method 500 also includes initiating 540 transmission of a content item into the memory at the pre-fetch point. In some embodiments,method 500 further includes determining 532 a pre-fetch length of the content item that is less than a total length of the content item, and initiating 540 transmission of a content item further includes initiating transmission of a first portion of the content item approximately equal to the pre-fetch length. According to the invention, determining a pre-fetch length further includes determining a pre-fetch length based on one or more of historical user behavior of the user, a user profile, a bit rate of the content item, and available storage space in the memory. - In some embodiments,
method 500 also includes displaying 550 the online content item to the user using the output device. In other embodiments, selecting the content item based at least in part on one or more attributes of the online publication. In still other embodiments, the first computing device is a client device that includes the memory and the output device, and initiating 540 transmission of a content item includes initiating transmission of the content item from a second computing device to the first computing device, wherein the second computing device is a server device. In yet other embodiments, the first computing device is a server device, and initiating 540 transmission of a content item includes initiating transmission of the content item from the first computing device to a second computing device, wherein the second computing device is a client device that includes the memory and the output device. -
