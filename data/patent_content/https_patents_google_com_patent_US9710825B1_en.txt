Definitions
- the invention relates generally information organization and retrieval. More specifically, the invention relates to advertising and document relevance determination.
- the Internet which is a global network of interconnected networks and computers, commonly makes available a wide variety of information through a vehicle known as the World Wide Web (WWW).
- WWW World Wide Web
- search engines To aid users in finding sites or pages having information they desire, search engines were developed. Search engines and directories attempt to index pages and/or sites so that user's can find particular information. Typically, search engines are initiated by prompting a user to type in one or more keywords of their choosing along with connectors (such as “and”) and delimiters. The search engine matches the keywords with documents or categories in an index that contain those keywords or are indexed by those keywords and returns results (either categories or documents or both) to the user in the form of URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). One predominant web search engine receives submissions of sites and manually assigns them to categories within their directory. When the user types in a keyword, a literal sub-string match of that keyword with either the description of the site in their index or the name of the category occurs.
- URLs Uniform Resource Locators
- results of this sub-string search will contain some sites of interest, but in addition, may contain many sites that are not relevant or on point. Though one may refine the search with yet more keywords, the same sub-string match will be employed, but to the result set just obtained. Almost all search engines attempt to index sites and documents and leave it to the user to formulate an appropriate query, and then to eliminate undesired search results themselves. Recently other search engines using natural language queries have been developed but these also often result in many undesired responses.
- the quality of the results obtained varies, but by doing essentially sub-string matches or category browsing, the engines are unable to properly discern what the user actually intends or means when a particular keyword is entered.
- the response to search terms entered is a list of documents/sites that may bear little relation to the intended meaning/usage of the term(s) entered.
- banner ads One corollary response to search terms input into search engine is the retrieval and display of advertising icons often referred to as “banner ads.”
- One ad-buying model for companies and web sites desiring to advertise on a search engine is to purchase one or more search terms.
- the search term(s) When the search term(s) are input by a user of the search engine, the corresponding banner ad is displayed.
- the advertiser must purchase several search terms to cover a given concept or meaning that may have multiple equivalent terms associated with them. For instance, a computer manufacturer may have to buy “computer,” “PC,” and “desktop” if they desire to have an ad for computers appear. If the advertiser cannot afford the increase in cost certain equivalent expressions may be entirely missed by the ad campaign.
- banner ads One other factor with banner ads is that related terms or expressions may be completely ignored. For instance, the term “hardware” is not equivalent but related to “computer” and may be a related concept the advertiser desires to capture but cannot unless explicitly purchased.
- the responses to a given search term are often based upon the manner in which documents or pointers to document's are indexed in a directory.
- Internet search engines often index documents and pointers to those documents based upon one or more keywords, which may be embedded within the document, and/or automatically determined by analyzing the document or input manually by a user or reviewer desiring to have the document indexed.

- each block within the flowcharts represents both a method step and an apparatus element for performing the method step.
- the corresponding apparatus element may be configured in hardware, software, firmware or combinations thereof.
- the searching paradigm presented herein relies on an unconventional approach to information retrieval; namely, the idea of a “meaning-based” search. Instead of simply indexing words that appear in target documents, and allowing users to find desired word instances within documents or an index, searches are instead conducted within the realm of “semantic space”, allowing users to locate information that is “close in meaning” to the concepts they are interested in.
- a search engine and searching paradigm so implemented enables Web users to easily locate subject categories within a large subject directory, such as Netscape's Open Directory (a product of Netscape Communications Corporation) by a convenient and meaningful manner.
- a “target document” refers to a single subject page within such a directory.
- Such a subject directory is arranged in a roughly hierarchical fashion and consists of many unique topics.
- the invention in its various embodiments enables users to quickly filter out undesired responses, and therefore achieve more precise and more relevant search results. For example, the user would be able to filter out results relating to the concept of “Bulls” as a basketball team, because they are only interested in the concept of “Bulls” as a kind of cattle.
- search engines implemented according to the invention result in presenting conceptual areas “near” to a particular meaning, the user is also presented with categories that are likely to be of interest, yet might have been missed by a traditional search approach.
- An example would be a result of “Cows” to a search on “Bulls”, which would come up as a result because the concepts are deemed “near” to each other in semantic space.
- FIG. 1 is a flow diagram of one or more embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 1 The flow diagram in FIG. 1 for implementing meaning-based information organization and retrieval system may be summarized as follows:
- the first step is develop/update a useful meaning-based lexicon (block 110 ).
- a “lexicon” is a network of interconnected meanings; it describes the “semantic space” that is employed by the search engine.
- One such lexicon already in existence consists of thousands of meanings, or “synsets”, which are connected to one another through two key relationships: “kind of” and “part of”.
- the concept of “table” is connected to the concept of “furniture” through a “kind of” connection.
- “table” is a kind of “furniture”.
- “California” is a part of “United States”.
- the lexicon can be updated and expanded to include new meanings or update connections for meanings already present.
- New meanings can be updated mainly to reflect the importance in everyday culture of a large number of proper nouns, which are not available in many lexicons such as the names of companies, people, towns, etc.
- new meanings may have to be developed within the lexicon in order to cover subject areas of common interest with greater specificity. For example, whereas an existing lexicon might define the idea of a “programming language”, it may be useful to expand this concept within the lexicon to designate the many hundreds of specific programming languages that may exist as “kind of” children to this meaning.
- connection An extension to this “bind” connection is the concept of varying “bond strengths” between meanings. A value can be assigned to a connection from one meaning to another that signifies how strongly the second meaning relates to the first. These connection strengths are dependent on the direction of the bond, so that, for example, “skier” might imply a strong connection to “skiing”, whereas “skiing” need not imply “skier” to the same degree.
- One other enhancement is the addition of a “commonness” value to each meaning, which reflects a combination of “how often does this concept arise in everyday usage” and “how specific a concept is this”? This value allows both more accurate interpretation of input terms passed to the search engine (“what is more likely to be meant by this?”), as well as improved ranking of search results, showing users the results that they are more likely to be interested in first (the more specific terms are likely to be more important to the user).
- Each subject, or node, within the directory is given a “location” within the semantic space that is established by the Lexicon. Before a search engine can find anything within this space, targets to retrieve must be placed there.
- the process is envisioned to be a manual one; editors examine each directory subject node, and decide upon the “meaning” of the subject. However, this process may also be automated.
- one or more individual meanings from the Lexicon are “attached” to the node. These meanings may be grouped together into “synset groups”, each of which, in a sense, describes the node's position within a different dimension of semantic space.
- a node within the directory that is about “Piano Players” would be assigned the meaning piano player.
- a node about “Piano Players in Australia” would be assigned two meanings, piano player and Australia.
- the two concepts represent two distinct “synset groups” on the node, as each establishes a location for the node within a different “dimension” of meaning.
- Another way to look at this example is to say that the node represents the “intersection” of the concepts of piano player and Australia—it is where the two ideas come together within the directory.
- the concept of “distance” from one meaning to another within this space must be defined.
- the input to this portion of the process is the lexicon itself and the output is a table of information that details the distance from each meaning to each other meaning that falls within a certain “radius of semantic closeness”.
- the process for discovering meanings that are semantically close to a specific meaning involves a traditional breadth-first search outward from the origin meaning. Neighboring meanings in the network of nodes are explored in an outward seeking fashion, and distance from the origin is tracked. When a certain radius has been reached, the search stops. Intricacies in this search include the following:
- the inputs to this process are the lexicon, the table of relatives of each meaning, showing semantic distances, and the data that details what meanings have been attached to what nodes.
- the output of this process is information describing what nodes are close to each given meaning, and a “score” for that closeness, which is a direct reflection of the semantic distance from the origin meaning to the meanings that have been attached to the node.
- Other factors that affect the pre-calculated node scores for a meaning are the number of meanings attached to the node, and the “commonness” value of the meaning in question.
- An additional element of this pre-calculation step involves the creation of tables of information that allow very fast comparison between meaning when determining which nodes are hit by multiple meanings simultaneously. For this, bitmapped information that reflects a compressed version of the node-meaning score information is generated. Essentially, if a meaning has any score whatsoever for a particular node, a single bit is set to 1 in a binary field, marking that node as hit. By comparing the “bitmaps” for two meanings against each other, a quick assessment of “combination hits” can be made—it is simply a process of performing a bitwise AND operation on the two bitmaps.
- bitmap data is compressed.
- first level of compression single bit represents a set of 8 nodes. If a meaning has a score for any of these nodes, the bit is set.
- second level of compression each bit corresponds to a set of 64 nodes, in the same way.
- bitmap information in this way allows large chunks of empty raw bitmap data to be ignored, resulting in a much smaller data set.
- bitwise operations performed on these bitmaps can be done with greater speed, because detailed sections of the bitmap data do not have to be examined unless the higher-order compressed version indicates that there is information of value present there.
- pre-processing and information organization may be an on-going process, at anytime where at least a partial table of scores for nodes is available, the user can then input a specific search term as he/she would when using the conventional search engine.
- the search engine conducts two phases of processing.
- the first phase interpretation, involves analyzing the user's input so that the meanings that the user desires can be identified (see block 150 description).
- the second phase, collection and ranking of results involves the collecting of nodes that have good scores for the desired meanings, and ordering them based on predicted relevance (see block 160 description).
- an input string may be received and processed for results.
- the input string is simply a set of words that the user types into a search box and submits for query. An interpretation of these words is made, to map words to probable desired meanings.
- a set of meanings that are known ahead of time to be of interest may be passed to the search engine for query. These require less processing, as plain words to not have to be mapped to meanings, as they are already predefined. Meanings passed to the engine in this way are called preconceptions.
- the process for interpreting the input string begins with stemming, or morphing, of the individual words in the string. This involves mainly an attempt to reduce words perceived as being plurals to their singular form. This is necessary because word mappings to meanings within the Lexicon are stored in singular form only, except in special cases.
- probabilities are assigned to each. These values reflect the likelihood that the user really means a certain concept. Because many words have multiple meanings, probabilities for implied meanings for words may be manually or automatically pre-assigned. These values are used in this phase of the engine processing, in order to estimate what meanings are most likely implied by particular search words. Other factors that affect the probabilities given to meanings are: was the meaning matched by a morphed word or the word in its “pure” form (favor pure forms); was the meaning only partially matched the input word(s) (if so, reduce probability); was the meaning the result of a match on multiple words (if so, increase probability); the commonness of the meaning implied (favor more common meanings).
- Processing of preconceptions in the Interpretation phase is simpler, as the meanings that the user desires are passed as direct input to the engine.
- the only processing that is necessary is a weighting on the importance of these meanings, which is applied by analyzing the commonness of the meanings in question.
- Block 160 Collection and Ranking Phase
- This phase begins with the collection of bitmap information on the desired meanings. Only meanings that have more than a set number of node scores have bitmap information, these meanings are called popular. (Exception: if the search is being performed for a single input word, these bitmaps do not have to be collected.) Discovering bitmap information stored for meanings indicates to the engine their popular state.
- top scoring nodes for all meanings are queried from the pre-calculated score information. Meanings that were not found to be popular have their bitmaps constructed during this stage, as all of their scored nodes will be present in this “top scoring” category. Unless the search is to be a special AND operation between terms, we begin to compile a list of potential node results from these score table queries. (If the search is a pure OR, these results are likely to be useful. If an AND is to be done, the chances are good that most of these results will be filtered out, therefore all node scoring is performed later in this case.)
- bitmap analysis phase comes next. Behavior of the engine here varies widely between cases where different kinds of terms are required/not required. In general, the point of bitmap analysis is for either of the following reasons, or for a combination of them:
- Bitmap processing involves a series of bitwise OR and AND operations, which occur in two passes. Processing is done first on the highest level of compression, to get a rough idea of what areas of the bitmaps need to be examined in more detail. Next the detailed bitmap information of interest is queried from the database. Finally, the logical processing is run again at the uncompressed level of detail.
- the result of the bitmap processing is a set of nodes of interest. These nodes are queried from the score tables for all meanings of interest and added to the list of potential results nodes.
- Node scores result primarily from a multiplication of the score for the node for a given meaning and the probability factor for that meaning that came out of the Interpretation phase. Additional bonuses are given to nodes that are hit by a combination of meanings.
- the “portion of meaning” of the node is also considered. For example, if a node has three attached meaning groups (synset groups), and two of those meanings were queried by the user, we can say roughly that 2 ⁇ 3 of the concept behind this node was of interest to the user. Thus this node is probably of less interest to the user than one whose concept was hit more completely. Other special considerations are also introduced, such as the favoring of nodes that are hit “perfectly” by meanings, over those that were separated at all by some distance in semantic space.
- this is a search for subject matter that is “close in meaning” to the subject page they are currently on.
- These kinds of searches are performed by the passing of the meanings attached to the given subject to the search engine as preconceptions, along with the user's input string.
- the preconceptions are designated as required, and the input string terms, as a whole, are also treated as required terms.
- a user Whenever a user performs a search, the node results are preceded by a description of what meanings were actual searched on. Because these meanings are often the result of the interpretation of the user's input string, and may include multiple possible meanings for given words, the user is encouraged here to specify exactly what meanings they wanted, and to search again.
- This second search is called a refined search. Essentially, the user is presented with a set of checkboxes, each of which corresponds to a possible intended meaning. The user refines the search by simply checking off the meanings she wishes to search on, and clicking on “Search Again”.
- a refined search is passed to the search engine as a set of non-required preconceptions, thus an OR operation is performed on all of the meanings.
- Node results i.e. target documents, having the desired meaning or closeness in meaning to the concept searched for may then shown to the user.
- the user in turn may navigate the nodes presented him or refine his search in accordance with block 170 described above.
- nodes Once nodes are collected and ranked in accordance with block 160 (also described above), then they may shown to the user as results with the highest ranked nodes appearing first. This concludes the retrieval stage where the user has now successfully navigated to the site of interest.
- searching in a meaning-based fashioned as described above allows users to more quickly locate relevant and useful documents or sites.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a portion of a relationship based lexicon employed in one or more embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 2 shows one portion of a sample lexicon 200 which differs from conventional lexicons by adding a lateral bond (“bind”) connection between elements.
- the boxed elements in FIG. 2 represent meanings within the lexicon and collectively, along with the relationship connections between meanings can be viewed as defining a semantic space.
- the three basic relationship types “part of”, “kind of” and “bind” are represented by differing line types in FIG. 2 , a legend for which is drawn thereon.
- skiing is defined in the lexicon 200 as a kind of “sport”.
- the word “ski” typically, in its noun form, can be thought of as related to “skiing” in that it is a part of “skiing” as shown in FIG. 2 .
- “Slalom skiing” is a type of skiing and hence a kind of connection is shown between it and “skiing”.
- “Bindings” are a structural attachment on a ski, and hence it is assigned a part of connection with “ski”.
- the example of a specific brand of ski, “K2 ski,” is given to show how it is in a “kind of connection with “ski”.
- K2 ski is also assigned a lateral bond showing a conceptual commonness with the manufacturer of the ski “K2” which lies in the “company” branch.
- the company branch has as child “athletic equipment company” as a kind of “company.”
- “Athletic equipment company” has as its child in turn the “K2” company.
- ski is also a child of the “equipment” branch which has “athletic equipment” as a kind of “equipment” and ski as a kind of “athletic equipment”.
- “Surfboard” is related to “ski” in that it too is a kind of “athletic equipment”.
- Target documents or nodes within a subject directory may be “placed” or “located” by human intervention” into the semantic space as defined by lexicon 200 .
- a website that sells skis or has information about skiing destinations would fall somewhere within the defined semantic space based upon its focus of content.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the concept of bond strength and semantic distance in one or more embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates how distance and closeness of meaning between meanings can be quantified within the semantic space. Distances are shown between the element “ski” and all other elements within the semantic space. Using three classes of bond strengths the degree of closeness between meanings may be discovered. A “strong relationship” exists between “ski” and “skiing” as does between “ski” and “athletic equipment.” Between “skiing” and “sport” there is a weaker than strong relationship known as a “medium relationship”. This is because when you think of the root term “skiing” one doesn't quickly think also of “sport”. Going from “ski” to “skiing” however, the average person would more likely associate or think “skiing” if given the term “ski”.
- FIG. 3 also shows semantic distances between elements. “Ski” and “skiing” have only a distance of 2 between them while “skiing” and “sport” have a distance of 5 (7 ⁇ 2). The distance between “ski” and “sport” is 7. When travelling from parent to child or vice-versa, the distances can be simply added/subtracted but when changing the direction of travel, a penalty may be imposed upon the distance calculation. Take for example the distance between “ski” and “athletic equipment company”. Judging merely on a linear basis, the distance might be 12.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the application of synsets to categories in a subject directory tree.
- FIG. 4 illustrates how “Skiing in California” may be assigned a location in the semantic space.
- the subject directory 410 the subject Sports has associated with it the child subjects of “Football”, “Skiing” “Baseball” and “Tennis.”
- the subject “Skiing” has its own children “Skiing in California”, “Skiing in Colorado” “Skiing in Alaska” and “Skiing in Washington”.
- In the semantic space “Skiing in California” would be assigned to “skiing” as well as to “California”.
- the node “Skiing in California” would thus be ascribed the element “skiing” as well as “California” such that both meanings and related meanings would be available as additional refinements. For instance, consider “Los Angeles”, a city in California. If another node of directory 410 described “Things to do in Los Angeles”, by virtue of the connectedness of “Los Angeles” as part of “California” within the semantic space, this node may also be presented to the user when a search for “California” or “skiing in California” is performed even though none of the literal sub-strings match with the node. The meanings or closeness in concept would bring such relevancy of nodes to the forefront.
- FIG. 5 is a system diagram of one embodiment of the invention. Illustrated is a computer system 510 , which may be any general or special purpose computing or data processing machine such as a PC (personal computer), coupled to a network 500 .
- a computer system 510 may be any general or special purpose computing or data processing machine such as a PC (personal computer), coupled to a network 500 .
- PC personal computer
- One of ordinary skill in the art may program computer system 510 to act as a meaning-based search engine. This may be achieved using a processor 512 such as the Pentium® processor (a product of Intel Corporation) and a memory 511 , such as RAM, which is used to store/load instructions, addresses and result data as needed.
- the application(s) used to perform the functions of a meaning-based information organization and retrieval system may derive from an executable compiled from source code written in a language such as C++.
- the instructions of that executable file which correspond with instructions necessary to scale the image, may be stored to a disk 518 , such as a floppy drive, hard drive or CD-ROM 517 , or memory 511 .
- the lexicon, directory and scoring and distance tables and other such information may be written to/accessed from disk 518 or similar device.
- the software may be loaded into memory 511 and its instructions executed by processor 512 .
- Computer system 510 has a system bus 513 which facilitates information transfer to/from the processor 512 and memory 511 and a bridge 514 which couples to an I/O bus 515 .
- I/O bus 515 connects various I/O devices such as a network interface card (NIC) 516 , disk 518 and CD-ROM 517 to the system memory 511 and processor 512 .
- NIC network interface card
- the NIC 516 allows the meaning-based search engine software executing within computer system 510 to transact data, such as queries from a user, results of such queries back to users that present meaning-based results and refinements to searches performed, with users connected to network 500 . Filters and other meaning-based search utilities may be distributed across network 500 .
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of meaning-based advertising according to one or more embodiments of the invention.
- Meaning-based advertising may be achieved by placing or indexing ads within the semantic space.
- advertisements may be indexed or placed within the semantic space according to their targeted meaning. For instance, an advertisement from a desktop and laptop computer retailer might be indexed at/near a synset for personal computer. This places the advertisement into semantic space such that it would be retrieved according to an input that has a semantic “sub-space” that includes the advertisement's location.
- An advertisement such as an internet banner ad can thus be accessed or retrieved not merely by a keyword or category, but rather by a semantic concept that may encompass many words, equivalent words and words of related meaning.
- the computer retailer in the above example would be able to place the ad into the synset corresponding to personal computers.
- a search engine or mechanism that utilizes this semantic space may sell the concept of “personal computer” to the advertiser. Instead of a keyword or even multiple keywords the purchase of a concept such as “personal computer” may be much more valuable to the advertiser and the potential viewer of the ad.
- Input words such as “PC”, “laptop” “desktop” and “workstation” would be related closely with one another and thus fall in close proximity to one another. As a result, an input of any of these words to a search engine or filter would result in retrieval of the same banner ad.
- the word “hardware” in one of its meanings indicates devices that are used in a computing or communications environment. While “hardware” is not equivalent to “personal computer,” within a semantic space, “personal computer” may be related to the synset for “hardware” as a type of “hardware” and fall close enough in semantic distance such that an input of hardware might retrieve the same advertisement as would an input of “personal computer”. This procedure, as it relates to a searching utility or engine is described below.
- a user enters a search term (block 610 ).
- This search term is then fed to the search engine or filter that differentiates based on semantic relationships (meanings) in a lexicon (block 620 ).
- a semantic engine is the meaning-based differentiator described above.
- a meaning-based search engine determines the sub-space in the whole semantic space that encompasses the search term.
- the semantic sub-space is determined by first fixing a point in semantic space closest to or at the synset (meaning) that best suits the search term. After fixing this point in the entire semantic space, all elements of the semantic space within a certain radius of semantic distance will comprise the semantic “sub-space” governing the term that was searched (block 630 ). Once the semantic subspace has been determined, then ad banners positioned within the sub-space can be found (block 640 ). This assumes that prior to the search banner ads have been indexed into semantic space.
- the radius of semantic distance can be increased (block 647 ) or by other means, the semantic sub-space can be expanded upon until banner ads are found. Once banner ads are found within the original or expanded semantic sub-space these ads may be displayed (block 650 ). If there is more than one banner ad within the semantic sub-space and only one ad is to be displayed then the ad positioned closest in semantic distance (most closely associated) to the search term can be displayed. In an alternate embodiment, if no documents are found within the original semantic sub-space, it may be desirable to retrieve no ads. Also, where the semantic sub-space is expanded, it may be desirable to terminate the process of expanding the sub-space beyond a certain threshold since the likelihood of a relevant ad may decrease with such an expansion.
- the user may be able to select a given meaning from a set of possible meanings (block 660 ). If the user selects a particular meaning or word context, then the semantic sub-space is redefined (block 670 ) and new banner ads can be found (block 640 ). While FIG. 6 and other embodiments refer to advertisements or banner ads, these principles can be applied to retrieval of any documents, images, sounds or other data, and is provided as one example finding documents based on their semantic content or purpose.
- FIG. 7 illustrates advertisements indexed within a semantic space.
- the semantic space 700 of FIG. 7 includes six nodes or synsets A, B, C, D, E and F.
- the semantic space 700 is illustrated for convenience as a two dimensional space with connections between various nodes showing their inter-relationship.
- An actual semantic space may be thought of as having N-dimensions, given the complex possible associations between synsets, words, subjects and meanings. In general, the further away one location in the space from another, the less related or associated semantically are the nodes.
- semantic sub-spaces are also shown. These sub-spaces are triggered by an input of a term or meaning that equates to a synset. A user or mechanism inputting a term that is associated with the node D will generate a semantic sub-space 710 . With sub-space 710 thus defined, an ad, Advertisement 1 is found immediately. Semantic sub-space 710 is a “first” semantic sub-space which is an initial guess at a given semantic radius about the node D. In this case, an advertisement was discovered contained therein without any expansions of the space. Consequently, taking the example of a search engine portal website, a user visiting that website that enters a term equivalent to the node D would trigger retrieval of Advertisement 1.
- a first semantic sub-space 720 determined by an input term associated with node F, contains no advertisements to retrieve.
- the semantic radius about the node F may be increased until an ad is found.
- the semantic radius about node F was increased to give an expanded sub-space 730 .
- the semantic sub-space 730 contains Advertisement 2.
- a user entering in a search term associated with node F will retrieve Advertisement 2.
- input of related meanings may also retrieve the same Advertisement 2. For instance, an input term associated with node C would likely also retrieve Advertisement 2, since both node C and F are related or connected concepts.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart of keyword generation by semantic filtering.
- keywords and related words can be generated when starting from a particular term or set of terms that matches even roughly the desired theme. For instance, if trying to find keywords intended for a candy advertisement, then a starting input of “candy” might return a semantic sub-space containing with related and associated words such as “sweets,” “chocolate,” “licorice,” and “toffee”.
- keyword or related word generation based upon a semantic lexicon can be applied to other information applications such as word processing and artificial intelligence or the indexing of documents and data. The generation of keywords and related words based upon semantic principles is discussed below.
- an input term or phrase is fed to the semantic engine (block 810 ).
- the advertiser or portal can enter in the input term(s).
- the input may be fed automatically from another document or data source.
- the semantic engine determines a semantic sub-space encompassing the meaning of the input term (block 820 ).
- the keyword generation may be refined based upon the selection of a particular meaning of the input term(s) where the input terms have more than one possible meaning (checked at 815 ). If the meaning is refined (block 815 ) the refined term (meaning) is fed back to the semantic engine (block 810 ).
- a new semantic sub-space is determined (block 820 ). With the semantic sub-space determined, the keywords, related words and meanings that belong to the sub-space can all be retrieved (block 830 ). This list of related words and meanings can then be displayed to a user.
- FIG. 9 is a graph of meaning-based advertising pricing according to another embodiment of the invention.
- an advertising campaign may be sold on a variable rather than a fixed cost basis.
- the cost of the banner ad or other ad when retrieved can be based directly upon the semantic distance (i.e. degree of closeness in meaning/context) from a key term that was purchased to the input term(s). For instance, if the purchased synset by a candy website for its ad is “candy” and a search term “snack foods” is entered as input, this may still trigger retrieval of the candy website ad (due to a semantic proximity). However, since this user was probably not as interested in a candy website, the ad may not be reaching the as valuable a target user as one who may have entered “candy” as a search term.
- the relevance of the ad to the user can be determined based upon the input terms.
- the price of that particular page view can be modified based upon the semantic distance between location in semantic space of the purchased synset and the input term(s).
- One way to formulate this relation is to say that the semantic distance is inversely proportional to the price of the ad. The farther away in semantic space the input term is to the purchased synset, the less the ad will cost the advertiser. Conversely, the closer in semantic space the term is to the purchased synset, the more the ad will cost the advertiser. This relationship is demonstrated in the graph of FIG. 9 which plots semantic distance against the price of the ad to the advertiser. The graph of FIG.
- variable pricing is one of many possible formulations of variable pricing according to semantic relationship and is merely illustrative. Other factors may include the path through semantic space, the type of semantic relationship between the term and purchased synset and the presence of other ads within the same semantic sub-space.
Abstract
Description
-
- Meanings that signify geographical places are marked as “locations”. This allows special calculations to come into play in the search engine that are unique to these meanings.
- Meanings that are “offensive” are marked, indicating that the general public may find these meanings to be distasteful or vulgar in some way. This flag allows us to give users the option to filter search results that they may find offensive.
- Meanings that signify specific “instances” of things are marked. For example, “computer company” is a generic kind of concept, but “Microsoft” describes a unique entity. Knowing when “kind of” children of a meaning are “instances” allows the semantic distance calculations to more accurately estimate the precision of a parent meaning (this is described in more detail later).
- The “currentness” of meanings may be noted. Meanings marked as “current” are those that are in some way timely; values surrounding them are more likely to vary over time than other concepts. For example, the word “Monica” might currently imply the meaning “Monica Lewinsky” to a greater degree today than it might will a year from now. By marking meanings that are uniquely likely to change within the near future, the Lexicon may be more easily kept up to date.
- Meanings may be marked as “pseudosynsets”. This term describes meanings that are either not in common usage because they are highly specific or technical, or that exist within the Lexicon purely for the purpose of forming a parent category for a group of child meanings. An example of the former might be the Latin terms that describe phylum, class, or species within the biological taxonomy. An example of the latter would be the concept of “field sports”, which exists mainly for the purpose of grouping similar specific sports together cleanly in the Lexicon, rather than because it in itself is actually an oft used meaning in common usage. By marking “pseudosynsets”, more accurate values for semantic distance may be calculated (this is described in more detail later).
Block 115
- 1. A “scaling factor”, somewhat like a “velocity” is tracked as the search spreads outward. This scaling factor multiplies the perceived distance for a single jump. One net effect of this factor is to reduce the perceived distance to meanings that are close, thus the drop-off of distance is not linear as the search expands. This is a result of an increase in scaling factor based linearly on the previous jump distance.
- 2. The scaling factor is also modified by a change in direction of the search within the lexicon hierarchy. For example, a jump down to a child from a parent that was previously jumped up to from another child, incurs a scale factor increase penalty. Similar penalties arise from jumps down then up, from jumps in “kind of” that occur after “part of” (and vice versa), and from combinations of these.
- 3. Lateral “bond” type connections also incur scale factor penalties, based on the set distance of the jump.
- 4. “Psuedosynset” and “instance” meanings are treated in a special way. When used as the origin, they imply that the search for related meanings should be within a smaller radius, as their own greater degree of exactness imply a more specific kind of search for meanings is called for. Thus the search does not expand as far; this is controlled by starting the search with a higher scaling factor. Additionally, a different measurement of precision is used, which includes detailed terms that are otherwise excluded from the standard precision algorithm initially. (Alternately, if the origin meaning is not a pseudo-synset or instance meaning, then the standard precision values excluding count of descendant pseudosynsets are used.)
Block 130
-
- Find out what nodes are hit by more than one meaning, because they are likely to yield very good scores due to the combination hit factor. Many of these nodes will not have shown up in the individual meanings' “top scoring nodes” lists, and therefore would have been missed had we not looked specifically for combinations.
- Filter out only nodes that show up on required meanings, because a logical AND between terms is being performed.
