Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to consumer electronics and telecommunication systems, and in particular, to a system and method for using location information associated with wireless devices.
- wireless devices The use of wireless devices is increasing at a rapid rate. A majority of the people living in large metropolitan areas use one or more wireless devices on a daily basis. These people communicate with each other or access information on the Internet using, among other devices, wireless telephones, interactive pagers, personal digital assistants, and handheld computers. As technology continues to improve, wireless devices will become more useful: at the same time, they will decrease in size and weight, making them more portable than ever. Consequently, consumers may carry their wireless devices wherever they go. For some people, their wireless device will become indispensable.
- the first phase started on Apr. 1, 1998, required wireless service providers to transmit a 911 caller's number and section of the cell site from which the call is originated to a public safety answering point (PSAP).
- PSAP public safety answering point
- wireless communication-networks and wireless telephones must provide both the identity and location of the caller to a 911 dispatcher.
- the wireless device will furnish a device identification, e.g., a mobile identification number (MIN), indicating in most instances the telephone number of the device.
- MIN mobile identification number
- the wireless communication networks and wireless devices will use a network-based location system or a handheld location system installed within the wireless devices, or a combination of the two systems.
- An example of a handheld location system is a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- wireless communications services are also expensive. For example, payment to wireless service providers for the use of wireless telephones is usually based on the amount of “airtime” consumed. The longer a user is on the telephone, the more expensive the conversation will be. Charges for use of the wireless telephone call could be significantly higher when the user is beyond his or her home market, at a location where the wireless telephone roams in a different market served by a different wireless service provider.
- the user must remember to turn off the telephone when he or she leaves the home market. Alternatively, the user must remember not to answer an incoming call when the telephone rings while it is roaming.
- the existing wireless communications technology does not allow the wireless device users (the subscribers) to activate one of more service features based on the user's physical location, i.e., without the user's manual activation of the features.
- a wireless telephone user must manually activate a call forwarding feature subscribed to by him or her if the user wants to have all calls forwarded to his or her voice mailbox each time the user enters a public place such as a movie theater, a concert hall, or a courtroom. Once the user leaves the public place, the user must remember to deactivate the call forwarding feature.
- the user must also activate a call forwarding feature to route all incoming calls intended for the wireless telephone to a home wireline telephone when the user is at home where the wireline telephone is located.
- the user if the user wishes to accept calls intended for the wireless telephone using a wireline telephone at work, the user must manually activate the call forwarding feature to route calls to his or her office when the user is at work.
- an action such as routing telephone calls, based on location information pinpointing the location of a wireless device.
- the present invention is a system and method for using location information associated with wireless devices.
- the location information may be used to execute an action.
- the action may be executed via a number of networks, including a wireless communications network (some examples includes Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO), Ultra-Wideband UWB, third-generation (3G) wireless networks, fourth-generation (4G) wireless networks, all of the IEEE 802.XX wireless networks, etc.), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a local area network (LAN), and a global computer network.

Although these general steps and sub-steps are discussed herein sequentially, the steps may be implemented in any combination and in any logical order to accomplish a specific purpose. Furthermore, specific embodiments of the present invention may include additional steps not discussed herein.
- a subscriber to the service of the present invention e.g., the user of wireless device 110 can define a set of subscriber rules, instructions, or preferences.
- the subscriber rules relate or associate location information with the execution of an action. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2 , assuming wireless device 110 is a wireless telephone, specific examples of the subscriber rules may include:
- feature server 102 routes all calls intended for the wireless telephone to wireline telephone 107 .
- feature server 102 routes all calls intended for the wireless telephone to wireline telephone 117 .
- the subscriber rules can be stored in memory 104 .
- the subscriber rules may be stored using a number of channels, including via an input device on wireless device 110 , other components of wireless communications network 100 , global computer network 140 , and PSTN 150 that are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- the subscriber rules may be stored in memory 104 using any known format.
- the subscriber rules can be contained in a database that relates a specific location with a specific action to be executed when wireless device 110 is in the specific location.
- Feature server 102 can operate under a default rule in step 206 , e.g., allowing wireless device 110 to accept all calls, unless wireless device 110 is at origin 105 or destination 115 .
- feature server 102 can monitor location information to determine whether wireless device 110 has changed locations.
- the location information may be generated by either handheld location system 112 or network-based location system 106 , or by a combination of both location systems.
- the location systems can generate the location information as specified in the subscriber rules. For example, the location information may be generated at regular intervals. Furthermore, the location systems may generate the location information at designated or scheduled times specified by the subscriber rules.
- handheld location system 112 is a GPS receiver that can generate the location information using information received from a constellation of GPS satellites.
- Network-based location system 106 can generate the location system using triangulation across cell sites based on signal strength experienced by wireless device 110 .
- the location information may be generated using designation of cell sites. For example, if origin 105 and destination 115 are within wireless coverage of two distinct and separate cell sites of a wireless communications network in which wireless device 110 operates, the location information pinpointing the location of wireless device 110 may be determined based on which cell site is exchanging wireless signals with wireless device 110 .
- wireless device 110 is initially located in origin 105 , i.e., within the area delineated by nodes 161 , 162 , 163 , and 164 .
- the location system can generate initial location information and provide feature server 102 with the initial location information.
- Feature server 102 can store the initial location information in memory 104 , and route all calls intended for wireless device 110 to wireline telephone 107 .
- wireless device 110 is then moved from origin 105 to destination 115 , crossing a first boundary defined by nodes 162 and 163 and a second boundary defined by nodes 165 and 168 .
- One or both location systems 106 and 112 can generate a first subsequent location information after wireless device 110 crosses the first boundary.
- the first subsequent location information can then be provided to feature server 102 .
- feature server 102 can detect a change of location because the first subsequent location information is different from the initial location information.
- the materiality depends on whether wireless device 110 has been moved to a different location in which a different action should be executed by feature server 102 .
- a change is considered not material unless wireless device 110 crosses the first or the second boundaries.
- the change is considered material.
- the subscriber can be notified that a material or actionable change of location has been detected, and the subscriber can be given an opportunity to override the subscriber rules.
- a notification provided to the subscriber may be executed using any known method. For example, a vibration on, or a ringing tone from, wireless device 110 could be used to alert the subscriber that, unless the subscriber otherwise overrides, a new service feature will be activated. The subscriber may then see or hear a message, e.g., “You have left origin 105 , unless you press the Cancel key, all incoming calls will be accepted.”
- step 216 the subscriber chooses to override, she can press a key that is responsive to the notification, e.g., the “Cancel” key, on wireless device 110 .
- the process then goes to step 218 , in which the existing service feature will continue to operate, i.e., feature server 102 will continue to forward all calls intended for wireless device 110 to wireline telephone 107 . Otherwise, the process goes to step 220 , and a new service feature is activated according to the subscriber rules, i.e., stop forwarding calls to wireline telephone 107 , and begin accepting calls using wireless device 110 .
- step 208 If in step 208 a second subsequent location information is generated before wireless device 110 crosses the second boundary, then in step 210 , when feature server 102 compares the second subsequent location information with the first subsequent location information, feature server 102 detects a change of location. In step 212 , this new change of location is considered not material because wireless device 110 did not cross either the first or the second boundaries. In this case, the process returns to step 208 .
- step 208 a comparison of the second and the third subsequent location information by feature server 102 in step 210 then indicates that another change of location has been detected.
- feature server 102 may determine that the change is material.
- step 214 a notification, e.g., “You have entered destination 115 , unless you press the Cancel key, all incoming calls will be forwarded to wireline telephone 117 .” The subscriber may then decide in step 216 whether to override the subscriber rules.
- feature server 102 may be programmed to define the subscriber rules based on the subscriber's habits for using wireless device 110 . For example, if all location information generated by the location system and all actions executed by the subscriber are stored in memory 104 by feature server 102 , after a definite period of time, sufficient data would be collected to establish what the subscriber's habits were for using wireless telephone 110 . The subscriber may then decide whether to adopt the habits as the subscriber rules.

- Another delineation method may comprise the use of one center node and a radius.
- Each node can comprise point coordinates.
- the point coordinates comprise an X component and a Y component of a coordinate system.
- the point coordinates can further comprise a Z component of the coordinate system.
- One coordinate system that is suitable for the present invention has longitude, latitude, and altitude as its X, Y, and Z components, respectively.
- home 302 could be delineated as a circular area with a 125-meter radius with a center node.

- step 328 feature server 102 can be adapted to review the location information and determines whether the location information fits within the parameters of the subscriber rules. If the determination is in the affirmative, the process goes to step 330 . Otherwise, the process returns to step 326 .
- step 328 when the location information indicates that wireless device 110 is at home 302 , an incoming call intended for wireless device 110 is forwarded to the home wireline telephone in step 330 .
- feature server 102 in step 330 , stops forwarding all calls intended for wireless device 110 to the home wireline telephone.
- feature server 102 can operate under the default rule, i.e., it can allow wireless device 110 to accept all calls. Therefore, while the subscriber is in automobile 304 from home 302 to building 306 , he receives calls intended for wireless device 110 using wireless device 110 itself.
- Wireless device 110 can continue to receive calls even as the subscriber enters the parameter of building 306 , i.e., the X and Y components of the location information are within the delineated boundaries of building 306 .
- the call forwarding feature to his office wireline telephone is not activated until he reaches the seventh floor, i.e., when the Z component of the location information matches the value specified in the subscriber rules. If the subscriber goes to a different floor of building 306 , e.g., the sixth floor or the tenth floor, wireless device 110 can return to use the default rule, i.e., it can receive all calls.
- feature server 102 When the location information indicates that the subscriber has entered courthouse 308 , feature server 102 immediately activates the voicemail feature of the subscriber rules. Once the feature is activated, all incoming calls are automatically forwarded to the subscriber's voice mailbox. In other words, wireless device 110 does not ring as long as it remains within the delineated boundaries of courthouse 308 . If a voicemail was left in the voice mailbox while the subscriber was in courthouse 308 , then as soon as he leaves courthouse 308 , he is alerted to the voicemail message by feature server 102 through a ringing tone (or a vibration signal) from wireless device 110 .
- a ringing tone or a vibration signal
- the subscriber is asked to select one option from the choices of “Answer,” “Hold,” “Reject,” “Voice Mail,” and “Forward to Office.” If the subscriber decides to accept the call but at a few seconds later, he can simple choose “Hold,” and the caller will hear a recorded voice of the subscriber, e.g., “I'm in the theater, please wait for a few more seconds as I find my way to a place where I can talk.” The subscriber then excuses himself, finds a convenient place to talk, and presses another key on wireless device 110 so that he could start talking with the caller. Alternatively, if the subscriber does not want to take the call, he could choose one of the remaining options. As soon as the subscriber leaves theater 310 , the default rule is in operation again unless the subscriber in a location that is defined by the subscriber rules.
- FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram illustrating a specific example of using a second specific embodiment of the present invention by a subscriber whose traveling covers areas served by more than one wireless communication network.
- the subscriber lives and works in home city 402 where she is a customer of a wireless service provider. She travels occasionally to foreign city 406 for vacation. She visits domestic city 410 regularly to conduct business.
- the wireless service provider has roaming agreements with other wireless service providers in domestic city 410 and foreign city 406 .
- the subscriber may use her wireless device 110 in home city 402 , domestic city 410 , and foreign city 406 .
- Airplanes 404 and 408 and train 412 are vehicles that transport the subscriber from a city to another city.
- wireless device 110 may be a wireless telephone.
- the location system can be a handheld unit such as handheld location system 112 shown in FIG. 2 .
- feature server 102 and memory 104 can be part of wireless device 110 as shown in FIG. 2 .
- the system architecture shown in FIG. 1 may also be used.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in using the second specific embodiment shown in FIG. 6 .
- the location system can generate location information pinpointing the location of wireless device 110 whenever wireless device 110 is used.
- the location information and the habits of the subscriber for using wireless device 110 can be stored, for example, in memory 104 that is in communication with feature server 102 .
- feature server 102 can record in memory 104 frequently dialed telephone numbers and relates those frequently dialed numbers with the location information and the time at which the calls were made.
- step 424 after feature server 102 has built up substantial experience with the subscriber's movements and habits, e.g., two months, the subscriber's habits for using wireless device 110 can be reduced to a finite number of repeated circumstances.
- feature server 102 can convert the habits into subscriber rules.
- the subscriber rules may contain the following call routing instructions and user preferences:
- wireless device 110 When wireless device 110 is in domestic city 410 where he uses wireless device 110 to accept calls from a selected list of callers, only incoming calls from those callers are acceptable. All other incoming calls are forwarded to his voice mailbox.
- wireless device 110 When wireless device 110 is in an airport, notify the subscriber that he is in the airport, and wireless device 110 will be turned off in thirty minutes unless he overrides it or specify a time at which to turn off wireless device 110 .
- the subscriber rules can be presented to the subscriber for her approval.
- the subscriber rules may be displayed on the mini-browser on wireless device 110 or they may be played as voice recording. If the subscriber does not approve the subscriber rules, the process returns to step 422 . If the subscriber rules are modified or otherwise approved by the subscriber, the process goes to step 430 .
- Steps 430 through 434 of FIG. 7 may be described as follows.
- location system 112 can generate the location information at regular intervals, e.g., every five minutes.
- feature server 102 can recognize the location information as a triggering event, i.e., wireless device 110 is in an airport that is identified in the subscriber rules.
- feature server 102 can review the subscriber rules, and determine that the appropriate action is to alert the subscriber that she is in the airport.
- feature server 102 can ring wireless device 110 , and display the message: “You are now at the airport.
- This telephone will be powered off in thirty minutes unless you enter a number greater than 30.”
- the departure time is 60 minutes away from the time the message is displayed, and the subscriber wants to wait for an incoming call, the subscriber may use the keypad to enter “60,” delaying the auto power off feature from 30 minutes to 60 minutes.
- feature server 102 can power off wireless device 110 . This feature prevents the subscriber from forgetting to power off her wireless device 110 when she enters airplane 404 .
- Steps 430 through 434 are then repeated as the subscriber continues her journey.
- location system 112 can generate new location information in step 430 .
- feature server 102 receives the new location information, it knows, based on the subscriber rules, that wireless device 110 is in a city where the subscriber does not accept incoming calls. Therefore, although the subscriber may use wireless device 110 to make outgoing calls, all incoming calls will be forwarded to her voice mailbox, thereby saving her roaming fees for answering the incoming calls. If a call is made by a caller to wireless device 110 , feature server 102 , in step 434 , can play the announcement to the caller “I'm out of town, please leave a message.”
- feature server 102 can review location information generated by location system 112 in step 430 , and accepts incoming calls from designated callers in accordance with the subscriber rules in step 434 .
- location system 112 can continue to generate location information, and feature server 102 can continue to review the location information.
- feature server 102 can make a call to a taxi service. This feature is done even if the subscriber is sleeping. The taxi service would hear a voice recording, “This is Ms. Smith. I am 20 minutes away from the train station. Please come to pick me up.”
- a software component may be able to use location information about individual taxis and select a taxi company based on which company's taxis are closest to the train station. Taxi locations may be provided using location information provided by wireless phones in the taxis, or using some other source of location information, such as any wireless transmitter attached to the vehicle. Based on a particular taxi or set of taxis being closest to the subscriber's eventual location, a software component may make the phone call to the taxi company having the closest taxis. Moreover, such a method of selecting a taxi company need not be limited to a subscriber's impending arrival at a train station.
- Similar technology may be used when the subscriber is traveling along a highway in a car and is looking for a taxi service at her point of egress from the vehicle in which she is currently traveling. If the subscriber provides to a software component an expected time of arrival at her destination (e.g., about one hour), then the software component may determine a likely point of egress using the subscribers position and speed (and optionally knowledge of roads and highways) and then determine which taxis and taxi companies are closest to the point of egress. Furthermore, in having a software component request a taxi on her behalf, the subscriber may enter additional parameters (or previously have set preferences) further limiting a choice of taxi company. For example, the subscriber may have previously specified a particular taxi company or multiple companies with which she would prefer to work. Additionally, the subscriber may also specify that the driver speak a particular language. Such a preference may be used to request a specific taxi at a specific taxi company, or it may simply be communicated to the selected taxi company as a preference.
- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram illustrating a specific example of using a third specific embodiment of the present invention to track the delivery of a piano from factory 502 to church 512 in city 510 .
- the piano will be shipped using vessel 504 , stored in warehouse 506 , and delivered by truck 508 .

- wireless device 110 can be attached to the piano and activated.
- location system 112 can generate location information in step 526 .
- the location information may be generated continuously or at regular intervals, and the location information can be provided to feature server 102 . In other embodiments, the location information may be generated at specific times as programmed in the subscriber rules.
- feature server 102 can review the location information. If in step 530 feature server 102 receives location information that is defined in the subscriber rule, e.g., the piano is now somewhere in the Pacific Ocean on vessel 504 , feature server 102 can execute an action in step 532 . In these instances, the appropriate action is to review the location information and the speed at which the vessel is traveling, and estimated an arrival time. The appropriate action may further include sending a message to the headquarters of the subscriber informing the subscriber of the status of the status of the delivery. Steps 528 through 532 are repeated as the piano makes its way to the piano purchaser.
- feature server 102 can execute another action. This time it may notify the subscriber that the piano has arrived in warehouse 506 , and the subscriber can dispatch a truck to pick up the piano.
- location system 112 can continue to generate location information and feature server 102 can continue to monitor the location of the piano and estimate the time of arrival.
- feature server 102 can send a message to the piano purchaser. The message may be a voice recording stating: “The piano you ordered has entered the city limits. It should be arriving at the church momentarily.”
- wireless device 110 can be removed. A log of the delivery can then printed at the headquarters. The log may then be given to the piano manufacturer for its files.
- FIG. 10 is a schematic diagram illustrating a specific example of using a fourth specific embodiment of the present invention by a fourth subscriber to activate a machine such as an office equipment and a home appliance controlled by one or more computer networks.

- FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in using the fourth specific embodiment shown in FIG. 10 .
- the subscriber can define subscriber rules through an input device on handheld computer 610 in step 622 .
- the subscriber rules may include a provision that activates the location system in step 624 to generate location information pinpointing the location of handheld computer 610 at specific times.
- feature server 102 can be programmed with subscriber rules such that location system 106 can generate location information at 8:55 a.m. and 5:55 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays.
- Location system 106 can be otherwise inactive.
- the subscriber rules in this specific example may include the following:
- location system 106 can generate the first location information in step 624 .
- feature server 102 can review the location information. If in step 628 it is determined that handheld computer 610 is still more than ten minutes away from office 615 , feature server 102 , in step 630 , can make a call to a wireline telephone in office 615 through telephone network 650 to let someone know that the subscriber is more than ten minutes away from office 615 . Otherwise, if in step 628 it was determined that the subscriber is fewer than ten minutes away from office 615 , then feature server 102 in step 632 sends a message to computer network 640 to turn on equipment 617 .
- location system 106 can generate a second location information in step 624 .
- feature server 102 can review the location information. If in step 628 it is determined that the subscriber is not within 30 minutes from home 605 , feature server 102 can make a call, in step 630 , through telephone network 650 to a wireline telephone at home 605 that the subscriber is more than 30 minutes away from home 605 . Otherwise, feature server 102 can activate appliance 607 in step 632 via computer network 640 .
- FIG. 12 is a geographic representation of an example of requesting a service such as a plumber using location information.
- User 1201 is a homeowner who requires the services of a plumber to fix a problem.
- Plumbers 1202 , 1203 , and 1204 are all prospective plumbers who may fit the bill for user 1201 .
- a software component may receive from user 1201 a request for a provider of plumbing services, the component located on a wireless device located at the home of user 1201 or on a remote server (not shown).
- the software component may be co-located with a feature server.
- User 1201 may access the software component through a number of technologies, including a web browser on a computer, an interface on a wireless device (e.g., cellular telephone, personal digital assistant, computer with wireless network connection, etc.), an interactive voice response system, through an intermediary such as a telephone operator, and other methods of access.
- location information is provided to the software component, as described above.
- the software component can select a service provider (i.e. a plumber) who is geographically available to user 1201 . This selection may include using location information associated with plumbers 1202 , 1203 , and 1204 by way of wireless devices associated with each. Location information may further be manually be provided by a dispatcher or other person having knowledge of plumber locations.
- plumber 1203 may be the selection of the software component.
- the software component may have knowledge of roads and highways, and be able convert the locations of plumbers 1202 , 1203 , and 1204 into road locations. In this situation, plumber 1202 may be selected, as this plumber is closer via known roads.
- the software component may be able to receive subsequent locations from plumbers 1202 , 1203 , and 1204 , which may be used to estimate a speed and direction for each plumber. Having this information, the software component may determine that plumbers 1202 and 1203 are stationary, but plumber 1204 is moving towards user 1201 . Knowing this, the software component may select plumber 1204 since the plumber may get to user 1201 the fastest.
- one or more additional service-specific parameters may be provided that further limit selectable service providers. These parameters may be provided by the user at the time he or she makes the request, or they may have been previously specified by the user or software component and stored for all such requests. These service-specific parameters may include any of the following:
- the software component may utilize service-specific parameters such as these to make a selection.
- the parameters associated with the request may be prioritized or weighted for importance to the user.
- the software component may select a plumber based on meeting the one or more parameters specified in conjunction with evaluating the locations of each plumber relative to user 1201 .
- the method of selection described above may also be utilized when a user requires other types of services.
- other types of home repair services may be requested.
- livery services such as a taxi company may be requested using similar wireless technology and service-specific parameters. Additional parameters that may be available when requesting livery services include time to destination and type of vehicle (e.g., limousine or mini-van).
- plumber 1204 may be sent a text message via an associated wireless device and/or plumber 1204 may receive a voice call stating something like, “User needs your services within the next 45 minutes. User resides at 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
- the software component may provider user 1201 a status via the same interface used to make an initial request.
- a software component may further provide a facility for ongoing negotiations with one or more service providers once an action has been executed.
- a facility may minimally include an online chat room, conference call, or email facility for sharing offers and counteroffers. Once a negotiated service agreement is established, the negotiation facility may store the agreement for future reference.
- FIG. 13 is a geographic representation of an example of requesting a service such as a pharmacy using location information. Similar to the example of FIG. 12 , here, location information is utilized by a software component to aid in the selection of a service provider.
- the service is a pharmacy. If user 1301 requests pharmacy services, the software component may select one of pharmacies 1302 , 1303 , and 1304 based on location and other service-specific parameters.
- user 1201 and user 1301 are moving in a vehicle.
- the software component may estimate a speed and direction of the user. Used in conjunction with knowledge of roads and highways, the software component may be able to predict where the user will be at a particular time. Used in conjunction with service-specific parameters, the software component may modify its selection of a pharmacy using this dynamic location information.
- Service-specific parameters which may be associated with a request for pharmacy services include, but are not limited to, many of the parameters listed above and:
- the software component can select a pharmacy.
- user 1301 is moving in the direction of three pharmacies 1302 , 1303 , and 1304 .
- the software component may determine an estimated time of arrival at each pharmacy.
- pharmacy requests may be sent to each of pharmacies 1302 , 1303 , and 1304 .
- the pharmacy requests may ask for specific product availability and a time to fill the prescription.
- Other parameters such as price, payment method, etc. may be included in the pharmacy request, or may already be known to the software component.
- Pharmacy 1302 may not have the requested product, leaving pharmacies 1303 and 1304 . Both may have the product, but pharmacy 1304 may take 30 minutes longer to fill the prescription.
- Pharmacy 1303 may be the best or only choice based on location and the service-specific parameters requested by the user.
- the software component can select pharmacy 1303 , and execute an action, such as placing an order to be filled on behalf of the user.
- the software component may connect the user directly with the pharmacy so that user 1301 can place the order manually, and possibly ask additional questions.
- Such a service selection may also be utilized in the context of other services. For example, a user may need a particular medical service, and the software component can select and make an appointment for the user.
- Service-specific parameters in this setting may include many of the above-identified parameters, as well as medical specialty, appointment availability, and whether the provider takes the user's insurance.
- FIG. 14 is a depiction of an interface example through which a user may provide service-specific parameters.
- wireless device 1401 is able to access an interface 1402 for requesting services from a software component.
- Wireless device 1401 can both provide access to the software component and location information corresponding to a request for services.
- an access interface and wireless location provider need not be contained within the same device.
- a cell phone may provide location information and a web page on a separate computer may provide access to the software component.
- Interface 1402 includes an entry area for the type of service being requested by the user. Here, a user is searching for a restaurant and has selected that type of service. Service-specific parameters then appear which may further narrow the focus of the selection. Interface 1402 includes service-specific parameters such as:
- the location information provided by wireless device 1401 is used in conjunction with the supplied parameters when selecting a restaurant. If a user chooses the “Where I'm Going” option, the software component may estimate a speed and direction of the user based on multiple locations received over time, and then utilize the desired time of seating to predict where the user will be at the appointed time. If the software component is not sure where the user is going (e.g., locations are changing too much over time to predict future location), the software component may request additional information from the user (e.g., desired neighborhood or zip code).
- FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating steps involved in using location information to execute an action in response to a request. Steps displayed are merely representative. Steps may be added, removed, rearranged, and so forth.
- a request for a provider of a service is received, accompanied by one or more service-specific parameters at step 1502 , and location information at step 1503 . If the location is changing at decision 1510 , then at step 1504 , additional locations may be received in order to predict future locations based on the changes in location at step 1505 .
- one or more providers of a service are selected using the location information in conjunction with other service-specific parameters.
- step 1508 communication with a selected service provider is initiated, or at step 1509 a reply is sent to the user with identifying information about selected provider(s).
- a user may not even know which service to request. For example, when confronting a home repair, a user may not know which type of repair person to request. As another example, a user may not know what type of medical specialty to request when confronted with an illness. In these situations, an interface may prompt the user for additional information in order to aid the user in selecting a service to request.
- Such service selection tools may be implemented for any family of services.
