Location-specific information can also be expressed using token.It is, for example, possible to use token expresses location information, it is all
Such as, either country or the user for equipment 12 are used for determining the other information in the direction of oneself for " three buildings parking lots ", city.
In a kind of such method, token establishes the rough position for positioning and being trimmed off via RSSI RTT positions.
As described above, wireless access point can conceal the position where it, so as to break away from equipment to the position of their own
It calculates.This would generally prevent any useful application.In order to prevent this situation, introduce new concept " accredited position supplier ".
Here thinking is that the location information issued by access point can be signed by accredited position supplier, typically generate (latitude,
Longitude, token) triple entity, and the signature can be verified by equipment 12.If equipment 12 trusts position supplier,
No matter then why, which may be used to the location information of the accredited position supplier from its selection.
In a kind of exemplary method, location-based service 18, which provides, has (latitude, longitude, token) triple and (latitude, warp
Degree, token, BSSID) tuple (as shown in Figure 5 B) signature.In a kind of such method, signature is public key certificate, but
Other authentication techniques can be used.
Accredited position supplier can be provided in equipment in equipment only by by public certificate.It can make
It is strictly generated by specific position supplier come positional information with the key available for the certificate, and is not damaged also
It is bad.In order to prevent such as the further position attack personation, position triple can be extended to including other information, it is all
Such as, the time of the BSSID of wireless access point 14 and inquiry.In order to make information more reliable, in a kind of exemplary method, regular (example
Such as, weekly or once a day flush bit information).In some such methods, equipment 12, which further includes, to be only selected that
