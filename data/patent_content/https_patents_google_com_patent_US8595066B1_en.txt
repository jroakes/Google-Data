Definitions
- the present invention concerns arbitrating and/or advertising.
- the present invention concerns on-line advertising where advertisers compete for one or more desired ad rendering attributes (e.g., position, size, volume, time period, ad type, etc.).
- the ad system charges each advertiser based on its next lower competitor's maximum offer.
- the “top” advertiser in Position 1 may be charged an amount per user click equal to, or otherwise determined using, the maximum offer proffered by the next ranked advertiser in Position 2 .
- an advertiser in Position i may be charged an amount based on the maximum offer of the advertiser in Position i+1, and the last advertiser in Position N may be charged based on a reserve price.
- the AdWords and AdSense advertising services from Google or Mountain View, Calif.
- a dominant bidding strategy provides a participant in an arbitration (such as an auction) a way to maximize their benefit from the arbitration without regard to the behavior of the other participants.
- Existing arbitration models such as those introduced above, have a dominant bidding strategy when there is only one advertising position up for arbitration. However, in the common case where multiple advertising positions are up for arbitration, no dominant bidding strategy exists.
- a manifestation of this deficiency is that the marginal cost paid per click may exceed, sometimes by a great degree, the maximum offer set by the advertiser for the price per click. This is because these models ensure only that the average price per click is less than the maximum offer price.
- the following example illustrates how marginal costs per click may greatly exceed a maximum cost per click offer under one arbitration model.
- positions of ad spots have monotonically decreasing selection rates of 1.00% for ad spot position 1, 0.70% for ad spot position 2, 0.65% for ad spot position 3, and 0.30% for ad spot position 4.
- advertiser A offers a maximum of $0.90 per selection
- advertiser B offers a maximum of $0.80 per selection
- advertiser C offers a maximum of $0.40 per selection
- advertiser D offers a maximum of $0.35 per selection.
- the present invention provides new methods and apparatus for discounting maximum offers in an online advertising space (and/or some enhanced ad rendering attribute) arbitration such that there exists a dominant bidding strategy, whereby advertisers can choose optimal maximum offers without knowing anything about their competitors' behavior, and without knowing anything about the relative selection rates for different ad spot positions (or the relative values of different enhanced ad rendering attributes that advertisers may compete for).
- the dominant bidding strategy for an advertiser is to set its maximum offer at its marginal value per selection (that is; its gross profit per selection). This optimal maximum offer depends only on parameters of the advertiser's business, and does not fluctuate with maximum offers of competitors or selection rates of various ad spot positions.
- the present invention also provides new methods and apparatus for running arbitrations combining offers for use in arbitrations with a first price discounting method, such as those described in the '542 and '543 applications for example, with offers for use in arbitrations with a second price discounting technique consistent with the present invention.

- the present invention may also involve novel methods, apparatus, message formats, and/or data structures allowing offers made assuming different cost discounting techniques, to be considered together, in a common arbitration.
- Online ads may have various intrinsic features. Such features may be specified by an application and/or an advertiser. These features are referred to as “ad features” below.
- ad features may include a title line, ad text, and an embedded link.
- ad features may include images, executable code, and an embedded link.
- ad features may include one or more of the following: text, a link, an audio file, a video file, an image file, executable code, embedded information, etc.
- Serving parameters may include, for example, one or more of the following: features of (including information on) a document on which, or with which, the ad was served, a search query or search results associated with the serving of the ad, a user characteristic (e.g., their geographic location, the language used by the user, the type of browser used, previous page views, previous behavior, user account, any Web cookies used by the system, etc.), a host or affiliate site (e.g., America Online, Google, Yahoo) that initiated the request, an absolute position of the ad on the page on which it was served, a position (spatial or temporal) of the ad relative to other ads served, an absolute size of the ad, a size of the ad relative to other ads, a color of the ad, a number of other ads served, types of
- serving parameters may be extrinsic to ad features, they may be associated with an ad as serving conditions or constraints. When used as serving conditions or constraints, such serving parameters are referred to simply as “serving constraints” (or “targeting criteria”). For example, in some systems, an advertiser may be able to target the serving of its ad by specifying that it is only to be served on weekdays, no lower than a certain position, only to users in a certain location, etc. As another example, in some systems, an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only if a page or search query includes certain keywords or phrases. As yet another example, in some systems, an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only if a document being served includes certain topics or concepts, or falls under a particular cluster or clusters, or some other classification or classifications.
- Ad information may include any combination of ad features, ad serving constraints, information derivable from ad features or ad serving constraints (referred to as “ad derived information”), and/or information related to the ad (referred to as “ad related information”), as well as an extension of such information (e.g., information derived from ad related information).
- the ratio of the number of selections (e.g., clickthroughs) of an ad to the number of impressions of the ad (i.e., the number of times an ad is rendered) is defined as the “selection rate” (or “clickthrough rate”) of the ad.
- the selection rate of an ad rendered in an ad spot may be composed of two components: a creative-specific selection rate (CSR), and a position-specific selection rate (PSR).
- the CSR and/or the PSR may have been normalized to remove the influence of external factors that may affect selection rate.
- Each ad creative has its own CSR and each ad slot position has its own PSR.
- An estimated selection rate for a given ad creative in a particular ad slot position may be defined as the product of the ad creative's CSR and the ad slot position's PSR.
- a “conversion” is said to occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served ad. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, it may be the case that a conversion occurs when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's Web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that Web page. Alternatively, a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an ad, and making a purchase on the advertiser's Web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days).
- a conversion may be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc.
- user actions don't indicate a consummated purchase, they may indicate a sales lead, although user actions constituting a conversion are not limited to this. Indeed, many other definitions of what constitutes a conversion are possible.
- the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of impressions or selections of the ad is referred to as the “conversion rate.” If a conversion is defined to be able to occur within a predetermined time since the serving of an ad, one possible definition of the conversion rate might only consider ads that have been served more than the predetermined time in the past.
- a “document” is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may be a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, etc.
- the files may be of any type, such as text, audio, image, video, etc.
- Parts of a document to be rendered to an end user can be thought of as “content” of the document.
- a document may include “structured data” containing both content (words, pictures, etc.) and some indication of the meaning of that content (for example, e-mail fields and associated data, HTML tags and associated data, etc.)
- Ad spots in the document may be defined by embedded information or instructions.
- a common document is a Web page.
- Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript, etc.).
- a document has a unique, addressable, storage location and can therefore be uniquely identified by this addressable location.
- a universal resource locator is a unique address used to access information on the Internet.
- Document information may include any information included in the document, information derivable from information included in the document (referred to as “document derived information”), and/or information related to the document (referred to as “document related information”), as well as an extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information).
- document derived information is a classification based on textual content of a document.
- document related information include document information from other documents with links to the instant document, as well as document information from other documents to which the instant document links.
- Content from a document may be rendered on a “content rendering application or device”.
- content rendering applications include an Internet browser (e.g., Explorer or Netscape), a media player (e.g., an MP3 player, a Realnetworks streaming audio or video file player, etc.), a viewer (e.g., an Abobe Acrobat pdf reader), etc.
- a “content owner” is a person or entity that has some property right in the content of a document.
- a content owner may be an author of the content.
- a content owner may have rights to reproduce the content, rights to prepare derivative works of the content, rights to display or perform the content publicly, and/or other proscribed rights in the content.
- a content server might be a content owner in the content of the documents it serves, this is not necessary.
- User information may include user behavior information and/or user profile information.
- E-mail information may include any information included in an e-mail (also referred to as “internal e-mail information”), information derivable from information included in the e-mail and/or information related to the e-mail, as well as extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information).
- An example of information derived from e-mail information is information extracted or otherwise derived from search results returned in response to a search query composed of terms extracted from an e-mail subject line.
- Examples of information related to e-mail information include e-mail information about one or more other e-mails sent by the same sender of a given e-mail, or user information about an e-mail recipient.
- Information derived from or related to e-mail information may be referred to as “external e-mail information.”
- Ad area may be used to describe an area (e.g., spatial and/or temporal) of a document reserved or made available to accommodate the rendering of ads. For example, Web pages often allocate a number of spots where ads can be rendered, referred to as “ad spots”. As another example, an audio program may allocate “ad time slots”.
- an “offer” is something presented for acceptance.
- an offer will often be a monetary amount, associated with an advertisement, to be paid, upon the occurrence of an act with respect to the advertisement (e.g., impression, selection, conversion, etc.)
- An offer may be a bid.
- an offer may specify a maximum and/or a minimum amount to be paid.
- An offer may be non-monetary.
- An “arbitration” is a process for determining one or more winning participants competing for something.
- An auction is an example of an arbitration.
- FIG. 1 is a high level diagram of an advertising environment.
- the environment may include an ad entry, maintenance and delivery system (simply referred to as an “ad server” or “ad system”) 120 .
- Advertisers 110 may directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in the system 120 .
- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads such as so-called banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, animation ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads may also include embedded information, such as a link, and/or machine executable instructions.
- Ad consumers 130 may submit requests for ads to, accept ads responsive to their request from, and provide usage information to, the system 120 .
- An entity other than an ad consumer 130 may initiate a request for ads.
- other entities may provide usage information (e.g., whether or not a conversion or a selection related to the ad occurred) to the system 120 .
- This usage information may include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an environment 200 in which the present invention may be used.
- a user device also referred to as a “client” or “client device”
- client device 250 may include a browser facility (such as the Explorer browser from Microsoft, the Opera Web Browser from Opera Software of Norway, the Navigator browser from AOL/Time Warner, etc.), some other content rendering facility, an e-mail facility (e.g., Outlook from Microsoft), etc.
- a search engine 220 may permit user devices 250 to search collections of documents (e.g., Web pages).
- a content server 210 may permit user devices 250 to access documents.
- An e-mail server (such as Gmail from Google, Hotmail from Microsoft Network, Yahoo Mail, etc.) 240 may be used to provide e-mail functionality to user devices 250 .
- An ad server 210 may be used to serve ads to user devices 250 .
- the ads may be served in association with search results provided by the search engine 220 .
- content-relevant ads may be served in association with content provided by the content server 230 , and/or e-mail supported by the e-mail server 240 and/or user device e-mail facilities.
- ads may be targeted to documents served by content servers.
- ad consumer 130 is a general content server 230 that receives requests for documents (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, Web page listings, etc.), and retrieves the requested document in response to, or otherwise services, the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- Such an ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include document request information. This information may include the document itself (e.g., a Web page), a category or topic corresponding to the content of the document or the document request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the document request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, document information, etc.
- the content server 230 may combine the requested document with one or more of the advertisements provided by the ad server 120 / 210 . This combined information including the document content and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the end user device 250 that requested the document, for presentation to the user. Finally, the content server 230 may transmit information about the ads and how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., position, selection or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the ad server 120 / 210 . Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the ad server 120 / 210 by some other means.
- search engine 220 may receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine may retrieve relevant search results (e.g., from an index of Web pages).
- relevant search results e.g., from an index of Web pages.
- An exemplary search engine is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference , Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999 (both incorporated herein by reference).
- search results may include, for example, lists of Web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those Web pages, and hypertext links to those Web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 220 may submit a request for ads to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In one embodiment, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, and preferably from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geolocation information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate, and/or as described below, information related to, and/or derived from, the search query), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., Web pages), full text of identified documents, topics of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- identifiers related to the search results e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”
- scores related to the search results e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores
- snippets of text extracted from identified documents e.g., Web pages
- full text of identified documents e.g., topics of
- the search engine 220 may combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the ad server 120 / 210 . This combined information including the search results and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the user that submitted the search, for presentation to the user.
- the search results are maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the search engine 220 may transmit information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- information may include information for determining on what basis the ad was determined relevant (e.g., strict or relaxed match, or exact, phrase, or broad match, etc.) Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the ad server 120 / 210 by some other means.
- the e-mail server 240 may be thought of, generally, as a content server in which a document served is simply an e-mail.
- e-mail applications such as Microsoft Outlook for example
- an e-mail server 240 or application may be thought of as an ad consumer 130 .
- e-mails may be thought of as documents, and targeted ads may be served in association with such documents. For example, one or more ads may be served in, under over, or otherwise in association with an e-mail.
- servers as (i) requesting ads, and (ii) combining them with content
- a client device such as an end user computer for example
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary ad system 300 in which, or with which, the present invention may be used.
- the exemplary ad system 300 may include an inventory system 310 and may store ad information 305 and usage information 345 .
- the exemplary system 300 may support ad information entry and management operations 315 , campaign (e.g., targeting) assistance operations 320 , accounting and billing operations 325 , ad serving operations 330 , relevancy determination operations 335 , optimization operations 340 , relative presentation attribute assignment (e.g., position ordering) operations 350 , fraud detection operations 355 , and result interface operations 360 .
- campaign e.g., targeting
- accounting and billing operations 325 e.g., accounting and billing operations 325
- ad serving operations 330 e.g., relevancy determination operations 335
- optimization operations 340 e.g., relative presentation attribute assignment (e.g., position ordering) operations 350
- fraud detection operations 355 e.g., fraud detection operations 355
- Advertisers 110 may interface with the system 300 via the ad information entry and management operations 315 as indicated by interface 316 .
- Ad consumers 130 may interface with the system 300 via the ad serving operations 330 as indicated by interface 331 .
- Ad consumers 130 and/or other entities may also interface with the system 300 via results interface operations 360 as indicated by interface 361 .
- An advertising program may include information concerning accounts, campaigns, creatives, targeting, etc.
- the term “account” relates to information for a given advertiser (e.g., a unique email address, a password, billing information, etc.).
- a “campaign” or “ad campaign” refers to one or more groups of one or more advertisements, and may include a start date, an end date, budget information, geo-targeting information, syndication information, etc.
- Honda may have one advertising campaign for its automotive line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line.
- the campaign for its automotive line have one or more ad groups, each containing one or more ads.
- Each ad group may include a set of keywords, and a maximum cost offer (cost per click-though, cost per conversion, etc.).
- each ad group may include an average cost offer (e.g., average cost per click-through, average cost per conversion, etc.). Therefore, a single maximum cost offer and/or a single average cost offer may be associated with one or more keywords. As stated, each ad group may have one or more ads or “creatives” (That is, ad content that is ultimately rendered to an end user.). Naturally, the ad information 305 may include more or less information, and may be organized in a number of different ways.
- the ad information 305 can be entered and managed via the ad information entry and management operations 315 .
- Campaign (e.g., targeting) assistance operations 320 can be employed to help advertisers 110 generate effective ad campaigns.
- the campaign assistance operations 320 can use information provided by the inventory system 310 , which, in the context of advertising for use with a search engine, may track all possible ad impressions, ad impressions already reserved, and ad impressions available for given keywords.
- the ad serving operations 330 may service requests for ads from ad consumers 130 .
- the ad serving operations 330 may use relevancy determination operations 335 to determine candidate ads for a given request.
- the ad serving operations 330 may then use optimization operations 340 to select a final set of one or more of the candidate ads. Finally, the ad serving operations 330 may use relative presentation attribute (e.g., position) assignment operations 350 to order the presentation of the ads to be returned.
- the fraud detection operations 355 can be used to reduce fraudulent use of the advertising system (e.g., by advertisers), such as through the use of stolen credit cards.
- the results interface operations 360 may be used to accept result information (from the ad consumers 130 or some other entity) about an ad actually served, such as whether or not ad selection occurred, whether or not conversion occurred (e.g., whether the sale of an advertised item or service was initiated or consummated within a predetermined time from the rendering of the ad), etc. Such results information may be accepted at interface 361 and may include information to identify the ad and time the ad was served, as well as the associated result.
- features consistent with the present invention can be used with accounting/billing operations 325 and/or relative presentation attribute assignment operations 350 .
- the present invention may be used to discount offers used in various arbitration techniques so that the marginal cost per user action (e.g., selection) is restricted. In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention an advertiser's marginal cost per selection never exceeds their maximum offer.
- Principles of the present invention may be applied to different attribute assignment (e.g., position arbitration) techniques. Exemplary embodiments applying principles of the present invention to a position arbitration that only uses price are described in ⁇ 4.3.1 below. Then, exemplary embodiments applying principles of the present invention to a position arbitration that uses both price information and performance information (e.g., a product of price per selection and selection rate, referred to as effective cost per impression or “eCPI”) are described in ⁇ 4.3.2 below.
- eCPI effective cost per impression
- Advertisements may be displayed on a search results Web page, or any other Web page or document.
- a Webpage display shows n ads, in positions 1 through n.
- Each ad spot position has an associated selection rate, which may be the average selection rate achieved by all advertisements shown in ad spot position i.
- Each of n participants submits a maximum offer.
- These maximum offers may be expressed in terms of cost-per-selection (e.g., cost-per-click or “CPC”), or cost for some other event (e.g., impression, some other user behavior such as conversion, etc.).
- cost-per-selection e.g., cost-per-click or “CPC”
- cost for some other event e.g., impression, some other user behavior such as conversion, etc.
- the embodiments described in this section may be used with arbitration systems in which positioning is still determined using only a cost per selection offer.
- the top position goes to the ad with the highest offer, only the second position goes to the ad with the second highest offer, and so on.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 400 that may be used to determine a cost in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- a number of acts may be performed for each participant (e.g., each advertiser participating in the arbitration) that had an ad placed.
- Information regarding offers for ad(s) with worse position(s) than that of the participant's ad is accepted. (Block 420 ). This information is used in a cost determination. For example, a cost may be determined using a weighted average of the accepted offers.
- the weighting may be determined using a change in the selection rate (or some other user action upon which payment is conditioned) between the position of the participant's ad and the position(s) of the other ad(s).
- the positions may have a general selection rate (e.g., over a group of ads, or over all ads). Generally, the selection rate will monotonically decrease as the ad spot position becomes lower.
- the determined cost should be made available for billing.
- the determined cost can be encoded into the ad information served.
- This encoded determined cost information may be encrypted and/or signed for security purposes. When the participants have been processed, the method 400 may be left. (Node 470 )
- a cost C p for participant p may be determined using the following expression:
- a cost per selection is determined as a weighted average of all (or at least some) of the offers which are less than p's.
- the cost per selection is determined as a weighted average of all of the offers which are less than p's.
- the weights are the differences in selection rates of the corresponding ad spot positions. For example, consider the following participants that had an ad placed:
- the “offer” column shows each participant's maximum offer
- the “selection rate” column shows the selection rate associated with each of the ad spot positions without regard to the selection rate of the particular ad (normalized to 1.0).
- the price paid by advertiser i is the average of the marginal costs associated with each of the ad positions that advertiser i beat.
- hal's marginal cost per selection in 4th position is exactly equal to the amount hal needed to bid to make it into 4th position.
- At least some cost discounting methods consistent with the present invention always restrict marginal cost per selection so that it is less than or equal to the maximum offer. Consequently, a dominant strategy exists—it is optimal for each advertiser to offer its gross profit per selection, that is, its profit before paying advertising costs. For example, an advertiser who makes $800 in profit from 1000 selections has a gross profit per selection of $0.80. Under cost discounting techniques consistent with the present invention, it is optimal for this advertiser to offer a maximum of $0.80 per selection. Contrast this with existing price discounters where an advertiser's best maximum offer may depend on many factors unknown to the advertiser (e.g., at spot position selection rates) and/or out of its control (e.g., competitors' offers).
- new cost determination techniques consistent with the present invention may aggressively discount the cost for selections in relation to offers of others.
- a simple cost determination would have determined a cost for rob as $1.20 per selection (i.e., bob's offer)
- a new cost determination method consistent with the present invention determines the cost for rob as only $0.593. If an ad serving system were to simply start interpreting all of the existing offers (which may have been made under the assumption that they would be discounted in accordance with a simple discounting method) as offers under the new cost determination model, the revenue of the ad serving system would be expected to drop in the short term. This would be expected because offers made assuming one cost discounting method would likely be lower than offers made assuming a more aggressive cost discounting method.
- the main challenge with allowing the different cost discounting models to coexist is that different participants may enter their offers under different assumptions. Participants using a simple cost discounting method which keeps them ahead of the next lower participant may reduce their offers to some extent (consciously or not) because this cost discounting model restricts only the average cost of selections—not the marginal cost. Since a new cost discounting model consistent with the present invention restricts the marginal cost, participants operating under the new model can safely make higher offers. (In fact, the optimal bid under the new cost discounting model is equal to the participant's gross profit per selection.)
- a combined arbitration method in which some maximum offers are specified under a known (position arbitration) method (“known model”) and other maximum offers are specified under a new method consistent with the present invention (“new model”), the maximum offers given under the new model can be converted into maximum offers under the known model and vice versa. Then a “combined arbitration” can be run using maximum offers expressed under either model.
- a “combined arbitration” includes two steps. First, the maximum offers are ordered from highest to lowest. Second, the maximum offers expressed under the new model are converted into maximum offers expressed under the known model. Then, a normal arbitration and cost discounting under the known model can be run using the combined sets of maximum offers.
- the maximum offers are ordered from highest to lowest using the following procedure.
- a set of maximum offers “K” expressed under the known (position arbitration) model is collected (the “known-model offers”), and a set of maximum offers “N” expressed under a new model consistent with the present invention is collected (the “new-model offers”).
- both sets of maximum offers are sorted in descending order.
- the sets of maximum offers are interleaved with each other so that a total ordering of the maximum offers is achieved, which respects the ordering of the maximum offers collected for each of the two arbitration models. Desirable methods for achieving this interleaving are discussed in section 4.3.1.2.3 below.
- a corresponding “new arbitration model maximum offer” (or “new-model offer”) Ni is determined for each known-model maximum offer Ki.
- a corresponding “known arbitration model maximum offer” (or “known-model offer”) Ki is determined for each new-model maximum offer Ni.
- the missing Ni and Ki values may be computed, in ascending order of maximum offers, by the following formulas, derived from the definition of marginal cost:
- PSRi is the position-specific selection rate for position i.
- Equation (2) may be used to compute a new-model offer for position i when the known-model offers are already known for positions i and i+1. Intuitively, this formula computes the marginal cost per selection that a new model participant would pay in position i ⁇ 1. This is calculated as the cost of being in position i ⁇ 1 minus the cost of being in position i, divided by the difference in the selection rates of ad spot positions i ⁇ 1 and i.
- Equation (3) may be used compute a known-model offer for position i (K i ) when all of the new-model offers are available for all positions greater than (i.e. in worse position than) or equal to i (N j , where j ⁇ i). Equation (3) may be expressed by the following algorithm, which computes the weighted average of the worse-positioned bids:
- Equation (3) and the foregoing algorithm essentially compute the cost participant i ⁇ 1 would pay under the new model, and assigns it to the known-model offer for participant i, thus ensuring that participant i ⁇ 1 pays the same amount under each model.
- the net profit that each new-model participant derives from each ad impression may be determined.
- the net profit of such an advertiser may be determined by first finding the difference between the participant's new-model maximum offer and the price the advertiser actually pays per selection (e.g., as computed by pricing equations (2) and (3)). Then, this difference may be multiplied by the selection rate of the ad position the participant's ad occupies to determine the participant's net profit.
- n_offer shows the new-model offer.
- selection rate shows the position-specific selection rate of each ad spot position.
- k_offer shows the corresponding known-model offer—which is equal to the amount that the next higher-positioned participant must pay.
- the “k_offer” column here is exactly the same as the cost column from the previous example, shifted down one row.
- n_offer is determined such that equation (3) produces an k_offer for kate which corresponds to her actual offer ($0.56).
- equation (2) may be used to determine an n_offer of $1.08 for kate.
- the table becomes:
- a normal known-model arbitration can be run using the offers in the k_offer column.
- the cost per selection for rob would be $0.688
- the cost per selection for bob would be $0.560
- the cost per selection for kate would be $0.486, etc.
- the relative ordering of the maximum offers is determined iteratively, based on the net profit derived by the new-model participants.
- an ordering is chosen, and offers (i.e., new-model maximum offers) for each missing position are determined (e.g., using equation (2), or a similar method). Then the ordering of the maximum offers is adjusted iteratively in order to maximize the net profit of the new-model participants.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 500 that may be used to order the position of offers from different cost discounting models.
- First and second (e.g., known-model and new-model) cost determination offers are accepted.
- first-model offers e.g., known-model and new-model cost determination offers
- second-model offers e.g., known-model and new-model cost determination offers
- the sets of each of the first- and second-model offers are sorted by descending maximum offer.
- Blocks 510 and 515 Then the ordered sets of maximum offers are combined by placing all of the first-model offers above all of the second model offers.
- a “CHANGED?” flag is initialized (i.e., set to FALSE).
- loop 530 - 575 a number of acts is performed for each second-model offer, starting with the highest second-model offer. As will be appreciated, depending on a state of the CHANGED? flag, the loop 530 - 575 may be repeated.
- each of the second-model offers are allowed to “bubble up” until they reach an ad spot position that maximizes its net profit.
- the participant is put in that position and the next second-model offer is then processed.
- Positioning and re-positioning the second-model offers is continued until all are optimally positioned (e.g., when no position has changed in the last iteration). Referring to FIG. 5 , this may be done as follows.
- the method 500 branches back to block 525 for another iteration of the loop 530 - 575 . If, on the other hand, the CHANGED? flag is not FALSE, the method continues to block 585 where the now properly positioned second-model offers are converted to first model offers and costs are determined using the first cost determination model, before the method 500 is left. (Node 580 )
- the following algorithm may be used to assign positions as done by the method 500 , where the first offers are known cost determination model offers and the second offers are new cost determination model offers:
- This algorithm starts all the offers of the new-model participants below all of the offers of the known-model participants, and bubbles the new-model offers up into the positions which maximize their profit.
- a profit is calculated as the difference between the cost per selection offer and actual billed cost per offer, times the selection rate of the present ad position, as given in Equation (4). Since this computation needs the missing offers to be recalculated, a number of iterations may be needed (until no change in position occurs). A simulation of a million random arbitrations of 5-15 participants suggests that the foregoing algorithm reliably terminates after only a few iterations.
- any first (e.g., known) model offers can be converted to the second (e.g., new) model offers and the costs can be determined using the new cost determination model.
- the set of candidate positions can be restricted to the positions equal to or above the new-model participant's current position, but below the position occupied by the next higher new-model participant.
- the set of candidate positions can be restricted to the positions equal to or above the new-model participant's current position, but below the position occupied by the next higher new-model participant.
- the following algorithm may be used to perform position assignment and to calculate missing offers in one pass:
- the foregoing algorithm starts with sorted lists of the known-model and new-model offers. It computes the list of final new-model offers from highest (worst) position to lowest (best) position. At each step, it computes the new offer for the lowest known-model participant, and compares that to the lowest new-model participant. The lower of the two is taken and appended to the output offer list. This is repeated until done.
- the running time of this algorithm is linear in the number of ads, as the conversion function from known-model offer to new-model offer is constant time.
- Known-model offers could be compared instead, but it is more difficult to compute the known-model offer from the new-model offer in constant time because partial sums of offers already in final_offers need to be maintained.
- This alternative algorithm is disadvantageous in that it does not always choose the positions which maximize the profit of the new-model participants. Since the earlier algorithm typically converges to a solution in a few passes, it is generally preferred.
- each offer is multiplied by the corresponding creative's creative-specific selection rate (CSR) before running the arbitration, and each billed cost-per-selection is divided by the creative's creative-specific selection rate afterwards.
- CSR creative-specific selection rate
- eCPI effective cost per impression
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 600 that may be used to determined a cost in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- a number of acts may be performed for each participant (e.g., each advertiser participating in the arbitration) that had an ad placed.
- Information regarding eCPIs for ad(s) with worse position(s) that that of the participant's ad is accepted. (Block 620 ). This information is used in a cost determination. For example, a cost may be determined using a weighted average of the accepted eCPI.
- the weighting may be determined using a change in the position-specific selection rate (or some other user action upon which payment is conditioned) between the position of the participant's ad and the position(s) of the other ad(s).
- the positions may have a general position-specific selection rate (e.g., averaged over a group of ads, or over all ads). Generally, the position-specific selection rate will monotonically decrease as the ad spot position becomes lower. Note that the change in position-specific selection rate used for weighting concerns that due to the ad spot position, not the creative-specific selection rate of the creative.
- the determined cost should be made available for billing.
- the determined cost can be encoded into the ad information served.
- This encoded determined cost information may be encrypted and/or signed for security purposes. When the participants have been processed, the method 600 may be left. (Node 670 )
- a cost C p for participant p may be determined using the following expression:
- CSR p ⁇ ⁇ i position ⁇ ⁇ of ad ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ p n ⁇ ( PSR ⁇ i - PSR ⁇ i + 1 ) ( 5 ) where increasing position i corresponds to lower (and worse performing) ad spot positions.
- CSR i is the creative-specific selection rate of the ad in position i
- PSR i is the position-specific selection rate of position i.
- offer n+1 is assumed to be the reserve price
- CSR n+1 is assumed to be 1
- PSR n+1 is assumed to be 0.
- the range of the summation is changed.
- the summation should include at least one ad spot position worse than the position of the ad of the participant.
- various alternative embodiments consistent with the present invention are possible under which the selection rate difference (or some other performance parameter) of the ad spot positions is modified, and/or under which the offer is modified.
- embodiments that ensure that an advertiser's marginal per-selection cost never exceeds their maximum offer may be advantageous.
- Ni and Ki values may be computed, in ascending order of maximum offers, by the following formulas, which are similar to equations (2) and (3), derived from the definition of marginal cost:
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 700 that may be used to order the position of eCPI's from different cost discounting models.

- first-model eCPI's and “second-model eCPI's” for brevity.
- the sets of each of the first-model and second-model eCPI's are sorted by descending maximum eCPI.
- Blocks 710 and 715 Then the ordered sets of eCPI's are combined by placing all of the first model eCPI's above all of the second model eCPI's.
- a “CHANGED?” flag is initialized (e.g., set to FALSE).
- Block 725 As indicated by loop 730 - 775 , a number of acts is performed for each second model eCPI, starting with the highest second-model eCPI. As will be appreciated, depending on a state of the CHANGED? flag, the loop 730 - 775 may be repeated.
- each of the second-model eCPI's are allowed to “bubble up” until they reach an ad spot position that maximizes its net profit.
- the participant is put in that position and the next second-model offer is then processed.
- Positioning and re-positioning the second-model eCPI's is continued until all are optimally positioned (e.g., when no position has changed in the last iteration). Referring to FIG. 7 , this may be done as follows.
- a best profit, a best position and a start position for the second-model eCPI are initialized.
- a best profit may be set to zero, and both a best position and a start position may be set to the current position of the second model eCPI.
- a number of acts is then performed for each position j.
- the loop 740 - 760 may cycle through each position (e.g., all possible positions), or may only cycle through positions above the start position of the second model eCPI, and/or below the best position of the previous second model eCPI.
- the net profit of such a participant may be determined by first finding the difference between the participant's new-model maximum offer and the price the advertiser actually pays per click (e.g., as computed by the pricing formulas given in equation (6) (5)). Then, this difference may be multiplied by the selection rate of the ad position the advertiser's ad occupies to determine the advertiser's net profit.
- Cost per selection may be determined using equation (7). Note that the profit may be negative. If the profit is greater than the best profit, the best profit is set to the current value of profit, and the best position is set to the current position (i.e., j) and the method 700 proceeds to block 760 to continue the loop 740 - 760 . (Blocks 750 and 755 ) If, on the other hand, the profit is not greater than the best profit, the method 700 proceeds to block 760 to continue the loop 740 - 760 . (Block 750 )
- the method 700 branches back to block 725 for another iteration of the loop 730 - 775 . If, on the other hand, the CHANGED? flag is not FALSE, the method continues to block 785 where the now properly positioned second-model eCPIs are converted to first-model eCPIs and costs are determined using the first cost determination model, before the method 700 is left. (Node 780 )
- the following algorithm may be used to assign positions as done by the method 700 , where the first-model offers are known cost determination model offers and the second-model offers are new cost determination model offer:
- This algorithm starts all the eCPI's of the new-model participants below all of the eCPI's of the known-model participants, and bubbles the new-model eCPI's up into the positions which maximize their profit.
- a profit is calculated as the difference between the offer per selection and actual determined cost per selection, times the selection rate of the present ad position. Since this computation needs the missing eCPIs to be recalculated, a number of iterations may be needed (until no change in position occurs).

If, on the other hand, the condition(s) is met, the determined cost can be billed to the advertiser's account (Block 840 ), before the method 800 is left (Node 899 ). Referring back to decision block 830 , if there is no condition(s) precedent to billing, the determined cost can simply be billed to the advertiser's account (Block 840 ) before the method 800 is left (Node 850 ).

- an arbitration may be performed for a number of ads m over a number of Webpage views, where each Webpage view has n ⁇ m ad spots. For example, suppose a search engine generates four pages of search results, each with ten (10) ad spots. Although there is a potential to render forty (40) ads, this depends on whether a user requests subsequent pages of search results. The expected selection rate of an ad spot may be per Webpage view, or per collection of Webpage views. Thus, if there are m>n ads, then the primary display shows only the n highest-scoring ads. A user may choose to view a second Webpage of ads which displays ads n+1 through 2n.

- an ad is considered shown whenever any Webpage of ads from its arbitration is shown, regardless of whether the ad's position falls within the range of ads actually rendered on the rendered Webpage.

- Arbitration models consistent with the present invention may provide advertisers with a dominant participation strategy (that is, a strategy for making maximum offers which is always optimal, independent of what the other advertisers do and independent of the relative values of ad spot positions or some other ad treatment). If the offers are maximum offers per selection, the dominant maximum offer is the value of a selection to the advertiser, such as its average gross profit per selection. Since the dominant maximum offer does not depend on the behavior of the competition, nor on the relative selection rates of the different ad positions (or some other ad treatments), the advertiser does not have to monitor its competition or change its maximum offer unless its conversion rate or profit per conversion changes.

- Embodiments consistent with the present invention permit the marginal cost per selection to be restricted. For example, using some embodiments consistent with the present invention, a participant's marginal cost per selection will never exceed its maximum offer per selection. Under such embodiments, when a participant advances to a higher ad position, the price paid for all selection increases, but only because new selections are obtained.
- At least some embodiments consistent with the present invention permit an ad server to introduce a new cost determination technique gradually, by facilitating the running a combined arbitration in which some offers are made under a first cost discounting assumption and other offers are made under a second cost discounting assumption.
- This allows an ad server to accurately test advertiser reaction to the new cost discounting model without disturbing the other advertisers that want to continue using an existing or different cost discounting model.
- the ad server can avoid sudden decreases in revenue that would otherwise likely occur if more aggressive cost discounting were applied before participants changed their offers in response to such aggressive cost discounting.
Abstract
Description
where increasing position i corresponds to lower (and worse performing) ad spot positions, and PSRi corresponds to the position-specific selection rate for a position i. Additionally, offern+1 is assumed to be the reserve price, and PSRn+1 is assumed to be 0. Various alternative embodiments consistent with the present invention are possible under which the range of the summation is changed. However, the summation should include at least one ad spot position worse than the position of the ad of the participant. Similarly, various alternative embodiments consistent with the present invention are possible under which the selection rate difference (or some other performance parameter) of the ad spot positions is modified, and/or under which the offer is modified. Naturally, however, embodiments that ensure that an advertiser's marginal cost per selection never exceeds their maximum offer may be advantageous.

profit=offer per selection·PSR−cost per selection·PSR (8)
The net profit is how much the participant derives from each ad impression. In one embodiment, the net profit of such a participant may be determined by first finding the difference between the participant's new-model maximum offer and the price the advertiser actually pays per click (e.g., as computed by the pricing formulas given in equation (6) (5)). Then, this difference may be multiplied by the selection rate of the ad position the advertiser's ad occupies to determine the advertiser's net profit.
