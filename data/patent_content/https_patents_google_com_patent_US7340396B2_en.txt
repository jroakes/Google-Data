Definitions
- This invention relates generally to speech recognition and more particularly to the provision of speaker adapted speech recognition model sets.
- Automatic speech recognition techniques are known that convert a speech signal into a sequence of speech feature vectors (and/or classes) and then identify segments of the sequence that correspond to specific words.
- the segmentation and recognition process typically relies on a set of speech recognition models (wherein typically each such model corresponds to a given sound, such as a specific word or sub-word unit).
- each model can provide a basis for computing a likelihood that a particular set of speech feature values (or classes) are properly associated with a corresponding acoustic unit such as a given specific sound.
- Such speech recognition models are often created during overall system development and are usually based on a large corpus of speech data from many speakers representing a given language (or dialect). During use, however, speech recognition accuracy depends on the ability of the models to provide accurate estimates of feature likelihoods for a given user's voice. Since the statistics of speech feature usage and occurrence in fact differ significantly as between various speakers of a given language, models trained on many speakers will usually not provide completely accurate likelihood estimates for any given individual user unless the permitted words are purposefully significantly limited and significantly audibly distinct from one another.
- acoustic classes can include phonemes as such, but more typically also comprise more abstract categories for the most part, such as sub-phonemes or context dependent phonemes where the sound depends upon what precedes and/or what follows the sound).
- FIG. 1 comprises a block diagram depiction of a prior art platform
- FIG. 2 comprises a block diagram as configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention
- FIG. 3 comprises a general flow diagram as configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 4 comprises a detail flow diagram as configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
- both a speaker independent speech recognition model set (to be used when recognizing speech) and a speaker independent speech feature space model that is at least partially different from the speaker independent speech recognition model are provided.
- Speech from a given specific user then supports the provision of a corresponding speaker dependent speech feature space model.
- a set of alignment indices are then formed as a function, at least in part, of the speaker independent speech feature space model and the speaker dependent speech feature space model. These alignment indices then permit modification of the speaker independent speech recognition model to effect provision of a speaker adapted speech recognition model set for subsequent use during speech recognition activities.
- the speaker independent speech feature space model comprises a speaker independent acoustic feature space model.
- the speaker dependent speech feature space model can comprise a speaker dependent acoustic feature space model.
- speech feature vectors are determined from the speech. These speech feature vectors provide at least an estimation of the speaker dependent speech feature space model.
- speech feature vectors can comprise, for example, cepstral parameters as well understood in the art.
- the alignment indices can be determined, for example, by determining correspondences between speech feature classes of the speaker independent speech feature space model and the speaker dependent speech feature space model. For example, one can determine the alignment between the speech feature classes of the speaker independent speech feature space model and the speech feature classes of the speaker dependent speech feature space model. Further, one can ascertain when the alignments meet at least a first criteria such as a measure of a difference between likelihoods of occurrence for at least some of the speech features classes of the speaker independent speech feature space model and likelihoods of occurrence for at least some of the speech feature classes of the speaker independent speech feature space model. Such a measure of a difference could be, for example, a measure of a difference between a speech feature class n-gram probability for the speaker independent speech feature space model and a speech feature class n-gram probability for the speaker dependent speech feature space model.
- the prior art platform shown in FIG. 1 comprises a speech recognition platform as follows.
- This prior art platform provides for both the clustering of a speaker's feature data 12 and a vector quantization codebook 15 (the former typically being speaker dependent and the latter typically being speaker independent).
- Speech feature vectors 10 representing a given speech input for a given speaker are provided to a model estimation unit 11 which in turn feeds the speaker's feature data clustering activity 12 .
- each vector quantization codebook element is associated with the nearest cluster centroid in the speaker model. The average deviation for each cluster then serves as a bias estimate to permit adjustment of the vector quantization elements associated with that cluster.
- a model alignment unit 13 uses the information from the clustering process 12 and the vector quantization codebook 15 to determine these bias estimates.
- a transformation estimation unit 14 then utilizes this information to provide transformation parameters that are used by a model transformation unit 16 to provide a resultant speaker dependent speech recognition model set 17 based upon a transformed and modified vector quantization codebook.
- This prior art approach requires the storage of feature vector information while facilitating the clustering process. Perhaps more significantly, this approach uses a simple vector distance measurement to effect its overall approach. While perhaps appropriate and/or somewhat intuitive when applied in the context of vector quantization-based speech recognition platforms, such an approach does not apply with relevance to more modern model-based speech recognition techniques.
- This platform serves generally to provide a way of adapting a model to an individual speaker without having to perform speech recognition as an integral part of the modification process. While these described processes do require some sufficient quanta of a user's speech, there are no constraints with respect to the content of that speech. Therefore, the user's speech samples do not need to comprise specialized training material or the like (though, if desired, such content would also suffice for these purposes).
- a sequence of speech feature vectors 10 are extracted from such speech samples in accordance with well understood prior art technique and provided to a model estimation unit 11 .
- the latter uses these speech feature vectors 10 to then estimate a corresponding speaker dependent speech feature space model 20 (which may comprise, in a preferred embodiment, an estimated speaker dependent acoustic feature space model).
- This model 20 comprises a representation of the statistics of the speech features and may comprise, in a preferred embodiment, the following elements:
- a model alignment unit 21 receives the resultant information corresponding to the speaker dependent speech feature space model 20 and compares for correspondence between the classes for the speaker dependent speech feature space model 20 and the classes of a predetermined speaker independent speech feature space model 24 .
- Such correspondence derives from searching all the possible combinations of class associations to find an alignment that optimizes a predetermined criterion (if desired, and likely pursuant to some pre-processing filtering, a smaller subset than all possible combinations of class associations could possibly suffice in some settings).
- the predetermined criteria has three components: (1) a measure of the distance between the class prior probabilities of the two models (with this measure reflecting the typical situation with most languages where some sounds (such as “aa” in English) are more likely to occur than other sounds (such as “zzz” in English)); (2) a measure of the distance between the class n-gram probabilities of the two models; and (3) a measure of the likelihood of the speaker dependent model based on the speaker independent model.
- the model alignment unit 21 can be aided by a set of model tranformation prior parameters 22 .
- Such model transformation prior parameters would describe prior distributions for transformation functions that map the speaker dependent feature space model onto the speaker independent feature space model.
- the model alignment unit 21 responds to the speaker dependent acoustic feature space model information and the speaker independent acoustic feature space model information and provides an output comprising model alignment indices that correspond to differences between speaker dependent feature space models and speaker independent feature space models that correspond to one another as a function, at least in part, of a probability of occurrence of each such model.
- these alignment indices correspond to differences between speaker dependent feature space models and speaker independent feature space models that further correspond to one another as a function, at least in part, of n-gram probability information for classes that comprise each of the speaker dependent and speaker independent feature space models.
- a transformation estimation unit 23 receives the alignment indices from the model alignment unit 21 and determines a transformation that, in a preferred embodiment, maps the arithmetic means of the speaker independent feature model classes onto the arithmetic means of the corresponding speaker feature model classes.
- the transformation comprises a piecewise transformation estimated by maximum likelihood.
- the piecewise components of the transformation are preferably organized in a hierarchical tree. If in a given embodiment the classes are represented by more detailed distribution information, then more sophisticated transformations can of course be estimated.
- a model transformation unit 25 has access to one or more speaker independent speech recognition model sets 26 .
- these speaker independent speech recognition model sets 26 are at least partially different from the speaker independent speech feature space model 24 referred to earlier, and also preferably comprise a set of hidden Markov models (HMMs).
- the model transformation unit 25 receives the transformation parameters from the transformation estimation unit 23 and applies this transformation information to the HMMs. More particularly, each class within the speech feature space models is preferably associated with a subset of the probability density functions (pdfs) for the set of hidden Markov models, and the model transformation unit 25 applies the transformations to the corresponding HMM pdfs.
- PDFs probability density functions
- the model transformation unit 25 provides as an output a speaker adapted speech recognition model set 27 that comprises the speaker independent speech recognition model set 26 as transformed to better align with pertinent characteristics of a given speaker's speaking tendencies.
- the model estimation unit 11 can be configured to process the incoming feature vector information in such as way as to avoid the need to store a considerable quantity of these feature vectors. For example, a first received feature vector can be used as an initial estimate of a first acoustic class. Subsequent vectors whose distance from the mean falls below a predefined threshold can then be used to update the mean information by computing a linear combination of the old mean and the new vector. Subsequent vectors whose distance from all existing means exceeds the same (or another) threshold can be used to form a new initial estimate of the mean of a new class. This process can continue, for example, until the number of classes reaches a predefined level.
- the number of classes can then be delimited down to some desired N classes by eliminating those classes whose frequency of appearance are low relative to the likelihood of their means conditioned on other classes with larger frequencies.
- the feature vectors themselves need not correspond to any particular speech content or training text. These processes can be readily carried out successfully based upon whatever utterances are offered by a given individual during, for example, an ordinary conversation.
- the platform as described above or any other suitable mechanism or combination of mechanisms serves to provide 31 a speaker independent speech recognition model set, which model set comprises a model set that is otherwise likely used during ordinary automatic speaker independent speech recognition purposes.
- the process also provides 32 another speaker independent speech feature space model.
- the latter model although also speaker independent, is preferably different from the first speaker independent speech recognition model set provided 31 above.
- the speaker independent speech feature space model will typically contain far fewer acoustic classes than the speaker independent speech recognition model set. This tends to ensure a more robust process of aligning the speaker independent speech feature space model and the speaker dependent feature space model.
- one preferred approach to providing such a corresponding speaker dependent speech feature space model 34 includes providing 41 one or more threshold values and using 42 an initially received speech feature vector as an initial estimate of a mean of a first speech feature class. Subsequently received speech feature vectors 44 are then compared 43 with this mean. When the distance from the mean is below a first predetermined threshold as provided earlier, that vector information is used 45 in a first way to update the mean.
- a second predetermined threshold which second predetermined threshold may be the same as, or different than, the first predetermined threshold as appropriate to a given application
- that vector information is used 46 in a second way; i.e., to characterize a different speech feature class.
- this iterative process can be utilized until, for example, the number of classes reaches a predefined level.
- the process provides 35 a corresponding set of resultant alignment indices.
- these alignment indices are determined as a function, at least in part, of a likelihood that a given speaker dependent speech feature space model will occur; i.e. the probability of a given speaker dependent speech feature space model actually occurring within a given speech sample.
- the alignment indices are then used to modify 36 the speaker independent speech recognition model to provide a resultant speaker adapted speech recognition model set.
- these processes will function with or without such knowledge.
- the process collects user data (the verbal content of which may, or may not, be recognizable to the platform) and forms clusters based on the data itself and make corresponding classifications of use when altering pre-defined models to effect the adaptation.
- these embodiments effect a comparison of the two classes with the information provided regarding independent speaker-based classes. Based upon this comparison, the process can correlate or otherwise match up the two classes as between the developed set of classes and the classes of the speaker independent speech feature space model and use the resultant identified differences to adjust the speaker independent speech recognition model set 26 as will be used by the platform when effecting automated speech recognition.
- Such embodiments are suitable for use during a training period with or without specific training content and/or for use on the fly during ordinary use.
- the developed information can be used on a one-time basis and then discarded, or kept for future use. It should also be noted that these processes provide useful results even when the speech sample(s) of the speaker do not include content that corresponds to all possible classes for a given spoken language. Even a relatively small amount of data that corresponds, strictly speaking, to only a few of the potential classes of a given language can be used to compute a relatively simple transformation that will nevertheless often prove beneficial.
- Such embodiments can be realized using any appropriate platform, including discrete logic elements, a wholly integrated processing platform, distributed processing, and so forth. Such embodiments are also particularly appropriate for application in a device such as a wireless voice communications device, as the platform would have ready and relatively transparent access to samples of the speakers utterances during normal conversations.
