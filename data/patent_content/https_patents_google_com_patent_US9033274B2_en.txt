- the example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
- Example embodiments help to provide a data network that includes a plurality of balloons; for example, a mesh network formed by high-altitude balloons deployed in the stratosphere. Since winds in the stratosphere may affect the locations of the balloons in a differential manner, each balloon in an example network may be configured to change its horizontal position by adjusting its vertical position (i.e., altitude). For instance, by adjusting its altitude, a balloon may be able find winds that will carry it horizontally (e.g., latitudinally and/or longitudinally) to a desired horizontal location.
- the balloons may communicate with one another using free-space optical communications.
- the balloons may be configured for optical communications using ultra-bright LEDs (which are also referred to as “high-power” or “high-output” LEDs).
- ultra-bright LEDs which are also referred to as “high-power” or “high-output” LEDs.
- lasers could be used instead of or in addition to LEDs, although regulations for laser communications may restrict laser usage.
- the balloons may communicate with ground-based station(s) using radio-frequency (RF) communications.
- RF radio-frequency
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be homogenous. That is, the balloons in a high-altitude-balloon network could be substantially similar to each other in one or more ways. More specifically, in a homogenous high-altitude-balloon network, each balloon is configured to communicate with one or more other balloons via free-space optical links. Further, some or all of the balloons in such a network, may additionally be configured to communicate with ground-based and/or satellite-based station(s) using RF and/or optical communications. Thus, in some embodiments, the balloons may be homogenous in so far as each balloon is configured for free-space optical communication with other balloons, but heterogeneous with regard to RF communications with ground-based stations.
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be heterogeneous, and thus may include two or more different types of balloons.
- some balloons in a heterogeneous network may be configured as super-nodes, while other balloons may be configured as sub-nodes.
- some balloons in a heterogeneous network may be configured to function as both a super-node and a sub-node.
- Such balloons may function as either a super-node or a sub-node at a particular time, or, alternatively, act as both simultaneously depending on the context.
- an example balloon could aggregate search requests of a first type to transmit to a ground-based station.
- the example balloon could also send search requests of a second type to another balloon, which could act as a super-node in that context.
- some balloons which may be super-nodes in an example embodiment, can be configured to communicate via optical links with ground-based stations and/or satellites.
- the super-node balloons may be configured to communicate with nearby super-node balloons via free-space optical links.
- the sub-node balloons may not be configured for free-space optical communication, and may instead be configured for some other type of communication, such as RF communications.
- a super-node may be further configured to communicate with sub-nodes using RF communications.
- the sub-nodes may relay communications between the super-nodes and one or more ground-based stations using RF communications.
- the super-nodes may collectively function as backhaul for the balloon network, while the sub-nodes function to relay communications from the super-nodes to ground-based stations
- the altitude of a balloon may be controlled in a number of different ways.
- the buoyancy, and thus the altitude, of the balloon may be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the gas within an envelope of the balloon.
- the temperature of the gas within the envelope itself does not change the buoyancy of the balloon.
- the envelope In order for temperature to change buoyancy, the envelope needs to be somewhat elastic so that it expands when heated, or the gas inside is heated, or conversely that it collapses to some degree when cooled, since it is the density change of the gas within the balloon that, by definition, is what changes the buoyancy of the balloon.
- the altitude of balloon may be controlled by increasing or decreasing the temperature of the gas within the envelope.
- it may be possible to control the altitude of the balloon by controlling the density of the gas within the balloon, by controlling the amount of solar energy that is absorbed by the gas.
- the gas within the envelope of the balloon may cool quickly, and controlling the altitude of the balloon by adjusting the temperature of the gas within the envelope may not be possible. Therefore, at night, it may be desirable to pump more or less gas into the envelope of the balloon, or into a bladder within the envelope of the balloon, to increase or decrease the buoyancy of the balloon. Therefore, it may be useful to provide altitude control for a balloon during the day using a first mode of operation by controlling the density of the gas within the envelope of the balloon through the control of the temperature of the gas within the envelope of the balloon, and it be also be useful to control the altitude of the balloon at night using a second mode of operation by adjusting the volume of the gas within the balloon envelope or bladder to adjust the buoyancy of the balloon as appropriate.
- the temperature of the gas within the envelope may be controlled by controlling the amount of solar energy that is absorbed by the gas within the balloon envelope.
- the absorptive/reflective properties of the surface of the balloon envelope may be adjusted, or varied, by providing a balloon with an envelope having a first portion of the envelope having a property different from a second portion of the envelope, with respect to reflecting or absorbing solar energy.
- a first portion of the envelope may be colored white, or some other light color, which reflects more solar energy than a dark colored surface to help prevent the temperature of the gas within the envelope from rising.
- a second portion of the envelope could be colored black, or some other dark color, which absorbs more solar energy than a lightly colored surface to allow more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope, causing the temperature of the gas within the envelope to rise. It may also be the case that a clear side would allow the sun to penetrate into the balloon, warming the air inside. In this way a clear surface would be equivalent to the dark colored or black surface for the portion of the envelope that is presented towards the sun when it desired to warm up the air inside the balloon (relative to the light colored or otherwise reflective side).
- a non-symmetrically shaped balloon such that a first portion of the balloon may be oriented towards the sun that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope than when a second portion of the balloon is oriented towards the sun. Therefore, by choosing which side of the non-symmetrically shaped balloon envelope to orient towards the sun, differential heat may be brought into the balloon.
- a non-symmetrically shaped balloon may be used with a balloon having the same material used for its entire envelope surface area, or may be used in conjunction with a first portion of the balloon having different reflective, transmissive, or emissive properties than a second portion of the balloon.
- the balloon envelope may be engineered to serve as an orientable solar thermal energy collection system.
- the portion of the balloon that allows for the most transmission or absorption of solar energy may be rotated and oriented towards the sun.
- the materials chosen to make this envelope might look very different in the thermal IR vs. the visible band.
- envelope material that looks white to human eyes might in fact be quite black (low R (reflectivity), high E (emissivity), low T (transmissivity) when viewed in the thermal IR.
- the temperature of the gas within the balloon envelope may be controlled.
- the balloon may be equipped with the ability to rotate the balloon envelope so that the first portion of the envelope or the second portion of the envelope is positioned facing the sun.
- the first portion of the balloon envelope that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope may be positioned facing the sun to increase the temperature of the gas within envelope (and increase the altitude of the balloon).
- the second portion of the envelope that allows for less solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the balloon envelope may be positioned facing the sun to decrease the temperature of the gas within the balloon envelope (and decrease the altitude of the balloon). Relying on solar heat to raise and lower the balloon may not be the most reliable way to accomplish the goal of station keeping of the balloon.
- the use of solar energy has the advantage that it is very energy efficient and doesn't take much energy. Specifically, it takes less energy to turn the balloon into a desired position relative to the sun (using many of the possible ways of turning the balloon) than to change altitude by some other means such as by running an electric air compressor.
- the use of solar energy to control balloon altitude may advantageously use less energy than other methods of controlling balloon altitude.
- a second mode of operation that may be used to control the altitude of the balloon may be by introducing additional lifting gas into the balloon envelope or bladder. In this manner, gas may be pumped into or out of the balloon envelope or bladder to control the altitude of the balloon at night.
- Altimeters or other devices may be used determine the altitude and/or rate of descent and provide for switching from a first mode of altitude control using solar energy, to a second mode of altitude control using inflation/deflation of the balloon envelope or bladder with gas, or some combination thereof.
- the payload may include one or more solar cells to store energy that can be used for altitude control during the night.
- solar energy stored during the day may be used to control the altitude of the balloon by pumping gas into, or out of, the envelope of the balloon, or the bladder of the balloon.
- the stored solar energy could also be used to store energy used for rotating the balloon envelope during the day time.
- the solar energy stored during the day may be used to heat the gas within the balloon envelope to provide increased buoyancy.
- hydrogen used as the lifting gas
- Fuel for the fuel cell can be generated by oxidizing hydrogen, supported by energy from the solar cells. Hydrogen gas may be burned at night to heat the payload and/or the gas within the balloon envelope and/or bladder.
- FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a balloon network 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- balloon network 100 includes balloons 102 A to 102 F, which are configured to communicate with one another via free-space optical links 104 .
- Balloons 102 A to 102 F could additionally or alternatively be configured to communicate with one another via RF links 114 .
- Balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network for packet-data communications.
- at least some of balloons 102 A and 102 B may be configured for RF communications with ground-based stations 106 and 112 via respective RF links 108 .
- some balloons, such as balloon 102 F could be configured to communicate via optical link 110 with ground-based station 112 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F are high-altitude balloons, which are deployed in the stratosphere.
- the stratosphere includes altitudes between approximately 10 kilometers (km) and 50 km altitude above the surface.
- the stratosphere starts at an altitude of approximately 8 km.
- high-altitude balloons may be generally configured to operate in an altitude range within the stratosphere that has relatively low wind speed (e.g., between 5 and 20 miles per hour (mph)).
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may generally be configured to operate at altitudes between 18 km and 25 km (although other altitudes are possible). This altitude range may be advantageous for several reasons.
- this layer of the stratosphere generally has relatively low wind speeds (e.g., winds between 5 and 20 mph) and relatively little turbulence.
- winds between 18 km and 25 km may vary with latitude and by season, the variations can be modeled in a reasonably accurate manner.
- altitudes above 18 km are typically above the maximum flight level designated for commercial air traffic. Therefore, interference with commercial flights is not a concern when balloons are deployed between 18 km and 25 km.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may be configured to transmit an optical signal via an optical link 104 .
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may use one or more high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to transmit an optical signal.
- LEDs high-power light-emitting diodes
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may include laser systems for free-space optical communications over optical links 104 . Other types of free-space optical communication are possible.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may include one or more optical receivers. Additional details of example balloons are discussed in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. 3 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may utilize one or more of various different RF air-interface protocols for communication with ground-based stations 106 and 112 via respective RF links 108 .
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may be configured to communicate with ground-based stations 106 and 112 using protocols described in IEEE 802.11 (including any of the IEEE 802.11 revisions), various cellular protocols such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, EV-DO, WiMAX, and/or LTE, and/or one or more propriety protocols developed for balloon-ground RF communication, among other possibilities.
- an example network may also include downlink balloons, which could provide a high-capacity air-ground link.
- balloon 102 F is configured as a downlink balloon.
- a downlink balloon 102 F may be operable for optical communication with other balloons via optical links 104 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may also be configured for free-space optical communication with a ground-based station 112 via an optical link 110 .
- Optical link 110 may therefore serve as a high-capacity link (as compared to an RF link 108 ) between the balloon network 100 and the ground-based station 112 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may additionally be operable for RF communication with ground-based stations 106 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may only use an optical link for balloon-to-ground communications.
- an example balloon network can also include multiple downlink balloons.
- a balloon network can also be implemented without any downlink balloons.
- a downlink balloon may be equipped with a specialized, high-bandwidth RF communication system for balloon-to-ground communications, instead of, or in addition to, a free-space optical communication system.
- the high-bandwidth RF communication system may take the form of an ultra-wideband system, which may provide an RF link with substantially the same capacity as one of the optical links 104 .
- Other forms are also possible.
- Ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and/or 112
- a ground-based station may include components such as transceivers, transmitters, and/or receivers for communication via RF links and/or optical links with a balloon network.
- a ground-based station may use various air-interface protocols in order to communicate with a balloon 102 A to 102 F over an RF link 108 .
- ground-based stations 106 and 112 may be configured as an access point via which various devices can connect to balloon network 100 .
- Ground-based stations 106 and 112 may have other configurations and/or serve other purposes without departing from the scope of the invention.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F could be configured to establish a communication link with space-based satellites in addition to, or as an alternative to, a ground-based communication link.
- a balloon may communicate with a satellite via an optical link.
- other types of satellite communications are possible.
- ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and 112
- Such ground-based stations 106 and 112 may thus serve as an interface between the balloon network and the Internet, a cellular service provider's network, and/or other types of networks. Variations on this configuration and other configurations of ground-based stations 106 and 112 are also possible.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network. More specifically, since balloons 102 A to 102 F may communicate with one another using free-space optical links, the balloons may collectively function as a free-space optical mesh network.
- each balloon 102 A to 102 F may function as a node of the mesh network, which is operable to receive data directed to it and to route data to other balloons.
- data may be routed from a source balloon to a destination balloon by determining an appropriate sequence of optical links between the source balloon and the destination balloon.
- These optical links may be collectively referred to as a “lightpath” for the connection between the source and destination balloons.
- each of the optical links may be referred to as a “hop” on the lightpath.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may employ various routing techniques and self-healing algorithms.
- a balloon network 100 may employ adaptive or dynamic routing, where a lightpath between a source and destination balloon is determined and set-up when the connection is needed, and released at a later time. Further, when adaptive routing is used, the lightpath may be determined dynamically depending upon the current state, past state, and/or predicted state of the balloon network.
- an example balloon network 100 may apply a mesh protocol to update the state of the network as the topology of the network changes.
- balloon network 100 may employ and/or adapt various techniques that are employed in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Other examples are possible as well.
- MANETs mobile ad hoc networks
- a balloon network 100 may be configured as a transparent mesh network. More specifically, in a transparent balloon network, the balloons may include components for physical switching that is entirely optical, without any electrical components involved in the physical routing of optical signals. Thus, in a transparent configuration with optical switching, signals travel through a multi-hop lightpath that is entirely optical.
- the balloon network 100 may implement a free-space optical mesh network that is opaque.
- some or all balloons 102 A to 102 F may implement optical-electrical-optical (OEO) switching.
- some or all balloons may include optical cross-connects (OXCs) for OEO conversion of optical signals.
- OEO optical-electrical-optical
- Other opaque configurations are also possible.
- network configurations are possible that include routing paths with both transparent and opaque sections.
- balloons in an example balloon network 100 may implement wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which may help to increase link capacity.
- WDM wavelength division multiplexing
- physical lightpaths through the balloon network may be subject to the “wavelength continuity constraint.” More specifically, because the switching in a transparent network is entirely optical, it may be necessary to assign the same wavelength for all optical links on a given lightpath.
- An opaque configuration may avoid the wavelength continuity constraint.
- balloons in an opaque balloon network may include the OEO switching systems operable for wavelength conversion.
- balloons can convert the wavelength of an optical signal at each hop along a lightpath.
- optical wavelength conversion could take place at only selected hops along the lightpath.
- various routing algorithms may be employed in an opaque configuration. For example, to determine a primary lightpath and/or one or more diverse backup lightpaths for a given connection, example balloons may apply or consider shortest-path routing techniques such as Dijkstra's algorithm and k-shortest path, and/or edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing such as Suurballe's algorithm, among others. Additionally or alternatively, techniques for maintaining a particular quality of service (QoS) may be employed when determining a lightpath. Other techniques are also possible.
- QoS quality of service
- a balloon network 100 may implement station-keeping functions to help provide a desired network topology. For example, station-keeping may involve each balloon 102 A to 102 F maintaining and/or moving into a certain position relative to one or more other balloons in the network (and possibly in a certain position relative to the ground). As part of this process, each balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to determine its desired positioning within the desired topology, and if necessary, to determine how to move to the desired position.
- the desired topology may vary depending upon the particular implementation.
- balloons may implement station-keeping to provide a substantially uniform topology.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to position itself at substantially the same distance (or within a certain range of distances) from adjacent balloons in the balloon network 100 .
- a balloon network 100 may have a non-uniform topology.
- example embodiments may involve topologies where balloons are distributed more or less densely in certain areas, for various reasons.
- balloons may be clustered more densely over urban areas.
- the distribution of balloons may be denser over land than over large bodies of water.
- Many other examples of non-uniform topologies are possible.
- the topology of an example balloon network may be adaptable.
- station-keeping functionality of example balloons may allow the balloons to adjust their respective positioning in accordance with a change in the desired topology of the network. For example, one or more balloons could move to new positions to increase or decrease the density of balloons in a given area. Other examples are possible.
- a balloon network 100 may employ an energy function to determine if and/or how balloons should move to provide a desired topology.
- the state of a given balloon and the states of some or all nearby balloons may be input to an energy function.
- the energy function may apply the current states of the given balloon and the nearby balloons to a desired network state (e.g., a state corresponding to the desired topology).
- a vector indicating a desired movement of the given balloon may then be determined by determining the gradient of the energy function.
- the given balloon may then determine appropriate actions to take in order to effectuate the desired movement. For example, a balloon may determine an altitude adjustment or adjustments such that winds will move the balloon in the desired manner.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a balloon-network control system, according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 2 shows a distributed control system, which includes a central control system 200 and a number of regional control-systems 202 A to 202 B.
- Such a control system may be configured to coordinate certain functionality for balloon network 204 , and as such, may be configured to control and/or coordinate certain functions for balloons 206 A to 206 I.
- central control system 200 may be configured to communicate with balloons 206 A to 206 I via a number of regional control systems 202 A to 202 C. These regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may be configured to receive communications and/or aggregate data from balloons in the respective geographic areas that they cover, and to relay the communications and/or data to central control system 200 . Further, regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may be configured to route communications from central control system 200 to the balloons in their respective geographic areas. For instance, as shown in FIG.
- regional control system 202 A may relay communications and/or data between balloons 206 A to 206 C and central control system 200

- balloons 206 A to 206 I are configured as downlink balloons.
- the balloons 206 A, 206 F, and 206 I that are configured as downlink balloons may relay communications from central control system 200 to other balloons in the balloon network, such as balloons 206 B to 206 E, 206 G, and 206 H.
- all balloons may function as downlink balloons.
- FIG. 2 shows multiple balloons configured as downlink balloons, it is also possible for a balloon network to include only one downlink balloon, or possibly even no downlink balloons.
- a regional control system 202 A to 202 C may in fact just be a particular type of ground-based station that is configured to communicate with downlink balloons (e.g., such as ground-based station 112 of FIG. 1 ).
- a control system may be implemented in conjunction with other types of ground-based stations (e.g., access points, gateways, etc.).
- the central control system 200 may coordinate certain mesh-networking functions for balloon network 204 .
- balloons 206 A to 206 I may send the central control system 200 certain state information, which the central control system 200 may utilize to determine the state of balloon network 204 .
- the state information from a given balloon may include location data, optical-link information (e.g., the identity of other balloons with which the balloon has established an optical link, the bandwidth of the link, wavelength usage and/or availability on a link, etc.), wind data collected by the balloon, and/or other types of information.
- the central control system 200 may aggregate state information from some or all of the balloons 206 A to 206 I in order to determine an overall state of the network.
- the overall state of the network may then be used to coordinate and/or facilitate certain mesh-networking functions such as determining lightpaths for connections.
- the central control system 200 may determine a current topology based on the aggregate state information from some or all of the balloons 206 A to 206 I.
- the topology may provide a picture of the current optical links that are available in balloon network and/or the wavelength availability on the links. This topology may then be sent to some or all of the balloons so that a routing technique may be employed to select appropriate lightpaths (and possibly backup lightpaths) for communications through the balloon network 204 .
- the central control system 200 may also coordinate certain station-keeping functions for balloon network 204 .
- the central control system 200 may input state information that is received from balloons 206 A to 206 I to an energy function, which may effectively compare the current topology of the network to a desired topology, and provide a vector indicating a direction of movement (if any) for each balloon, such that the balloons can move towards the desired topology.

In fact, in some embodiments, there may be no ground-based control systems. In such an embodiment, all network control and coordination functions may be implemented by the balloon network itself. For example, certain balloons may be configured to provide the same or similar functions as central control system 200 and/or regional control systems 202 A to 202 C.

- the buoyancy of the balloon 500 (and thus the altitude of the balloon) may be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the gas within envelope 502 . As the temperature of the gas within envelope 502 increases, the relative density of the gas within the envelope 502 decreases and the volume of the gas increases, which may result in a more buoyant (or upward) force on the balloon 500 , which may cause the altitude of the balloon to increase.
- the altitude of balloon 500 may be controlled by increasing or decreasing the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 .
- the temperature of the gas within the envelope of the balloon may be controlled using a first mode of operation by controlling the amount of solar energy that is absorbed by the gas within the envelope.
- white surfaces, or lightly colored surfaces absorb less solar energy than black surfaces, or darkly colored surfaces.
- the amount of solar energy absorbed by the gas within envelope 502 and thus the temperature of the gas, may be controlled if the absorptive/reflective properties of the surface of the envelope 502 that is facing the sun are adjustable.
- the absorptive/reflective properties of the surface of the envelope 502 may be adjusted, or varied, by rotating an envelope 502 having a first portion 502 a that allows for less transfer of solar energy to gas within the envelope (e.g., via decreased absorption and/or increased reflection of sunlight), than a second portion 502 b of the envelope.
- a first portion of the envelope 502 a could be colored white, or some other light color, which reflects more solar energy than a dark colored surface to help prevent the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 from rising.
- a second portion of the envelope 502 b could be colored black, or some other dark color, which absorbs more solar energy than a lightly colored surface to allow more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 502 , causing the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 to rise.
- the first portion of the envelope 502 a could be opaque or reflective, thereby preventing sunlight from passing into the envelope 502 , to help prevent the temperature of the gas within envelope 502 from rising.
- the second portion of the envelope 502 b could be translucent, or transmissive, allowing sunlight to pass through the second portion of envelope 502 b and thereby more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 502 , to cause the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 to rise.
- a non-symmetrically shaped balloon such that a first portion of the balloon may be oriented towards the sun that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope than when a second portion of the balloon is oriented towards the sun.
- balloon 1500 is shown having an envelope 1502 having a first portion 1502 a that has a large circular surface area that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 1502 than second portion 1502 b of envelope 1502 shown in FIG. 8B .
- FIG. 8B shows balloon envelope 1502 after it has been rotated 90 degrees from the position shown in FIG. 8A .
- a non-symmetrically shaped balloon may be used with a balloon having the same material used for its entire envelope surface area, or may be used in conjunction with a first portion of the balloon having different reflective, transmissive, or emissive properties than a second portion of the balloon.
- the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 of balloon 500 may be controlled.
- balloon 500 may be equipped with the ability to rotate the envelope 502 so that the first portion of the envelope 502 a or the second portion of the envelope 502 b is positioned facing the sun.
- the first portion of the envelope 502 a that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 502 may be positioned facing the sun to increase the temperature of the gas within envelope 502 (and increase the altitude of the balloon 500 ).
- the second portion of the envelope 502 b that allows for less solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 502 may be positioned facing the sun to decrease the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 (and decrease the altitude of the balloon 500 ).
- the temperature of the gas within the envelope 1502 of balloon 1500 may be controlled.
- Balloon 1500 may be equipped with the ability to rotate the envelope 1502 so that the first portion of the envelope 1502 a or the second portion of the envelope 1502 b is positioned facing the sun.
- the first portion of the envelope 1502 a that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 1502 may be positioned facing the sun to increase the temperature of the gas within envelope 1502 (and increase the altitude of the balloon 1500 ).
- the second portion of the envelope 1502 b that allows for less solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 1502 may be positioned facing the sun to decrease the temperature of the gas within the envelope 1502 (and decrease the altitude of the balloon 1500 ).
- first or second (or even third or more portions) of the envelope facing the sun may be desirable to have a certain amount of the first or second (or even third or more portions) of the envelope facing the sun.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B show a simplified scenario making the assumption that half of the balloon surface is exposed to the sun.
- envelope portion 1402 a allows more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 1402 than envelope portion 1402 b .
- Envelope portion 1402 a covers an area W, and in certain times of the day, e.g., when the sun is directly overhead, only a portion W′ of area W is directly exposed to sunlight.
- envelope portion 1402 b allows less solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 1402 than envelope portion 1402 a .
- Envelope portion 1402 covers an area B, and at certain times of the day, only a portion B′ of area B is directly exposed to sunlight.
- EnergyTotal (W′ ⁇ WT)+(B′ ⁇ BT).
- the amount of energy transferred to the gas within the envelope 1402 may be viewed as a function of area W′ and B′ that is directly exposed to the sun.
- the balloon envelope 1402 By rotating the balloon envelope 1402 so that the area of W′ is increased (and therefore the area B′ is decreased), the amount of solar energy transferred to the gas within envelope 1402 may be increased.
- the balloon envelope 1402 may be rotated so that the area W′ is decreased (and therefore the area B′ is increased).
- the above equation for EnergyTotal may also be simplified in that it assumes that the energy transmission factors WT is constant across sun-exposed area W′ and that energy transmission factor BT is also constant across sun-exposed area B′.
- the energy transmission factors WT and BT might vary across the surface of the envelope based on the angle of incidence at which the sunlight hits the envelope at a given point.
- the amount of solar energy transferred to gas in the envelope may be a function of the shape and size of the surface area that faces the sun, the size and shape of B′ and W′, the position and/or location of the sun relative to the envelope, the intensity of sunlight (which may be a function of the time of day, the month, the year), and/or the absorptive, reflective, and/or refractive properties of the materials with which B and W are constructed.
- the amount of solar energy absorbed or reflected by the balloon envelope may be controlled and/or adjusted by controlling and/or adjusting the amount of the portions of the balloon envelope that are facing the sun. In this manner, the energy absorption of the gas or air within the balloon may be controlled in a continuous fashion by altering the ratios of the portions of the balloon envelope facing the sun.
- FIGS. 5 and 5A show sharp dividing lines between the different portions of the envelope.
- the division between the first and section portions of the envelope could be gradual, allowing for a continuously decreasing amount of solar energy absorbed by the gas within the envelope as the darker or more transmissive portion of the envelope is rotated away from a position facing the sun to a position where the lighter or more opaque or reflective portion of the envelope is positioned facing the sun.
- the amount of solar energy that may be absorbed by the gas within the envelope may be slowly reduced.
- the portions of the balloon envelope could be made of materials that either absorb light or reflect light so as to change the temperature (and therefore the pressure and density of the gas) on the inside of the balloon, as well as materials that change their elasticity and expand and/or contract when they, or the gas within them, or heated and/or cooled.
- the size and the shape of the balloon could be modified to further allow for a more clear distinction between the first and second portions of the envelope.
- the envelope of the balloon could have a generally rectangular shape with two oppositely disposed major surfaces corresponding to the first and second portions of the envelope.
- the balloon 500 shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B , or balloon 1500 shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B may, but is not required to, further include a bladder, like the bladder 310 depicted in FIG. 3 .
- the bladder may be used to act as a type of ballast to further control the altitude of the balloon 500 or 1500 . As the bladder is filled with more air, the density of the gas within the envelope increases resulting in a decrease in the buoyant, upward force of the balloon, which also results in a decrease in the altitude of the balloon.
- the air may be removed, or bled, from the bladder, resulting in a lower density of the gas in the envelope and a higher buoyant, upward force of the balloon, which results in an increase in the altitude of the balloon.
- the natural environment and/or natural temperature changes to control the temperature of the gas and/or air within the balloon (in the balloon envelope or bladder) to control or change the altitude of the balloon.
- a heat sink which could take the form of a metal fin, or a fin made of a thermally conductive material such as Beryllium Copper
- the fin could be positioned below the balloon and thermally coupled to the gas within the balloon (via a rod, for example).
- the heat sink when it is desired to cool the gas within the balloon (in the bladder or envelope) more quickly, the heat sink could be deployed and the metal fin extended into the atmosphere where heat from within the balloon may be transferred to the atmosphere.
- the heat sink or fin when it desired to cool the air or gas within the balloon more slowly, the heat sink or fin could be retracted so that less heat is transferred from the gas or air within the balloon to the atmosphere.
- the heat sink or fin may be extended when it is desired to cool the air or gas within the balloon more quickly, and the heat sink or fin may be retracted when it is desired to cool the air or gas within the balloon more slowly.
- the rotation of the envelope may be accomplished by using an offset fan or fans positioned on and extending from one of the components of the balloon 500 .
- the fan or fans may be attached to a retractable arm or support when not needed for operation.
- a directional spigot of compressed air, or compressed air directed towards a thrust plate or thrust deflector (retractable and/or adjustable if desired) positioned on and extending from a component of the balloon 500 could also be used to achieve the desired rotation of the envelope.
- a fin or wing that is manoeuvrable may be used to rotate, or control the rotation, of the balloon.
- the envelope 502 of the balloon 500 may be rotatable about the payload, the cut-down, or the skirt.
- the envelope 502 may be rotatably connected using a gimbal support, or spherical roller bearing, thereby allowing three degrees of freedom, i.e., roll, pitch, and yaw at the point of connection.
- the rotatable connection could be made using any of a variety of bearings, including a plain bearing, a friction bearing, or roller bearing, or even an air bearing.
- the rotation of the envelope 502 may be controlled by a motor, or servomotor.
- the rotation of the envelope 500 may be further controlled by an indexing mechanism.
- Such an indexing mechanism could include a ratchet and pawl indexing mechanism that allows for a toothed ratchet or gear to rotate freely in one direction, but that is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a pawl, where the pawl could be spring loaded.
- a roller ratchet or notched wheel could also be used for indexing.
- the envelope of the balloon could be controlled to rotate a desired portion of the envelope towards the sun.
- the positioning of the desired portion of the envelope towards the sun could be performed by the balloon that the envelope is attached to, for instance using processor 312 and memory 314 to control rotatable connection of the envelope.
- the positioning of the desired portion of the balloon could be controlled remotely by another balloon or ground- or space-based station.
- positioning of the envelope could be adjusted as the sun moved to point the desired portion of the envelope towards the sun. In other words, adjustments could be performed with an effort to maintain the positioning of the desired portion of the envelope towards the sun. Or the positioning of the desired portion of the envelope could be continuously adjusted to account for the continual movement of the sun.
- the altitude of the balloon may be controlled by rotating the balloon so that desired portions of the envelope are facing the sun, thereby controlling of the amount of solar energy that is absorbed by the gas within the envelope of the balloon.
- solar energy to control the altitude of the balloon may be advantageous because less energy may be consumed rotating the balloon into proper position relative to the sun, than using other methods of altitude control including inflating/deflating the balloon envelope or bladder, or burning hydrogen to heat the gas within the balloon.
- a second mode for controlling altitude should be available during the night.
- a second mode of operation used to control the altitude of the balloon at night is by introducing additional lifting gas into the balloon envelope or bladder. In this manner, gas may be pumped into or out of the balloon envelope or bladder to control the altitude of the balloon at night.
- Altimeters or other devices may be used determine the altitude and/or rate of descent and provide for switching from a first mode of altitude control using solar energy, to a second mode of altitude control using inflation/deflation of the balloon envelope or bladder with gas, or some combination thereof.
- the payload may include one or more solar cells to store energy that can be used for altitude control during the night.
- solar energy stored during the day may be used to control the altitude of the balloon by pumping gas into, or out of, the envelope of the balloon, or the bladder of the balloon.
- the balloon envelope may need to expand to allow the gas to become less dense and to provide a more buoyant upward force.
- the balloon envelope 902 of balloon 900 may expand.
- the balloon envelope 902 may expand from an envelope size 902 D to an envelope size 902 E.
- the bladder 910 of balloon 910 may also expand as gas is pumped into the bladder from, as an example, bladder size 910 A to bladder size 910 B, and even to bladder size 910 C.
- the first mode of altitude control and the second mode of altitude control discussed above are not two different mutually exclusive modes.
- the first mode of altitude control it may be desirable to use the first mode of altitude control as much as possible, but this may need to be augmented by also using the second mode of altitude control. For example, from 11 am to 1 pm, when the sun is mostly directly above the balloon, the second mode of altitude control may need to be mostly used.
- the heat from the sun used in the first mode of altitude control may not provide as much vertical travel as desired so it may need to be to be augmented even at 3 pm (which is about the best time for this) with the pump used in the second mode of altitude control.
- the exterior shape of the envelope when inflating the balloon envelope for altitude control, it may be desirable to allow the exterior shape of the envelope to expand as the temperature of the gas within the envelope is increased, and to have the exterior shape return to its normal shape when the temperature of the gas within the envelope is decreased.
- the use of memory metal may be used for the exterior of the balloon envelope to allow the balloon to expand when the temperature of the gas within the envelope is increased, and return to its former exterior shape when the temperature of the gas within the envelope is decreased.
- the exterior shape of the envelope may change back and forth from its normal exterior shape to an expanded shape.
- FIG. 9 shows a method 1200 that is provided that includes the step 1202 of determining a location of a balloon with respect to the sun, wherein the balloon has an envelope with a gas contained within the envelope and a payload connected to the envelope, and the envelope has a first portion that has a first absorptive or reflective property with respect to allowing solar energy to be transferred to the gas within the envelope, and a second portion that has a second absorptive or reflective property that is different from the first absorptive or reflective property.
- the method 1200 further includes the step 1204 of rotating the envelope of the balloon to position the first portion or second portion of the envelope facing the sun.
- the method 1200 may also provide an additional mode of altitude control by including the step 1206 of admitting or releasing gas or air into a bladder positioned within the envelope to raise or lower the altitude of the balloon, or admitting or releasing gas or air into the balloon envelope to raise or lower the altitude of the balloon.
- Other techniques known in the art to properly position a desired portion of the envelope towards the sun may be reasonably used within the context of the disclosure.
- the non-transitory computer readable medium could be, for example, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a flash memory, a cache memory, one or more magnetically encoded discs, one or more optically encoded discs, or any other form of non-transitory data storage.
- the non-transitory computer readable medium could also be distributed among multiple data storage elements, which could be remotely located from each other.
- the computing device that executes the stored instructions could be a computing device, such as the processor 312 illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the computing device that executes the stored instructions could be another computing device, such as a server in a server network, or a ground-based station.
- the non-transitory computer readable medium may store instructions executable by the processor 312 to perform various functions.
- the functions could include the determination of a location of a first balloon, and the positioning of a portion of the envelope of the balloon in relation to the sun.
- the functions could also include pumping gas or air into or out of the balloon envelope or bladder to control the altitude of the balloon during the night, or other desired times.
