Abstract
A user installs a hotspot alert application on their mobile device. The application employs the location technology of the user device to transmit the location of the device, and thus the location of the user. The location can be transmitted to a server located in a hotspot tracking system. By establishing the location of the user, the server may search for hotspots on a database stored on the system. The server establishes the dimensions of a hotspot zone around the user's location and transmits the hotspots and the zone dimensions to the application on the user device. The application monitors the location of the user device and deliver's configured alerts to the user when approaching a hotspot. When the device leaves a zone or remains idle for a configured amount of time, the device requests and receives an updated zone of hotspots.

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to mobile hotspot tracking, and more particularly to delivering server-controlled hotspot zones to a mobile device.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Location data from a mobile device can be used for numerous applications. There are applications that use the location data for locating friends, playing games, and assisting a user with directions. The location data can also be used to alert a user when the user and the user's device are in the vicinity of a hotspot. A hotspot is any business, institution, or location that would be of interest to a user. For example, a user may choose to be alerted every time the user nears a particular store or restaurant, or the server may identify a hotspot as a nearby store that the user frequents and that is currently offering a promotion or coupon.
[0003] Unfortunately, hotspot information is constantly changing. New stores are built, promotions are updated, and the user location changes. A user may desire constantly updated hotspot information, but the mobile devices are not typically capable of maintaining a database of all the hotspots and hotspot marketing data. Trying to maintain this data may have an adverse effect on the data storage capacity of the device, the battery life of the device, the required data transmission capacity, or other aspects of operating a mobile device.
[0004] Conversely, tracking the location of the user device by the server and continually providing updates with hotspot data as the mobile device changes locations also adversely affects the battery, storage capacity, and data transmission capacity of the device.
[0005] Thus, a need in the art exists for systems and methods that improve upon one or more of the above-described limitations.
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
[0006] An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method for delivering server-controlled hotspot zones to a mobile device. A user installs a hotspot alert application ("HAA") on their mobile device. The HAA employs the location technology of the user device to determine a location of user device. The location can be transmitted to a server located in a hotspot tracking system ("HTS"). By establishing the location of the user, the HTS may search for hotspots on a database stored on the system. The HTS
establishes the dimensions of a hotspot zone substantially surrounding the user's location. The HTS
transmits the hotspots and the zone dimensions to the HAA. The HAA monitors the location of the user device and may deliver configured alerts to the user when approaching a hotspot.
Alternatively, the HAA may notify the server when the user is approaching a hotspot, and the server may determine whether to alert the user. When the device leaves a zone or remains idle for a configured amount of time, the device requests and receives an updated zone of hotspots.

Overview
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
Overview
[0012] The exemplary embodiments provide a hotspot alert application ("HAA") that can utilize a user's location data for delivering server-controlled hotspot zones to a mobile device.
A user installs an HAA on their mobile device. The HAA can provide a user interface for entering configuration information. The HAA employs the Global Positioning System ("GPS") location technology or other location identifying technology of the user device to transmit the location of the device, and thus the location of the user. This location can be transmitted to a server located in a hotspot tracking system ("HTS"). The HAA might gather the location data 3b directly from the device operating system, or the HAA might request the location from another location-based application operating on the phone.

This location can be transmitted to a server located in a hotspot tracking system ("HTS"). The HAA might gather the location data 3b directly from the device operating system, or the HAA might request the location from another location-based application operating on the phone.
[0013] The HTS receives the location data from the user device and identifies the geographical location of the device. The HTS then accesses a database for hotspot information in the vicinity of the user device. The hotspot information may be anything that would be of interest to the user. The category of hotspot information accessed might be user configured or may be selected by the HTS server based on the user's prior activities, interests, or suggestions.
Examples of hotspots that may be identified by the server for transmitting to the user device might include, but would not be limited to, restaurants, stores, or other businesses frequented by the user, businesses currently offering a sale or promotion, 3c businesses currently offering an electronic coupon, tourist attractions, museums, friends identified by their devices, or any other identifiable entity in which the user may be interested.

[0014] The HTS identifies the hotspots in the user's vicinity and uses the density or quality of the hotspot information to establish the size and boundaries of the hotspot zone to transmit to the user device. The HTS may limit the size of the hotspot zone to prevent any adverse effects caused by transmitting a quantity of data that is too large for the user device and the system to operate efficiently. For example, if the amount of hotspot data transmitted is too large, the data may require enough capacity on the data storage unit of the device to affect the normal operating of the device. Alternatively, if the size of the hotspot zone is too small, the HTS may be forced to transmit a new zone of hotspots to the device too frequently to be practical. For example, if the hotspot zone data were transmitted too frequently, it might consume the battery life of the device.
[0015] The HTS may additionally prioritize the hotspot data. Based on user input or an analysis of user historical data, such as purchasing history or website usage, the HTS may provide a ranked list of the hotspots to the user device. This ranked list may be used by the HAA to determine when or how to alert the user to the proximity of a particular hotspot. For example, the HAA may display all hotspots on a map of the zone, but only alert the user when they are approaching one of the top ten ranked hotspots.
[0016] The HAA on the user device receives the zone boundaries and the hotspot information. The HAA may be an application running on the user device that is configured for any type of hotspot locating activity. For instance, the HAA may be an application that is configured to alert a user to restaurants or stores that are a favorite of the user or are currently offering a coupon. The HAA may alert a user to museums or tourist attractions.
The HAA
may alert a user of other devices operating in the area that may be contacts of the user. The HAA may be focused on alerting a user to any other business or entity that the user or the server configures the HAA to monitor.

may alert a user of other devices operating in the area that may be contacts of the user. The HAA may be focused on alerting a user to any other business or entity that the user or the server configures the HAA to monitor.
[0017] After receiving the hotspot and zone information, the HAA may display the information on a map or other grid via the user interface of the HAA.
Additionally or alternatively, the HAA may display the information to the user in any other format that can convey the information, such as a simple listing of each hotspot and the distance away from the user that each hotspot is located. The HAA may further provide a route to the hotspot upon request from the user.
Additionally or alternatively, the HAA may display the information to the user in any other format that can convey the information, such as a simple listing of each hotspot and the distance away from the user that each hotspot is located. The HAA may further provide a route to the hotspot upon request from the user.
[0018] If displaying the information on a map view, the HAA may expand or collapse the data displayed to the user depending on the density of the data. For example, if a large number of hotspots are located in a localized area, the HAA may group hotspots together and show the grouping in a single icon or notation. An example of this may be a shopping complex that contains a quantity of hotspots too great to display on a user device. The display may simply show a shopping complex notation and list the number of hotspots contained at that location or any other manner of representing the group of hotspots. As the user approaches the dense hotspot, the grouped hotspot may expand to show the individual hotspots in that area.
[0019] After receiving the hotspot information, the mobile device continues to monitor the location of the user device. If the device approaches a hotspot, the HAA
may perform any alert function configured by the user. For instance, the HAA may alert a user when the user device is within a configured range of the hotspot, such as within a block of the hotspot.
The alert may additionally take any configured form desired by the user. In exemplary embodiments, the HAA may use the alert internally or may provide an audible alert, a vibration, a visible alert, such as showing the hotspot details on the display of the user device, an e-mail, or any other configurable alerting procedure. In an alternate embodiment, the HAA may alert the HTS that the device is approaching a hotspot. The HTS may perform any alert function configured by the user or store the alert for later use. The HTS may send an alert to the HAA or to another location. For example, the HTS may send an email, push notification, text message, or another communication to the user.
may perform any alert function configured by the user. For instance, the HAA may alert a user when the user device is within a configured range of the hotspot, such as within a block of the hotspot.

The HTS may send an alert to the HAA or to another location. For example, the HTS may send an email, push notification, text message, or another communication to the user.
[0020] The HAA can be embodied as a stand-alone application program or as a companion program to a web browser, for example, as a companion program to a Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 ("HTML5") compliant web browser or other type of web browser having messaging and storage capabilities. While certain embodiments are described in which parts of the HAA are implemented in software, it will be appreciated that one or more acts or functions of the HAA may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems.
[0021] Users may, in appropriate circumstances, limit or otherwise affect the operation of the features disclosed in the specification. For example, users may be given an initial opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of the collection or use of certain data or the activation of certain features. In addition, a user may change the manner in which the features are employed, including for situations in which a user may have concerns regarding his privacy.
Instructions may be provided to notify the users regarding policies about the use of information, including personally identifiable information and receipt information, and manners in which the users may affect such use of information.

[0022] Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail. Figure 1 is a block diagram depicting an operating environment 100 for a hotspot alert application ("HAA"), in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
[0023] Referring to Figure 1, the exemplary operating environment 100 includes a user network device 110 associated with a user 101, a hotspot marketing system 150, and a hotspot tracking system ("HTS") 160. The user device 110 may be a mobile device, (for example, notebook computer, tablet computer, netbook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), video game device, GPS locator device, cellular telephone, smartphone, or other mobile device), or other appropriate technology that may include or may be coupled to a web browser application module 112 or other communication module 117. The user device 110 may employ a host CPU 116 to process the operations of the user device 110.
[0024] In certain exemplary embodiments, the web browser application 112 is an HTML5 compliant web browser. HTML5 compliant web browsers include a cross-document messaging application programming interface (API) and a local storage API that previous HTML versions did not have. The cross-document messaging API of HTML5 compliant web browsers enables documents, such as web pages, to communicate with each other. For example, a first document can send a message to a second document requesting information.
In response, the second document can send a message including the requested information to the first document. The local storage API of HTML5 compliant web browsers enables the web browser to store information on a client device upon which the web browser is installed or is executing, such as the user device 110. Websites also can employ the local storage API
to store information on a client device. Other web browsers having cross-document messaging and/or local storage capabilities also may be used in certain exemplary embodiments.
In response, the second document can send a message including the requested information to the first document. The local storage API of HTML5 compliant web browsers enables the web browser to store information on a client device upon which the web browser is installed or is executing, such as the user device 110. Websites also can employ the local storage API
to store information on a client device. Other web browsers having cross-document messaging and/or local storage capabilities also may be used in certain exemplary embodiments.
[0025] The user 101 can use the web browser application 112 to view, download, upload, or otherwise access documents or web pages via a distributed network 105. The network 105 includes a wired or wireless telecommunication system or device by which network devices (including devices 110, 150, and 160) can exchange data. For example, the network 105 can include a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), an intranet, an Internet, storage area network (SAN), personal area network (PAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a cellular or other mobile communication network, Bluetooth, NFC, or any combination thereof or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates the communication of signals, data, and/or messages. Throughout the discussion of exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the terms "data" and "information" are used interchangeably herein to refer to text, images, audio, video, or any other form of information that can exist in a computer based environment.
[0026] The web browser application 112 can interact with web servers (or other computing devices) connected to the network 105, web server 151 of the hotspot marketing system 150, and the web server 161 of the HT S 160.

LATTITUDE.
[0046] In block 220, the HTS 160 gathers hotspot location data and transmits the location data to the user device 110. The details of this step will be discussed in further detail with reference to method 220 of Figure 3.
[0047] In block 225, the user device 110 incorporates the hotspot data into the user interface of the HAA 115. The HAA 115 may display the information on a map or other grid via the user interface of the HAA. Additionally or alternatively, the HAA 115 may display the information to the user in any other format that can convey the information, such as a simple listing of each hotspot and the distance away from the user that each hotspot is located. The HAA 115 may further provide a route to a hotspot upon request from the user.
The user 101 may elect to operate the HAA 115 in the foreground of the host operating system and provide substantially instant alerts as the user 101 moves through the hotspot zone. The HAA 115 may alternatively operate in the background of the operating system and store the hotspot alerts for later access by the user 101.
The user 101 may elect to operate the HAA 115 in the foreground of the host operating system and provide substantially instant alerts as the user 101 moves through the hotspot zone. The HAA 115 may alternatively operate in the background of the operating system and store the hotspot alerts for later access by the user 101.
[0048] In block 230, the HAA 115 monitors the location of the user device 110 as it moves through the hotspot zone. The HAA 115 compares the location of the user device 110 to known hotspots identified on the most recent hotspot zone. The HAA 115 continually or intermittently determines if the user device is within a configured distance from a hotspot.
[0049] In block 235, the HAA 115 determines if a hotspot is being approached. For example, if a user 101 is walking through a shopping district with the user device 110 and comes within a specified distance of a hotspot, such as one block, the HAA 115 recognizes the approached hotspot. If a hotspot is being approached, the method 200 follows the "YES"
branch of block 235 to block 237. If no hotspot is being approached, the method 200 follows the "NO" branch of block 235 to 230.
branch of block 235 to block 237. If no hotspot is being approached, the method 200 follows the "NO" branch of block 235 to 230.
[0050] Following the "NO" branch of block 235 to block 230, the HAA 115 continues to monitor the location of the user device 110 as previously described.
[0051] Following the "YES" branch of block 235 to block 237, a hotspot alert is triggered when the user device 110 moves within a configured range of a hotspot. In exemplary embodiments, the HAA 115 may use the alert internally or may provide an audible alert, a vibration, a visible alert, such as showing the hotspot details on the display of the user device, an e-mail, or any other configurable alerting procedure.
[0052] In an alternate embodiment, the HAA 115 may alert the HTS 160 that the device is approaching a hotspot. The HTS 160 may perform any alert function configured by the user or store the alert for later use. The HTS 160 may send an alert to the HAA 115 or to another location. For example, the HTS 160 may send an email, push notification, text message, or another communication to the user.
[0053] In an alternative embodiment, the HAA 115 may be configured to alert the user 101 of only the higher priority hotspots. As discussed in the details of method 220 of Figure 3, the hotspot data may be prioritized by the HTS 160. The HAA 115 may use the priority of the hotspot data to determine which hotspots will trigger an alert to the user 101. For example, the user 101 may desire to limit the alerts to the 10 highest priority hotspots in a given zone. Alternatively, the user 101 may configure the HAA 115 to alert the user 101 to every hotspot in the zone.
[0054] In block 240, if the user device 110 approaches a configured distance from the boundary of the hotspot zone, the method 200 follows the "YES" branch of block 240 to block 220. If the user device 110 has not approached a configured boundary of the hotspot zone, the method 200 follows the "NO" branch of block 240 to block 245. In an alternate embodiment of the application, the HAA 115 may require the user device 110 to completely exit the boundaries of the hotspot zone to follow the "YES" branch of block 240.
[0055] Following the "YES" branch of block 240 to block 220, the method requests and receive a refreshed hotspot zone. As the user device 110 has left the boundaries of the previous hotspot zone, the HAA 115 will have no hotspot data to display to the user 101 or monitor for alerts. A new hotspot zone with a new list of hotspots is transmitted to the user device 110.
[0056] Following the "NO" branch of block 240 to block 245, the user device determines if the user device 110 has received a new hotspot zone in a configured amount of time. For instance, if a user device 110 has remained in one location for a configured time or has not encountered any hotspots for a configured time, the method 200 will determine that the user device 110 is idle and follow the "YES" branch of block 245 to block 220. A new hotspot zone with a new list of hotspots is transmitted to the user device 110. The idle time required to trigger the "YES" branch of block 245 is configurable by the user 101 or the HAA 115. For example, the idle time required might be one hour, one day, one week, or any other time that is reasonable based upon the activities of the user 101.
[0057] If the device has not remained idle and has received a new hotspot zone within the configured time, the method 200 follows the "NO" branch of block 245 to block 230. The device will continue monitoring the location of the user device 110.
[0058] The method 200 continues until the user 101 deactivates the HAA 115 or the user device is shut down.
[0059] Figure 3 is a flow chart depicting a method 220 for generating and transmitting hotspots to a user device, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
[0060] With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in block 305 of method 220, the establishes and maintains current marketing and location data of hotspots that relate to a user 101. The hotspot information may be anything would be of interest to the user.
The category of hotspot information accessed might be user configured or may be selected by the HTS
server 161 based on the prior activities, interests, or suggestions of the user 101. Examples of hotspots that may be identified by the server 161 for transmitting to the user device 110 might include, but would not be limited to, restaurants, stores or other businesses frequented by the user 101, businesses currently offering a sale or promotion, businesses currently offering an electronic coupon, tourist attractions, museums, friends identified by their devices, or any other identifiable entity in which the user 101 may be interested.

[0061] The HTS 160 may access hotspot data from any system that may be polled by the HTS 160 to gather hotspot information. For example, the hotspot data may be gathered from a hotspot marketing system 150. A hotspot marketing system 150 may be the marketing system of a product manufacturer or a service provider. The hotspot marketing system 150 may be a social network system of a user that can provide preferences and historical data of a user's activities, a coupon aggregator or provider, a mapping system, or any other service or system that may provide information that the HTS 160 can use to define a hotspot zone and prioritize the hotspots.
[0062] In block 310, the HTS 160 receives the location of the user device 110. The HTS
160 stores the location of the user device 110 in the user account. In block 315, the HTS 160 identifies the hotspots in the vicinity. The HTS 160 may access the database maintained for the account of the user 101. The distance of each possible hotspot from the location of the user 101 is calculated and stored.
160 stores the location of the user device 110 in the user account. In block 315, the HTS 160 identifies the hotspots in the vicinity. The HTS 160 may access the database maintained for the account of the user 101. The distance of each possible hotspot from the location of the user 101 is calculated and stored.
[0063] In block 320, the HTS 160 uses the density or quality of the hotspot information to establish the size of the hotspot zone to transmit to the user device 110.
The HTS 160 may limit the size of the hotspot zone to prevent any adverse effects caused by transmitting a quantity of data that is too large for the user device 110 and the system to operate efficiently.
For example, if the amount of hotspot data transmitted is too large, the data may require enough capacity on the data storage unit 113 of the user device 110 to affect the normal operation of the user device 110. Alternatively, if the size of the hotspot zone is too small then the HTS 160 may be forced to transmit a new zone of hotspots to the user device 110 too frequently to be practical. For example, if the hotspot zone data were transmitted too frequently, it might consume the battery life of the user device 110.
The HTS 160 may limit the size of the hotspot zone to prevent any adverse effects caused by transmitting a quantity of data that is too large for the user device 110 and the system to operate efficiently.
For example, if the amount of hotspot data transmitted is too large, the data may require enough capacity on the data storage unit 113 of the user device 110 to affect the normal operation of the user device 110. Alternatively, if the size of the hotspot zone is too small then the HTS 160 may be forced to transmit a new zone of hotspots to the user device 110 too frequently to be practical. For example, if the hotspot zone data were transmitted too frequently, it might consume the battery life of the user device 110.
[0064] The size of the hotspot zone around the current location of the user device 110 can be determined based on the density or quality of the hotspot information. In an exemplary embodiment, the size of the hotspot zone may be established to encompass a configured number of hotspots in the proximity of the user device 110. For example, the size of the hotspot zone can be configured to encompass the specified number of hotspots that are closest to the user device 110 or that provide the highest priority hotspots around the user device 110. Thus, in an area of high concentration of available hotspots, the hotspot zone may be relatively small to capture the specified number of hotspots.
Alternatively, in an area of lower concentration of available hotspots, the hotspot zone may be relatively large to capture the specified number of hotspots. Additionally, the size of the hotspot zone can take any suitable shape to encompass the specified hotspots.
Alternatively, in an area of lower concentration of available hotspots, the hotspot zone may be relatively large to capture the specified number of hotspots. Additionally, the size of the hotspot zone can take any suitable shape to encompass the specified hotspots.
[0065] The HTS 160 may additionally prioritize the hotspot data. Based on input of the user 101 or an analysis of historical data, such as purchasing history or website usage of the user 101, the HTS 160 may provide a ranked list of the hotspots to the user device 110. For example, the HTS 160 may be able to determine that a user 101 prefers a certain store or restaurant and raffl( it higher than an alternative restaurant even if the alternative restaurant is closer to the user 101 location. Thus, if the user 101 limits the number of hotspot alerts in a given zone, a lower ranked hotspot may be ignored in favor of a nearby, higher ranked hotspot.
[0066] Another example of a prioritizing factor might be the value or quantity of coupons or offers being marketed by a hotspot. For example, the HAA 115 may not alert a user 101 to a nearby hotspot if a better promotion is being offered by a neighboring business.
[0067] If displaying the information on a map view, the HAA 115 may expand or collapse the data displayed to the user depending on the density of the data. For example, if a large number of hotspots are located in a localized area, the HAA 115 may group hotspots together and show the grouping in a single icon or notation. An example of this may be a shopping complex that contains a quantity of hotspots too great to display on a user device. The display may show a shopping complex notation and list the number of hotspots contained at that location or any other manner of representing the group of hotspots. As the user 101 approaches the dense hotspot, the grouped hotspot may expand to show the individual hotspots in that area. For example, if the user 101 is between two shopping malls or between two cities, a single hotspot may be provided for each mall or each city, respectively. Then, as the user approaches one of the malls or one of the cities, the collapsed hotspot for that mall or city expands to show all hotspots (or a specified number of hotspots) at that location.
[0068] In certain exemplary embodiments, the HTS 160 applies the extracted data to a machine learning algorithm or another statistical model to determine the most effective ranking system. For example, a machine learning algorithm can be performed on the hotspots generated for one or more users to learn the ranking system that produces results having the highest usage rates. The machine learning algorithm can be updated periodically.
[0069] In block 325, the HTS 160 transmits the hotspot zone dimensions, the hotspot identities and locations, and any associated hotspot marketing information to the HAA 115.
The HTS 160 may additionally transmit the priority ranking of each of the hotspots for use by the HAA 115.
The HTS 160 may additionally transmit the priority ranking of each of the hotspots for use by the HAA 115.
[0070] From block 325, the method 220 proceeds to block 225 with reference to Figure 2.
