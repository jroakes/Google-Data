Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of data mining, and particularly to a software system and associated methods for identifying relevant terms from a large text database of unstructured information, such as the World Wide Web (WWW). More specifically, the present invention relates to the automatic and iterative recognition of relevant terms by association mining and refinement of co-occurrences using hypertext link metadata.
- WWW World Wide Web
- WWW World Wide Web
- search engines play an important role in furnishing desired information to the end users, the organization of the information lacks structure and consistency. Web spiders crawl web pages and index them to serve the search engines. As the web spiders visit web pages, they could look for, and learn pieces of information that would otherwise remain undetected.
- Bibliometrics involves the study of the world of authorship and citations. It measures the co-citation strength, which is a measure of the similarity between two technical papers on the basis of their common citations. Statistical techniques are used to compute this measures. In typical Bibliometric situations the citations and authorship are explicit and do not need to be mined. One of the limitations of the Bibliometrics is that it cannot be used to extract buried information in the text.
- HITS Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search
- a common technique for accessing textual materials is by means of a “keyword” combination, generally with boolean connections between the words or terms.
- This searching technique suffers from several drawbacks. First, the use of this technique is limited to text and is not usable for other types of material. Second, in order to develop a searchable database of terms, the host computer must usually download the entire documents, which is a time-consuming process, and does not normally provide an association between relevant terms.
- the system and methods enable the automatic and iterative recognition of relevant terms by association mining and refinement of co-occurrences using hypertext link metadata, such as link annotations.
- a computer program product is provided as an automatic mining system to identify a set of relevant terms from a large text database of unstructured information, such as the World Wide Web (WWW), with a high degree of confidence.
- WWW World Wide Web
- One feature of the present invention is to design metrics that address the learning process of relevant terms by finding associations among terms that appear as link annotations, and to minimize the association errors resulting from one or more of the following sources:
- the present automatic mining system includes a computer program product such as a software package, which is comprised of a metadata extractor, a document vector module, an association module, and a filtering module.
- the automatic mining system further includes a database for storing the mined sets of relevant terms. The set of relevant terms is continuously and iteratively broadened by the automatic mining system.
- the automatic mining system allows the users to conduct searches expeditiously on all types of linked annotations.
- the system is provided with a novel metric that can be used to sift strongly relevant terms from the association mining result, as well as the standard metrics, confidence and support, used by the data mining community.
- the automatic mining system scans the downloaded hypertext link annotations in the downloaded pages, rather than the entire body of the documents for related information. As a result, the crawler is not required to provide a relatively lengthy download of the document content, and the automatic mining system minimizes the download and processing time.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary operating environment in which the automatic mining system of the present invention can be used.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the automatic mining system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 is a high level flow chart that illustrates the operation of a preferred embodiment of the automatic mining system of FIG. 2 .
- Crawler or spider A program that automatically explores the World Wide Web by retrieving a document and recursively retrieving some or all the documents that are linked to it.
- Gateway A standard interface that specifies how a web server launches and interacts with external programs (such as a database search engine) in response to requests from clients.
- Hypertext System A computer-based informational system in which documents (and possibly other types of data entities) are linked together via hypertext links to form a user-navigable web.
- Hypertext Link A reference link from some point in one hypertext document to another point in another document or another place in the same document. When a user activates the link (e.g. by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser will display the destination of the link.
- HTML Hypertext Markup Language
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol: Standard WWW client-server protocol used for the exchange of information (such as HTML documents, and client requests for such documents) between a web browser and a web server.
- HTTP includes several different types of messages that can be sent from the client to the server to request different types of server actions.
- Internet A collection of interconnected public and private computer networks that are linked together with routers by a set of standards protocols to form a global, distributed network.
- Metadata (or annotation) of a hypertext link Description of a hypertext link provided by the page that contains it. Ideally, it describes the concept of the linked page. This description may be found, for example, in elements around a hypertext link's anchor tags. Such elements may include attribute values or free text surrounding the hypertext link. Of these elements, anchor texts seem to be the most descriptive and frequent, and are believed to constitute serious candidates for use as annotations.
- Server A software program or a computer that responds to requests from a web browser by returning (“serving”) web documents.
- SGML Standard Generalized Markup Language
- SGML A generic markup language for representing documents.
- SGML is an International Standard that describes the relationship between a document's content and its structure.
- SGML allows document-based information to be shared and re-used across applications and computer platforms in an open, vendor-neutral format.
- SGML is defined in “ISO 8879:1986 Information processing—Text and office systems—Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)”, an ISO standard produced by JTC 1/SC 18 and amended by “Amendment 1:1988”.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- SMIL Synchronization Multimedia Integration Language
- CML Compute Markup Language
- MML Machine Markup Language
- Web browser A software program that allows users to request and read hypertext documents. The browser gives some means of viewing the contents of web documents and of navigating from one document to another.
- Web document or page A collection of data available on the World Wide Web and identified by a URL.
- a web page is a file written in HTML and stored on a web server. It is possible for the server to generate pages dynamically in response to a request from the user.
- a web page can be in any format that the browser or a helper application can display. The format is transmitted as part of the headers of the response as a MIME type, e.g. “text/html”, “image/gif”.
- An HTML web page will typically refer to other web pages and Internet resources by including hypertext links.
- Web Site A database or other collection of inter-linked hypertext documents (“web documents” or “web pages”) and associated data entities, which is accessible via a computer network, and which forms part of a larger, distributed informational system such as the WWW.
- a web site corresponds to a particular Internet domain name, and includes the content of a particular organization.
- Other types of web sites may include, for example, a hypertext database of a corporate “intranet” (i.e., an internal network which uses standard Internet protocols), or a site of a hypertext system that uses document retrieval protocols other than those of the WWW.
- WWW World Wide Web
- FIG. 1 portrays the overall environment in which the automatic mining system 10 according to the present invention can be used.
- the automatic mining system 10 includes a software or computer program product which is typically embedded within, or installed on a host server 15 .
- the automatic mining system 10 can be saved on a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices.
- the cloud-like communication network 20 is comprised of communication lines and switches connecting servers such as servers 25 , 27 , to gateways such as gateway 30 .
- the servers 25 , 27 and the gateway 30 provide the communication access to the WWW Internet.
- Users, such as remote internet users are represented by a variety of computers such as computers 35 , 37 , 39 , and can query the automatic mining system 10 for the desired information.
- the host server 15 is connected to the network 20 via a communications link such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link.
- the servers 25 , 27 can be connected via high speed Internet network lines 44 , 46 to other computers and gateways.
- the servers 25 , 27 provide access to stored information such as hypertext or web documents indicated generally at 50 , 55 , 60 .
- the hypertext documents 50 , 55 , 60 most likely include embedded hypertext links to other locally stored pages, and hypertext links 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 to other webs sites or documents 55 , 60 that are stored by various web servers such as the server 27 .
- the automatic mining system 10 includes a computer program product such as a software package, which is generally comprised of a metadata extractor 90 , a document vector module 100 , an association module 110 , and a filtering module 120 .
- the automatic mining system 10 further includes a database 130 for storing the mined sets of relevant terms. In an alternative design, the database 130 does not form part of the automatic mining system 10 .
- a crawler that resides in the host server 15 , visits and downloads every web page or document d i on the WWW at periodic intervals, for example about once a month. During such visits, the crawler downloads all the hypertext links or hyperlinks in the document d i to the automatic mining system 10 .
- the hypertext links can be expressed, for example, in HTML. While the crawler is capable of downloading the entire content of the document d i to the host server 15 , in the exemplary embodiment described herein, the automatic mining system 10 scans the downloaded hypertext links, rather than the entire body of the documents for related information. As a result, the crawler is not required to provide a relatively lengthy download of the document content, and consequently the automatic mining system 10 minimizes the download and processing time.
- the document d 1 contains the following five exemplary hypertext links or annotations:
- the document d 2 contains the following exemplary hypertext link or annotation:
- the document d 3 contains the following five exemplary hypertext links or annotations:
- the operation of the automatic mining system 10 is represented by a process 200 (FIG. 3) that starts at block or step 205 by having the metadata extractor 90 identify all the hypertext link metadata in the document d i .
- the hypertext link metadata are extracted and listed as follows:
- the automatic mining system 10 proceeds to block 210 for the document vector module 100 to create a document vector for each HTML document.
- the vector module 100 does not list the duplicate terms c n,m or the frequency of occurrence of all the terms c n,m . Rather, the association module 110 measures the number of documents that contain the terms c n,m . regardless of the frequency of occurrence of the terms c n,m within a single document. Such measurement enables the association module 110 to perform the necessary statistical analyses. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, the vector module 100 takes into account the frequency of occurrence of the terms c n,m within individual documents. In the examples above, the document vectors will be as follows:
- the association module 110 discovers the association rules from all the document vectors with a certain degree of confidence and support.
- the association mining rules are discovered by the association module 110 solely or primarily from the hypertext links and not to the entire content of the documents d i . It should however be understood that in other applications, the mining rules described herein, or other mining rules can be applied to a part or to the entirety of the content of the documents d i , in order to complement the association mining method of the present invention.
- X ⁇ Y indicates an association rule between the set of terms X and the set of terms Y, such as: the terms in X imply the terms in Y.
- X ⁇ x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ⁇ indicates that the set of terms X is comprised of a set of sub-terms x i .
- Y ⁇ y 1 , y 2 , . . . ,y n ⁇ indicates that the set of terms Y is comprised of a set of sub-terms y i .
- Support of an association rule X ⁇ Y is the percentage of documents that contain all the terms in the sets X and Y in the hypertext link metadata. It is the joint probability or the percentage of the frequency of co-occurrence of the sets of terms X and Y: p(X, Y). Support favors major terms that appear with frequency in the document d i . As used herein, a “major term” is a term that has a high frequency of occurrence in the document d i . For this reason, this metric is valuable for finding major relevant terms.
- Confidence of an association rule X ⁇ Y is the percentage of the documents containing the sets of terms X and Y relative to the number of documents that contain the term X.
- confidence is the conditional probability of the set of terms Y given the set of terms X, and is expressed as follows:
- X) is the confidence of the association rule X ⁇ Y
- p(X, Y) is the support of the association rule X ⁇ Y
- p(X) is the probability or frequency of occurrence of the set of terms X.
- the confidence metric that favors minor terms wherein a “minor term” is a term that has a low frequency of occurrence in the document d i . For this reason, this metric is valuable for finding minor relevant terms.
- Hybrid metric is a combination of the confidence metric that favors minor terms and the support metric that favors major terms.
- the hybrid metric maps to the interval [ 0 , 1 ], and is expressed as follows:
- H is the hybrid metric
- s is the support metric
- c is the confidence metric
- Confidence values (c) normally lie in the interval [ 0 , 1 ], while support values (s) do not normally rise above 0.1.
- the normalization functions n(s) and n(c) linearize both the support (s) and the confidence (c), respectively, over the interval [ 0 , 1 ].
- Such normalization renders the weighting of the support and confidence more convenient, with the factors a and b being relative normalization weights.
- R (X, Y) of an association rule X ⁇ Y is the set defined in terms of non-exclusive terms as follows: R (X, Y): ⁇ support
- the foregoing association mining rules are based primarily on two premises.
- the first premise is that the metadata of a hypertext link provides an adequate summary description of the page to which it points (i.e., the target page). This premise is based on empirical results where experiments indicate that, with relevance judgement based on full-text as the baseline, judgment based on well-chosen metadata could be ninety percent (90%) accurate.
- the second premise is based on the presumption that a hypertext document that discusses a certain topic references pages of relevant terms, and that there exists a high probability that target pages to which a common page points are related to each other and to the referring (or source) page by research results which demonstrate that hypertext links and static link topology form an invaluable resource for developing meaningful and advanced query responses.

Li et al., “Facilitating Complex Web Queries through Visual User Interfaces and Query Relaxation,” Proceedings of the 7th International World Wide Web Conference, Apr. 14-18, 1998, Brisbane, Australia; and S. Chakrabarti, et al., “Focused Crawling: A New Approach to Topic-Specific Resource Discovery,” IBM Research Report, January 1999.
- the association module 110 applies the foregoing rules to the examples provided above and other examples at step 220 , to generate the following, non-exclusive, exemplary statistics for individual terms and for sets of terms that co-occur in the same document:
- p(MXL) 30/1000, where p(XML) is the number of documents that contain term XML, and where the probability of occurrence is calculated by dividing the number of the documents the contain the term XML (e.g. 30) by the total number of documents in the database (e.g. 1000);
- p(XML, DTD) 23/1000, where p(XML, DTD) is the support for the pair (XML, DTD), or, in other words, the percentage of documents that contain both terms XML and DTD;
- H(s, c) a*n(s)+b*n(c), where H(s, c) is the hybrid metric of the confidence metric p(XML
- the association module 110 determines the relevance “R” among the terms c n,m .
- the relevance R (XML, DTD) for the association rule DTD ⁇ XML is set as follows for the above examples:
- a user can select any of three relevance metrics in the above equation to determine the relevance of the terms.
- the user selects support as the relevance metric, then any term in the association rules where support is greater than a predetermined threshold “t” will be considered to be relevant terms. For example, if the threshold “t” is. greater than 0.01, then the relevant R(DTD ⁇ XML) is equal to 23/1000 which is greater than the threshold “t” of 0.01, and therefore the terms DTD and XML are considered to be relevant.
- the filtering module 120 filters the relevant terms c n,m according to predefined values set by a user or an application. In the above examples, the filtering module 120 disregards any term c n,m , or set of terms whose support value is less than 0.01, whose confidence value is less than 0.5, and/or whose hybrid value is less than 05. These conditions or threshold parameters can be imposed either individually or collectively.
- the method 200 forwards the set “C” comprised of the related terms c n,m to the database 130 for storage and subsequent use.
