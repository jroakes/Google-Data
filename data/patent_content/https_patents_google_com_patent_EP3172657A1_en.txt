Definitions
- This specification relates to data processing and content distribution.
- the Internet facilitates the exchange of information and transactions between users across the globe. This exchange of information enables content sponsors to provide sponsored content to a variety of users.
- a content sponsor can control the distribution of their content items (e.g., promotions, advertisements, audio files, video files, or other content items) based on a set of distribution parameters that specify under what conditions a content item is eligible to be distributed. When a presentation opportunity meeting the conditions is available, the content item provided by a content sponsor is deemed eligible to be provided for presentation.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, for a publisher resource, user interaction data specifying user interactions with the publisher resource; creating, based on the user interaction data, a heat map specifying levels of user interaction with various portions of the publisher resource; identifying, for various candidate content item slot locations on the publisher resource, content item slot performance information specifying one or more performance measures for content items presented in each of the various candidate content item slot locations; selecting one of the various candidate content item slot locations based on the heat map and the one or more performance measures; and generating and outputting data that cause presentation, to a publisher of the publisher resource, of suggestion information that identify the one of the various candidate content item slot locations as a suggested content item slot location in the publisher resource.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Methods can include the actions of generating and providing instructions defining a content item slot at the content item slot location in the publisher resource.
- Methods can include the actions of obtaining performance data for content items presented in the content item slot of the publisher resource; and providing a new suggested content item slot location based on the performance data for the content items.
- Identifying content item slot performance information can include identifying resources having heat maps that are considered to match the heat map of the publisher resource; obtaining performance data for content items that were presented in content item slots at locations of the resources that correspond to the various candidate content item slot locations; and determining, for each of the various candidate content item slot locations and based on the performance data, the content item slot performance information based on the performance of the content items presented in the content item slots that are at locations of the resources corresponding to a location of the various candidate content item slot.
- Selecting one of the various candidate content item slot locations can include ranking the various candidate content item slot locations based, at least in part, on a function of the content item slot performance information; and selecting at least a highest ranked candidate content item slot location as a suggested content item slot location for the publisher resource.
- Ranking the various candidate content item slot locations can include ranking each of the various candidate content item slot locations based on a mathematical combination of a cost-per-mille for the candidate content item slot location and a conversion- per-dollar for the candidate content item location.
- Identifying content item slot performance information can include
- Locations of content item slots on publisher resources can be selected to help limit the chances that users will inadvertently click on content items.
- the locations of the content item slots can also be selected near locations where users focus a high level of attention (e.g., as indicated by long pointer dwell times) so that a user will likely review a content item in detail prior to clicking on the content item.
- Locations of a publisher resource that provide benefits to both publishers and content sponsors can be selected.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which content is distributed to user devices.
- FIG. 2 is an example resource that can provide user interaction feedback.
- FIG. 3A is an illustration of a heat map overlaid on the example resource.
- FIG. 3B is another illustration of a heat map overlaid on the example resource.
- FIG.4 is a flow chart of an example process for suggesting a content item slot location for a publisher resource.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an example computer system.
- the content item slot configurations include a location, size, and/or style of the content item slots.
- the locations, sizes, and/or styles of the suggested content item slot locations can be determined based on performance measures of similar content item slots on similar resources.
- the similar resources can be, for example, resources that have a heat map that is similar to a heat map of the publisher resource for which a content item slot location is being suggested.
- a heat map can provide information regarding user interactions with a resource. Areas of higher user interaction (or a particular type of user interaction) can be presented in a first specified color, texture, or pattern, while areas of lower user interaction (or a different type of user interaction) can be presented in a second specified color, texture, or pattern.
- Resources having heat maps that are very similar can be an indication that content item slot performance for the two resources is likely to be similar, such that performance information for similar resources can be used to predict performance of other similar resources.
- the heat maps can also be used to identify areas where content item slots are less likely to obtain inadvertent clicks. For example, using the heat map a particular area of the resource that obtains a relatively high amount of dwell time (e.g., relative to other areas of the resource) and a relatively low number of clicks can be selected as a potential location for a content item slot. Similarly, the shape and/or size of the potential content item slot can be selected based on a size and/or shape of the particular area of the resource that covered by the portion of the heat map corresponding to the high amount of dwell time and the low number of clicks.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which content is distributed to user devices 106.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104, user devices 106, content sponsors 108, and a content distribution system 1 10.
- the example environment 100 may include many different websites 104, user devices 106, and content sponsors 108.
- a website 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102.
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). Units of content that are presented in (or with) resources are referred to as content items, and an individual content item can be stored in a single file or set of files independent of the resource.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102.
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 can submit a resource request 1 12 that requests a resource 105 from a website 104.
- data representing the requested resource 1 14 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106.
- the requested resource 1 14 can be, for example, a home page of a website 104, a web page from a social network, or another resource 105.
- the data representing the requested resource 1 14 can include data that cause presentation of resource content 1 16 at the user device 106.
- the data representing the requested resource 1 14 can also include data specifying a content item slot 1 18.
- a content item slot is a portion of the resource (e.g., a portion of a web page) or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of another window or in a slot of a web page) in which one or more content items, such as advertisements, can be presented.
- a content items slot 1 18 can also be referred to as an advertisement slot, but any type of content (e.g., content items other than advertisements) can be presented in the content item slot 1 18.
- a single content item slot 1 18 may be configured to include one or more presentation positions 1 19a and 1 19b. Alternatively or additionally, each different content item slot 1 18 can be considered a separate presentation position, and a resource can include multiple different content item slots. Each presentation position can represent a portion of the content item slot 1 18 at which a content item can be presented. In some implementations, the number of presentation positions and/or the size of the presentation positions for a particular content item slot 1 18 may be determined based on the number, type, and/or value of content items that are available for presentation in the content item slot.
- the environment 100 can include a search system 1 13 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource with which the data are associated. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in a search index 122. Data that are associated with a resource is data that represents content included in the resource and/or metadata for the resource.
- User devices 106 can submit search queries to the search system 1 13 over the network 102.
- the search system 1 13 accesses the search index 122 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query.
- the search system 1 13 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device in search results page.
- a search result is data generated by the search system 1 13 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- search results pages can include one or more content item slots 1 18 in which content items, such as advertisements, can be presented.
- a resource 105 When a resource 105 is requested by a user device 106, execution of code associated with a content item slot 1 18 in the resource initiates a request for one or more content items to populate the slot, which is referred to as a content item request.
- the content item request can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource 1 14. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the requested resource 1 14 for which the content item slot 1 18 is defined, a size of the content item slot, a maximum number of presentation positions (or content items) that can be included in the content item slot 1 18, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the content item slot 1 18 can be provided to the content distribution system 1 10.
- keywords associated with a requested resource can also be provided to the content distribution system 1 10 to facilitate identification of content items that are relevant to the requested resource 1 14.
- Content item requests can also include other information, such as information that the user has provided, geographic information indicating a state or region from which the request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the content item will be displayed (e.g., a type of device at which the content item will be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device).
- the content items that are provided in response to a content item request are identified based, in part, on distribution parameters associated with the content items.
- Distribution parameters are a set of criteria upon which distribution of content items are conditioned.
- the distribution parameters for a particular content item can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by resource keywords or search queries) in order for the content item to be eligible for presentation.
- the distribution parameters can also require that the content item request include information specifying a particular geographic region (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying that the content item request originated at a particular type of user device.
- the distribution parameters can also specify a bid and/or budget for distributing the particular content item. Bids can be used to select a set of content items for presentation with a resource and/or to determine in which presentation position the content item(s) will be presented.
- the location of a content item slot on a publisher resource can have an impact on the performance of content items presented in the content item slot and/or user satisfaction with the resource.
- content items that are presented near user interface elements such as buttons of a web page, may receive more inadvertent clicks than content items that are presented near content that a user reads in detail.
- the inadvertent clicks may lead to user dissatisfaction with the resource (e.g., based on the user inadvertently being redirected to a landing page of the content item) and/or skewed performance measures.
- the environment 100 includes a slot suggestion apparatus 120 that facilitates selection of suggested content item slot locations for publisher resources (e.g., resource 1 14).
- the selection of the suggested content item slot locations considers, at least in part, user interaction patterns with the resources and performance information corresponding to content item slots for resources similar to the publisher resource for which the content item slot location is being suggested.
- the user interaction patterns with a resource can be represented, for example, using heat maps that are created based on user interaction data corresponding to user interactions with the resource.
- FIG. 2 is an example resource 200 that can provide user interaction feedback.
- the resource 200 can be, for example, a publisher resource that is provided by a publisher.
- the resource 200 includes various portions of content 202, 204, 206, and 208.
- the various portions of content 202, 204, 206, and 208 can be, for example, job listings, links and/or summaries to news articles, posts in a content stream (e.g., posts in a social network stream), or embedded content (e.g., embedded audio files, video files, or other embedded content).
- the various portions of content to 202, 204, 206, and 208 can also be paragraphs of an article or some other form of content.
- the resource 200 can also include various user interface elements.
- the resource 200 can include links to related pages 210, 212, and 214.
- the resource 200 can also include a text input box 216 and a button 218 (or another user interface element) with which the user can initiate a search of the publisher's website or otherwise input information.
- User interaction data specifying user interactions with the resource 200 can be obtained using a script that is embedded in the code of the resource 200.
- a publisher can be provided with a script that, upon execution of the resource code, causes a user device to log user interactions with the resource 200.
- the script can detect pointer movements (e.g., mouse movements) over the resource 200, dwell times of a pointer over portions of the resource 200, clicks (or other affirmative selections) of content presented in the resource, and scrolling of the resource using a browser scrollbar.
- a user is reading the portion of content 202.
- the user may hover their mouse 220 over the content 202 as they read.
- the script that logs the user interactions can detect that the mouse 220 is being hovered over the content 202, and log user interaction data 222 specifying an action of "hover" and specifying information corresponding to the hover.
- the information corresponding to the hover can include, for example, a dwell time "DT" and a location "LI " of the particular portion of the resource where the mouse was hovered (e.g., the amount of time that the mouse was hovered over the content 202.
- the script that logs the user interactions can detect the mouse movement as well as the click on the related link 214 and log user interaction data 222 specifying the mouse movement "MM,” coordinates corresponding to the path of the mouse movement "coord MM,” the click "CI” on the related link 214, and the location "L2" of the click CI .
- the script can continue to monitor user interactions with various portions of the resource 200 and generate the user interaction data 222 corresponding to the user interactions to the slot suggestion apparatus 120.
- the user device executing the script can include additional information in the user interaction data 222.
- the device type e.g., desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile device
- the screen size e.g., dimensions
- resolution can be included in the user interaction data 222.
- this information can be used to collect device or display size specific information for resources so that different content item slot locations can be selected on a per-device-type and/or per-screen-size basis.
- the user interaction data can be transmitted to, and received by, the slot suggestion apparatus 120, which can use the user interaction data to create a heat map for the resource 200 and suggest content item slot locations, as discussed in more detail below.
- the resource 200 also includes two candidate content item slot locations areas 224 and 226.
- the candidate content item slot area 224 is a top banner location and the candidate content item slot location area 226 is a side bar slot location that includes multiple different candidate content item slots 228, 230, 232, and 234.
- One or more of these candidate content item slot areas and/or locations can be suggested to the publisher as described in more detail below.
- FIG. 3A is an illustration of a heat map overlaid on the example resource 200 of FIG. 2.
- the heat map specifies levels (or types) of interaction with various portions of the resource 200. For example, different colors, textures, patterns, or other visual distinctions can be used to represent different levels (or types) of user interaction with the various portions of the resource.
- the fill pattern in the areas 302 and 304 can be an indication that user clicks are the most dominant (e.g., most common) user interaction with the portion of the resource that is in the areas 302 and 304.
- the fill pattern in the area 306 may indicate that the "hover" action (e.g., mouse or pointer hover) is the most dominant (e.g., most common) user interaction with the portion of the resource that is in the area 306.
- FIG. 3B is another illustration of a heat map overlaid on the example resource 200.
- the fill pattern in the areas 352, 354, and 356 can indicate that these portions of the resource 200 receive the highest aggregate amount of user interaction.
- the fill pattern in the areas 358 and 360 can indicate that these portions of the resource 200 receive a second highest aggregate amount of user interaction, and the fill pattern in the areas 362 and 364 indicate that these portions of the resource 200 receive a third highest aggregate amount of user interaction.
- Additional fill patterns, different colors, or other differences between the heat map can specify further differences in the level of user interaction with different portions of the resource 200.
- the aggregate amount of user interaction used for purposes of creating the heat map can be based on a total number of user interactions with each specific location of the resource 200.
- the aggregate amount of user interactions can be a sum of a total number of user clicks on the specific location, a total number of hovers (e.g., that exceed a specified dwell time), and/or a total number of mouse movements over the specific location.
- the contribution of each user interaction to the aggregate amount of user interaction with the resource 200 can be weighted based on the type of user interaction. For example, clicks may be weighted higher than hovers, which may be weighted higher than mouse movements or scrolls, such that each click may contribute more to the aggregate amount of user interaction with the resource 200 than hovers, which may contribute more to the aggregate than mouse movements or scrolls. In some implementations, hovers may be weighted higher than clicks.
- a separate heat map can be created for each different type of user interaction.
- one heat map can indicate a magnitude of the user clicks on each specific location of the resource 200
- another heat map can indicate a magnitude of the dwell time on each specific location of the resource 200 (e.g., based on the user interaction data 222).
- another heat map can indicate a magnitude of the number of mouse movements over each specific location of the resource 200.
- the heat maps and shown in FIGs. 3A and 3B are graphical representations of heat maps that can be created using the user interaction data 222.
- the term heat map includes not only the graphical representations of heat maps shown in FIGs. 3A and 3B, but also includes other representations such as data structures storing heat map data (e.g., location and magnitude or dominant interaction type data) for different portions of a resource.
- the heat map for a resource can be used, in part, to identify suggested content item slot locations for a publisher resource.
- a data processing apparatus such as the slot suggestion apparatus 120, can examine the heat map to identify content item slot locations that are likely to provide at least a specified amount of content item performance, while also limiting potentially negative user experiences related to presentation of content items in the content item slots.
- potentially negative user experiences can be limited, for example, by using a set of conditions that specify locations where a content item slot may (or may not) be located on a particular resource.
- the set of conditions can be selected based on the potential negative user experiences (e.g., such as a user inadvertently clicking on an advertisement because it is too close to resource content or is too similar to resource content) that can be related to presentation of a content item with a resource.
- Conditions on where content item slots can be located on a resource can include, for example, preventing content item slots from being located closer than a specified distance (e.g., in pixels) from a user interface element that receives a high number of clicks (e.g., relative to the number of clicks received by other user interface elements of the resource and/or as indicated by the heat map).
- content item slots can be prevented from having the same dimensions or style as content presented in the resource to reduce the likelihood that a user will mistake the content item for content of the resource.
- Other conditions can be specified as appropriate, and the conditions that are specified for one type of resource (e.g., a publisher web page related to a particular topic) may differ from the conditions that are specified for another type of resource (e.g., a social media stream).
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for suggesting a content item slot location for a publisher resource.
- the process 400 can be performed, for example, by one or more data processing apparatus, such as the slot suggestion apparatus 120 of FIG. 1.
- Operations of the process 400 can be implemented by instructions that when executed cause one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations of the process 400.
- the instructions can be stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium.
- a script is provided to a publisher (402).
- the script is provided to be embedded in a publisher resource provided by the publisher.
- the script can include instructions that cause a user device that renders the publisher resource to detect and/or log user interactions with the resource. For example, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2, the script can cause the user device executing the script to detect mouse movements, clicks on user interface elements, hovers, and resource scrolling.
- the script can further cause the user device to log user interaction data specifying the user interactions and transmit the user interaction data to a data processing apparatus, such as the slot suggestion apparatus 120, or a data store.
- User interaction data specifying user interactions with the publisher resource are received (404).
- the user interaction data can specify various user interactions with the resource and other information related to the user interactions.
- information related to a user click can specify a location of the resource (e.g., coordinates of the resource) at which the user click was detected.
- information related to a mouse movement can specify a path (e.g., set of resource coordinates) over which the mouse traveled.
- Information related to a hover action can specify, for example, a location (e.g., coordinates or user interface element) over which the hover occurred and/or a dwell time specifying how long the hover occurred (e.g., how long a mouse pointer was hovered over the location).
- the user interaction data can also include, for example, additional information specifying, for example a device type (e.g., mobile, tablet, or desktop) from which the user interaction data are being received (and/or at which the user interaction data were obtained).
- the user interaction data can also specify a size (e.g., dimensions) and/or resolution of the display on which the publisher resource was presented when the user interaction data was obtained.
- a heat map is created based on the user interaction data (406).
- the heat map specifies levels of user interaction with various portions of the publisher resource.
- the heat map can show an aggregate level of user interaction with each different location of the resource and/or different types of user interactions that are most dominant (e.g., occur most often) relative to each different location of the resource.
- a different heat map can be created for each different type of user device (e.g., mobile, tablet, laptop, or desktop) and/or each different screen size in which the publisher resource is presentable.
- One or more candidate content item slot locations are identified (408).
- the one or more candidate content item slot locations are various locations at which a content item slot can be included in the publisher resource.
- the candidate content item slots can include, for example, a set of specified locations that are available for presentation of content items.
- the set of specified locations can include top page and bottom page banner locations that are located above and below content of the resource, side bar locations that are located on a side of the resource adjacent to content of the resource, in- stream locations that are within a content stream (e.g., a social network stream or news feed), and in-content locations (e.g., locations that are embedded in the content of the resource).
- the candidate content item slot locations include all locations in the set of specified locations. In some implementations, the candidate content item locations include fewer than all of the locations in the set of locations.
- the candidate content item locations can be a subset of the locations in the set of locations, where the subset includes only those locations that meet location conditions. For purposes of example, assume that one condition specifies that a content item slot location is only eligible to be a candidate content item slot location if the content item slot location is farther than a specified distance from a user interface element that receives a specified number, portion, or level of clicks (e.g., based on the heat map).
- the locations of the content item slot locations in the set of locations can be compared to portions of the heat map indicating that the specified number, portion, or level of clicks are received. Any of the locations that are within the specified distance of these portions of the heat map can be filtered (or otherwise not included) in the candidate content item slot locations.
- Content item slot performance information is identified for each of the one or more candidate content item slot locations (410).
- the content item slot performance information specifies one or more performance measures for content items presented in each of the various candidate content item slot locations.
- the content item slot performance information can specify a number of impressions that were received by content items presented in the content item slot location, a number of user interactions with (e.g., clicks of) content items that were presented in the candidate content item slot location, an amount of revenue generated for the content sponsor (e.g., through sales or other conversions) by content items that were presented in the candidate content item slot location, an amount of revenue generated for the publisher (e.g., through payment to the publisher for presentation of content items in the content item slot locations, a number of conversions that were attributed to user interactions with the content items presented in the candidate content item slot location, an amount paid by content sponsors for distribution of the content items that were presented in the candidate content item slot location, as well as other performance measures (e.g.
- the identified content item slot performance includes content item slot performance for similar resources (e.g., similar to the publisher resource for which a content item slot is being suggested.
- the similar resources can be identified based on the heat maps for the resources. For example, other resources having heat maps that are considered to match the heat map for the publisher resource can be identified as similar resources to the publisher resource.
- a heat map for a particular resource can be considered to match the heat map for the publisher resource if the two heat maps have at least a specified amount of similarity. For example, a difference measure can be determined based on a comparison of the two heat maps, and the difference measure can be compared to a specified threshold difference. If the difference measure is less than the specified threshold, the two heat maps can be considered to match, and the content item slot performance for the particular resource can be used for purposes of suggesting a content item slot location for the publisher resource.
- the content item slot performance of the similar resource can include (or be based on) performance data for content items that were presented in content item slots at various locations of the similar resource. For example, performance data for content item slots at each of the locations of the candidate content item slots can be obtained, and used to predict the performance of each candidate content item slot if it is selected as a content item slot for the publisher resource. [0063] In some implementations, the content item slot performance information for each candidate content item slot location is determined based on an aggregate measure of content item performance of the content items presented in content item locations corresponding to the location of the candidate content item slot.
- the performance of a candidate content item slot that is located at a top banner position can be determined based on an average (or another measure of central tendency) content item performance for content items presented in the top banner positions of the similar resources.
- the performance corresponding to each resource can be weighted based on a measure of similarity between the heat map of that resource relative to the heat map of the publisher resource for which a suggested content item slot is being selected.
- the content item slot performance information for each candidate content item slot location can specify a cost-per-mille (e.g., cost for each 1 ,000 impressions) for the candidate content item slot location and/or a conversion-per-dollar (e.g., number of conversions obtained for each dollar spent) for the candidate content item location.
- the cost-per-mille and/or conversion-per-dollar of the candidate content item slot location can be determined based on the aggregate (e.g., average) cost-per-mille and/or conversion- per-dollar of content item slots, in the similar resources, that are at the location of the candidate content item slot.
- the cost-per-mille and/or conversion-per-dollar for each particular candidate content item slot location can also be estimated, at least in part, based on the heat map for the publisher resource for which a content item slot is being suggested.
- the heat map for the publisher resource and the heat maps for the similar resources can be input into a machine learning system that predicts a number of impressions and a click through rate for the particular candidate content item slot based on the heat maps and the content item slot performance information.
- the cost-per-mille and/or conversion-per-dollar measures can be determined using the predicted number of impressions, the click through rate, and one or more predicted performance measures (e.g., total revenue to the publisher (or content sponsor) and/or conversion rate) that can be obtained using the performance measures of the similar resources.
- predicted performance measures e.g., total revenue to the publisher (or content sponsor) and/or conversion rate
- the candidate content item slot locations are ranked based, at least in part, on a function of the content item slot performance information (412).
- the candidate content item slots are ranked based on a mathematical combination of the cost- per-mille for the candidate content item slot location and the conversion-per-dollar for the candidate content item slot location. For example, relationship (1) can be used to generate a score for each candidate content item slot location, and the candidate content item slot locations can be ranked based on the score.
- Score x is the score for candidate content item slot location x
- wi is a first weighting factor
- RPM X is the revenue-per-mille for the candidate content item slot location x
- W2 is a second weighting factor
- CPD X is the conversion-per-dollar for content item slot location x.
- the first weighting factor and the second weighting factor are selected by an administrator of the slot suggestion apparatus 120.
- the weighting factors can be chosen to balance the interests of the publisher and the content sponsors that will provide content items for presentation in the suggested content item slot location.
- the RPM X is a measure of the revenue that a publisher receives (or is predicted to receive) for each 1 ,000 presentations of content items in the content item slot location
- the CPD X is a measure of how many conversions a content sponsor will receive for each dollar spent providing content items for presentation in the content item slot location.
- the weights can be adjusted in an attempt to identify content item slot locations that will provide at least a specified amount of benefit to each of the content sponsor and the publisher.
- a default weighting of 1.0 can be used for each of wi and W2 in some
- a candidate content item slot location is selected as a suggested content item slot location for the publisher resource (412).
- one of the various candidate content item slot locations is selected based on the heat map and one or more performance measures. For example, as discussed above, the score that is used to rank the candidate content item slot locations can be determined based on scores that are computed using an RPM and CPD of the respective candidate content item slot locations. These values can be derived from performance measures of similar resources, which are identified based, at least in part on the heat map of the publisher resource.
- the selection of a suggested content item slot location includes selecting at least a highest ranked candidate content item slot location as a suggested content item slot location for the publisher resource. For example, the candidate content item slot location having the highest score (e.g., computed using relationship (1)) can be selected as a suggested content item slot location. If more than one candidate content item slot location is being selected as a suggested content item slot location, the candidate content item slot locations having the highest N scores (where N is an integer corresponding to the number of suggested content item slot locations being selected) can be selected as suggested content item slot locations.
- the candidate content item slot locations having the highest N scores where N is an integer corresponding to the number of suggested content item slot locations being selected
- a size of the suggested content item slot is determined.
- the size of the suggested content item slot can be determined, at least in part, based on whether the publisher resource supports dynamic slot sizing (e.g., based on a size of the content item being presented). If the publisher resource does not support dynamic slot sizing, then a standard slot size (e.g., as specified by a content distribution apparatus) can be selected.
- the standard size can be selected, for example, based on an amount of available space on the publisher resource.
- the standard size can also be selected, for example, based on the heat map for the publisher resource.
- the heat map shows that there is a high level of mouse hovering over a vertical section of the right side of the publisher resource and that the high level of mouse hovering extends from near the top of the publisher resource to about half way down the publisher resource.
- the size of the suggested content item slot can be selected to extend down the right hand side of the publisher resource near the area corresponding to the high level of user hovering.
- the size of the suggested content item slot can be selected based on content items that are eligible to be presented with the resource. For example, the minimum and/or maximum dimensions of the suggested content item slot can be set, at least in part, based on the minimum size and maximum size of the eligible content items. The minimum and/or maximum dimensions of the suggested content item slot can also consider information from the heat map, similar to that discussed above with reference to the standard size content item slots.
- the selected sizes of the content item slots can also be determined as part of the content item slot selection techniques discussed above. For example, each different possible size content item slot can be evaluated separately, and the size of the content item slot having the highest score will be the selected size.
- Data that cause presentation of suggestion information that identify the selected candidate content item slot location as a suggested content item slot location for the publisher resource are generated and output (416).
- the suggestion data are generated and output in the form of an e-mail (or another notification) to the publisher of the publisher resource.
- the suggestion data are output for presentation in an account management system that provides the publisher with information regarding content item slot configuration and/or performance related to the publisher resource.
- the suggestion information can include information specifying the location of the suggested content item slot location and/or predicted performance information for the suggested content item slot location.
- instructions that define the suggested content item slot are generated and provided (418).
- the instructions can include, for example, a portion of code that cause a content item slot to be inserted into the publisher resource at the suggested content item slot location.
- the instructions can be inserted into the publisher resource such that when the publisher resource is rendered by a user device, execution of the instructions will cause the user device to request a content item for presentation at the suggested content item slot location.
- the instructions are provided to the publisher for insertion into the publisher resource.
- Performance data for content items presented in the suggested content item slot location of the publisher resource are obtained (420).
- the performance data can be obtained, for example, based on user interactions with the content items that are presented in the suggested content item slot location.
- This performance data can include, for example, a number of impressions, a click through rate, a conversion rate (or number of conversions), a total amount paid to the publisher for presentation of content items in the suggested content item slot location, and/or other measures of performance.
- a new suggested content item slot location can be provided based on the performance data for the content items (422).
- the new suggested content item slot location can be selected in a manner similar to that described above, and the selection techniques discussed above can use the performance data for the content items presented in the suggested content item slot location, in addition to (or instead of), the performance information corresponding to the other resources having similar heat maps relative to the publisher resource.
- the performance data can be selected in a manner similar to that described above, and the selection techniques discussed above can use the performance data for the content items presented in the suggested content item slot location, in addition to (or instead of), the performance information corresponding to the other resources having similar heat maps relative to the publisher resource.
