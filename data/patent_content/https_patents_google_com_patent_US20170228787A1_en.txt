Definitions
- the Internet enables access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, webpages directed to particular subject matter, news articles, images, and other resources are accessible over the Internet.
- the wide variety of resources that are accessible over the Internet has enabled opportunities for content distributors to provide content items with resources that are requested by users.
- Content items are units of content (e.g., individual files or a set of files) that are presented in/with resources (e.g., web pages, applications, etc.).
- An advertisement is an example of a content item that advertisers can provide for presentation with particular resources, such as web pages and search results pages.
- An advertisement can be made eligible for presentation with specific resources and/or resources that are determined to match specified distribution criteria, such as distribution keywords.
- This specification describes technologies relating to providing content items based on an upcoming user action.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a content item request specifying an upcoming user action that is scheduled to be performed at a future time that is within a specified amount of time after the content item request is received; determining, in response to receiving the content item request, that a content item has distribution criteria corresponding to a complementary product or service of the user action and specifying that the content item is eligible to be provided in response to content item requests received during the specified amount of time prior to the future time when the user action is scheduled to be performed; and providing, in response to the content item request and based on the determination, the content item for presentation at a user device.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- aspects can include receiving data specifying the user action and the specified amount of time; providing the data to one or more content item providers; and receiving, from at least one of the content item providers, distribution criteria specifying a bid for providing a content item of the at least one content item provider in response to content item requests that specify that the user action and that are received during the specified amount of time prior to a future time when the user action is scheduled to be performed by a user; and selecting the content item based at least on the received distribution criteria.
- the user action includes attending an event.
- aspects can include selecting, based on at least one of the event and a role of the user with respect to the event, the content item from a set of content items that have distribution criteria corresponding to a complementary product or service.
- aspects can include determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed based on previous user actions performed with respect to a first application and determining that the content item is eligible to be provided by a second application that is different from the first application.
- the content item can present a link to install the second application in response to determining that the second application is not installed on the user device.
- providing the content item includes providing data that causes a notification of the content item to be displayed at the user device. Interaction with the notification can cause the content item to be displayed at the user device.
- aspects can include determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed based on scheduled attendance at an event at a particular time.
- the content item request is initiated by an application in response to determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed based on previous user interaction with the application.
- the user action is an offline user action performed without use of the application or the user device.
- Content items that are of interest to a user may be provided at a time that is useful to the user.
- Contextual data stored by applications, such as mobile apps, can be used to provide content items that are of interest to users and at an appropriate time for the user.
- Economic incentives can be provided to advertisers and/or application developers by providing content items based on anticipated needs or upcoming actions of users.
- Such content items can include content or links to resources that assist the users in fulfilling their needs and/or completing the upcoming actions.
- FIG. 1 is an example environment in which a content distribution system provides content items.
- FIG. 2 shows illustrations of an example user interface that displays a content item.
- FIG. 3 shows illustrations of an example user interface that displays a content item.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for requesting and presenting a content item.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process for providing a content item.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example computer system.
- Content items can be provided based on user actions that have been performed, that are being performed, and/or that are scheduled to be performed, e.g., within a specified amount of time.
- the user actions can be identified based on previous actions performed by the user and/or data stored by one or more applications, such as one or more mobile apps.
- applications such as one or more mobile apps.
- a user may book a flight using a travel-based application and the application may store data regarding the flight.
- a content item for a taxi or car sharing service may be provided to the user.
- the content item may be displayed in/with the travel-based application, an application for a taxi service, and/or separate from the applications based on a determination that the flight is scheduled to depart within three hours of the current time.
- the content item provided for a user action may be directed to a complementary product or service that complements the user action. For example, if the user action is to attend a party, an advertisement for a gift for the host may be provided.
- the content item may also be selected based on the user's role in the event. For example, a content item for a gift may be provided to a guest of a party, while a content item for a catering service may be provided to a host of a party.
- Application developers or other entities related to an application can specify user actions for which content items may be provided. For example, the developer of a travel-based application may specify pre-departure actions for which content items may be provided based on a user's scheduled departure being within a specified amount of time.
- An event scheduling application may specify event actions for which content items may be provided to users attending the event, for example, based on the event occurring within a specified amount of time.
- a ticket purchasing application may specify event actions for which content items (e.g., for nearby restaurants) may be provided to users attending a ticketed event, such as a movie, concert, or sporting event.
- Content item providers can configure campaign or distribution criteria for their content items such that the content items are eligible to be provided for particular user actions, user actions in particular locations, and/or categories or types of user actions. For example, a restaurant owner may configure criteria such that coupons are provided to users that have purchased movie tickets at a particular theater, e.g., a theater that is located near the restaurant. The coupons may be provided at a specified amount of time before the movie is scheduled to start.
- Techniques described herein can enable advertisers (or other content item providers) and application developers to realize economic benefits by anticipating the needs or upcoming actions of users and providing content items that help the user fulfill the needs to complete the action. For example, an application may anticipate that a user will need a ride to the airport based on the user purchasing a plane ticket and the flight leaving within a specified amount of time. A taxi service may realize an economic benefit by having a content item for the service provided to users that may need a ride to the airport and the users booking a taxi in response to receiving the content item. In addition, if the user does not have an application for the taxi service installed on their device, the user may receive a link to download the application.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- FIG. 1 is an example environment 100 in which a content distribution system provides content items.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects user devices 105 , advertisers 120 , application developers 130 , and the content distribution system 150 .
- the example environment 100 may include many user devices 105 , advertisers 120 , and application developers 130 .
- a user device 105 is an electronic device that is capable of executing one or more applications 112 , e.g., mobile apps.
- Example user devices 105 include mobile computing devices, e.g., smartphones, tablet computing devices, and/or smart watches, and personal computers.
- Applications executing on the user device 105 can cause the user device 105 to send, to the content distribution system 150 , content item requests 108 for content items to display at the user device 105 .
- Content items can include advertisements, recommendations, text, images, videos, newsletters, coupons, documents, or other types of content items.
- a social networking application may request advertisements for presentation to users viewing social networking content using the social networking application.
- a content item request 108 can include data regarding a user action that has been performed, that is being performed, and/or that is likely to be performed (e.g., scheduled to be performed) within a specified amount of time.
- an application 112 may be configured to send a content item request 108 for one or more content items in response to determining that a user is scheduled to perform a particular action, e.g., at a particular time or within a specified amount of time from the current time.
- a travel-based application may be configured to request content items (e.g., content items related to ground transportation) in response to determining that the user is scheduled to take a flight that departs within two hours of the current time.
- the user actions can include offline actions, e.g., actions taken without the use of the application 112 or the user device 105 , such as going to the airport or to a restaurant.
- the data regarding a user action can specify the user action, a category of the user action, and/or contextual data related to the user action.
- a travel-based application may determine that a user is likely to be traveling to a particular airport within the next three hours based on a flight from that airport that the user has booked using the travel-based application.
- the travel-based application may send a content item request 108 that specifies the action of going to the particular airport within three hours, a category of traveling or flying, and/or contextual data, such as the airport, the time of the flight, the destination of the flight, and/or whether the flight has been delayed.
- a content item request 108 can also include other data, such as data regarding content item slots in which the content items will be presented (e.g. size or type of content item slot), location data that indicates a location of the user device 105 (e.g., using GPS data), other contextual data, data specifying the application sending the request, and/or data specifying other applications installed on the user device 105 .
- the data of the content item request 108 may be based on the application submitting the request or the type of application sending the request.
- an event-based application or a social networking application that enables users to set up events and invite other users to the events may provide data regarding a user's role (e.g., host or guest) at the event, the number of people attending the event, and/or whether any social networking contacts of the user are attending the event.
- a user's role e.g., host or guest
- the content item requests 108 can be for particular user actions, the content items requests 108 need not provide any user identifiable information.
- the content item requests 108 can indicate that a user, but not a particular user, is scheduled to take a flight or attend a movie within a specified amount of time.
- the content distribution system 150 can select content items 110 to provide in response to content item requests 108 and provide the selected content items 110 to the user device 105 .
- the content distribution system 150 allows application developers 130 to specify user actions 132 for which content items may be presented.
- an application developer 130 for a travel-based application may specify user actions related to traveling using the travel-based application.
- Example travel-based user actions include a user going to an airport within a specified amount of time; a user's flight being delayed and the length of the delay; and a user boarding a cruise ship within a specified amount of time, to name just a few.
- a developer of an event scheduling application (or an application that enables users to invite users to events, such as a social networking application) can specify actions related to an event a user is scheduled to attend.
- Example user actions can include a user attending an event of a particular type; a guest attending an event of a particular type; and/or a host hosting an event of a particular type.
- the particular type of event may specify a dinner party, birthday party, office party, or other appropriate type of event.
- a developer of a ticket purchasing application can specify actions related to an event for which a user has purchased a ticket.
- user actions for a movie ticket purchasing application may include a user going to see a movie; a user going to see a particular movie at a particular theater; and a user going to see a particular type of movie (e.g., action, drama, or comedy).
- Many other appropriate user actions can be specified for the applications described above and for many other types of applications.
- the application developers 130 can also specify a time period (or amount of time) with respect to the time at which the user action is likely to, or scheduled to, occur.
- the specified amount of time can be used to trigger the request for a content item 110 .
- the specified amount of time for user actions related to traveling to an airport to make a scheduled flight may be two to three hours to allow the user time to receive the content item, request a ride to the airport, and make it to the airport in time to make the flight. This allows the users to receive relevant content items at a time that is beneficial to the user.
- User actions can also be specified for actions that a user may be interested in taking based on their past actions. For example, a user may have downloaded or listened to a particular musician's music using a music application. If that musician schedules a concert near the user (e.g., within a specified distance from the user), the music application may determine that the user may be interested in attending the concert. In response, the user action of attending the musician's concert may be associated with the user. This user action may have a specified time period for causing the music application to request a content item related to the concert. For example, the user action may trigger a content item request a week before tickets for the concert are offered for sale.
- the user actions are specified using a structured format.
- each user action may specify a particular user action (e.g., attending a particular football game) or a category of user action (e.g., event or travel) and a time period for use in triggering the request or presentation of a content item.
- the structured format may allow for additional data, e.g., contextual data, that can be configured by the application developers 130 .
- a developer of an event-based application may include a user's role in an event as part of a defined action.
- the application developers 130 may configure their applications to cause a user device on which the application is executing to submit a content item request 108 in response to determining that a specified user action is likely to, or scheduled to, be performed by a user of the user device.
- the developer of a travel-based application may configure the application to cause the user device to request content items in response to determining that the user is going to take a flight in three hours.
- Each user action may be associated with criteria for the user action.
- the criteria for a user action of going to an airport may be the purchase of an airline ticket that departs from the airport.
- the criteria for attending an event may be accepting an invitation to the event or purchasing a ticket to the event. If the user's previous activity matches the criteria for the user action, the application may cause the user device to submit a content item request that specifies the user action.
- the application developers 130 can also provide data specifying the user actions to the content distribution system 150 .
- the content distribution system 150 allows advertisers 120 and/or other content item providers to define distribution criteria that specify user actions and/or categories of user actions for which they would like for their content items to be provided or for which their content items are eligible to be provided.
- a taxi service may select to have its content items provided in response to certain user actions in which a user may be interested in taking taxi.
- a taxi service may specify in distribution criteria that one or more of its content items are eligible to be provided in response to content item requests that specify the user action of going to an airport or the user action of going to a concert or other event.
- the distribution criteria for a content item may also specify that the content item is eligible to be provided in response to content item requests received during a specified amount of time prior to a future time when the user action is likely to, or schedule to, occur.
- the taxi service may specify in distribution criteria that one or more of its content items are eligible to be provided in response to content item requests that specify the user action of going to an airport in two hours or going to a concert or other event in two hours.
- a complementary product or service of a content item may be different from or independent of the user action.
- the user action may be completed without the complementary product or service.
- a user may be scheduled to take a flight in three hours and, in response, a content item for a taxi may be provided to the user's device.
- the user can complete the user action of going to the airport without the use of the taxi, e.g., the user may have arranged other transportation or may be in walking distance of the airport.
- the advertisers 120 can also specify distribution criteria for products or services that complement user actions. For example, an advertiser 120 may specify that a product or service offered by the advertiser complements a particular user action. Or, the content item distribution system 150 may identify products or services of advertisers 120 that complement particular user actions. If a product or service is deemed to complement a particular user action, content items for the particular product or service may be eligible to be provided in response to content item requests 108 that specify the user action.
- the advertisers 120 may include application developers 130 .
- an application developer 130 for a taxi service may want to provide a content item that advertises its application to users that are scheduled to take a flight within a specified amount of time.
- an advertisement for using the taxi service's application may be provided if the user's device has the application installed thereon. If the user's device does not have the application, content item for installing the application may be provided to the user's device.
- the advertisers 120 select user actions that have been specified by the application developers. For example, an inventory of user actions that have been specified by the application developers 130 may be provided to the advertisers 120 . The advertisers 120 may select one or more user actions for a content item and, in some implementations, provide a bid for the user action.
- the campaign criteria can also specify particular contextual data about a user action or user device 105 on which content items are to be presented.
- the advertisers 120 may define location-based rules to serve content items to user devices 105 that are within particular geographic areas.
- the taxi service may specify locations in which the taxi service operates, along with the user actions for which its content items are eligible.
- the taxi service may bid on user actions of going to an airport in a particular city in which the taxi service operates.
- the content items of the taxi service may only be eligible to be provided in response to content items that are received from user devices located in the locations specified by the contextual data.
- the content distribution system 150 includes a data storage system that stores campaign data 152 and performance data 154 .
- the performance data 154 stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click-through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items (e.g., purchase of a product in response to the display of an advertisement or download of a mobile app or other application). Other performance data can also be stored.
- click data and conversion data can be predicted.
- machine learning techniques can be used to predict the probability that a content item will be selected and/or the probability that a content item will result in a conversion.
- the machine learning techniques may be trained using historical performance data for one or more users.
- the campaign data 152 stores content items (e.g., advertisements, recommendations, etc.), campaign criteria, bid values for content items, and budgeting information for advertisers 120 .
- the campaign data 152 includes a user action index 153 .
- the user action index 153 can include, for one or more applications, data specifying user actions for which content items may be provided and/or categories of user actions for which content items may be provided.
- the user action index 153 can also include, for each user action or category of user action, data specifying content items that are eligible to be provided in response to content item requests 108 that specify the user action. For example, multiple restaurants may bid to have their content item presented in response to content item requests that specify that a user is going to a particular movie theater within two hours of a current time. In another example, multiple taxi and/or car sharing services may bid to have their content items presented on response to content item requests that specify that a user is scheduled to take a flight at a particular airport in the next three hours.
- the content distribution system 150 may select content items that are eligible for a content item request. For example, the content distribution system 150 may select content items based on the user action, the category of user action, and/or other data received in the content item request.
- the campaign data 152 and the performance data 154 can be used as input parameters to a content item selection process, e.g., an advertisement auction.
- a content item selection process e.g., an advertisement auction.
- the content distribution system 150 in response to determining that a user action specified by a content item request is likely or scheduled to occur within a specified time period from a current time or a time at which the content item request is received, can conduct an action to select content items 110 that are provided in response to the content item request 108 .
- the content items 110 that are eligible to be provided in response to the user action specified by the content item request 108 can be ranked according to a rank score.
- the rank score may be proportional to a value that is determined based on a content item bid and one or more parameters specified in the performance data 154 .
- One or more of the content items may be selected and provided to the user device 105 based on the rank scores.
- the content distribution system 150 may use employ spam prevention measures. For example, the content distribution system 150 may limit the number of content items provided to each particular user during a time period. The content distribution system 150 may also consider the quality of content items provided to the user, the probability of the user interacting with the content item, and/or other appropriate data when determining whether to provide a content item. For example, if the user has received a threshold amount of content items in the last six hours, the content distribution system 150 may provide a content item if the selected content item is high quality (e.g., has a quality measure that exceeds a threshold) or has a high probability of being selected (e.g., greater than a threshold probability).
- the content distribution system 150 may use employ spam prevention measures. For example, the content distribution system 150 may limit the number of content items provided to each particular user during a time period. The content distribution system 150 may also consider the quality of content items provided to the user, the probability of the user interacting with the content item, and/or other appropriate data when determining whether to provide a content item.
- a content item application may execute on the user device to facilitate the requesting and presentation of content items.
- a content item application may interact with one or more applications executing on the device to determine when a user action associated with an application has been triggered (e.g., based on the user action being scheduled to occur within an amount of time specified by the user action).
- the content item application can submit a content item request 108 to the content distribution system 150 .
- the content item application can cause the content item 110 to be presented.
- the content item(s) 110 provided to the user device 105 may be presented with the application from which the user action was identified.
- the content item may also be presented separate from the application.
- the content item may be related to another application rather than the application that triggered the user action.
- a content item for a taxi service may be selected for presentation in response to a travel application triggering a user action related to a user's upcoming flight. If the user's device has the taxi application installed and executing thereon, the content item may be provided using the taxi application. If not, a content item for downloading the taxi application or a content item that links to a web page of the taxi application may be provided.
- FIG. 2 depicts block diagrams of example user interfaces 210 and 220 that display a content item.
- a content item related to a taxi service has been provided to a user device.
- a travel-based application 212 may submit a content item request for a content item in response to determining that a user associated with the user device is scheduled to take a flight in three hours.
- the user device may display a notification 214 that informs the user that a content item is available for viewing. To view the content item, the user may interact with (e.g., select) the notification 214 .
- the user interface 220 presents the content item 222 .
- the content item 222 includes a link 224 that links to an application that enables the user to request a ride to the airport.
- the content item 222 that includes the link 224 may be presented based on the user's device already having the application installed thereon.
- FIG. 3 depicts block diagrams of example user interfaces 310 and 314 that display a content item.
- a content item related to a taxi service has been provided to a user device, similar to that of the example illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- a travel-based application 212 may submit a content item request for a content item in response to determining that a user associated with the user device is scheduled to take a flight in three hours.
- the user device may display a notification 214 that informs the user that a content item is available for viewing.
- the user interface 320 presents the content item 322 .
- the content item 322 includes a link 324 that links to a resource for downloading an application that enables the user to request a ride to the airport.
- the content item 322 that includes the link 324 may be presented based on the user's device not having the application installed thereon.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for requesting and presenting a content item. Operations of the process 400 can be implemented, for example, by a data processing apparatus, such as the user device 105 of FIG. 1 .
- the process 400 can also be implemented by instructions stored on computer storage medium, where execution of the instructions by a data processing apparatus cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of the process 400 .
- An upcoming user action of a user is identified ( 402 ).
- the user action can be identified based on previous user interactions with one or more applications and/or data stored by the one or more applications. For example, if a user has purchased a ticket to a sporting event using a ticket purchasing application executing on a user device, the ticket purchasing application may determine that the user is likely to, or is scheduled to, attend the sporting event.
- an application may compare data stored by the application for a user to criteria for a set of predefined user activities to determine whether the user is likely to, or scheduled to, perform a predefined activity in the future.
- the predefined user activities may be user activities that an application developer has defined for presenting content items. For example, a movie ticket purchasing application may define the user action of going to a movie in two hours as a user action for which a content item (e.g., a content item for a restaurant) may be presented.
- the movie ticket purchasing application may compare data regarding a user's previous activity (e.g., whether the user has purchased a ticket for a movie) to the criteria for predefined user activities (e.g., the purchase of a ticket for the movie) to determine whether the user's previous activity matches the criteria for a predefined user action. If there is a match, the application may identify the matching predefined activity as an upcoming user action of the user.
- a scheduled time for the upcoming user action is identified ( 404 ).
- the scheduled time would be the time that the movie is scheduled to start.
- the scheduled time may be determined by the application. For example, by knowing that the user has a flight at a particular time, the application may estimate that the user will be going to the airport at a particular time.
- the application may also use additional data to determine when to request a content item.
- a travel-based application may have access to traffic data, e.g., by way of the Internet or another application. Using the traffic data and the user's route to the airport, the application may estimate the travel time and use that estimated travel time to determine when to request a content item.
- the scheduled time for the upcoming user action is compared to the current time ( 406 ).
- the scheduled time may be compared to the current time to determine how much time there is before the upcoming user action is scheduled to be performed. For example, if the movie is scheduled for 3:00 PM and the current time is noon, then there is three hours between the current time and the scheduled time for the user action.
- the predefined activity of going to the movie in two hours has a specified amount of time of two hours before the scheduled time of the user action of going to a movie.
- This specified amount of time can specify when a content item for the user action of going to the movie is to be presented.
- a content item for a product or service related to, or that complements, the activity of going to a movie should be presented two hours before the movie.
- a user may be interested in receiving a coupon for a restaurant near the movie theater two hours before the movie.
- the process 400 returns to block 406 to monitor for the appropriate time to present a content item for the user action.
- a content item request is sent for the user action ( 410 ).
- the application for which the user action was identified may cause the user device to request a content item based on the user action.
- the user device may send the content item request to a content distribution system, such as the content distribution system 150 of FIG. 1 .
- a content item request may include data specifying the user action, a category for the user action, contextual data for the user action or the user device, and/or other appropriate data.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for providing content items are disclosed herein. In one aspect, a method includes receiving a content item request specifying an upcoming user action that is scheduled to be performed at a future time that is within a specified amount of time after the content item request is received. In response, a determination is made that a content item has distribution criteria corresponding to a complementary product or service of the user action and specifying that the content item is eligible to be provided in response to content item requests received during the specified amount of time prior to the future time when the user action is scheduled to be performed. In response to the content item request and based on the determination, the content item is provided for presentation at a user device.
Description
- The Internet enables access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, webpages directed to particular subject matter, news articles, images, and other resources are accessible over the Internet. The wide variety of resources that are accessible over the Internet has enabled opportunities for content distributors to provide content items with resources that are requested by users. Content items are units of content (e.g., individual files or a set of files) that are presented in/with resources (e.g., web pages, applications, etc.). An advertisement is an example of a content item that advertisers can provide for presentation with particular resources, such as web pages and search results pages. An advertisement can be made eligible for presentation with specific resources and/or resources that are determined to match specified distribution criteria, such as distribution keywords.
- This specification describes technologies relating to providing content items based on an upcoming user action.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a content item request specifying an upcoming user action that is scheduled to be performed at a future time that is within a specified amount of time after the content item request is received; determining, in response to receiving the content item request, that a content item has distribution criteria corresponding to a complementary product or service of the user action and specifying that the content item is eligible to be provided in response to content item requests received during the specified amount of time prior to the future time when the user action is scheduled to be performed; and providing, in response to the content item request and based on the determination, the content item for presentation at a user device. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Aspects can include receiving data specifying the user action and the specified amount of time; providing the data to one or more content item providers; and receiving, from at least one of the content item providers, distribution criteria specifying a bid for providing a content item of the at least one content item provider in response to content item requests that specify that the user action and that are received during the specified amount of time prior to a future time when the user action is scheduled to be performed by a user; and selecting the content item based at least on the received distribution criteria.
- In some aspects, the user action includes attending an event. Aspects can include selecting, based on at least one of the event and a role of the user with respect to the event, the content item from a set of content items that have distribution criteria corresponding to a complementary product or service.
- Aspects can include determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed based on previous user actions performed with respect to a first application and determining that the content item is eligible to be provided by a second application that is different from the first application. The content item can present a link to install the second application in response to determining that the second application is not installed on the user device.
- In some aspects, providing the content item includes providing data that causes a notification of the content item to be displayed at the user device. Interaction with the notification can cause the content item to be displayed at the user device.
- Aspects can include determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed based on scheduled attendance at an event at a particular time. In some aspects, the content item request is initiated by an application in response to determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed based on previous user interaction with the application. In some aspects, the user action is an offline user action performed without use of the application or the user device.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Content items that are of interest to a user may be provided at a time that is useful to the user. Contextual data stored by applications, such as mobile apps, can be used to provide content items that are of interest to users and at an appropriate time for the user. Economic incentives can be provided to advertisers and/or application developers by providing content items based on anticipated needs or upcoming actions of users. Such content items can include content or links to resources that assist the users in fulfilling their needs and/or completing the upcoming actions.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process for providing a content item. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example computer system. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Content items can be provided based on user actions that have been performed, that are being performed, and/or that are scheduled to be performed, e.g., within a specified amount of time. The user actions can be identified based on previous actions performed by the user and/or data stored by one or more applications, such as one or more mobile apps. For example, a user may book a flight using a travel-based application and the application may store data regarding the flight. At a particular time prior to the flight, a content item for a taxi or car sharing service may be provided to the user. For example, the content item may be displayed in/with the travel-based application, an application for a taxi service, and/or separate from the applications based on a determination that the flight is scheduled to depart within three hours of the current time.
- The content item provided for a user action may be directed to a complementary product or service that complements the user action. For example, if the user action is to attend a party, an advertisement for a gift for the host may be provided. The content item may also be selected based on the user's role in the event. For example, a content item for a gift may be provided to a guest of a party, while a content item for a catering service may be provided to a host of a party.
- Application developers or other entities related to an application can specify user actions for which content items may be provided. For example, the developer of a travel-based application may specify pre-departure actions for which content items may be provided based on a user's scheduled departure being within a specified amount of time. An event scheduling application may specify event actions for which content items may be provided to users attending the event, for example, based on the event occurring within a specified amount of time. In another example, a ticket purchasing application may specify event actions for which content items (e.g., for nearby restaurants) may be provided to users attending a ticketed event, such as a movie, concert, or sporting event.
- Content item providers can configure campaign or distribution criteria for their content items such that the content items are eligible to be provided for particular user actions, user actions in particular locations, and/or categories or types of user actions. For example, a restaurant owner may configure criteria such that coupons are provided to users that have purchased movie tickets at a particular theater, e.g., a theater that is located near the restaurant. The coupons may be provided at a specified amount of time before the movie is scheduled to start.
- Techniques described herein can enable advertisers (or other content item providers) and application developers to realize economic benefits by anticipating the needs or upcoming actions of users and providing content items that help the user fulfill the needs to complete the action. For example, an application may anticipate that a user will need a ride to the airport based on the user purchasing a plane ticket and the flight leaving within a specified amount of time. A taxi service may realize an economic benefit by having a content item for the service provided to users that may need a ride to the airport and the users booking a taxi in response to receiving the content item. In addition, if the user does not have an application for the taxi service installed on their device, the user may receive a link to download the application.
- For situations in which the systems described here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, users may have control over how information is collected about them and used by a content server.

FIG. 1 is anexample environment 100 in which a content distribution system provides content items. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectsuser devices 105,advertisers 120,application developers 130, and thecontent distribution system 150. Theexample environment 100 may includemany user devices 105,advertisers 120, andapplication developers 130. - A
user device 105 is an electronic device that is capable of executing one ormore applications 112, e.g., mobile apps.Example user devices 105 include mobile computing devices, e.g., smartphones, tablet computing devices, and/or smart watches, and personal computers. Applications executing on theuser device 105 can cause theuser device 105 to send, to thecontent distribution system 150, content item requests 108 for content items to display at theuser device 105. Content items can include advertisements, recommendations, text, images, videos, newsletters, coupons, documents, or other types of content items. For example, a social networking application may request advertisements for presentation to users viewing social networking content using the social networking application. - A
content item request 108 can include data regarding a user action that has been performed, that is being performed, and/or that is likely to be performed (e.g., scheduled to be performed) within a specified amount of time. For example, anapplication 112 may be configured to send acontent item request 108 for one or more content items in response to determining that a user is scheduled to perform a particular action, e.g., at a particular time or within a specified amount of time from the current time. In a particular example, a travel-based application may be configured to request content items (e.g., content items related to ground transportation) in response to determining that the user is scheduled to take a flight that departs within two hours of the current time. The user actions can include offline actions, e.g., actions taken without the use of theapplication 112 or theuser device 105, such as going to the airport or to a restaurant. - The data regarding a user action can specify the user action, a category of the user action, and/or contextual data related to the user action. For example, a travel-based application may determine that a user is likely to be traveling to a particular airport within the next three hours based on a flight from that airport that the user has booked using the travel-based application. In response, the travel-based application may send a
content item request 108 that specifies the action of going to the particular airport within three hours, a category of traveling or flying, and/or contextual data, such as the airport, the time of the flight, the destination of the flight, and/or whether the flight has been delayed. - A
content item request 108 can also include other data, such as data regarding content item slots in which the content items will be presented (e.g. size or type of content item slot), location data that indicates a location of the user device 105 (e.g., using GPS data), other contextual data, data specifying the application sending the request, and/or data specifying other applications installed on theuser device 105. The data of thecontent item request 108 may be based on the application submitting the request or the type of application sending the request. For example, an event-based application or a social networking application that enables users to set up events and invite other users to the events may provide data regarding a user's role (e.g., host or guest) at the event, the number of people attending the event, and/or whether any social networking contacts of the user are attending the event. - Although the content item requests 108 can be for particular user actions, the
content items requests 108 need not provide any user identifiable information. For example, the content item requests 108 can indicate that a user, but not a particular user, is scheduled to take a flight or attend a movie within a specified amount of time. - The
content distribution system 150 can selectcontent items 110 to provide in response to content item requests 108 and provide the selectedcontent items 110 to theuser device 105. Thecontent distribution system 150 allowsapplication developers 130 to specifyuser actions 132 for which content items may be presented. For example, anapplication developer 130 for a travel-based application may specify user actions related to traveling using the travel-based application. Example travel-based user actions include a user going to an airport within a specified amount of time; a user's flight being delayed and the length of the delay; and a user boarding a cruise ship within a specified amount of time, to name just a few. - A developer of an event scheduling application (or an application that enables users to invite users to events, such as a social networking application) can specify actions related to an event a user is scheduled to attend. Example user actions can include a user attending an event of a particular type; a guest attending an event of a particular type; and/or a host hosting an event of a particular type. The particular type of event may specify a dinner party, birthday party, office party, or other appropriate type of event.
- A developer of a ticket purchasing application can specify actions related to an event for which a user has purchased a ticket. For example, user actions for a movie ticket purchasing application may include a user going to see a movie; a user going to see a particular movie at a particular theater; and a user going to see a particular type of movie (e.g., action, drama, or comedy). Many other appropriate user actions can be specified for the applications described above and for many other types of applications.
- The
application developers 130 can also specify a time period (or amount of time) with respect to the time at which the user action is likely to, or scheduled to, occur. The specified amount of time can be used to trigger the request for acontent item 110. For example, the specified amount of time for user actions related to traveling to an airport to make a scheduled flight may be two to three hours to allow the user time to receive the content item, request a ride to the airport, and make it to the airport in time to make the flight. This allows the users to receive relevant content items at a time that is beneficial to the user. - User actions can also be specified for actions that a user may be interested in taking based on their past actions. For example, a user may have downloaded or listened to a particular musician's music using a music application. If that musician schedules a concert near the user (e.g., within a specified distance from the user), the music application may determine that the user may be interested in attending the concert. In response, the user action of attending the musician's concert may be associated with the user. This user action may have a specified time period for causing the music application to request a content item related to the concert. For example, the user action may trigger a content item request a week before tickets for the concert are offered for sale.
- In some implementations, the user actions are specified using a structured format. For example, each user action may specify a particular user action (e.g., attending a particular football game) or a category of user action (e.g., event or travel) and a time period for use in triggering the request or presentation of a content item. The structured format may allow for additional data, e.g., contextual data, that can be configured by the
application developers 130. For example, a developer of an event-based application may include a user's role in an event as part of a defined action. - The
application developers 130 may configure their applications to cause a user device on which the application is executing to submit acontent item request 108 in response to determining that a specified user action is likely to, or scheduled to, be performed by a user of the user device. For example, the developer of a travel-based application may configure the application to cause the user device to request content items in response to determining that the user is going to take a flight in three hours. Each user action may be associated with criteria for the user action. For example, the criteria for a user action of going to an airport may be the purchase of an airline ticket that departs from the airport. In another example, the criteria for attending an event may be accepting an invitation to the event or purchasing a ticket to the event. If the user's previous activity matches the criteria for the user action, the application may cause the user device to submit a content item request that specifies the user action. - The
application developers 130 can also provide data specifying the user actions to thecontent distribution system 150. Thecontent distribution system 150 allowsadvertisers 120 and/or other content item providers to define distribution criteria that specify user actions and/or categories of user actions for which they would like for their content items to be provided or for which their content items are eligible to be provided. For example, a taxi service may select to have its content items provided in response to certain user actions in which a user may be interested in taking taxi. In a particular example, a taxi service may specify in distribution criteria that one or more of its content items are eligible to be provided in response to content item requests that specify the user action of going to an airport or the user action of going to a concert or other event. - The distribution criteria for a content item may also specify that the content item is eligible to be provided in response to content item requests received during a specified amount of time prior to a future time when the user action is likely to, or schedule to, occur. For example, the taxi service may specify in distribution criteria that one or more of its content items are eligible to be provided in response to content item requests that specify the user action of going to an airport in two hours or going to a concert or other event in two hours.
- A complementary product or service of a content item may be different from or independent of the user action. For example, the user action may be completed without the complementary product or service. In a particular example, a user may be scheduled to take a flight in three hours and, in response, a content item for a taxi may be provided to the user's device. The user can complete the user action of going to the airport without the use of the taxi, e.g., the user may have arranged other transportation or may be in walking distance of the airport.
- The
advertisers 120 can also specify distribution criteria for products or services that complement user actions. For example, anadvertiser 120 may specify that a product or service offered by the advertiser complements a particular user action. Or, the contentitem distribution system 150 may identify products or services ofadvertisers 120 that complement particular user actions. If a product or service is deemed to complement a particular user action, content items for the particular product or service may be eligible to be provided in response to content item requests 108 that specify the user action. - The
advertisers 120 may includeapplication developers 130. Continuing the previous taxi example, anapplication developer 130 for a taxi service may want to provide a content item that advertises its application to users that are scheduled to take a flight within a specified amount of time. As shown inFIGS. 2 and 3 and described in more detail below, an advertisement for using the taxi service's application may be provided if the user's device has the application installed thereon. If the user's device does not have the application, content item for installing the application may be provided to the user's device. - In some implementations, the
advertisers 120 select user actions that have been specified by the application developers. For example, an inventory of user actions that have been specified by theapplication developers 130 may be provided to theadvertisers 120. Theadvertisers 120 may select one or more user actions for a content item and, in some implementations, provide a bid for the user action. - The campaign criteria can also specify particular contextual data about a user action or
user device 105 on which content items are to be presented. For example, theadvertisers 120 may define location-based rules to serve content items touser devices 105 that are within particular geographic areas. Continuing the previous taxi example, the taxi service may specify locations in which the taxi service operates, along with the user actions for which its content items are eligible. For example, the taxi service may bid on user actions of going to an airport in a particular city in which the taxi service operates. In this example, the content items of the taxi service may only be eligible to be provided in response to content items that are received from user devices located in the locations specified by the contextual data. - The
content distribution system 150 includes a data storage system that storescampaign data 152 andperformance data 154. Theperformance data 154 stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click-through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items (e.g., purchase of a product in response to the display of an advertisement or download of a mobile app or other application). Other performance data can also be stored. - In some implementations, click data and conversion data can be predicted. For example, machine learning techniques can be used to predict the probability that a content item will be selected and/or the probability that a content item will result in a conversion. The machine learning techniques may be trained using historical performance data for one or more users.
- The
campaign data 152 stores content items (e.g., advertisements, recommendations, etc.), campaign criteria, bid values for content items, and budgeting information foradvertisers 120. In some implementations, thecampaign data 152 includes auser action index 153. Theuser action index 153 can include, for one or more applications, data specifying user actions for which content items may be provided and/or categories of user actions for which content items may be provided. Theuser action index 153 can also include, for each user action or category of user action, data specifying content items that are eligible to be provided in response to content item requests 108 that specify the user action. For example, multiple restaurants may bid to have their content item presented in response to content item requests that specify that a user is going to a particular movie theater within two hours of a current time. In another example, multiple taxi and/or car sharing services may bid to have their content items presented on response to content item requests that specify that a user is scheduled to take a flight at a particular airport in the next three hours. - In some implementations, the
content distribution system 150 may select content items that are eligible for a content item request. For example, thecontent distribution system 150 may select content items based on the user action, the category of user action, and/or other data received in the content item request. - The
campaign data 152 and theperformance data 154 can be used as input parameters to a content item selection process, e.g., an advertisement auction. For example, thecontent distribution system 150, in response to determining that a user action specified by a content item request is likely or scheduled to occur within a specified time period from a current time or a time at which the content item request is received, can conduct an action to selectcontent items 110 that are provided in response to thecontent item request 108. Thecontent items 110 that are eligible to be provided in response to the user action specified by thecontent item request 108 can be ranked according to a rank score. The rank score may be proportional to a value that is determined based on a content item bid and one or more parameters specified in theperformance data 154. One or more of the content items may be selected and provided to theuser device 105 based on the rank scores. - In some implementations, the
content distribution system 150 may use employ spam prevention measures. For example, thecontent distribution system 150 may limit the number of content items provided to each particular user during a time period. Thecontent distribution system 150 may also consider the quality of content items provided to the user, the probability of the user interacting with the content item, and/or other appropriate data when determining whether to provide a content item. For example, if the user has received a threshold amount of content items in the last six hours, thecontent distribution system 150 may provide a content item if the selected content item is high quality (e.g., has a quality measure that exceeds a threshold) or has a high probability of being selected (e.g., greater than a threshold probability). - In some implementations, a content item application may execute on the user device to facilitate the requesting and presentation of content items. For example, a content item application may interact with one or more applications executing on the device to determine when a user action associated with an application has been triggered (e.g., based on the user action being scheduled to occur within an amount of time specified by the user action). In response, the content item application can submit a
content item request 108 to thecontent distribution system 150. Upon receiving thecontent item 110, the content item application can cause thecontent item 110 to be presented. - The content item(s) 110 provided to the
user device 105 may be presented with the application from which the user action was identified. The content item may also be presented separate from the application. For example, the content item may be related to another application rather than the application that triggered the user action. In a particular example, a content item for a taxi service may be selected for presentation in response to a travel application triggering a user action related to a user's upcoming flight. If the user's device has the taxi application installed and executing thereon, the content item may be provided using the taxi application. If not, a content item for downloading the taxi application or a content item that links to a web page of the taxi application may be provided. -
FIG. 2 depicts block diagrams ofexample user interfaces example user interface 210, a content item related to a taxi service has been provided to a user device. For example, a travel-basedapplication 212 may submit a content item request for a content item in response to determining that a user associated with the user device is scheduled to take a flight in three hours. The user device may display anotification 214 that informs the user that a content item is available for viewing. To view the content item, the user may interact with (e.g., select) thenotification 214. - In response to the user interaction with the
notification 214, theuser interface 220 presents thecontent item 222. In this example, thecontent item 222 includes alink 224 that links to an application that enables the user to request a ride to the airport. For example, thecontent item 222 that includes thelink 224 may be presented based on the user's device already having the application installed thereon. -
FIG. 3 depicts block diagrams ofexample user interfaces 310 and 314 that display a content item. In theexample user interface 310, a content item related to a taxi service has been provided to a user device, similar to that of the example illustrated inFIG. 2 . For example, a travel-basedapplication 212 may submit a content item request for a content item in response to determining that a user associated with the user device is scheduled to take a flight in three hours. The user device may display anotification 214 that informs the user that a content item is available for viewing. - In response to user interaction with the
notification 214, theuser interface 320 presents thecontent item 322. In this example, thecontent item 322 includes alink 324 that links to a resource for downloading an application that enables the user to request a ride to the airport. For example, thecontent item 322 that includes thelink 324 may be presented based on the user's device not having the application installed thereon.FIG. 4 is a flow chart of anexample process 400 for requesting and presenting a content item. Operations of theprocess 400 can be implemented, for example, by a data processing apparatus, such as theuser device 105 ofFIG. 1 . Theprocess 400 can also be implemented by instructions stored on computer storage medium, where execution of the instructions by a data processing apparatus cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of theprocess 400. - An upcoming user action of a user is identified (402). The user action can be identified based on previous user interactions with one or more applications and/or data stored by the one or more applications. For example, if a user has purchased a ticket to a sporting event using a ticket purchasing application executing on a user device, the ticket purchasing application may determine that the user is likely to, or is scheduled to, attend the sporting event.
- In some implementations, an application may compare data stored by the application for a user to criteria for a set of predefined user activities to determine whether the user is likely to, or scheduled to, perform a predefined activity in the future. The predefined user activities may be user activities that an application developer has defined for presenting content items. For example, a movie ticket purchasing application may define the user action of going to a movie in two hours as a user action for which a content item (e.g., a content item for a restaurant) may be presented. The movie ticket purchasing application may compare data regarding a user's previous activity (e.g., whether the user has purchased a ticket for a movie) to the criteria for predefined user activities (e.g., the purchase of a ticket for the movie) to determine whether the user's previous activity matches the criteria for a predefined user action. If there is a match, the application may identify the matching predefined activity as an upcoming user action of the user.
- A scheduled time for the upcoming user action is identified (404). Continuing the previous movie ticket example, the scheduled time would be the time that the movie is scheduled to start. In some implementations, the scheduled time may be determined by the application. For example, by knowing that the user has a flight at a particular time, the application may estimate that the user will be going to the airport at a particular time.
- The application may also use additional data to determine when to request a content item. For example, a travel-based application may have access to traffic data, e.g., by way of the Internet or another application. Using the traffic data and the user's route to the airport, the application may estimate the travel time and use that estimated travel time to determine when to request a content item.
- The scheduled time for the upcoming user action is compared to the current time (406). The scheduled time may be compared to the current time to determine how much time there is before the upcoming user action is scheduled to be performed. For example, if the movie is scheduled for 3:00 PM and the current time is noon, then there is three hours between the current time and the scheduled time for the user action.
- A determination is made whether the scheduled time is within a specified amount of time of the current time (408). For example, the predefined activity of going to the movie in two hours has a specified amount of time of two hours before the scheduled time of the user action of going to a movie. This specified amount of time can specify when a content item for the user action of going to the movie is to be presented. In this example, a content item for a product or service related to, or that complements, the activity of going to a movie should be presented two hours before the movie. For example, a user may be interested in receiving a coupon for a restaurant near the movie theater two hours before the movie.
- If the scheduled time for the user action is not within the specified amount of time of the current time, the
process 400 returns to block 406 to monitor for the appropriate time to present a content item for the user action. - If the scheduled time for the user action is within the specified amount of time of the current time, a content item request is sent for the user action (410). For example, the application for which the user action was identified may cause the user device to request a content item based on the user action. The user device may send the content item request to a content distribution system, such as the
content distribution system 150 ofFIG. 1 . As described above, a content item request may include data specifying the user action, a category for the user action, contextual data for the user action or the user device, and/or other appropriate data. - A content item is received in response to the content item request (412). For example, the
content distribution system 150 may select a content item based on data included in the content item request and send the selected content item to the user device from which the content item request was sent. An example process for selecting a content item and providing a content item is illustrated inFIG. 5 and described below. - The received content item is presented (414). For example, the content item may be presented at/with the application for which the user activity was identified. In another example, the content item may be presented in/with a different application than the application for which the user action was identified. For example, a movie ticket purchasing may have identified the user action based on the user purchasing a movie ticket using the application. However, the content item may be related to a restaurant application, e.g., an application that allows users to make reservations at restaurants. In this example, the content item may be presented by the restaurant application. If the restaurant application is not installed on the user device that received the content item, a content item that provides a link for the user to download the restaurant application may be presented, e.g., with the received content item.
- The application that requested the content item can also provide data to another application, such as the application that presents the content item. For example, a travel-based application may have data that specifies the user's current location and the location of the airport (or other destination). The travel-based application can provide this data to an application for a taxi-service. The taxi application can then use the data to enable the user to request a taxi at the user's current location without the user inputting this data. The data can also be used to identify taxis in the area of the user's current location.

FIG. 5 is a flow chart of anexample process 500 for providing a content item. Operations of theprocess 500 can be implemented, for example, by a data processing apparatus, such as thecontent distribution system 150 ofFIG. 1 . Theprocess 500 can also be implemented by instructions stored on computer storage medium, where execution of the instructions by a data processing apparatus cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of theprocess 500. - A content item request is received (502). The content item request may be received from a user device and include data specifying a user action that is likely to, or scheduled to, be performed. The content item request may also include data specifying that the user action is scheduled to be performed at a future time, e.g., that is within a specified amount of time after a current time. For example, the content item request may specify that the user action of attending a concert for a particular musician is scheduled to be performed in two hours from the current time. The content item request can also specify a category for the user action, contextual data for the user action or the user device, and/or other appropriate data. As described above with reference to
FIG. 4 , the content item request may be sent in response to determining that the user action is scheduled to be performed within a specified amount of time of a current time. - A determination is made that a content item has distribution criteria corresponding to a complementary product or service of the user action (504). A determination may also be made that the distribution criteria for the content item specifies that the content item is eligible to be provided in response to content item requests received during the specified amount of time prior to the future time when the user action is scheduled to be performed. For example, a content distribution system may compare the user action and amount of time specified by the content item request to distribution criteria of a set of content items to identify content items that are eligible to be provided in response to content items that specify the user action and the amount of time. Continuing the previous concert example, the content distribution system may identify content items for complementary products or services that are eligible to be provided in response to content items that specify attendance of a concert within two hours of the current time.
- One or more content items may be selected from the set of content items eligible for the user action based on campaign data and/or performance data. The campaign data may specify bids submitted for the user action by advertisers and/or other content item providers. The performance data may specify the performance of the eligible content items, for example, with respect to the user action specified by the content item request or with respect to multiple user actions for which the eligible content items have been provided. The campaign data and performance data may be input to a content item selection process, e.g., a content item auction, to select the content item(s) to provide in response to the content item request. For example, the content item selection process may rank the eligible content items using rank scores for each content item. The rank score for a particular content item may be based on the content item's bid for the user action and/or performance data for the content item. The content item(s) having the highest rank score(s) may be selected.
- The selected content item is provided (506). For example, the content item may be provided to a user device that submitted the content item request. The user device may then present the content item to a user.

- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
