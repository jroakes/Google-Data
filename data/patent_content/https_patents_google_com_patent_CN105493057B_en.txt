Broadcasting content etc. is analyzed, to predict one or more content selection parameter values for device identification.In some cases,
It can predict multiple overlapping content selection parameter values, such as overlapping value range.
Referring still to the embodiment of Fig. 3, process 300 includes one or more contents to predict for device identification
Selection parameter value determines accurate sexual factor (step 308).Can for some in the parameter value predicted for device identification or
Accuracy factor is all generated by prediction model.In general, accuracy factor indicates the content selection parameter value of prediction
It is accurate probability.For example, a predicted parameter value of device identification can have 75% accurate sexual factor, and it is another pre-
Surveying parameter value can have 95% accurate sexual factor.
Again referring still to the embodiment of Fig. 3, process 300 includes receiving to be selected by the content that third party content supplier specifies
Select parameter value and accurate sexual factor (step 310).Specified parameter value and accurate sexual factor can be with a specific thirds
Square content, the grouping (for example, advertisement group) of third party content, activity etc. are associated, or can select for supplier and content
The account for selecting service is arranged in global level.Specified accurate sexual factor can be obtained for certain content selection parameters or
Person can optionally be specified by content provider.For example, third party content supplier, which can specify some advertisement, to be only presented
To with it is such as being predicted by selection service and have be greater than or equal to the accuracy of the accurate sexual factor specified by supplier because
The device identification for the parameter value of element specified.
Referring still to the embodiment of Fig. 3, process 300 include by the content selection parameter predicted and specified and
Accurate sexual factor is compared to select content (step 312) for device.If predicted within step 306 for device identification
Content selection parameter value and the content selection parameter value specified by third party content supplier match, then device identification is usual
It may qualify for from supplier's reception content.If accurate sexual factor has also been specified by supplier, device mark can will be directed to
The predictive factors for knowing symbol are compared with the accurate sexual factor specified by supplier, to determine whether identifier is actually qualified
Reception content.In some cases, content selection service, which can be represented still, is not explicitly specified the content of accurate sexual factor and mentions
The minimum accurate sexual factor threshold value of donor application.
Referring now to Figure 4, showing the diagram for generating an embodiment of the model for carrying out predictive content selection parameter

Which content selection parameter value of the accurate sexual factor of big correspondence.In one embodiment, prediction extractor 612 is configured to
Determine the most close limit for including parameter value in subset 614 for meeting minimum threshold.For example, if 18-44 and 18-34
The range of age all there is the accurate sexual factor for meeting minimum threshold, then predict that extractor 612 can be by the range of age of 18-34
It is included in subset 614, because it has the range of the narrow range than 18-44.The minimum used by prediction extractor 612 is accurate
Property threshold value can be serviced and 104 globally apply by content selection, can be specific to some content selection parameter, or can be to appoint
What other way variation.
Memory 120 may include being configured to retrieve in third party based on the content selection parameter value in subset 614
The content retriever 616 of appearance.For example it is assumed that subset 614 includes corresponding with the age group of 18+ simultaneously with 95% accurate sexual factor
And with 80% accurate sexual factor parameter value corresponding with the age group of 24-34.It is better than because two selection parameter values have
The accurate sexual factor of minimum threshold (for example, such as being determined by prediction extractor), so these values can be by content retriever 616
For identifying third party content associated with 18+ and/or 24-34 years old age group.In other words, with the age group phase of 52-64
Associated third party content may be excluded in the case where this group is not included in subset 614 by content retriever 616.It is logical
The third party content for identifying first in subset 614 and there is content selection parameter value is crossed, can assess and be potentially suitable for selecting
All third party contents.
Memory 120 may include being configured to apply by third party content the result generated by content retriever 616
The accuracy filter 618 for the accurate sexual factor that supplier specifies.For example it is assumed that third party content supplier given ad is by base
Only have in the specific content selection parameter value of the accuracy with 95% come the correspondence parameter value sent and in subset 614
85% accuracy.In this case, content retriever 616 can be initially by the third party content mark from supplier
Know to be potentially suitable for selecting.However, having been specified because of supplier higher more accurate than being predicted for device identification
Degree, it is possible to the content of supplier is excluded from the selection for device identification.In one embodiment, can pass through
Accuracy filter 618 includes any third party content for not specifying accurate sexual factor to it in qualified content 620.Equally
Ground has device identification in any third party more than or equal to the specified accuracy of the accuracy in subset 614
Appearance can be included in qualified content 620.Therefore, qualified content 620 can be in the profile of device identification and with right
The acceptable level of accuracy of supplier only includes in those of supplier for using content selection parameter value third party
Hold.
Content selection service 104 can select for rendering in qualified content 620 in any number of ways to dress
The third party content set.In some cases, content selection service 104 can be in corresponding third party content supplier
It is auctioned, to determine which content in qualified content 620 is actually selected for rendering to device identification.It is such
Auction can based on the bid gone out by content provider, one or more quality scores associated with content are (for example, user general
Clicking third party content has how likely etc.) or combinations thereof.
It is configured to permit third party content supplier using accuracy control come specified interior referring now to Figure 7, showing
Hold the diagram of an embodiment at the interface 700 of selection parameter.In shown embodiment, it is assumed that third party content mentions

The content for determining supplier is appropriate for be presented to certain device identifications.
Interface 700 may include any number of input 702- for being configured to receive specified content selection parameter value
712.Input 702 can receive one or more groups of display keywords.It is related to activity if specifying any display keyword
The third party content of connection may be appropriate only for being presented on the website using specified keyword.For example, if content provides
Person's designated key word " automobile insurance (car insurance) ", then the advertisement of supplier will be appropriate only for being presented on making
On website with same or similar keyword.Input 704, which can receive, indicates that third party content is suitable for being presented on above
One or more placement values of specific website, webpage etc..For example, advertisement appearance can be limited aprowl using input 704
To specific first party website.Input 706 can receive the subject categories of first party content.If specifying any such class
Not, then the presentation of third party content can be limited to the first party content with matching theme by content selection service.Input 708 can
To receive one or more specified category of interest.If specific device identifier is associated with matched category of interest, it
It may qualify for receiving the content of supplier.It is intended merely to for example, advertiser can specify him or she to interested to golf
User sends advertisement.
Input 710, which can receive any other specified content selection parameter value and input 712, can receive the phase of value
Hope the accuracy of rank.For example, the device identification for only having and inputting the matched prediction selective value of value specified in 710 can
