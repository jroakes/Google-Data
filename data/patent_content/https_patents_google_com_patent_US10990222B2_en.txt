- Sets of sensitivity parameters have been selected, each set corresponding to a test weight that was applied to the trackpad in a calibration session.
- the test weights can be selected based on the expected range of force to be applied to the trackpad. For example, four sets of sensitivity parameters may have been selected, corresponding to test weights of 100 g, 200 g, 300 g, and 500 g, respectively.
- the sensitivity parameter selection circuitry 904 may pick one of the sets of sensitivity parameters as a default.
- the sensitivity parameter selection circuitry 904 may select the set of sensitivity parameters corresponding to 300 g, and this is reflected in the input 906 to the force estimation circuitry 900 . This can be considered primary sensitivity parameters.
- the force estimation circuitry 900 applies the set of sensitivity parameters corresponding to 300 g to the reading of the force sensor(s) and estimates a force which is reflected in the output 908 .
- This can be considered primary estimated force.
- the estimated force is equivalent to the gravitational force of a mass of 200 g, which is different from the 300 g on which the default set of sensitivity parameters is based.
- the output 908 can be provided to the sensitivity parameter selection circuitry 904 by way of a feedback 910 .

- This can be considered secondary sensitivity parameters.
- the force estimation circuitry 900 applies the set of sensitivity parameters corresponding to 200 g to the reading of the force sensor(s) and estimates a force which is reflected in an updated version of the output 908 .
- This can be considered secondary estimated force.
- This approach may generate a more reliable, precise, exact, and/or representative output because the set of sensitivity parameters was selected based on some knowledge about the applied force as represented by the feedback 910 .

- the electronic device 1000 can include touch sensing circuitry 1016 and an accelerometer 1018 .
- the force sensing circuitry 1004 can be calibrated according to a present state of the sensor(s) 1006 . This can involve defining a zero offset vector 1020 .
- the zero offset vector 1020 can be considered as corresponding to an initial gap in the touchpad.
- the zero offset vector 1020 represents the normal separation of the gap and will be used as a baseline to determine when the gap changes from that initial value, which may then be a sign that force is being applied to the trackpad.
- the force can then be estimated as follows:
- the gap can be susceptible to deformation of the external system. For example, if a user bends, twists, or otherwise applies force to an electronic device, this can result in a change in the gap. If the electronic device is dropped this can also or instead cause the gap to change. If the gap changes from its size at the time of assembly, then the original calibration done at the assembly stage may no longer be optimal or even relevant. As a result, one or more of the sensitivity values may no longer be proper. For example, if the gap becomes smaller this can lead to false triggers of force signals, which can result in unwanted input or output. As another example, if the gap becomes larger then no force input or a weakened force input may be detected when the user touches or presses against the touchpad. The sensitivity may become diminished.

- the calibration circuitry 1002 includes zero offset vector update circuitry 1026 .
- the zero offset vector update circuitry 1026 can provide the reading obtained by the sensor evaluation circuitry 1024 to the force sensing circuitry 1004 .
- the reading can be used for updating (e.g., overwriting) the zero offset vector 1020 ).
- the force can be determined as follows:
- the calculation of the force F now takes into account the updated zero offset vector O′ instead of the earlier zero offset vector O. This may improve the force sensing. For example, false triggers, unregistered user input, and/or sensitivity loss can be eliminated or reduced.
- a calibration done at an assembly stage can be updated one or more times after the trackpad has been in use for some time, or after a potentially damaging event, such as if an electronic device is dropped.
- a trackpad can evaluate whether to define an updated zero offset vector in response to the trackpad being at rest.
- a touch sensor indicating that no touching of the touchpad is detected, and an accelerometer indicating that the touchpad is not subjected to force, it can be evaluated whether to update the zero offset vector. For example, if the force sensor indicates a net force while the resting condition is satisfied, this may be a sign that the zero offset vector should be updated.

However, there are more equations (i.e., n number of equations, here 5) than unknown entities (i.e., m number of unknowns, here four), so the relationship is overdetermined. As such, depending on the values of the readings and the force, no values of the sensitivity parameters may simultaneously satisfy all the equations. In some implementations, the number of locations involved in the calibration is deliberately selected so that the set of relationships will form an overdetermined system.
- a linear least squares is performed to select sensitivity parameters.
- performing the linear least squares can involve forming a vector expression [F ⁇ DS] that includes the n ⁇ 1 array (F) subtracted by a product (DS) of the n ⁇ m array and the m ⁇ 1 array.
- the vector expression can be:
- An expression ⁇ 2 can denote the least square applied to vector calculation. Performing the linear least squares can involve minimizing the norm of that vector expression, that is: min ⁇ F ⁇ DS ⁇ 2 , which involves the known force values (F) and the readings (D).
- F is a vector
- D is a sensing matrix
- S is also a vector. The sensitivity parameters of the array S are to be selected so that the value of the expression is minimized.
- the above approach can result in a selection of sensitivity parameters S for a particular weight of the physical object 1106 , corresponding to the index x.
- This can be considered a sensitivity parameter vector for the particular weight that was used.
- This selected set of sensitivity parameters can be provided to force sensing circuitry for use in sensing force on a touchpad, and/or further calibration can be performed, for example as follows.
- the force sensors 1102 A-D are in touch areas (i.e., in areas covered by the touch surface 1104 ). That is, the touch surface 1104 here covers a larger area than what is spanned by the placement of the force sensors 1102 A-D. Therefore, in this example, the calibration area (i.e., the area spanned by the locations 1108 A-E) is larger than the physical locations of the force sensors 1102 A-D. In some implementations, some or all of these aspects may have different relationships with regard to each other.
- Measurements can be performed with one or more other weights.
- one or more additional measurements can be registered with different force input(s).
- the different force inputs can correspond to using a weight with different mass than the physical object 1106 . Any different masses can be used. For example, masses that are within a range of expected touchpad force inputs can be used. Each mass can then correspond to a different value of the index x, and the corresponding set of sensitivity parameters can then be selected for each respective one of the weights.
- the following sensitivity parameter arrays may be registered:
- the above sensitivity parameter arrays will here be referred to as S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 , respectively, where only the index x (for the corresponding mass) is used.
- the sensitivity parameter arrays S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 can be used individually (for example as illustrated below), or further processing can be performed, such as along the lines of the following example.
- the sensitivity parameter arrays S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 can be adjusted into a more coherent set of sensitivity parameters.
- a polynomial linear fitting can be performed.
- a polynomial expression can be formulated involving unknowns and coefficients, and this expression can be adapted to fit, as well as possible, to the individual values of the sensitivity parameter arrays S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 .
- the values of the individual sensitivity parameter arrays can be confirmed to each other so as to find the one set of sensitivity parameters that is the best fit across the range of masses that were used in the calibration process.
- the set of sensitivity parameters that is selected as a result of this process can be provided to force sensing circuitry for use in detecting force on a touchpad.
- force sensing circuitry can perform a selection of one or more particular sets of sensitivity parameters.
- the sensitivity parameter selection circuitry 904 can initially select, say, the array S 2 to be used. Based on applying the array S 2 to the obtained readings, it may be determined whether the thus estimated force (or mass) is more closely related to the array S 2 than to another of the available sensitivity parameter arrays. If the outcome is yes, then the determined force/mass can be used as the received force input.
- the estimated force/mass is more closely related to another of the sensitivity parameter arrays, then that array (e.g., one of the arrays S 1 , S 3 , or S 4 in this example) can instead be applied to the reading and the resulting determined force/mass can be used as the received force input.
- that array e.g., one of the arrays S 1 , S 3 , or S 4 in this example
- One or more validations can be performed after at least one calibration process.
- the physical object 1106 can be placed at a location that was not part of the calibration process (e.g., determined by the location selection circuitry 810 in FIG. 8 ), and another force determination can be performed using the selected set(s) of sensitivity parameters.
- the physical object 1106 can be placed at a location 1108 F that is different than the locations 1108 A-E, and readings can be registered using the force sensors 1102 A-D. For example, this may involve using a set of sensitivity parameters that is the result of polynomial fitting from respective sets of sensitivity parameters associated with corresponding weights used in the calibration process.
- this may involve beginning with a default (e.g., selected) set of sensitivity parameters and obtaining an estimate force/mass result, and thereafter selecting another set of sensitivity parameters based on the estimate and performing another determination.
- the force (or mass) determined based on the readings at the location 1108 F can be compared with the known force (mass) value.
- the validation can either indicate that the touchpad is properly calibrated using the set of sensitivity parameters, or that it may be necessary to perform another calibration.

- the weight selection circuitry 808 can output an instruction on the user interface 822 for the calibration operator to select another mass. The result may be that a number of sensitivity parameter arrays have been selected for respective different weights. For example, the sensitivity parameter arrays S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 described with reference to FIG. 11 can result, each associated with a different mass.

For example, the trackpad can perform this determination regularly, such as every minute, second, or fraction of second, to name just a few possibilities.

Abstract
Description
F=S*D,
where the force F may be measured in Newton or an equivalent unit, the reading D may be measured in a unit that represents to detected gap in the trackpad, such as a number of counts by a digital detector, and the sensitivity parameter S may have a unit of Newton per counts. That is, by multiplying the obtained sensor output with the selected sensitivity parameter, the estimated force is obtained.
where D1 . . . Dm are the readings from sensors 1 through m, respectively, and O1 . . . Om are the zero offset values associated with the sensors 1 through m, respectively. Accordingly, when each of the values of the reading vector D equals the corresponding value of the zero offset vector O, the resulting reading value is zero, and a resulting force of zero will be detected. However, when one or more of the readings D1 . . . Dm differs from the corresponding zero offset values O1 . . . Om, a net force F is detected. For example, this reading can occur when a user touches the trackpad with a finger or a stylus.
where each row of the D readings array corresponds to the readings registered when the physical object 1108 is at a respective one of the
min ∥F−DS∥ 2,
which involves the known force values (F) and the readings (D). Here, F is a vector, D is a sensing matrix, and S is also a vector. The sensitivity parameters of the array S are to be selected so that the value of the expression is minimized.
where the index x=1 may correspond to a 300 g mass, the index x=2 may correspond to a 200 g mass, the index x=3 may correspond to a 500 g mass, and the index x=4 may correspond to a 700 g mass, to name just a few examples. The above sensitivity parameter arrays will here be referred to as S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively, where only the index x (for the corresponding mass) is used. The sensitivity parameter arrays S1, S2, S3, and S4 can be used individually (for example as illustrated below), or further processing can be performed, such as along the lines of the following example.
