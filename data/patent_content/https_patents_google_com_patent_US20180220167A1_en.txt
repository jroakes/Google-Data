Definitions
- This specification relates to information tracking and presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet.
- Video content items can be presented to users in response to a request, such as request to view a selected video content item by selecting a link or otherwise navigating to a video resource hosted by a video hosting service. Once viewed, a user can perform one or more follow on actions in a same session or over a predetermined time period corresponding to plural sessions. Such activities may be of interest to the sponsor of the video resource or others.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item.
- the method comprises: determining that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item; tracking specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surfacing the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product embodied in a tangible medium that when executed by a processor cause the processor to: determine that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item; track specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surface the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
- a system includes a content management system, a video sharing system, and a campaign-management user interface.
- the content management system is configured to: determine that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item in the video sharing system; track specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surface the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item on the campaign-management user interface.
- the sponsored video content item can be a paid video advertisement.
- the activities can include follow on views on the channel.
- the activities can include unique follow on views.
- the activities can include subscribing and unsubscribing.
- the activities can include subscribing and unsubscribing to the channel.
- the activities can include designating a video, marking a video, sharing a video, embedding a video, or commenting on a video.
- Tracking can include recording in a view log sponsored views of the sponsored video content item, recording in an activities log activities of a user on a per channel basis, and correlating the view log and the activities log to determine activities that occurred after a paid view was recorded.
- Surfacing can include enabling the sponsor to designate which activities to surface.
- Surfacing can include reporting follow on views and subscriptions that occurred after a paid view.
- Surfacing can include presenting a user interface to the sponsor that identifies the specific activities along with other view data for the sponsored video content item.
- Tracking can include tracking a last sponsored video content item view in a given channel.
- the time period can be defined by the sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
- the time period can be a predetermined time period.
- the predetermined time period can be, for example, substantially twenty four hours.
- the predetermined time period can be based on a start and end of a session.
- the session can be started at a time right after the sponsored video content item is viewed.
- the session can end at a next start time of a presentation of the sponsored video content item on the channel to the user.
- Particular implementations may realize one or more of the following advantages. Activities that occur on a channel after a presentation of a sponsored video content item can be attributed to the video content item.
- a video content item sponsor can become aware of activities that occur following presentation of a sponsored video content item.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a series of example user activities.
- FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate example user interfaces.
- FIGS. 5 and 6 are flowcharts of example processes for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item.
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- Specific activities performed by a user can be tracked after determining that the user has been presented a sponsored video content item and the specific activities can be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. For example, activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item occurring in a specified time period can be identified. The user can view another video resource on the channel, subscribe to or unsubscribe from the channel, or share or designate a video resource on the channel, to name a few examples. After tracking the specific activities, the specific activities can be surfaced to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item, such as in a user interface or report. Examples of sponsored video content items can include video advertisements. In some implementations, sponsored video content items can include paid video advertisements that include compensation paid by an advertiser to a publisher associated with the paid video advertisement. In some implementations, a paid video advertisement is paid, in that, when viewed, a content management system credits a publisher of the video advertisement while debiting an advertiser associated with the paid video advertisement.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , publishers, a video sharing environment 109 , and a content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content providers 108 .
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 113 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the content providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible.
- a content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more video content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- the content provider 108 can create, for example, a video campaign or some other type of campaign.
- the content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 111 which define the content campaign.

- Campaign parameters 111 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., a creative, such as a video content item), targeting criteria, and one or more settings related to tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item (e.g., a paid video advertisement).
- Targeting criteria can include, for example, a targeted language, one or more targeted geographical locations or websites, and one or more targeting terms.
- Settings related to tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item can include, for example, a user-specified time period for which to track activities (e.g., activities may be tracked, for example, for one session, or one time period (such as twenty four hours, one week, thirty days, or some other user-specified time amount after a sponsored video content item has been presented)).
- Other settings may include an indication of which activities to track and/or which activities to display in one or more reports.
- the content provider 108 can specify to track or to report on views of another video on the same channel as the channel that includes the sponsored video content item (e.g., a “follow-on view”), subscription-related information, sharing of a video, other designations of a video (e.g., “liking”, adding to a favorites), or other activity occurring on the channel that includes the sponsored video content item.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 111 specified by the content provider 108 .
- the video sharing environment 109 allows users and content providers 108 , using the user devices 106 , to upload and make available video content items.
- the video sharing environment 109 may include, for example, multiple channels, where each channel may be associated, for example, with one or more content providers 108 , one or more particular users, or a particular type of video content.
- the content provider 108 can, for example, associate one or more targeting keywords with each video content item that is included in a video campaign and/or can associate a video content item in a video campaign with one or more user video content items that are stored in a repository 120 .
- the content provider 108 can provide, for example, one or more sponsored video content items.
- the content provider 108 can provide or identify one or more sponsored video content items (e.g., paid video advertisements) to be used for one or more video campaigns.
- video formats can exist, including, but not limited to a search-result-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided as part of a search result), a selected-from-group format (e.g., a video that is provided in response to a selection made from a slate of available videos), an in-display format (e.g., a video that is provided as a user-selectable thumbnail within a banner or other display), or a stream-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided before, during or after another content item in a stream).
- Other types of formats other than video formats can be used, for example, an audio-only format or an audio format that is used with a static image. Other formats are possible.
- a user device 106 can, for example, request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- a user device 106 can request a video content item hosted by the video sharing environment 109 .
- user devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 113 over the network 102 and one or more links to video content items hosted by the video sharing environment can be provided as search results.
- the search system 113 can access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 113 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in one or more search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 113 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title or video title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page or video, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- a request for content can be received by the content management system 110 from a user device 106 .
- the request for content can be associated with, for example, a request for a resource 105 , a search query 116 , or request for a particular video content item.
- the content management system 110 can select one or more content items to provide in response to the request.
- the request for content can include characteristics (e.g., size, supported media types) of one or more content “slots” that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page.
- resource keywords associated with a requested resource 105 or a search query 116 can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- Content items selected by the content management system 110 can include video content items (e.g., a paid video advertisement) or other content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of content slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- video content items e.g., a paid video advertisement
- content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 116 can be selected by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can also select content items at least in part based on the results of an auction.
- the selected content item(s) can be sent to the user device 106 , for presentation on the user device 106 .
- the presentation of a content item such as a paid video advertisement can be recorded, for example, in a view log 121 .
- Activities of users can be recorded, in an activities log 122 , on a per channel basis.
- a follow-on activities tracker 124 can, such as periodically, correlate the view log 121 and the activities log 124 to determine activities that occurred after a sponsored view was recorded and to attribute the activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. For example, for a particular presentation of a paid video advertisement, activities of the user in a channel associated with the paid video advertisement occurring in a specified time period can be identified in the activities log 124 .
- activity log information indicating that the user viewed another video on the channel, subscribed to or unsubscribed from the channel, or shared or designated a video on the channel may be identified, to name a few examples.
- the identified activities can be surfaced to the content provider 108 who provided the sponsored video content item, such as in one or more reports 126 , or in some other user interface, such as a campaign management user interface.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a series 200 of example user activities 202 - 218 .
- the user views a sponsored video content item that has been uploaded by a user “X” ( 202 ). Subsequent activities of the user can be tracked in a specified time period and activities occurring in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item can be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. Activities of the user occurring in the time period that are not associated with the channel might not be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item.
- the user views videos that have been uploaded by users “Y” ( 204 ), “X” ( 206 ), and “Z” ( 208 ). The viewing of the videos from users “Y” and “Z” are not attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item and the viewing of the video from the user “X” is attributed to the sponsored video content item (e.g., as illustrated by text 207 ).
- Activities other than views can be attributed to the sponsored video content item.
- the user subscribes to the channel associated with the sponsored video content item ( 210 ), designates (e.g., “plus one”, “likes”) a video from the user “X” ( 212 ), and shares a video from the user “X” ( 214 ).
- Each of these three activities are attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item (e.g., as illustrated by text 211 , 213 , and 215 , respectively).
- the user next views another video from the user “Z” ( 216 ), and this view is not attributed to the sponsored video content item.
- the user next views a sponsored video content item from a user “A” ( 218 ).
- This view is not attributed to the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”, and, as described above, a new session is initiated that is associated with the presentation of the sponsored video content item for the user “A.” Subsequent activities of the user can be tracked and activities occurring in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item from the user “A” can be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item from the user “A”.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example user interface 300 .
- the user interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign, such as a video campaign.
- the user can select a tab 302 to display a campaign area 304 .
- the user can view a list 306 of video campaigns by selecting a control 308 .

- follow-on views 320 , follow-on view rate 322 , follow-on subscribes 324 , and follow-on subscribe rate 326 are displayed.
- the follow-on views 320 indicates the total number of views of videos that occurred after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315 .
- the follow-on view rate 322 indicates a ratio of the follow-on views 320 to the number of times the paid video advertisement 315 was presented during the time period indicated by the control 312 .
- the follow-on subscribes 324 indicates the total number of subscriptions to the channel that includes the paid video advertisement 315 that occurred after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315 during the time period indicated by the control 312 .
- the follow-on subscribe rate 326 indicates a ratio of the follow-on subscribes 324 to the number of times that the paid video advertisement 315 was presented during the time period indicated by the control 312 .
- Summary follow-on information for all sponsored video content items in the campaign can be displayed in an area 328 .
- a graph of follow-on views is displayed in a graph area 330 .
- the user can select other information (e.g., information for subscriptions) to display in the graph area 332 using a control 334 .
- Other information other than follow-on views and subscription information can be displayed in the user interface 300 .
- information for unsubscribes, designations, shares, embeds, and other activities occurring on the channel associated with the paid video advertisement 315 after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315 can be displayed in the user interface 300 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 400 .
- the user interface 400 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign, such as a video campaign.
- the user can select a control 402 to display a settings area 404 .
- the settings area 404 includes, among other elements, areas 406 and 408 for selecting which performance information items and which conversion information items, respectively, to display in a campaign management interface, such as the user interface 300 described above with respect to FIG. 3 .
- the settings area 404 also includes a “follow-on” area 410 , which enables the user to select which items of information that have been tracked in response to and attributed to the presentation of a sponsored video content item are to be displayed in the campaign management interface.
- the “follow-on” area 410 includes controls 412 , 414 , 416 , and 418 , for selecting whether follow-on views, follow-on view rate, follow-on subscribes, and follow-on subscribe-rate, respectively, are to be displayed in the campaign management interface.
- the user can select a control 420 to configure a time period used for identifying activities of the user occurring within the time period after a presentation of a sponsored video content item. For example, the user has selected a time period of twenty four hours.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item.
- the process 500 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- a user views a video content item provided by a user “X” ( 502 ).
- the user “X” may be an advertiser.
- It is determined that the viewed video is a sponsored video content item ( 504 ).
- a first session is started, where the first session is associated with the sponsored video content item provided by the user “X” ( 506 ).
- the user views a video provided by a user “Y” ( 508 , e.g., on a channel associated with the user “Y”).
- the user “Y” may be, for example, another advertiser, or a non-advertiser user. It is determined that the video provided by the user “Y” is not a sponsored video content item ( 510 ). It is determined that there is not a started session associated with the user “Y” ( 512 , e.g., there is a started session associated with the user “X” but not with the user “Y”). The viewing of the video provided by the user “Y” is not attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item provided by the user “X”, since the unattributed video is provided by a user different than the user “X” associated with the session started in step 506 .
- the user views a video provided by the user “X” ( 514 , e.g., on a channel associated with the user “X”). It is determined that the video provided by the user “X” is not a sponsored video content item ( 516 ). It is determined that there is a started session associated with the user “X” ( 518 ). For example, the session started in step 506 may be identified.
- the view of the video provided by the user “X” (e.g., in step 514 ) is attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item provided by the user “X” ( 520 ). Attributed activities may be subsequently surfaced to the user “X”, for example, in one or more user interfaces available to the user “X”.
- the user views a second video content item provided by the user “X” ( 522 ). It is determined that the second video content item is a sponsored video content item ( 524 ).
- the first session is ended ( 526 ).
- a second session is started, where the second session is associated with the second sponsored video content item provided by the user “X” ( 526 ).
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an example process 600 for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item.
- the process 600 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 . It is determined that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item ( 602 ). For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , it may be determined that the user has been presented a sponsored video content item that has been previously uploaded from the user “X”. As another example, with respect to FIG. 3 , it may be determined that the user has been presented the paid video advertisement 315 .
- Tracking may include, for example, identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period. Tracking may also include attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item.
- the specified time period may be defined, for example, by the sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
- the sponsor can configure a time period using the control 420 .
- the time period may be a predetermined time period.
- a time period may be predefined, for example, by the content management system 110 .
- the time period may be predefined to be a session or a period of substantially twenty four hours or, as another example, thirty days.
- the content management system 110 can change a predefined time period to a different amount of time, such as based on monitoring and analyzing of user activity and/or in response to sponsor feedback.
- the predetermined time period may be based on a start and an end of a session.
- a session can be started at a time right after a sponsored video content item is viewed.
- a session can begin when the user views a sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”.
- the session can end at a next start time of a presentation of a sponsored video content item.
- the session that started with the viewing of the paid advertisement associated with the user “X” can end when the user views a paid advertisement associated with the user “A” (or, as another example, when the user views a second, different sponsored video content item that is associated with the user “X”).
- the session may include, for example, multiple web browser sessions.
- the identified activities can include, for example, follow-on views on the channel.
- a second video e.g., a follow-on video
- the follow-on view of a video can occur, for example, on a web page that is associated with the channel (e.g., a “channel page”).
- the follow-on view can occur on a web page that is associated with the video or that is otherwise associated with the channel that is associated with the sponsored video content item.
- an identified follow-on view can occur on a “watch page” that is specific to the video.
- the identified activities include unique follow-on views and may not include duplicate follow-on views. For instance, in the example of FIG. 2 , in some implementations, if the user views the same follow-on video multiple times, each of the multiple views of the follow-on video are tracked and are attributed to the viewing of the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”. In some implementations, only the first view of the follow-on video is attributed to the viewing of the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”.
- Activities other than follow-on views can be identified.
- a user subscribing or unsubscribing to the channel may be identified and may be attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item.
- a user sharing the sponsored video content item or another video on the channel may be identified and may be attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item.
- the user designating the sponsored video content item or another video e.g., “liking”, adding a video to a favorites list
- Other user activities occurring on the channel may be identified and attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item, such as the user embedding a video.
- paid views of the sponsored video content item are recorded in a view log.
- Activities of a user may be recorded in an activities log (e.g., a log separate from the view log), on a per channel basis.
- a last sponsored video content item view may be tracked in a given channel (e.g., in the view log) and the view log may be correlated with the activities log to determine activities that occurred after the paid view was recorded. Correlation may occur periodically (e.g., every hour).
- activities other than activities occurring in the channel associated with the sponsored video content item can be tracked and attributed to the view of the sponsored content item.
- activities occurring on other web pages associated with the sponsor of the sponsored content item can be tracked.
- user visits to and user activities occurring on a blog or a social media site associated with the sponsor in the specified time period can be tracked.
- the tracked activities can be attributed to views of other sponsored content items other than the sponsored content item.
- the content management system 110 can attribute the tracked activities to each of multiple (e.g., five) of the most recently viewed sponsored content items.
- the attribution can be weighted equally among the multiple recently viewed sponsored content items.
- a weighted attribution formula that gives more attribution to the most recently viewed sponsored content items can be used. For example, for the five most recently viewed sponsored content items, attribution weights of 40%, 30%, 15%, 10%, and 5% can be applied, respectively, with the most recently viewed sponsored content item receiving 40% of the weight.
- the specific activities are surfaced to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item ( 606 ).
- a report may be presented to the sponsor that includes, for one or more sponsored video content items, follow on views and subscriptions that occurred after a view of a respective sponsored video content item.
- a user interface may be presented to the sponsor that identifies the specific activities along with other view data for the sponsored video content item. For example, with respect to FIG. 3 , information for specific activities that occurred after presentation of the paid video 315 are displayed in the follow-on view area 318 , along with other view data for the paid video advertisement 315 that is displayed in the area 314 .
- the sponsor is enabled to designate which activities to surface. For example, with respect to FIG. 4 , the sponsor can designate which activities to surface using the area 410 .

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item. A method includes: determining that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item; tracking specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surfacing the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
Description
- This specification relates to information tracking and presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Video content items can be presented to users in response to a request, such as request to view a selected video content item by selecting a link or otherwise navigating to a video resource hosted by a video hosting service. Once viewed, a user can perform one or more follow on actions in a same session or over a predetermined time period corresponding to plural sessions. Such activities may be of interest to the sponsor of the video resource or others.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item. The method comprises: determining that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item; tracking specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surfacing the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product embodied in a tangible medium that when executed by a processor cause the processor to: determine that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item; track specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surface the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems that include a system for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item. A system includes a content management system, a video sharing system, and a campaign-management user interface. The content management system is configured to: determine that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item in the video sharing system; track specific activities after the presentation including identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period and attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item; and surface the specific activities to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item on the campaign-management user interface.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The sponsored video content item can be a paid video advertisement. The activities can include follow on views on the channel. The activities can include unique follow on views. The activities can include subscribing and unsubscribing. The activities can include subscribing and unsubscribing to the channel. The activities can include designating a video, marking a video, sharing a video, embedding a video, or commenting on a video. Tracking can include recording in a view log sponsored views of the sponsored video content item, recording in an activities log activities of a user on a per channel basis, and correlating the view log and the activities log to determine activities that occurred after a paid view was recorded. Surfacing can include enabling the sponsor to designate which activities to surface. Surfacing can include reporting follow on views and subscriptions that occurred after a paid view. Surfacing can include presenting a user interface to the sponsor that identifies the specific activities along with other view data for the sponsored video content item. Tracking can include tracking a last sponsored video content item view in a given channel. The time period can be defined by the sponsor of the sponsored video content item. The time period can be a predetermined time period. The predetermined time period can be, for example, substantially twenty four hours. The predetermined time period can be based on a start and end of a session. The session can be started at a time right after the sponsored video content item is viewed. The session can end at a next start time of a presentation of the sponsored video content item on the channel to the user.
- Particular implementations may realize one or more of the following advantages. Activities that occur on a channel after a presentation of a sponsored video content item can be attributed to the video content item. A video content item sponsor can become aware of activities that occur following presentation of a sponsored video content item.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 7 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Specific activities performed by a user can be tracked after determining that the user has been presented a sponsored video content item and the specific activities can be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. For example, activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item occurring in a specified time period can be identified. The user can view another video resource on the channel, subscribe to or unsubscribe from the channel, or share or designate a video resource on the channel, to name a few examples. After tracking the specific activities, the specific activities can be surfaced to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item, such as in a user interface or report. Examples of sponsored video content items can include video advertisements. In some implementations, sponsored video content items can include paid video advertisements that include compensation paid by an advertiser to a publisher associated with the paid video advertisement. In some implementations, a paid video advertisement is paid, in that, when viewed, a content management system credits a publisher of the video advertisement while debiting an advertiser associated with the paid video advertisement.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information (such as activities of a user) or personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108, publishers, avideo sharing environment 109, and acontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andcontent providers 108. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - To facilitate searching of
resources 105, theenvironment 100 can include asearch system 113 that identifies theresources 105 by crawling and indexing theresources 105 provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 can be stored in anindexed cache 114. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - The
content providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. Acontent provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more video content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. Thecontent provider 108 can create, for example, a video campaign or some other type of campaign. - The
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 111 which define the content campaign. Thecampaign parameters 111 can be stored in aparameters data store 112.Campaign parameters 111 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., a creative, such as a video content item), targeting criteria, and one or more settings related to tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item (e.g., a paid video advertisement). Targeting criteria can include, for example, a targeted language, one or more targeted geographical locations or websites, and one or more targeting terms. - Settings related to tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item can include, for example, a user-specified time period for which to track activities (e.g., activities may be tracked, for example, for one session, or one time period (such as twenty four hours, one week, thirty days, or some other user-specified time amount after a sponsored video content item has been presented)). Other settings may include an indication of which activities to track and/or which activities to display in one or more reports. For example, the
content provider 108 can specify to track or to report on views of another video on the same channel as the channel that includes the sponsored video content item (e.g., a “follow-on view”), subscription-related information, sharing of a video, other designations of a video (e.g., “liking”, adding to a favorites), or other activity occurring on the channel that includes the sponsored video content item. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 111 specified by thecontent provider 108. - The
video sharing environment 109 allows users andcontent providers 108, using theuser devices 106, to upload and make available video content items. Thevideo sharing environment 109 may include, for example, multiple channels, where each channel may be associated, for example, with one ormore content providers 108, one or more particular users, or a particular type of video content. Thecontent provider 108 can, for example, associate one or more targeting keywords with each video content item that is included in a video campaign and/or can associate a video content item in a video campaign with one or more user video content items that are stored in arepository 120. Thecontent provider 108 can provide, for example, one or more sponsored video content items. - The
content provider 108 can provide or identify one or more sponsored video content items (e.g., paid video advertisements) to be used for one or more video campaigns. Different types of video formats can exist, including, but not limited to a search-result-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided as part of a search result), a selected-from-group format (e.g., a video that is provided in response to a selection made from a slate of available videos), an in-display format (e.g., a video that is provided as a user-selectable thumbnail within a banner or other display), or a stream-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided before, during or after another content item in a stream). Other types of formats other than video formats can be used, for example, an audio-only format or an audio format that is used with a static image. Other formats are possible. - A
user device 106 can, for example, requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. As another example, auser device 106 can request a video content item hosted by thevideo sharing environment 109. As yet another example,user devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 113 over thenetwork 102 and one or more links to video content items hosted by the video sharing environment can be provided as search results. - In response to a
search query 116, thesearch system 113 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 113 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in one or more search results pages. In some implementations, asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 113 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title or video title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page or video, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - A request for content can be received by the
content management system 110 from auser device 106. The request for content can be associated with, for example, a request for aresource 105, asearch query 116, or request for a particular video content item. Thecontent management system 110 can select one or more content items to provide in response to the request. For example, the request for content can include characteristics (e.g., size, supported media types) of one or more content “slots” that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. As another example, resource keywords associated with a requestedresource 105 or asearch query 116 can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Content items selected by thecontent management system 110 can include video content items (e.g., a paid video advertisement) or other content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of content slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. For example, content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 116 can be selected by thecontent management system 110. Thecontent management system 110 can also select content items at least in part based on the results of an auction. The selected content item(s) can be sent to theuser device 106, for presentation on theuser device 106. - The presentation of a content item such as a paid video advertisement can be recorded, for example, in a
view log 121. Activities of users can be recorded, in an activities log 122, on a per channel basis. A follow-onactivities tracker 124 can, such as periodically, correlate theview log 121 and the activities log 124 to determine activities that occurred after a sponsored view was recorded and to attribute the activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. For example, for a particular presentation of a paid video advertisement, activities of the user in a channel associated with the paid video advertisement occurring in a specified time period can be identified in the activities log 124. For example, activity log information indicating that the user viewed another video on the channel, subscribed to or unsubscribed from the channel, or shared or designated a video on the channel may be identified, to name a few examples. The identified activities can be surfaced to thecontent provider 108 who provided the sponsored video content item, such as in one ormore reports 126, or in some other user interface, such as a campaign management user interface. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a series 200 of example user activities 202-218. The user views a sponsored video content item that has been uploaded by a user “X” (202). Subsequent activities of the user can be tracked in a specified time period and activities occurring in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item can be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. Activities of the user occurring in the time period that are not associated with the channel might not be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. For example, the user views videos that have been uploaded by users “Y” (204), “X” (206), and “Z” (208). The viewing of the videos from users “Y” and “Z” are not attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item and the viewing of the video from the user “X” is attributed to the sponsored video content item (e.g., as illustrated by text 207). - Activities other than views can be attributed to the sponsored video content item. For example, the user subscribes to the channel associated with the sponsored video content item (210), designates (e.g., “plus one”, “likes”) a video from the user “X” (212), and shares a video from the user “X” (214). Each of these three activities are attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item (e.g., as illustrated by text 211, 213, and 215, respectively). The user next views another video from the user “Z” (216), and this view is not attributed to the sponsored video content item. The user next views a sponsored video content item from a user “A” (218). This view is not attributed to the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”, and, as described above, a new session is initiated that is associated with the presentation of the sponsored video content item for the user “A.” Subsequent activities of the user can be tracked and activities occurring in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item from the user “A” can be attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item from the user “A”.

FIG. 3 illustrates anexample user interface 300. Theuser interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign, such as a video campaign. The user can select atab 302 to display acampaign area 304. The user can view a list 306 of video campaigns by selecting acontrol 308. The user can edit an existing video campaign in thecampaign area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 310) in the video campaign list 306. - The user can view information for a campaign for a particular time period. For example, the user can select a time range (e.g., Sep. 1 through Sep. 6, 2011) using a
control 312. Information for one or more sponsored video content items that are associated with the campaign can be displayed in anarea 314. For example, thearea 314 displays information for a paid video advertisement 315. Summary information for all sponsored video content items in the campaign can be shown in atotals area 316. - Information about activities that have occurred after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315 can be displayed in an
area 318. For example, follow-onviews 320, follow-onview rate 322, follow-on subscribes 324, and follow-onsubscribe rate 326 are displayed. The follow-onviews 320 indicates the total number of views of videos that occurred after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315. The follow-onview rate 322 indicates a ratio of the follow-onviews 320 to the number of times the paid video advertisement 315 was presented during the time period indicated by thecontrol 312. The follow-on subscribes 324 indicates the total number of subscriptions to the channel that includes the paid video advertisement 315 that occurred after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315 during the time period indicated by thecontrol 312. The follow-onsubscribe rate 326 indicates a ratio of the follow-on subscribes 324 to the number of times that the paid video advertisement 315 was presented during the time period indicated by thecontrol 312. - Summary follow-on information for all sponsored video content items in the campaign can be displayed in an
area 328. A graph of follow-on views is displayed in a graph area 330. The user can select other information (e.g., information for subscriptions) to display in thegraph area 332 using acontrol 334. Other information other than follow-on views and subscription information can be displayed in theuser interface 300. For example, information for unsubscribes, designations, shares, embeds, and other activities occurring on the channel associated with the paid video advertisement 315 after presentation of the paid video advertisement 315 can be displayed in theuser interface 300. -
FIG. 4 illustrates anexample user interface 400. Theuser interface 400 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign, such as a video campaign. The user can select acontrol 402 to display asettings area 404. Thesettings area 404 includes, among other elements,areas user interface 300 described above with respect toFIG. 3 . - The
settings area 404 also includes a “follow-on”area 410, which enables the user to select which items of information that have been tracked in response to and attributed to the presentation of a sponsored video content item are to be displayed in the campaign management interface. The “follow-on”area 410 includescontrols control 420 to configure a time period used for identifying activities of the user occurring within the time period after a presentation of a sponsored video content item. For example, the user has selected a time period of twenty four hours. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of anexample process 500 for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item. Theprocess 500 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . A user views a video content item provided by a user “X” (502). For example, the user “X” may be an advertiser. It is determined that the viewed video is a sponsored video content item (504). A first session is started, where the first session is associated with the sponsored video content item provided by the user “X” (506). - The user views a video provided by a user “Y” (508, e.g., on a channel associated with the user “Y”). The user “Y” may be, for example, another advertiser, or a non-advertiser user. It is determined that the video provided by the user “Y” is not a sponsored video content item (510). It is determined that there is not a started session associated with the user “Y” (512, e.g., there is a started session associated with the user “X” but not with the user “Y”). The viewing of the video provided by the user “Y” is not attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item provided by the user “X”, since the unattributed video is provided by a user different than the user “X” associated with the session started in
step 506. - The user views a video provided by the user “X” (514, e.g., on a channel associated with the user “X”). It is determined that the video provided by the user “X” is not a sponsored video content item (516). It is determined that there is a started session associated with the user “X” (518). For example, the session started in
step 506 may be identified. The view of the video provided by the user “X” (e.g., in step 514) is attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item provided by the user “X” (520). Attributed activities may be subsequently surfaced to the user “X”, for example, in one or more user interfaces available to the user “X”. - The user views a second video content item provided by the user “X” (522). It is determined that the second video content item is a sponsored video content item (524). The first session is ended (526). A second session is started, where the second session is associated with the second sponsored video content item provided by the user “X” (526).
-
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of anexample process 600 for tracking activities following a view of a sponsored video content item. Theprocess 600 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . It is determined that a user has been presented a sponsored video content item (602). For example, with respect toFIG. 2 , it may be determined that the user has been presented a sponsored video content item that has been previously uploaded from the user “X”. As another example, with respect toFIG. 3 , it may be determined that the user has been presented the paid video advertisement 315. - Specific activities are tracked after the presentation (604). Tracking may include, for example, identifying activities of the user in a channel associated with the sponsored video content item in a specified time period. Tracking may also include attributing the specific activities to the presentation of the sponsored video content item.
- The specified time period may be defined, for example, by the sponsor of the sponsored video content item. For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 4 , the sponsor can configure a time period using thecontrol 420. As another example, the time period may be a predetermined time period. A time period may be predefined, for example, by thecontent management system 110. For example, the time period may be predefined to be a session or a period of substantially twenty four hours or, as another example, thirty days. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can change a predefined time period to a different amount of time, such as based on monitoring and analyzing of user activity and/or in response to sponsor feedback. - The predetermined time period may be based on a start and an end of a session. For example, a session can be started at a time right after a sponsored video content item is viewed. For example, with respect to
FIG. 2 , a session can begin when the user views a sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”. The session can end at a next start time of a presentation of a sponsored video content item. For example, with respect toFIG. 2 , the session that started with the viewing of the paid advertisement associated with the user “X” can end when the user views a paid advertisement associated with the user “A” (or, as another example, when the user views a second, different sponsored video content item that is associated with the user “X”). The session may include, for example, multiple web browser sessions. - The identified activities can include, for example, follow-on views on the channel. For example, with respect to
FIG. 2 , after viewing the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”, the user views a second video (e.g., a follow-on video) from the user “X” and the second view is attributed to the presentation of the sponsored video content item. The follow-on view of a video can occur, for example, on a web page that is associated with the channel (e.g., a “channel page”). As another example, the follow-on view can occur on a web page that is associated with the video or that is otherwise associated with the channel that is associated with the sponsored video content item. For example, an identified follow-on view can occur on a “watch page” that is specific to the video. - In some implementations, the identified activities include unique follow-on views and may not include duplicate follow-on views. For instance, in the example of
FIG. 2 , in some implementations, if the user views the same follow-on video multiple times, each of the multiple views of the follow-on video are tracked and are attributed to the viewing of the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”. In some implementations, only the first view of the follow-on video is attributed to the viewing of the sponsored video content item associated with the user “X”. - Activities other than follow-on views can be identified. For example, a user subscribing or unsubscribing to the channel may be identified and may be attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item. As another example, a user sharing the sponsored video content item or another video on the channel may be identified and may be attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item. As yet another example, the user designating the sponsored video content item or another video (e.g., “liking”, adding a video to a favorites list) may be identified and attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item. Other user activities occurring on the channel may be identified and attributed to the view of the sponsored video content item, such as the user embedding a video.
- In some implementations, paid views of the sponsored video content item are recorded in a view log. Activities of a user may be recorded in an activities log (e.g., a log separate from the view log), on a per channel basis. A last sponsored video content item view may be tracked in a given channel (e.g., in the view log) and the view log may be correlated with the activities log to determine activities that occurred after the paid view was recorded. Correlation may occur periodically (e.g., every hour).
- In some implementations, activities other than activities occurring in the channel associated with the sponsored video content item can be tracked and attributed to the view of the sponsored content item. For example, activities occurring on other web pages associated with the sponsor of the sponsored content item can be tracked. For example, user visits to and user activities occurring on a blog or a social media site associated with the sponsor in the specified time period can be tracked.
- In some implementations, the tracked activities can be attributed to views of other sponsored content items other than the sponsored content item. For example, the
content management system 110 can attribute the tracked activities to each of multiple (e.g., five) of the most recently viewed sponsored content items. The attribution can be weighted equally among the multiple recently viewed sponsored content items. As another example, a weighted attribution formula that gives more attribution to the most recently viewed sponsored content items can be used. For example, for the five most recently viewed sponsored content items, attribution weights of 40%, 30%, 15%, 10%, and 5% can be applied, respectively, with the most recently viewed sponsored content item receiving 40% of the weight. - Referring again to
FIG. 6 , the specific activities are surfaced to a sponsor of the sponsored video content item (606). If the identified activities include, for example, follow-on views and subscriptions, a report may be presented to the sponsor that includes, for one or more sponsored video content items, follow on views and subscriptions that occurred after a view of a respective sponsored video content item. A user interface may be presented to the sponsor that identifies the specific activities along with other view data for the sponsored video content item. For example, with respect toFIG. 3 , information for specific activities that occurred after presentation of the paid video 315 are displayed in the follow-onview area 318, along with other view data for the paid video advertisement 315 that is displayed in thearea 314. In some implementations, the sponsor is enabled to designate which activities to surface. For example, with respect toFIG. 4 , the sponsor can designate which activities to surface using thearea 410. -
