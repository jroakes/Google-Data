Definitions
- This instant specification relates to voice recognition.
- Multimodal applications can accept multiple types, or modes, of input.
- a multimodal application can accept input from users such as typed commands and mouse clicks; however the multimodal application also can accept other forms of input such as voice input.
- Voice recognition systems can interpret the voice input using a grammar that includes a particular vocabulary.
- Some multimodal applications implement a form-filling model where different input fields in an application are associated with different grammars.
- the multimodal application can associate a “name” grammar that includes a vocabulary of names with a “name” field that accepts a person's name.
- the multimodal application can select the “name” grammar associated with the field.
- this document describes selecting a grammar for use in voice recognition, where the grammar is selected based on implicit context information based on one or more user actions.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving geographical information derived from a non-verbal user action associated with a first computing device.
- the non-verbal user action implies an interest of a user in a geographic location.
- the method also includes identifying a grammar associated with the geographic location using the derived geographical information and outputting a grammar indicator for use in selecting the identified grammar for voice recognition processing of vocal input from the user.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving context information based on a user action associated with a computing device, where the user action is unprompted by a voice recognition processor.
- the method includes deriving a geographical location based on the context information, identifying a grammar associated with the geographical location, and outputting a grammar identifier for use in selecting the grammar to use in processing vocal input from the user.
- a system in yet another general aspect, includes an interface to receive context information based on a non-verbal user action associated with a first computing device.
- the non-verbal user action implies an interest of a user in a geography.
- the system also includes a means for identifying a grammar associated with a geographical location derived from the received context information and a voice recognition server configured to use the identified grammar to interpret vocal input received from the user.
- a system can increase the speed at which vocal input is recognized by identifying an appropriate subset of grammars instead of using a larger general grammar. Additionally, selecting a subset of grammars may increase the accuracy of voice recognition for vocal commands given within a particular context associated with the subset. The system also can reduce the amount of user interaction in voice recognition processes. Furthermore, additional or new grammars can be selected in a way that is transparent to a user (e.g., based on user interaction with a software application instead of based on explicit user answers to prompts by a voice recognition system).
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an exemplary system for selecting a grammar used in computer-implemented voice recognition.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an exemplary client and an exemplary audio processing system used in a selection of a grammar for voice recognition.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an exemplary method for selecting a grammar based on context information.
- FIG. 4 shows exemplary screenshots of a user interface for a client that interacts with an audio processing system.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the described systems and methods.
- an application can generate context information based on how a user interacts with a device running the application.
- the device can transmit the context information to a voice recognition system.
- the voice recognition system can identify a particular grammar that is associated with the context information and can subsequently use the identified grammar in audio recognition of vocal input received from the device (e.g., voice commands from a user of the device).
- context information includes geographical information. If a user views a map using a mobile browser on a cell phone, the cell phone can transmit information about a geographical location displayed by the map to a voice recognition system.
- the voice recognition system can identify the geographic location based on the received information and can select a grammar that includes a vocabulary of words, syntax, etc. associated with the geographic location. The voice recognition system can interpret subsequently received vocal input from the cell phone using the selected grammar.
- a user can opt in to permit devices associated with the user (e.g., through a unique identifier—such as a cookie—assigned to the user) to share context information with the voice recognition system. If a user opts out of sharing context information, the voice recognition system can use a default grammar or explicitly prompt a user for geographic or other context information for use in selecting a particular grammar to use in voice recognition processing.
- a unique identifier such as a cookie
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an exemplary system 100 for selecting a grammar used in computer-implemented voice recognition.
- the exemplary system 100 selects the grammar based on implicit context information that is generated as a result of user actions.
- the system 100 includes a client device 102 , a grammar selection server 104 , and a voice recognition server 106 .
- the client 102 transmits context information to the grammar selection server 104 , which uses the context information to select a grammar.
- a grammar selection server sends information about the selected grammar to the voice recognition server 106 , which uses the selected grammar to interpret audio input received from the client 102 .
- the client 102 may be a cell phone that is running a mobile browser 108 .
- a user can enter a search into the mobile browser to identify businesses that sell “ice huts.”
- the browser can display a map that shows related businesses in Canada, North and South Dakota, and Minnesota.
- the user may have previously entered a location identifier, such as a zip code, that is used by the browser to identify a location to show on the map.
- the user can enter the location identifier in a previous session and the browser may store the identifier for use in subsequent sessions (e.g., the location identifier can be stored as a cookie on the client).
- the cell phone runs a dedicated application 108 instead of the mobile browser 108 .
- the dedicated application 108 may not enable browsing of web pages, but can be configured to interface with a particular remote application, such as an online mapping application.
- the mobile browser or another application running on the cell phone 102 can transmit implicit geographical information 114 to the grammar selection server as indicated by an arrow labeled “1.”
- the context information includes implicit geographical information 114 that is based on the map displayed by the mobile browser 108 .
- implicit geographical information 114 can include coordinates that identify a center of the displayed map. In this example, the center of the map coincides with a location in the middle of Minnesota.
- a grammar selection server 104 can select 116 a grammar based on the received context information.
- a grammar selection server can access a data store 110 that identifies grammars 112 associated with geographical locations. Particular grammars can be associated with particular geographic locations.
- Each of the grammars 112 can include vocabulary that corresponds to vocabulary associated with the corresponding geographical location.
- a grammar associated with Minneapolis, Minn. can include words or phrases that describe businesses, points of interest, events, news, etc. that are located or occur in association with Minneapolis.
- the implicit geographical information 114 includes coordinates for a location positioned in the middle of Minnesota.
- the grammar selection server identifies a grammar that is anchored, or has a center, at a location that is closest to the middle of Minnesota.
- the grammar selection server can generate information 118 that identifies the grammar as indicated by arrows labeled “2A” and “2B.”
- the grammar selection server 104 transmits the identified grammar information 118 to the voice recognition server 106 as indicated by an arrow labeled “3.”
- the user can speak into the cell phone 102 , which transmits vocal input 120 to the voice recognition server 106 as indicated by an arrow “4.”
- the voice recognition server 106 can interpret the vocal input 120 using the grammar that was identified by the grammar selection server 104 .
- the recognition server 106 can perform one or more actions based on the vocal input.
- the voice recognition server 106 can transmit a response based on the vocal input back to the cell phone 102 as indicated by an arrow labeled “5.”
- a user of the cell phone 12 can audibly request a new search for “Paul Bunyan.”
- the cell phone 102 can transmit the vocal search request to the voice recognition server 106 .
- the voice recognition server 106 uses a grammar that is anchored, or centered, at a location near the center of Minnesota.
- the voice recognition server 106 uses this grammar to search sounds, words, phrases that correspond to the vocal input “Paul Bunyan.”
- a grammar anchored near or within Minnesota may include information used to interpret the name “Paul Bunyan” because this term is more frequently associated with information associated with Minnesota relative to other parts of the world.
- the voice recognition server 106 can transmit text “Paul Bunyan,” which corresponds to the vocal input from the cell phone 102 .
- the cell phone 102 can display the received text on the mobile browser 108 . If a user approves the translation performed by the voice recognition server 106 , the browser can initiate a new search by submitting the text “Paul Bunyan” as a search term to a search engine. In other implementations, the voice recognition server 106 can initiate the search using the term “Paul Bunyan” without approval or from the user of the cell phone 102 .
- the voice recognition server 106 can transmit the results from the search to the cell phone 102 without previously transmitting text recognized from the vocal input.
- the labeled arrows of FIG. 1 indicate an exemplary sequence of events that occur in the system 100 .
- the occurrence of events is not limited to the sequence shown.
- one or more steps in the sequence can occur in parallel.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an exemplary client 200 and an exemplary audio processing system 202 used in a selection of a grammar for voice recognition.
- the client 200 and the audio processing system 202 can communicate using a network 204 that can include, in some implementations, the Internet and a cellular network.
- the client 200 can include a cell phone or other mobile device 206 that, in turn, includes an application environment 208 .
- the application environment 208 can include an Internet browser 210 , a microphone interface 212 , and a GPS transceiver interface 214 .
- the audio processing system 202 can include a multimodal server 216 that servers an interface for the audio processing system 202 with the client 200 , a grammar selection server 218 , and a voice recognition server 220 .
- An application within the application environment 208 can generate or identifying geographical contact information 222 and transmit the information to the multimodal server 216 .
- the GPS transceiver interface 214 can receive GPS coordinates from a GPS transceiver based on a location of the cell phone 206 .
- the GPS transceiver interface 214 can transmit the GPS coordinate information to the multimodal server 216 .
- the GPS coordinate information can be appended as part of a uniform resource identifier (URI) that is included in a hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) POST command submitted by the browser 210 to the multimodal server 216 .
- URI uniform resource identifier
- HTTP hypertext transport protocol
- the application can generate an HTTP GET command, where a URI in the command includes the GPS coordinate information (or other context information).
- the GPS coordinate or other context information is not appended in the URI, but instead is included as binary information in the body of an HTTP request (e.g., GET or POST)
- the browser 210 can transmit geographical context information about items displayed by the browser 210 . For example, if a user views a web page that includes multiple mentions of the Bermuda Islands, the browser 210 can transmit geographical context information that specifies the Bermuda Islands.
- the multimodal server 216 can receive the geographical context information 222 and can forward the information to the grammar selection server 218 .
- a grammar selection server 218 can include a reverse geocoder 224 , which uses the geographical context information 222 to identify a location. For example, if the geographical context information 222 includes GPS coordinates, the reverse geocoder 224 can determine a location that corresponds to the GPS coordinates using stored mappings between coordinates and geographical locations.
- the grammar selection server includes a grammar index 226 that associates particular locations with particular grammars.
- the grammar index 226 associates the location “Bermuda Islands” with a Bermuda grammar that includes vocabulary, syntax, etc. that is associated with that location.
- the grammar selection server 218 selects a grammar using the grammar index 226 by identifying a grammar that is associated with a location identified by the reverse geocoder 224 .
- the grammar index can identify each of the grammars in using a grammar ID.
- the grammar selection server 218 can transmit a selected grammar ID 228 to the multimodal server 216 , which in turn can forward the grammar ID 228 to the voice recognition system.
- the reverse geocoder 224 can identify and return the grammar that is associated with a location nearest the identified location and then transmits a selected grammar ID 228 for that grammar to the multimodal server 216 .
- the voice recognition system can use the grammar ID to load identified grammar for use in subsequent audio processing.
- the voice recognition server can transmits a request 232 to a data store 230 for a grammar, where the request 232 includes the grammar ID 228 .
- the data store can return a grammar 234 that is specified by the grammar ID 232 .
- the voice recognition server can use the grammar 234 to interpret audio that is received subsequently from the cell phone 206 .
- the user can speak a search term, which is received by a microphone within the cell phone 206 .
- the microphone interface 212 can transmit audio 236 from the microphone to the multimodal server 216 .
- the multimodal server 216 can transmit the audio 236 to the voice recognition server 220 , which uses an audio decoder 238 to interpret the audio 236 .
- the audio decoder 238 can load the grammar 234 to process the audio 236 into a textual representation.
- the voice recognition server 220 can use the textual representation to, for example, initiate a search with a search engine (not shown).
- the interpreted audio can be transmitted as text 240 the multimodal server 216 .
- the multimodal server 216 can transmit the text 240 back to the cell phone 206 .
- the cell phone 106 can display the text using the browser 210 or another application in the application environment 208 .
- the client 200 submits new geographical context information based on new user interactions. For example, if the user changes location, the GPS transceiver within the cell phone 206 can transmit new GPS coordinates to the multimodal server 216 . In another example, the user may view a map that is associated with a different location. The browser 210 can transmit the new map location to the multimodal server 216 . The audio processing system can select a new grammar based on the new geographic context information and interpret received audio based on the new grammar.
- the multimodal server 216 the grammar selection server 218 , and the voice recognition server 220 are illustrated as separate devices, the servers can be combined into a single device or a single server can be implemented using multiple devices.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an exemplary method 300 for selecting a grammar based on context information.
- the systems 200 and 202 are used in an example implementation of method 300 . However, other systems, including the system 100 , can implement the method 300 .
- a session is created between the client 200 and the audio processing system 202 .
- the cell phone 206 can establish a communication session (e.g., based on HTTP protocols) with the multimodal server 216 .
- the session can be established, for example, when a browser access a web interface for a search engine (e.g., a search web page, an interactive map, a social networking site that permits users to search for profiles hosted on the site, etc.).
- the session is established, when a particular application is started on the cell phone 206 .
- a session may be initiated when a dedicated map program is started on the cell phone 206 .
- a user ID is received.
- the cell phone 206 may include a mobile browser that stores cookies within a memory of the cell phone.
- the cookies can include an identifier that identifies a user of the cell phone.
- the audio processing system 202 may have previously transmitted the user ID to the browser in response to an earlier interaction of the mobile browser with the audio processing system 202 or another server that the audio processing system 202 can access.
- the user may visit a web page that includes an interface for a search engine.
- the search engine can issue a unique identifier to the user.
- the audio processing system 202 can access a list of identifiers that are stored by the search engine.
- step 306 context information is received.
- the multimodal server 216 receives geographical context information such as GPS coordinates that specify a current location of the mobile device 206 .
- the multimodal server 216 can receive other context information such as application-specific context information.
- the client 202 can transmit information that specifies which application is accessed by a user.
- the information can specify that the user is interacting with a browser application.
- the information can include a history of past navigation or other actions previously performed by a user of the application.
- the context information can specify that a user has requested a map by specifying a zip code, zoomed out on the given map, navigated west on the map approximately 200 miles, requested a satellite view of the map, requested that points of interest be displayed on the map, etc.
- the multimodal server 216 can receive context information about items that are displayed by an application running on the client 200 , which may be a desktop computer.
- the user can view a portal web page that includes several types of content such as financial news content, entertainment news content, technology news content, etc. If the user's cursor hovers over the financial news content, the computing device can extract information from a region surrounding the cursor (e.g., text within a radius of the center of the cursor can be extracted). Some or all of the extracted information can be included in the context information transmitted to the multimodal server.
- a grammar is selected based on the received context information.
- the grammar selection server 218 can select a grammar that includes a financial vocabulary in the received context information indicates that the user's mouse is hovering over content describing financial information on a web page.
- a classification module (not shown) within the grammar selection server 218 can classify the extracted content.
- the grammar selection server 218 can match one or more keywords resulting from the classification of the extracted content with keywords that are associated with grammars by the grammar index 226 .
- the grammar selection server 218 can select a grammar associated with a particular geography, where the particular geography corresponds to the GPS coordinates, which indicate a current location of the cell phone 206 .
- the grammar selection server 218 can select a grammar including an application-specific vocabulary if the received context information specifies that the user is interacting with a particular application. For example, if the user is interacting with a calendar application (e.g., resident on the client 200 or hosted and accessed via the browser 210 ), the grammar selection server 218 can select a grammar that includes a calendar-specific vocabulary and calendar-specific grammar rules.
- a calendar application e.g., resident on the client 200 or hosted and accessed via the browser 210
- the grammar selection server 218 can select a grammar that includes a calendar-specific vocabulary and calendar-specific grammar rules.
- the grammar selection server 218 can also use the received user ID to select a grammar.
- a grammar may be constructed based on a user's past Web search history. For example, if a user frequently performed past web search queries associated with archaeology, a grammar builder (not shown) can construct a personalized grammar for the user that includes vocabulary, syntax, etc. associated with archaeology.
- more than one grammar can be selected using one or more types of context information. For example, context information derived from items viewed by a user may correlate to two more grammars. In this case, the grammar selection server can select multiple grammars for use in the voice recognition.
- audio can be received.
- the user of the device 206 can speak into a microphone of the device 206 .
- the microphone interface 212 can transmits the speech captured by the microphone to the voice recognition server 220 .
- the received audio can be interpreted using the previously selected grammar.
- the voice recognition server 220 can access a data structure that stores grammars to select a grammar that the grammar selection server 218 identified.
- the audio decoder 238 can use the selected grammar to interpret the received audio.
- step 314 it is determined whether the session has timed out.
- the session established between the client 200 and the audio processing system 220 in step 302 can have a time limit. If the time limit is exceeded, the method 300 can end. In another implementation, if the session times out, the audio processing system 202 prompts the client 200 to establish a new session. In some implementations, limiting the session time may prevent a client from monopolizing the audio processing system, especially if the client is inactive for a long period.
- step 316 it is determined whether a context has changed. For example, a user may change locations. If the user moves to a new location, a GPS transceiver can update GPS coordinates in response to reflect the new location.
- the new context information can be received and processed as previously described in association with step 306 and subsequent steps.
- the user may access a different application, or view different at a data using the same application. The change in application or use of an application can initiate transmission of the new context information.
- the method 300 can repeat steps starting with step 310 .
- the audio processing system 202 can continue to use the previously selected grammar to interpret any received audio.
- FIG. 4 shows exemplary screenshots of a user interface for a client that interacts with an audio processing system that selects a grammar based on context information.
- the screenshot 400 includes a map 402 .
- a user can launch a browser for the client and log onto an online interactive map service such as GOOGLE Maps or YAHOO! Maps.
- the user can specify a location to map by entering a zip code, area code, city and state, or other location identifier. For example, the user can enter the zip code 95661.
- the map service can then transmit a corresponding map of Roseville, Calif. for display on the browser.
- the browser (or web page displayed by the browser) can present a search option window 404 .
- a user can interact with the search option window 404 to initiate a search for businesses, points of interests, locations, etc., and can display the results on the map 402 .
- the search option window 404 can accept “entered” searches as indicated by the option 406 . For example, a user can select the option 406 using a keypad. Alternatively, the user can speak the selection “Enter a new search.” The user can then enter a search via the keypad.
- the search option window can also accept spoken searches as indicated by the option 408 .
- a user can selection the option 408 using the keypad or by speaking the selection.
- the screenshot 410 shows an exemplary interface displayed after a user has selected the option 408 indicating the user desires to speak a new search.
- the client visually prompts the user to speak a type of business or business name.
- the diagram 412 illustrates a user speaking a search term “Fry's.”
- the client can prompt a user to speak other terms such as points of interest, geographical locations, etc.
- the user is not visually prompted to speak a search, but can initiate a search sua sponte.
- a browser may display a web page that displays technology news. The user could say, “Search for AJAX.”
- the client may audibly prompt a user to enter or speak a search or other vocal input.
- the user can press a key on the device—such as an “answer call” key on a cell phone—to indicate that the user would like to initiate a voice search.
