Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method of mitigating errors in a distributed speech recognition system.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for mitigating errors in a distributed speech recognition system.
- the present invention is suitable for, but not limited to, mitigating transmission errors affecting speech recognition parameters when they are transmitted over a radio communications link.
- Speech recognition is a process for automatically recognising sounds, parts of words, words, or phrases from speech. Such a process can be used as an interface between man and machine, in addition to or instead of using more commonly used tools such as switches, keyboards, mouse and so on. A speech recognition process can also be used to retrieve information automatically from some spoken communication or message.
- the speech to be processed is sampled a number of times in the course of a sampling time-frame, for example 50 to 100 times per second.
- the sampled values are processed using algorithms to provide speech recognition parameters.
- one type of speech recognition parameter consists of a coefficient known as a mel cepstral coefficient.
- Such speech recognition parameters are arranged in the form of vectors, also known as arrays, which can be considered as groups or sets of parameters arranged in some degree of order.
- the sampling process is repeated for further sampling time-frames.
- a typical format is for one vector to be produced for each sampling time-frame.
- the above parameterisation and placing into vectors constitutes what can be referred to as the front-end operation of a speech recognition process.
- the above described speech recognition parameters arranged in vectors are then analysed according to speech recognition techniques in what can be referred to as the back-end operation of the speech recognition process.
- the likelihood of errors being introduced into the speech recognition parameters, on being passed from the front-end to the back-end is minimal.
- the front-end part of the speech recognition process is carried out remotely from the back-end part.
- the speech is sampled, parameterised and the speech recognition parameters arranged in vectors, at a first location.
- the speech recognition parameters are quantified and then transmitted, for example over a communications link of an established communications system, to a second location.
- the first location will be a remote terminal, and the second location will be a central processing station.
- the received speech recognition parameters are then analysed according to speech recognition techniques at the second location.
- GSM global system for mobile communications
- UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
- the present invention provides a means to mitigate the effect of transmission errors such as those described above.
- a method of mitigating errors in a distributed speech recognition system as claimed in claim 1 .
- an apparatus for mitigating errors in a distributed speech recognition system as claimed in claim 13 .
- the present invention tends to provide means for mitigating errors which are particularly appropriate to the nature of a distributed speech recognition process, the properties of the speech recognition parameters employed therein and the vectors in which they are arranged.
- one or more speech recognition parameters in an identified group of vectors are replaced by respective replacement parameters determined by reference to one or more speech recognition parameters from a vector received after the identified group of vectors.
- determination of which speech recognition parameter or parameters are to be replaced is performed by predicting, from vectors received without error, a predicted value for each speech recognition parameter within said identified group of vectors, and replacing those speech recognition parameters within the identified group of vectors which are outside of a predetermined threshold relative to their respective predicted value, then the effect is to advantageously exploit the independent relationship in the errors between different parameters within a speech recognition vector.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of speech recognition parameters arranged in vectors corresponding to sampling time-frames of an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a process flow chart of an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of consecutively received vectors of an embodiment of the present invention.
- the speech recognition parameters are arranged in vectors corresponding to sampling time-frames as shown schematically in FIG. 1 .
- Speech signal 110 A portion of speech signal 110 to be processed is shown in FIG. 1 .
- Speech signal 100 is shown in greatly simplified form, since in practise it will consist of a much more complicated sequence of sample values.
- Sampling time-frames of which in FIG. 1 are shown a first sampling time-frame 121 , a second sampling time-frame 122 , a third sampling time-frame 123 and a fourth sampling time-frame 124 , are imposed upon the speech signal as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the speech signal is sampled repeatedly in the course of each sampling time-frame.
- the speech recognition process is one in which a total of fourteen speech recognition parameters are employed.
- the thirteenth speech recognition parameter employed is the zeroth cepstral coefficient, i.e. c 0 (m).
- the fourteenth speech recognition parameter employed is a logarithmic energy term, i.e. log [E(m)]. Details of these coefficients and their uses in speech recognition processes are well known in the art and do not require further description here. Moreover, it is noted that the invention can be carried out with other combinations of cepstral coefficients forming the speech recognition parameters, likewise with other choices or schemes of speech recognition parameters other than cepstral coefficients.
- the fourteen parameters for each sampling time-frame are arranged, or formatted, into a corresponding vector, also known as an array, as shown in FIG. 1 .
- Vector 131 corresponds to sampling time-frame 121
- vector 132 corresponds to sampling time-frame 122
- vector 133 corresponds to sampling time-frame 123
- vector 134 corresponds to sampling time-frame 124 .
- Such a vector can generally be represented as
- the speech recognition parameters are processed prior to transmission from a first location to a second location.
- the parameters from vector 131 are quantized. This is implemented by directly quantizing the vector with a split vector quantizer. Coefficients are grouped into pairs, and each pair is quantized using a vector quantization (VQ) codebook predetermined for that respective pair. The resulting set of index values is then used to represent the speech frame. Coefficient pairings, by front-end parameter are as shown in Table 1, along with the codebook size used for each pair.
- VQ vector quantization
- the closest VQ centroid is found using a weighted Euclidian distance to determine the index
- q j i,i+1 denotes the jth codevector in the codebook Q i,i+1 , N i,i+1 is the size of the codebook
- W i,i+1 is the (possibly identity) weight matrix to be applied for the codebook Q i,i+1
- the indices that are produced are then represented in the form of 44 bits. These 44 bits are placed in the first 44 slots, as shown by reference numeral 141 in FIG. 1 , of a bit stream frame 150 .
- the corresponding 44 bits produced for the following vector, namely vector 132 are placed in the next 44 slots, as shown by reference numeral 142 in FIG. 1 , of the bit stream frame 150 .
- the remaining bits of the bit stream frame 150 consist of 4 bits of cyclic redundancy code, as shown by reference numeral 146 in FIG. 1 , the value of the bits being determined such as to provide error detection, in a known fashion, for the whole of the 88 preceding bits of the bit stream frame 150 .
- the 44 bits provided from vector 133 are placed in the first 44 slots, as shown by reference numeral 143 in FIG. 1 , of a second bit stream frame 155 .
- the corresponding 44 bits produced for the following vector are placed in the next 44 slots, as shown by reference numeral 144 in FIG. 1 , of the bit stream frame 155 .
- the remaining bits of the bit stream frame 155 consist of 4 bits of cyclic redundancy code, as shown by reference numeral 148 in FIG. 1 .
- This arrangement is repeated for following vectors.
- the above described format of the bit stream frames, in which bit data from two vectors is arranged in a single combined bit stream frame is merely exemplary.
- each vector's data could instead be arranged in a single bit stream frame containing its own error detection bits.
- the number of slots per bit stream frame is merely exemplary.
- bit stream frames described above should not be confused with transmission frames that are then used in the transmission of the bit stream data over the communications link of the communications system in which the data is transmitted from a first location to a second location, for example the time division multiple access (TDMA) time frames of a GSM cellular radio communications system, which is the communications system employed in the embodiments herein described.
- the first location consists of a remote user station
- the second, i.e. receiving location consists of a centralised processing station, which can be located for example at a base station of the cellular communications system.
- the speech recognition parameters are transmitted from the first location to the second location over a radio communications link.
- the nature of the first location and the second location will depend upon the type of communications system under consideration and the arrangement of the distributed speech recognition process therein.
- bit stream frames are reconstituted from their transmission format at the second location after being received there.
- function box 210 shows the step of identifying a group comprising one or more of said vectors which have undergone a transmission error.
- error detection is carried out by comparing the 4 cyclic redundancy coding bits such as 146 , 148 with the contents of the respective bit stream frames 150 , 155 , using known cyclic redundancy code methods.
- the identified group of vectors consists of two vectors, that is the pair of vectors from the single bit stream frame. If, in another example, each bit stream frame with error detection means contained only one vector, then the identified group of vectors would be a single vector. It is to be appreciated that the exact form and technical reason determining how many vectors are in such an identified group will depend on the different ways in which the vectors have been arranged in bit streams, and moreover how an error detection method has been imposed on top of that. Particularly, error detection methods other than the cyclic redundancy coding employed in the present embodiment might provide other numbers of vectors in an identified group.
- subsidiary design choices of how to process the error information can also play a role in determining the number of vectors in an identified group. For example, with reference to the present embodiment, it could be decided for reasons of conserving processing power to only consider whether batches of bit stream frames contain an error, even if the error detection means were physically capable of more narrowly detecting the error.
- the speech recognition parameters are retrieved from the bit stream frames by carrying out a reverse version of the vector quantization procedure described above. More particularly, indices are extracted from the bit stream, and using these indices, vectors are reconstituted in the form
- Function box 220 shows the next step of the present embodiment, namely the step of replacing one or more speech recognition parameters in the identified group of vectors.
- the order of the different processing steps is carried out such that all of the received speech recognition parameters are retrieved from the bit stream frames and temporarily stored, prior to replacement of one or more speech recognition parameters.
- the one or more speech recognition parameters could alternatively be replaced by altering the bit stream information in a corresponding fashion before actually physically retrieving the speech recognition parameters, including the newly introduced replacement ones, from the bit stream format.
- FIG. 3 shows vectors 131 - 134 as already described with reference to FIG. 1 plus a further 6 vectors 135 - 140 received consecutively thereafter.
- the one or more speech recognition parameters in said identified group of vectors are replaced by respective replacement parameters determined by reference to one or more speech recognition parameters from a vector received after said identified group of vectors.
- Such reference to vectors received after the identified group of vectors provides a method which can be performed particularly effectively with respect to speech recognition, because the latency can be exploited advantageously to provide better performance from the back-end speech recogniser.
- To apply such methods involves the temporary storage of received vectors in a buffer before output to the back-end.
- the vectors received after the identified group of vectors are used to compute replacement values. There will therefore be an increase in the latency before the error mitigated vectors can be made available to the back-end.
- This latency will usually not be a problem for the back-end recogniser which, especially if it is part of a centralised server, will have sufficient computational resources to overcome temporary fluctuations in latency caused by such error mitigation methods.
- each vector of said group are replaced by replacing the whole vectors, and each respective replaced whole vector is replaced by a copy of whichever of the preceding or following vector without error is closest in receipt order to the vector being replaced. Since for the presently described mode of transmission and mode of error detection the group of identified vectors consists of a pair of consecutive vectors, then the first vector of said pair is replaced by the second vector of a preceding vector without error and the second vector of said pair is replaced by the first vector of a following vector without error.
- vectors 135 and 136 are identified as a pair of vectors having an error, the whole of vector 135 is replaced by a copy of vector 134 , and the whole of vector 136 is replaced by a copy of vector 137 , provided that vectors 134 and 137 are not themselves parts of pairs that have been identified as having undergone a transmission error. If, say, the pair of vectors 133 and 134 are indeed themselves also a pair of vectors with an error, then both vectors 135 and 136 will be replaced by a copy of vector 137 , the first known correct vector following them, because it is closer in receipt order to each of them than vector 132 which is the nearest known correct vector preceding them. In the latter scenario, vectors 133 and 134 will both be replaced by copies of vector of 132 , this being the vector closest in receipt order from amongst those vectors known to be correct.
- each respective replaced whole vector is replaced by a vector determined by means of an interpolation technique.
- interpolation technique will choose an appropriate interpolation technique according to the requirements of the particular speech recognition process under consideration. Examples of interpolation methods that can be employed are the following:
- linear interpolation under this method, for each parameter the values taken from one or more vectors before and after the vectors known to contain errors are used to determine a constant and gradient defining a straight line equation between them. The interpolated values which are used to replace each parameter in the vectors with errors are then calculated using the equation for the lines.
- backwards prediction this method involves taking one or more unerrored vectors after the vectors known to contain errors. For each parameter the replacement value is generated from a weighted sum of these vector elements in the sequence of vectors, this method being known as prediction. The weights are predetermined by training on the parameters of vectors from speech without errors.
- curve fitting this method involves taking one or more vectors before and after the vectors known to contain errors. This method is similar to linear interpretation, but instead of fitting to a straight line, fitting is instead carried out using a curve based on the good parameters and using the equation of the curve to create the replacement values for each parameter.
- the speech recognition parameters were replaced by way of replacing whole vectors.
- the speech recognition parameters within a vector are necessarily replaced.
- determination of which speech recognition parameter or parameters are to be replaced is performed by predicting, from vectors received without error, a predicted value for each speech recognition parameter within said identified group of vectors, and replacing those speech recognition parameters within the identified group of vectors which are outside of a predetermined threshold relative to their respective predicted value.
- a predicted value is determined for each of the speech recognition parameters c 1 ( 3 ), c 2 ( 3 ), . . . , c 12 ( 3 ), c 0 ( 3 ), and log [E( 3 )] of vector 133 and for each of the speech recognition parameters c 1 ( 4 ), c 2 ( 4 ), . . . , C 12 ( 4 ), c 0 ( 4 ), and log [E( 4 )] of vector 134 .
- the predicted value is determined by any suitable prediction method. For example, prediction techniques described above with respect to whole vectors, such as linear interpretation, backwards prediction and curve fitting, can be applied to individual speech recognition parameters.
- the correspondingly positioned parameters within the other vectors are used, e.g. in the case of calculating a predicted value for c 1 ( 3 ), the values of corresponding position speech recognition parameters c 1 ( 1 ), c 1 ( 2 ), c 1 ( 5 ), c 1 ( 6 ), and so on, are used.
- a predetermined threshold relative to the predicted value is employed.
- the threshold level is set according to the requirements of the particular process under consideration. It can be altered over time based on experience gained within the process under consideration or other processes, or trials or simulations or the like.
- the threshold level can also be varied automatically on an ongoing feedback basis. For example, it can be varied according to the level of errors being identified.
- the threshold level can also be a function of the predicted value.
- the threshold level can also be varied as a function of which speech recognition parameter, i.e. whether the parameter is c 1 (m) or c 2 (m) or c 3 (m) and so on, which is particularly advantageous when the invention is applied to speech recognition processes in which certain speech recognition parameters are more important to the success of the speech recognition process than others.
- the choice of the specified number is made according to the requirements of the particular speech recognition process under consideration. By replacing the whole vectors in this way, there is an advantageous tendency to eliminate speech recognition parameters which are likely to be in error even though they have fallen within the level of the above described thresholds.
- the speech recognition parameters are replaced by the respective predicted values used in the step of determining which speech recognition parameters are to be replaced. This is efficient in that these values have already been determined.
- those speech recognition parameters which are within a predetermined threshold relative to their respective predicted value are compared with a set of reference vectors to find a best match vector from said set of reference vectors, and those speech recognition parameters which are outside of a predetermined threshold relative to their respective predicted value are replaced by corresponding speech recognition parameters from said best match vector.
- vectors 133 and 134 are identified as a pair of vectors having an error. Further consider that the only speech recognition parameter from the two vectors to be determined out of threshold range is c 1 ( 3 ) from vector 133 . Then using a correlation technique the closest fit between the remainder of vector 133 and a set of reference vectors is determined.
- the number of reference vectors and the contents thereof are chosen according to the requirements of the particular speech recognition process under consideration. These choices will involve a trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity of the error correction compared to levels of processing required.
- the criteria for determining which reference vector represents the best fit, to the remaining parts of a vector after the out of threshold parameters are discounted, is also implemented according to the requirements of the particular speech recognition process under consideration.
- Known correlation techniques are employed, such as computing the Euclidian distance. How they are adapted to the present method is that only the vector elements that are within the threshold are included in the calculation of the distance.
- speech recognition parameters from one or more neighbouring vectors are also compared with the set of reference vectors and the best match with respect to a plurality of consecutive reference vectors is chosen.
- vectors 133 and 134 are identified as a pair of vectors having an error, and further that the only speech recognition parameter from the two vectors to be determined out of threshold range is c 1 ( 3 ) from vector 133 .
- the remainder of vector 133 i.e. speech recognition parameters c 2 ( 3 ), c 3 ( 3 ) . . . , c 12 ( 3 ), c 0 ( 3 ), and log [E( 3 )]
- the whole of surrounding vectors 132 and 134 are compared en bloc with respect to reference groups of 3 consecutive reference vectors.
- the step of identifying a group comprising one or more of said vectors which have undergone a transmission error consists of comparing the 4 cyclic redundancy coding bits such as 146 , 148 with the contents of the respective bit stream frames 150 , 155 , using known cyclic redundancy code methods.
- the step of identifying a group comprising one or more of said vectors which have undergone a transmission error can include assessment of the speech recognition parameters themselves.
- respective predicted values for the speech recognition parameters are determined. This is done in any one of the same ways as were described earlier above with respect to the embodiments determining which speech recognition parameters were to be replaced, although when this is being carried out as the sole means of identifying errors then of course it is not possible to include the detail included earlier above that only vectors received without error are used in the prediction calculation, other than in the sense of input to interpolation functions.
- One or more threshold levels relative to the predicted values are determined. This is also carried out in any of the same ways as were described earlier above with respect to the embodiments determining which speech recognition parameters were to be replaced. However, typically the thresholds employed here will be greater than those used in the earlier described situation. Also, it is noted that one or more threshold levels are determined.
- the vector groups considered to have undergone a transmission error are identified responsive to a weighted analysis of how many speech recognition parameters in a vector group are outside of each of said one or more threshold levels.
- the weighted analysis could be such that if the highly likely error threshold is exceeded then a score of 5 is allocated, and if an outside chance of an error threshold is exceeded then a score of 1 is allocated, and the group of vectors can be identified as having undergone a transmission error if the total score is 6 or more.
- the second of such further embodiments includes a step of determining a difference between corresponding speech recognition parameters from different vectors within a vector group.
- a difference between c 1 ( 3 ) and c 1 ( 4 ) is calculated, the difference between c 2 ( 3 ) and c 2 ( 4 ) is calculated, the difference between c 3 ( 3 ) and c 3 ( 4 ) is calculated, and so on.
- the vector groups considered to have undergone a transmission error are identified responsive to an analysis of how many of said differences are outside of a predetermined threshold level.
- An appropriate predetermined threshold level is set, and can be altered over time, making use of any of the same ways as were described earlier above with respect to the embodiments determining which speech recognition parameters were to be replaced.
- the group of vectors is identified as having undergone a transmission error if two or more of said calculated differences are outside of the threshold level.
- This choice of how many need to be outside the threshold level is merely exemplary, and will generally be chosen according to the requirements of the particular distributed speech recognition process under consideration.
- a further optional aspect can be applied to embodiments wherein as part of the vector quantization process speech recognition parameters are grouped into pairs, as described earlier above with reference to Table 1.
- the data processing steps described are carried out by a programmable digital signal processing device, such as one selected from the DSP56xxx (trademark) family of devices from Motorola.
- a programmable digital signal processing device such as one selected from the DSP56xxx (trademark) family of devices from Motorola.
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- Other possibilities also exist.
- an interface unit can be employed that interfaces between a radio receiver and a computer system forming part of a back-end speech recognition processor.
