- FIG. 2 is an example text segment illustrating referential and antecedent noun phrases.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of an overview of an example of determining coreference resolution using distributed word representations.
- FIG. 4 is an example text segment for which coreference resolution may be determined.
- FIGS. 5A-5K illustrate an example method to group noun phrases.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of determining coreference resolution using distributed word representations.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a block diagram of an example computer system.
- Coreference resolution may be achieved by identifying noun phrases that occur in a text segment, and grouping together those noun phrases that refer to the same entity. For example, in a given document, “Barack Obama” may be referred to as “Mr. Obama”, “Mr. President”, and “he”. The document may include additional noun phrases such as “Mr. Boehner”, “the Speaker”, “Mr. He”, and “diplomat”. The document may also include the sentence: “He addressed the gathered journalists at the White House.” Determining if “He” refers to the candidate antecedent noun phrase “Barack Obama”, “Mr. Boehner”, or “Mr. He” is part of the coreference resolution problem. The methods and apparatus disclosed herein may rank the candidate antecedent noun phrases associated with “He”, select the highest ranked candidate antecedent noun phrase, and associate “He” with the selected antecedent noun phrase.
- Coreference resolution is generally related to determining which noun phrases occurring in a text segment refer to the same underlying entity.
- An entity as used herein, may be a person, location, organization, title, concept, and so forth.
- a text segment may be, for example, all of the text in a document, part of the text in a document, a textual transcript of a document, an identified corpus of documents, and/or all or parts of the text in a collection of documents.
- a document may include a web page, a post on a social networking platform, an email communication, a text document, and/or multimedia content.
- a text segment may include content of one or more queries issued by a user (e.g., search query, navigational query, and locational directional query).
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a coreference resolution may be determined using distributed word representations.
- the example environment 100 includes a communication network 101 that facilitates communication between the various components in the environment.
- the communication network 101 may include the Internet, one or more intranets, and/or one or more bus subsystems.
- the communication network 101 may optionally utilize one or more standard communications technologies, protocols, and/or inter-process communication techniques.
- the example environment 100 may also include a client device 110 , a content database 120 , a coreference resolver 130 , a noun phrase segmenter 135 , and a ranking system 140 .
- the coreference resolver 130 may include the noun phrase segmenter 135 and/or the ranking system 140 .
- the coreference resolver 130 , the noun phrase segmenter 135 , and/or the ranking system 140 may be separate components of the environment.
- the client device 110 may execute one or more applications, such as a web browser 115 .
- the client device 110 may be, for example, a desktop computer, a laptop, a mobile phone, a computing device of a vehicle of the user (e.g., an in-vehicle communications system, an in-vehicle entertainment system, an in-vehicle navigation system), a wearable apparatus of the user that includes a computing device (e.g., a watch of the user having a computing device, glasses of the user having a computing device). Additional and/or alternative computing devices of the user may be provided.
- a noun phrase is a phrase that has a noun (e.g., a name) and/or indefinite pronoun (e.g., she, it, they) as its head token.
- the head token of a noun phrase determines its syntactic type. For example, in the phrase “dining room” the head token is “room”, thereby defining “dining room” as a noun phrase, instead of a verb phrase or an adjective phrase.
- the head token is “student”, thereby defining “student group” as a noun phrase, instead of a verb phrase or an adjective phrase.
- the phrase “PGA Player of the Year” the head token is “Player”.
- Noun phrases may be of one or more mention types including named, nominal, or pronominal.
- “Barack Obama”, “Michael Jordan”, “Marie Curie”, and “Tiger Woods” are named noun phrases.
- “President”, “NBA MVP”, “Professor”, and “PGA Player of the Year” are nominal noun phrases.
- “he”, “his”, “her”, and “him” are pronominal noun phrases.
- One or more noun phrases in a given text segment may be co-referential.
- Co-referential noun phrases refer to the same entity.
- “Barack Obama” may be referred to as “Mr. Obama”, “Mr. President”, and “he”.
- the nominal noun phrase “NBA MVP”, and the pronominal noun phrase “his” may both refer to the named noun phrase “Michael Jordan”.
- the nominal noun phrase “Professor”, and the pronominal noun phrase “her” may both refer to the named noun phrase “Marie Curie”.
- the nominal noun phrase “PGA Player of the Year”, and the pronominal noun phrase “him” may both refer to the named noun phrase “Tiger Woods”.
- a noun phrase may be a referring noun phrase and/or an antecedent noun phrase.
- An antecedent noun phrase is a noun phrase that precedes a given noun phrase in a text segment, and the given noun phrase refers to the antecedent noun phrase.
- the given noun phrase is also called a referring noun phrase.
- FIG. 2 an example text segment is illustrated.
- some noun phrases appearing in the text are underlined.
- the noun phrases “President”, and “he” are referring noun phrases that refer to the antecedent noun phrase “Barack Obama”.
- the noun phrases “NBA MVP”, “Jordan”, and “they” are referring noun phrases that refer to the antecedent noun phrase “Michael Jordan”.
- the noun phrases “PGA Tour Player of the Year”, “Woods”, and “they” are referring noun phrases that refer to the antecedent noun phrase “Tiger Woods”.
- the noun phrases “Madame Curie”, “her”, and “her” are referring noun phrases that refer to the antecedent noun phrase “Marie Curie”.
- a noun phrase may be an antecedent noun phrase, but not a referring noun phrase.
- each of the noun phrases “Barack Obama”, “Michael Jordan”, “Tiger Woods”, and “Marie Curie” is an antecedent noun phrase, but not a referring noun phrase.
- a noun phrase that introduces an entity for the first time in a text segment cannot be a referring noun phrase.
- a noun phrase may perform a dual role in a text segment, i.e., the noun phrase may be a referring noun phrase and an antecedent noun phrase. For example, with reference to FIG.
- each of the noun phrases “President”, “Jordan”, “Woods”, and “Madame Curie” is a referring noun phrase that refers to the antecedent noun phrases “Barack Obama”, “Michael Jordan”, “Tiger Woods”, and “Marie Curie”, respectively.
- each of the noun phrases “President”, “Jordan”, “Woods”, and “Madame Curie” is also an antecedent noun phrase for “he”, “they”, “her”, and “they”, respectively.

- the distributed word representations 310 may be determined for the unlabeled data in the text segment.
- the text segment 300 may be parsed (e.g., into a parse tree) and co-referential feature representations 320 of the one or more noun phrases may be extracted.
- the coreference resolver 130 may utilize the labeled data as a training set to determine learned coreference embeddings 330 of the one or more noun phrases based on the co-referential feature representations 320 .
- such learned coreference embeddings 330 may be based on optimizing a loss function relevant to coreference resolution.

- the ranking system 150 may determine ranked candidate antecedent noun phrases 340 for one or more candidate antecedents of a given noun phrase.
- the coreference resolver 130 may determine grouped noun phrases 350 based on the ranked candidate antecedent noun phrases 340 .
- the coreference resolver 130 may annotate the text segment 300 with co-referential indicators based on the grouped noun phrases 350 , to determine an annotated text segment with co-referential noun phrases 360 .
- the content database 120 may include labeled and unlabeled data associated with one or more languages.
- the content database 120 may include data related to words in a language, and distributed word representations associated with such words. Text segments including labeled data, parse trees, and referring features and/or antecedent features of one or more noun phrases may also be stored in the content database 120 .
- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data. The data of the database does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more geographic locations. Thus, for example, the content database 120 may include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- One or more noun phrases may be identified and the noun phrase segmenter 135 may identify distributed word representations for the one or more noun phrases.
- the distributed word representations are indicative of syntactic and semantic features of the one or more noun phrases.
- Syntactic features include syntactic configurations and constraints that may influence coreference relations among noun phrases.
- syntactic features may include grammatical gender agreement.
- Semantic features may include domain features, such as semantic agreement between selectional restrictions on a pronominal predicate argument and a semantic type of the antecedent.
- such features may depend on one or more semantic resources, such as type information in a knowledge base linked to potential antecedents, or unsupervised distributional models that may measure semantic compatibility between two noun phrases.
- the mention type of a noun phrase may be based on a mapping of the noun phrase to the mention type in a knowledge base.
- Contextually similar noun phrases may have distributed word representations that are proximate to each other in an embedded space.
- the noun phrases “Planet”, “Galaxy”, “constellation”, and “Cassiopeia” may be identified to have distributed word representations that are proximate to the noun phrase “Andromeda” based on contextual analysis of a text segment that describes astronomical objects; whereas the noun phrases “Helen”, “Troy”, “Greece”, “mythology”, and “Perseus”, may be identified to have distributed word representations that are proximate to the noun phrase “Andromeda” based on contextual analysis of a text segment that describes Greek mythology.
- the coreference resolver 130 may access the content database 120 to retrieve stored distributed word representations for the one or more noun phrases in the text segment.
- distributed word representations may be determined using one or more models, and the distributed word representations and associated models may be stored in the content database 120 .
- the one or more models may include, for example, a feed-forward neural network language model.
- a next-word probability of a word W t may be computed from a context of previous n words W t-n , . . . W t-1 .
- the model may consist of one or more layers, including a projection layer where each context word may be projected to an embedding vector.
- Such embedding vectors may, in turn, be concatenated to form an input to a hidden layer of the one or more layers.
- the model may also include an output layer that may represent a probability distribution of W t based on contextual analysis.
- the feed-forward neural network language model may include several variables, including the number of embedding vector dimensions, the size of a vocabulary, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer of the one or more layers, and so forth. Additional and/or alternate variables may be utilized, including an error used in a loss function, a learning rate for a stochastic gradient descent (“SGD”) utilized in determining the distributed word representation, and model architecture.
- the output layer for the feed-forward neural network language model may be determined in one or more ways as described herein.
- a neural transfer function (e.g., softmax activation function) may be utilized to calculate the output layer based on the projection layer and one or more hidden layers.
- a hierarchical neural transfer function may be utilized.
- the distributed word representations may be based on an unnormalized output layer.
- a hinge-loss function may be selected that associates a higher score with the word w selected from the correct next word than for a randomly selected incorrect word ⁇ from the vocabulary.
- the hinge-loss function may be selected to be:
- + max (0, x).
- the distributed word representations may then be determined, for example, based on training by back-propagation (e.g., utilizing a mini-batch SGD).
- the distributed word representations may be determined without language modeling, such as context based next-word probabilities.
- a skip-gram model may be utilized to optimize a distributed representation of a given word to predict words that surround the given word in a sentence.
- identifying the distributed word representations for each of one or more noun phrases may further include identifying a language for the one or more noun phrases, and determining the distributed word representations based on the language.
- Conventional and/or other techniques may be utilized to determine the syntactic and semantic features based on linguistic knowledge for a well-studied language such as English.
- two languages may include wide syntactic and/or lexical-semantic variations.
- Spanish has grammatical gender agreement between non-personal antecedents such as “la empresa”, meaning “the company” and co-referring pronouns such as “la”, meaning “it”.
- French has grammatical gender agreement between non-personal antecedents such as “un York”, meaning “a book”, and “les pneumonia”, meaning “the books”, and respective co-referring pronouns such as “le”, meaning “it”, and “ils” meaning “they”. Any features and rules that may be transferred from English (e.g., to Spanish, French) may fail to capture such gender agreement. Also, a large labeled text segment (e.g., with accurate coreference annotations) may not be available for multiple languages.
- the noun phrase segmenter 135 may identify a language and further access a labeled text segment in the identified language.
- the noun phrase segmenter 135 may additionally identify a large unlabeled text segment (e.g., with no coreference annotations) in the identified language and distributed word representations may be determined for the unlabeled text segment.

- the noun phrase j may belong to a ⁇ (i) if (j,i) is a negative training pair for coreference.
- this may be determined based on a training rule to learn coreference embeddings, where the training rule selects the members of a ⁇ (i) as noun phrases j that may not be candidate antecedents for i. For example, “Barack Obama” cannot be a candidate antecedent for “she”. Accordingly, the noun phrase “Barack Obama” may belong to the negative set of candidate antecedents a ⁇ (“she”) associated with the referring noun phrase “she”. Such positive and negative training pairs may be utilized to learn coreference embeddings as described herein.
- a loss function may be identified based on the positive and negative sets of candidate antecedents and the inner product f(i,j). In some implementations the loss function may be chosen to be indicative of the number of incorrect antecedents. For example, a loss function for a text segment D may be determined as:
- L ⁇ ( D ) ⁇ i ⁇ ⁇ j ⁇ ⁇ a + ⁇ ( i ) ⁇ ⁇ j ′ ⁇ ⁇ a - ⁇ ( i ) ⁇ ⁇ 1 + f ⁇ ( i , j ′ ) - f ⁇ ( i , j ) ⁇ + , where
- + max (0, x). Accordingly, if the incorrect candidate antecedents (members of a ⁇ (i)) exceed the number of correct antecedents (members of a + (i)) by one, then a loss may be incurred.
- the iteratively learned coreference embeddings ⁇ , ⁇ may be selected to minimize the loss function. Additional and/or alternative loss functions may be utilized to iteratively learn the coreference embeddings.
- a score may be associated with each pair of a candidate antecedent noun phrase and an associated referring noun phrase.
- the score may be based on the determined distance measures.
- a noun phrase i and its associated candidate antecedent noun phrase j may be associated with a pair (j,i), and a score for the pair may be determined based on a distance measure associated with the pair.
- the score for the pair (j,i) may be the inner product f(i,j).
- the ranking system 150 may rank the one or more candidate antecedent noun phrases associated with the referring noun phrase. The ranking may be based on the score for the pair comprising of the candidate antecedent noun phrase and the referring noun phrase. An antecedent noun phrase of the one or more candidate antecedent noun phrases may be selected based on the ranking. As described herein, for each of the one or more noun phrases in a document, candidate antecedents may be identified and ranked. In some implementations candidate antecedents associated with a referring noun phrase may be grouped based on the ranking and/or scoring. In some implementations the highest ranked candidate antecedent in each group may be selected as the antecedent noun phrase associated with the referring noun phrase.
- the grouping may be determined based on a graph.
- Each node of the graph may be representative of a noun phrase appearing in the document.
- a link may be associated with the pair based on the coreference relationship between the two nodes in the pair. However, not every pair of nodes may be associated with a link.
- a link may be a selection link, or a blocking link.
- a selection link is indicative of two nodes in a pair as being potentially co-referential noun phrases. For example, the pair (Barack Obama, he) may be associated with a selection link if the noun phrase “Barack Obama” is a candidate antecedent for the noun phrase “he”.
- a blocking link is indicative of two nodes in a pair as being potentially non-co-referential noun phrases.
- the pair (Barack Obama, she) may be associated with a blocking link based at least in part on a determination that the noun phrase “Barack Obama” cannot be a candidate antecedent for the noun phrase “she”.
- a selection link may be further associated with a score.
- a scoring link For example, in the text segment “Barack Obama met with John Boehner at the White House. The President told the Speaker that his primary concern was to avoid the fiscal cliff”, each pair (John Boehner, Speaker) and (John Boehner, his) may be associated with a score; the pair (John Boehner, Speaker) may be associated with a score more indicative of being potentially co-referential noun phrases than the pair (John Boehner, his). Accordingly, the pairs (John Boehner, Speaker) and (John Boehner, his) are scoring links.
- the candidate antecedents associated with the higher scores may be selected and/or scored, whereas the candidate antecedents associated with the lower scores may be blocked.
- a threshold may be identified and candidate antecedents associated with scores that satisfy the threshold may be selected and/or scored, whereas the candidate antecedents associated with scores that fail to satisfy the threshold may be blocked.
- the noun phrases may then be sorted into one or more groups based on the graph and the links.
- the coreference resolver 130 may associate an ordering for the noun phrases that appear in the document, where the ordering may be based on the order of appearance of the noun phrase in the document. For example, the underlined noun phrases in the text segment “Barack Obama met with John Boehner at the White House. The President told the Speaker that his primary concern was to avoid the fiscal cliff” may be ordered as “1. Barack Obama; 2. John Boehner; 3. President; 4. Speaker; and 5. His,” based on the order of their appearance in the text segment. In some implementations the coreference resolver 130 may iterate through the noun phrases in the order of their appearance in determining the one or more groups.
- the noun phrases appearing in a document may be ordered as ⁇ N 1 , N 2 , . . . , N t ⁇ .
- the coreference resolver 130 may next identify the second noun phrase N 2 . If the pair (N 1 , N 2 ) is associated with a blocking link, then N 2 is blocked from the group G 1 .
- the coreference resolver 130 may next identify the third noun phrase N 3 .
- G 1 ⁇ N 1 , N 2 ⁇
- N 3 is associated with a blocking link
- the pair (N 2 , N 3 ) is associated with a selection link
- G 2 ⁇ N 2 , N 3 ⁇ .
- the pair (N 2 , N 3 ) is associated with a blocking link
- the pair (N 1 , N 3 ) is associated with a selection link
- G 1 ⁇ N 1 , N 3 ⁇ .
- both pairs (N 1 , N 3 ), and (N 2 , N 3 ) may be associated with selection links.
- the determined scoring may be utilized to distinguish between the selection links as scoring links.
- the score that associated with the scoring link for (N 1 , N 3 ) may be higher than the score associated with the scoring link for (N 2 , N 3 ).
- the score associated with the scoring link for (N 2 , N 3 ) may be higher than the score associated with the scoring link for (N 1 , N 3 ).
- the scores associated with the scoring link for (N 1 , N 3 ) may be identical to the score associated with the scoring link for (N 2 , N 3 ). In such an instance, a new group may be created to include N 3 .
- a blocking link bars the inclusion of a noun phrase in a group; however a selection and/or scoring link may not guarantee inclusion is a group.
- the coreference resolver 130 may iterate through the noun phrases in the order of their appearance in determining the one or more groups based on the iterative process described herein.

- the coreference resolver 130 may next identify the third noun phrase “Duh.com”.
- the pairs (John Duh, Duh.com), and (founder, Duh.com) are associated with blocking links; therefore, the noun phrase “Duh.com” is blocked from the group G 1 .
- FIG. 5E illustrates the next step in the example iterative process to group the one or more noun phrases.
- the coreference resolver 130 may identify the next noun phrase “reporters”.

Description
|1−f w(x)+f ŵ(x)|+
where |x|+=max (0, x). The distributed word representations may then be determined, for example, based on training by back-propagation (e.g., utilizing a mini-batch SGD).
m i =[r(h i);t i ;e i ;l i],
where r(hi) is the distributed word representation of the head token hi associated with the noun phrase, ti is the type of mention associated with the noun phrase, ei is the type of entity associated with the noun phrase, and li is the number of words in the noun phrase, as described herein.
a j =[r(h j);d(i,j)],
where r(hj) is the distributed word representation of the head token hj associated with the noun phrase j, and d(i,j) is the length of a path between the referring noun phrase i and the candidate antecedent noun phrase j, as described herein. As another example, the antecedent feature representation aj for a candidate antecedent noun phrase j, associated with a referring noun phrase i may be
a j =[r(h j);t j ;e j ;l j ;d(i,j)],
where r(hj) is the distributed word representation of the head token hj associated with the noun phrase j, tj is the type of mention associated with the noun phrase j, ej is the type of entity associated with the noun phrase j, lj is the number of words in the noun phrase j, and d(i,j) is the length of a path between the referring noun phrase i and the candidate antecedent noun phrase j, as described herein.
a j =[m j ;d(i,j)],
where mj is the referring feature representation for the antecedent noun phrase j as a referring noun phrase, and d(i,j) is the length of a path between the referring noun phrase i and the candidate antecedent noun phrase j, as described herein.
a i ∅ =[r(∅);t i ;e i ;l i ;d(i,i)],
where r(∅) is a distributed word representation that may be associated with a head token ∅ that does not appear in the text segment, and d(i,i)=0. In some implementations the antecedent feature representation for the null antecedent may be a zero vector, i.e., each component of the vector is zero. In some implementations the antecedent feature representation for the null antecedent may be a word representation of a word that does not appear appears in the text segment.
Learned Coreference Embeddings
φ:R m →R k ;γ:R n →R k.
f(i,j)=φ(m i)Tγ(a j)=(Mm i)T(Aa j)=(m i)T M T Aa j.
In some implementations a distance measure may be identified based on the inner product f(i,j).
where |x|+=max (0, x). Accordingly, if the incorrect candidate antecedents (members of a−(i)) exceed the number of correct antecedents (members of a+(i)) by one, then a loss may be incurred. The iteratively learned coreference embeddings φ,γ may be selected to minimize the loss function. Additional and/or alternative loss functions may be utilized to iteratively learn the coreference embeddings.
