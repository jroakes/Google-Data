- the present disclosure relates generally to ranking identified images of a location based on current conditions at that location. For example, when a user initiates a request to view images, such as street level images, of a geographic location, the techniques disclosed herein may automatically select real-world street level images that are most visually relevant to the current conditions (e.g., weather, time of day, holiday decor, etc.) at the location expected at a future point in time. While aspects of the disclosure are discussed in connection with street-level imagery, these techniques can also be used with other types of imagery such as aerial imagery or indoor imagery .
- a set of images for a location can be identified where the images correspond to images depicting different conditions at the location.
- Each image of the set of images is associated with condition information depicted in that image. It may be determined when a user will be at the location at a future point in time. For example, for a user currently traveling to a location, the user's current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates may be used to determine the user's expected time of arrival at the location.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- the images are ranked by a processor based on received environment information and the condition information associated with each image.
- the received environment information may include information indicating current environmental conditions at the location for the future point in time.
- An image from the set of images may be selected based on its rank relative to other images of the set of images.
- the selected image may depict current conditions at the location most closely matching the environmental conditions expected at the future point in time .
- FIG. 1 is an example set of images 100 including a set of street level images 102-104 of a location.
- the set of images 100 may depict objects at the location such as a street, buildings, various terrains and different environmental conditions.
- these images are captured, for example, by cameras or image capturing devices at the locations in a direction generally parallel to the ground .
- the set of images 100 may be identified in response to a user's request for imagery of a location.
- a user may request images of a location the user may plan to visit at a future point in time.
- the search request or query for images of the location may include relevant information for identifying the location.
- the user's query may include information indicating a specific location (e.g., "Vermont Mountain Resort"), a longitude/latitude position, a street address or other types identifying information that may be used to determine the location of which the user desires to view street level imagery.
- the user may enter the identifying information into a browser on client device 109.
- a server in communication with the client device 109 may identify one or more images also associated with the identifying information, and send these images to the client device 109.
- the client device 109 may receive the image and display them to the user.
- a street level image may be shown to a user on a display of the client device 109 along with controls for zooming in on the image as well as controls for changing the orientation of the view (which may require retrieving more street level images) .
- the techniques disclosed herein may be implemented in connection with an Internet browser such as Google Chrome (not shown) for displaying street level images as well as other information.
- Other navigation controls may be included as well, such as panning controls in the form of arrows disposed along the street. Such arrows may be selected by a user (by clicking or by dragging along the street line) to change the vantage point from up to down the street .
- the set of images 100 identified in response to the user's request may include images, such as street level images 102 and 104 that may depict the location 107 under different conditions (e.g., at daytime and nighttime ) .
- the user's expected time of arrival at a location can be estimated, for example, based on the user's current geolocated position.
- the user's client device 109 may include a positioning component, such as a GPS receiver, to determine a location of the device. Based on the device's current position, it can be approximated how far the user may be from the desired location.
- an arrival time of the user at the location can be estimated based on the user's known position and the user's given rate of travel. In some aspects, the rate of travel of the user may be interpolated, for example, from the GPS signal.
- This particular user may be traveling by vehicle 105 to the location 107 and may arrive at a certain time of day, such as 12:00 am midnight.
- a nighttime image 104 of location 107 may be selected to display to the user in a browser because it most closely matches the time of day (e.g., current environmental conditions) expected at the time the user will arrive in the future.
- the time of day at a location may be determined, for example, by using a latitude/longitude coordinate of the requested location to determine a time zone at that location.
- the time zone may then be used along with an internal clock of the client device 109 to calculate an expected local arrival time of the user at the location.
- Other types of current conditions may also be used to select and provide images.
- weather and other types of conditions for a location can be determined based on available information, such as current weather conditions, weather forecasts as well as historical information about the location. This information may then be used as described above to select images.

- the query may indicate the user's plans for an upcoming ski trip by including information for "Vermont Ski Resort", etc., indicating that the user desires to view imagery of the location that corresponds to winter conditions for the location.
- a user's navigation history may also include signals indicating a specific time period the user plans to be at the location.
- the user's navigation history may indicate that the user has viewed airline or hotel bookings for the location for a specific date or recently purchased items for the trip that are typically used during certain months like skies or ski boots.
- the user may have searched for driving direction to the location, e-mailed a friend or performed a number of other browsing activities which can be used as an indicator to determine a specific time period related to user's expected arrival at a location .
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, preferences or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive information that may be of interest to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, preferences or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's current and historical location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code or state level

- FIG. 4 is an example of a ranked set of images 400 including street level images 402-408.
- the set of images 402-408 may be identified in response to the user request for images of a location 107.
- the images may be ranked for display to a user on client device 409 based on how closely they match the current conditions. For example, conditions depicted in a highest ranking image may correspond to the current conditions expected at the location.
- the image depicting location 107 during winter months ranks higher than other images 404, 406 and 408 identified for that location.
- the winter image 402 may depict conditions that are more aligned with the user's planned ski trip to the location during the winter or simply at the time of day or the current weather conditions at the user's time of arrival.
- a number of indicators may be used to determine current conditions depicted in the images .
- a date and time may be associated with the images indicate a time of day depicted in the images, such as the time of day when the image was captured.
- image analysis may be performed on the set of images to extract features that may be used to identify various ambient lighting or weather conditions depicted in the images. For example, a mostly dark image may depict a night scene of a location as opposed to depicting a day scene. In other examples, certain objects in an image may be identified as being snow covered identifying the images as winter month images versus objects depicted on a bright sunny summer day.
- the current conditions depicted in the images may also be identified base on information stored in the image (e.g., metadata).
- the information associated with an image may indicate that a certain white balance was used on a camera when capturing the image. This may indicate that the picture was taken at a location at night and, thus represent a nighttime depiction of the location.
- Other metadata may include specific camera settings used to capture the image that may indicate the environment conditions depicted in the image, such as a camera setting for cloudy or daytime mode.
- a user may tag or otherwise label the images with information identifying seasonal events and celebrations, or other meaningful condition information depicted in the images.
- the images may be labeled based on identified Christmas lights and other related decorations on structures within the image indicating that the images are related to a specific holiday event and/or time frame.
