Embodiment
Disclosed herein is the execution mode of the auto-adaptive loop filter that removes or be reduced to blocking effect.In addition, the execution mode that uses less overhead data to remove or be reduced to blocking effect and/or reduce the auto-adaptive loop filter of computation complexity is also disclosed herein.
Fig. 1 is according to the block diagram of the video encoder 14 of the use auto-adaptive loop filter 34 of one embodiment of the present invention.
In disclosed execution mode, block-based video compression operates for the solid shape group (being called macro block) of neighbor.Conventionally, each frame of video can be divided into macro block, and wherein each macro block comprises the piece of a plurality of reduced sizes.These pixel groups in macro block and piece can compare with the data that find in present frame or the data that find in other frames, to make exercise data and rub-out signal.In this execution mode, each macro block can be the group of 16 * 16 pixels.In other embodiments, macro block can be also any other appropriate size.
Although described the execution mode of auto-adaptive loop filter new departure in the context of VP8 video code model, alternate embodiment of the present invention can realize in the context of other video code models.In addition, execution mode is not limited to any specific video encoding standard or form.
In order to remove the discontinuity at block boundary place, can be to the frame application loop filtering of rebuilding during reconstruction path.As explained in more detail below, the selection of loop filter and loop filter intensity can produce considerable influence to picture quality.Too strong filter may cause the fuzzy of details and loss.Too weak filter may be not enough to suppress the discontinuity between adjacent block.
With reference to figure 1, for input video stream 16 is encoded, encoder 14 is carried out following function to produce encoded bit stream 26 in forward path (being illustrated by solid line connecting line): in frame/inter prediction 18, conversion 19, quantize 22 and entropy coding 24.Encoder 14 also comprises the reconstruction path (being illustrated by dotted line connecting line) so that other macro blocks are encoded for reconstruction frames.Encoder 14 is carried out following function in reconstruction path: go to quantize 28, inverse transformation 30, rebuild 32 and loop filtering 34.Other structural variant of encoder 14 also can be for the coding of bit stream 26.
With reference to figure 1, when input video stream 16 presents when encoding, each frame in input video stream 16 can be take macro block and processed as unit.In frame/and the inter prediction stage 18, can use intra prediction mode or inter-frame forecast mode to encode to each macro block.In either case, can form predicted macroblock by the frame based on rebuilding.The in the situation that of infra-frame prediction, for example, can form predicted macroblock according to the sampling of having encoded before in present frame and rebuild.The in the situation that of inter prediction, for example, can form predicted macroblock according to frame (that is, reference frame) one or more before or future encoded and that rebuild.In addition, alternate embodiment can be by combining macro block encoded with the two certain of infra-frame prediction and inter prediction.
Next, continue with reference to figure 1, can from current macro, deduct predicted macroblock, to produce residual error macro block (residual error).19 pairs of residual errors of conversion stages are carried out transition coding, and 22 pairs of residual errors of quantization stage quantize to produce one group of conversion coefficient through quantizing.This conversion coefficient through quantizing can carry out entropy coding by entropy coding stage 24 then.Through the coefficient of entropy coding and required information that macro block is decoded (such as, the predictive mode type, motion vector and the quantizer values that use) together with can output to compressed bit stream 26.
Reconstruction path in Fig. 1 can present for guaranteeing that encoder both used the same reference frame of decoding required to macro block.Reconstruction path comprises by going quantization stage 28 to remove quantization transform coefficient and carrying out inverse transformation by inverse transformation stage 30 pairs of coefficients, to produce the residual error macro block (derivation residual error) of deriving, this reconstruction path is similar to the function occurring during the decode procedure below more discussing in detail.At phase of regeneration 32, predicted macroblock can be added to derives residual error to create the macro block of rebuilding.The macro block that auto-adaptive loop filter 34 can be applied to rebuild is to be reduced to blocking effect.
With reference to figure 2, according to an execution mode, for decoding compressed bit stream 26, similar with the reconstruction path of previously discussed encoder 14, decoder 21 is carried out following function to produce outputting video streams 35: entropy decoding 25, go to quantize 27, in inverse transformation 29, frame/inter prediction 23, rebuild 31, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 with go into piece filtering 33.Other structural variant of decoder 21 also can be for decoding to the bit stream 26 of compression.
When the bit stream 26 of compression presents when decoding, data element can carry out entropy decoding by entropy decode phase 25, to produce one group of coefficient quantizing.Go 27 pairs of coefficients of quantization stage to go to quantize, and inverse transformation stage 29 pairs of coefficients carry out inverse transformation, to produce the derivation residual error identical with the derivation residual error that phase of regeneration was created in encoder 14.In frame/and the inter prediction stage 23, use from the header information of bit stream 26 decodings of compression, decoder 21 creates the predicted macroblock identical with the predicted macroblock creating in encoder 14.At phase of regeneration 31, predicted macroblock can be added derivation residual error to, to create reconstruction macro block.The macro block that auto-adaptive loop filter 34 can be applied to rebuild is to be reduced to blocking effect.Remove into blocking filter 33 and can be applied to the macro block of rebuilding, to be further reduced to piece distortion, and result can be exported to outputting video streams 35.
Although the auto-adaptive loop filter 34 in reference encoder device has been described the execution mode of auto-adaptive loop filter new departure, described filtering technique also can realize in the auto-adaptive loop filter 34 in decoder.In the disclosure abridged to the reference of auto-adaptive loop filter in decoder 34 only for auxiliary the understanding of the present invention.Yet filtering new departure is not limited to the auto-adaptive loop filter 34 in encoder, but can be applied to the auto-adaptive loop filter 34 in decoder or be incorporated to any other unit of filtering technique.
Fig. 3 shows reference frame 44,48, and the present frame 36 of encoding or decoding.As previously mentioned, each frame can take macro block as unit and in frame/process in the inter prediction stage 18, and each macro block can be used some combination of infra-frame prediction, inter-frame forecast mode or inter prediction and inter prediction to encode.For example, current macro 38 uses are encoded or are decoded from the inter prediction of the macro block 46 of the reference frame 44 of encoding before.Similarly, current macro 38 ' use is encoded or is decoded from the inter prediction of the macro block 50 of the reference frame 48 of encoding before.And, for example, current macro 38 " use and encode or decode from the infra-frame prediction of the macro block 52 in present frame 36.
Blocking effect can produce during cataloged procedure, and for example can originate from frame/inter prediction stage 18, conversion stages 19 or quantization stage 22.Because some conventional filter is determined filter strength according to block boundary, so computing may be complicated and consuming time.
Fig. 4 shows the loop filter of the auto-adaptive loop filter 34 in one embodiment of the present invention and controls 61 block diagram.According to an execution mode, loop filter is controlled 61 and is determined intensity modifier 60 based on piece attribute.The existing coded message of piece attribute based on about piece or be passed to decoder with the information being correctly decoded of overhead bit stream.
Piece attribute can comprise forecast period parameter 65 and residual error wrong community 66.Forecast period parameter 65 can comprise the type of reference frame type 62 and predictive mode 64.As below more discussed in detail, the threshold level that intensity modifier 60 changes in auto-adaptive loop filter 34.
If what use is inter-frame mode predictive coding, can be by inter-frame as the basis of making prediction piece.When using inter-frame, can be for example according to encoded and rebuild one or more before frame, frame in the future or its some be combined to form prediction piece.Therefore,, when using inter-frame, reference frame type 62 can comprise for example last frame, gold frame or standby reference frame.Last frame can be before present frame before coded frame.Gold frame can be from selecting arbitrarily the past frame with the predictor as subsequent frame before morning.Standby reference frame can comprise the frame that any neither last frame neither gold frame.For example, standby reference can be frame in the past, frame in the future or the reference frame of structure.In addition, for example, the reference building can be disclosed reference frame in the patent application of " System and Method for Video Encoding Using Constructed Reference Frame " by name, this patent application is awarded and is given assignee of the present invention, and submit with the present invention simultaneously, in this by reference to being incorporated to its full content.
The type of predictive mode 64 can be that frame mode coding or coded in inter mode (as shown in Figure 4) are determined (being similar to reference frame type 62) by what use when building prediction piece.If what use is frame mode predictive coding, can support the intraframe coding of two types, it is marked as non-ly cuts apart pattern and cuts apart pattern.If what use is inter-frame mode predictive coding, can support the interframe encode of two types, it is marked as non-ly cuts apart pattern and cuts apart pattern.
If inter-frame mode predictive coding was used with non-cutting apart together with pattern, residual error wrong community 66 can be that sky or non-zero are determined by result motion vector.
As previously mentioned, macro block can be the array of 16 * 16 luminance pixels.In intraframe coding, each macro block can further be divided into 4 * 4 luma samples that are for example called 4 * 4 sub-blocks.Therefore, macro block can comprise 16 4 * 4 sub-blocks.This means and can form prediction piece for each sub-block (that is, cutting apart pattern) in macro block (that is, the non-pattern of cutting apart) or 16 4 * 4 sub-blocks.Other sub-block sizes are also available, such as 16 * 8,8 * 16 and 8 * 8.Although for the description of execution mode of intraframe coding of having cut apart pattern description of 4 * 4 sub-blocks, any other sub-block size can be used together with cutting apart pattern, and the description of execution mode is not limited to 4 * 4 sub-blocks.
In intraframe coding, non-ly cut apart mode producing for the prediction of whole 16 * 16 macro blocks, and cut apart mode producing for the independent prediction of each 4 * 4 sub-block.
For the non-pattern of cutting apart of intraframe coding, for example, in 4 predictive modes one can be for reference bit above 16 * 16 that will predict and/or the left side before the neighbor sampling of coded block.4 selectable predictive modes can be vertical prediction, horizontal forecast, DC prediction and planar prediction.
For intraframe coding, cut apart pattern, for example, in 9 predictive modes one can be for reference bit above 4 * 4 sub-blocks that will predict and/or the left side before the neighbor sampling of coded block.9 selectable predictive modes can be to predict in prediction under vertical prediction, horizontal forecast, DC prediction, the prediction of diagonal angle, lower-left, lower-right diagonal position prediction, vertical right prediction, level, vertical left prediction and level.
In interframe encode, the non-pattern of cutting apart causes based on for predicting that the displacement in the respective reference frame region of whole 16 * 16 macro blocks calculates one or more motion vectors.Alternatively, cutting apart pattern causes based on for predicting that the displacement of the corresponding reference frame regions of 16 * 16 macro block parts carrys out calculation of motion vectors.16 * 16 macro blocks can be divided into 16 * 8,8 * 16,8 * 8 or 4 * 4 division, and each has its oneself motion vector.Other divide size is also feasible.
Can carry out calculation of motion vectors for each complete macro block or each unitary part.Particularly, motion compensation carrys out the pixel value of predicted macroblock (or appropriate section) in macro block according to the migration of reference frame.Motion vector for each macro block or part can be empty, and this indication motion does not change, or can be non-zero, and change has occurred in this indication motion.
Although the description of execution mode has illustrated that how auto-adaptive loop filter 34 is based on forecast period parameter 65 and residual error wrong community 64 application varying strength modifiers 60, but any other loop filter attribute can change, such as, filter type, filter coefficient and filter tap, and the description of execution mode is not limited to change intensity modifier 60.
Fig. 5 shows according to flow chart one embodiment of the present invention, control 61 operation from the loop filter of Fig. 4.With reference to figure 5, at frame 100 places, can select baseline loops filter strength f for frame, it has defined the behavior of auto-adaptive loop filter 34.Therefore, baseline filter intensity f specifies the frame level in coded bit stream.By specify baseline filter intensity f in frame level, can reduce expense, because can specify the single baseline filter value f for whole frame with considerably less bit.Yet, even if can only specify a baseline filter intensity f for this frame, can not sacrifice filter quality, because the threshold level that filter strength value/modifier 60 changes in auto-adaptive loop filter 34 is as described below yet.
For at macro block rank redjustment and modification device 60, increment size 1-8 can encode in bit stream.These increment sizes for example add to baseline filter intensity f.For combining other suitable processes of baseline filter intensity f and intensity modifier 60, be also available.Increment size can be also added value or percentage increase/minimizing value etc.Increment size can also be positive, negative or zero.11 varying strength modifiers 60 that are designated F1-F11 according to flow chart application increment in Fig. 5, have been provided.

If interframe encode is not cut apart to pattern, do not use together with standby frame, control 61 and determine that the motion vector calculating is sky or non-zero.If motion vector is empty, can add increment 6 to baseline filter intensity f and increment 5, to produce intensity modifier F9.Referring back to Fig. 4, in the case, predictive mode 64 is the non-patterns of cutting apart of interframe encode, and residual error wrong community 66 is air transport moving vectors.If motion vector is non-zero, can add increment 7 to baseline filter intensity f and increment 5, to produce intensity modifier F10.Referring back to Fig. 4, in the case, predictive mode 64 is the non-patterns of cutting apart of interframe encode, and residual error wrong community 66 is non-zero motion vector.
Conventionally, to the varying level of blocking effect using strength modifier 60, its degree depends on reference frame type 62 and predictive mode 64 more or less.As shown in Figure 5, for example, can be to inter-coded macroblocks rather than inter-coded macroblocks application varying strength modifier 60 (that is, F1-F2 and F2-F11).In addition, can cut apart mode macro rather than mode macro application varying strength modifier 60 (that is, F1 and F2) is cut apart in intraframe coding to intraframe coding is non-.Other suitable mechanism of adjusting intensity modifier 60 are also feasible.
Fig. 6 is according to the flow chart of the method for the renewal loop filtering video data of one embodiment of the present invention.Loop filtering video data can comprise reference frame loop filter modifier and predictive mode loop filter modifier.Reference frame loop filter modifier can comprise the increment size for reference frame type 62.Predictive mode loop filter modifier can comprise for the two increment size of predictive mode 64 and residual error wrong community 66.
Refer again to Fig. 6, at decision block 132 places, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 determine present frame be whether when coding except with reference to itself not with reference to the frame (being commonly referred to key frame) of any other frame.If present frame is key frame, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 moves to frame 134, to be set to default value with reference to frame loop filter modifier.Then,, at frame 136 places, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 predictive mode loop filter modifiers are set to default value.Once these values are set to default value, auto-adaptive loop filter moves to decision block 130, to determine whether having enabled filter conditions in frame level.
If present frame is key frame and value, be set to default value, if or present frame be not key frame, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 moves to decision block 130, to determine whether having enabled filter conditions in frame level.Auto-adaptive loop filter 34 can determine whether to have enabled loop filter modifier by individual bit, byte, label etc.
If not enabled loop filter modifier (that is, single loop filter condition having been detected), can skip the loop filtering of auto-adaptive loop filter in 34 stages for present frame.In other words, can be to all single loop filter intensity of application in frame.Single loop filter intensity also can comprise not any part application loop filter for frame.
Once skip loop filtering for present frame, auto-adaptive loop filter will return to decision block 130, to determine whether to have enabled loop filter modifier for next frame.Auto-adaptive loop filter 34 can be based in residual error rub-out signal, reference frame type 62, predictive mode 64 or its some combination one or more characteristics and select to skip loop filtering.For skipping other suitable factors of the loop filtering of auto-adaptive loop filter 34, be also feasible.
For example, when not depositing the AC component of residual error macro block in conversion stages 19, and be, the in the situation that of utilizing air transport moving vector to carry out interframe encode, can skip loop filtering at macro block.In this way, skip in this case loop filtering and will on some frames of avoiding not existing in the region of motion, repeat loop filtering in image.Therefore, can reduce fuzzyly, and reduce calculate, thereby reduce overall calculation complexity.
Continuation is with reference to figure 6, if enabled loop filter modifier, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 moves to decision block 138, to determine whether loop filter intensity level condition to be detected.More specifically, at decision block 138 places, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 determines whether to exist any renewal for the loop filter modifier of having encoded in present frame.Auto-adaptive loop filter 34 can determine whether to upgrade loop filter modifier by individual bit, byte, label etc.
If there is no for the renewal of loop filter modifier, auto-adaptive loop filter 34 will be applied to present frame from the preset loop filter modifier of frame before.Once the value before having applied, auto-adaptive loop filter will return to decision block 130, to determine whether to have enabled loop filter modifier for next frame.
If there is the renewal for loop filter modifier, at frame 140 places, auto-adaptive loop filter will upgrade the preset value of reference frame loop filter modifier.Then, auto-adaptive loop filter will move to frame 142, to upgrade the preset value of predictive mode loop filter modifier.Once upgrade this value, auto-adaptive loop filter will return to decision block 130, to determine whether to have enabled loop filter modifier for next frame.
Return to Fig. 5, reference frame loop filter modifier and predictive mode loop filter modifier can be the increment size 1-8 in each node place application of flow chart.Particularly, increment size 1,3,4 and 5 can be the reference frame loop filter modifier corresponding to reference frame type 62, increment size 2 and 8 can be the predictive mode loop filter modifier corresponding to predictive mode 64, and increment size 6 and 7 can be the predictive mode loop filter modifier corresponding to residual error wrong community 66.Each in these increment sizes can be used the method shown in the flow chart in Fig. 6 to upgrade in auto-adaptive loop filter 34.
Fig. 7 is according to the flow chart of the method for one embodiment of the present invention, renewal loop filtering video data.The flow chart of Fig. 7 and Fig. 6 is similar, and difference is whether auto-adaptive loop filter 34 uncertain present frame are key frames.Therefore, if enabled loop filter modifier, and have the renewal for those loop filter modifiers, all frames can upgrade reference frame loop filter modifier and predictive mode loop filter modifier.
