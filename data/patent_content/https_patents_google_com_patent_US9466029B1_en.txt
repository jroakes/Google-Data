- the cookie labeler 126 can receive the known internet distribution for the class from a survey system 128 .
- the survey system 128 can provide information, for example, related to a current population survey for people in general in a country or information related to other surveys which indicate characteristics of users of the environment 100 or internet users in general.
- the probability for maleness for a particular unlabeled cookie based on known user behavior is sixty percent (with an inverse probability for femaleness for the cookie being forty percent).
- the known internet distribution of cookies as received from the survey system 128 indicates a likelihood that sixty five percent of internet cookies are associated with male users and that thirty five percent of internet cookies are associated with female users.
- the determined probability of sixty percent can be adjusted, using the model (e.g., adjusted upward toward 65%), based on the received probability of sixty five percent and also on the distribution of the determined probabilities of all of the processed unlabeled cookies.
- the adjustment can be of the form of a calibration where a linear interpolation is used to define a transform that maps from an expected distribution to a calibrated space. The transform for each segment of the feature (i.e., in a two segment feature such as gender) is even.
- a binning technique is used. That is, a mapping can be created of a number (e.g., a few thousand) of data points. For all the cookies not covered by the sampled data points, the system can calculate intercepts to get an approximated transformation.
- the cookie labeler 126 can assign a label (e.g., male) to the unlabeled cookie in accordance with the adjusting.
- the content selector 120 can use the label to identify content for delivery to a user device 106 that presented the cookie.
- a ranking system 130 can determine, for each unlabeled cookie, for example based on known user behavior, a score that represents a likelihood that the user associated with the cookie is included in a particular class of the multi-class demographic characteristic.
- the ranking system 130 can rank all of the unlabeled cookies based on the scores to create a ranking 132 .
- the cookie labeler 126 can determine an internet distribution for a given class of the multi-class demographic characteristic, such as from information received from the survey system 128 .
- the cookie labeler 126 can, for a particular unlabeled cookie, assign the unlabeled cookie to a class of the multi-class characteristic based on the rank of the unlabeled cookie and the internet distribution.
- the cookie labeler 126 can identify one or more location(s) in the ranking 132 that defines a boundary (or boundaries) between classes using the internet distribution and can determine a class for the particular unlabeled cookie based on the rank of the unlabeled cookie relative to the identified location(s).
- a content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- a content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 134 which define a content campaign.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 134 specified by the content provider 108 .
- the campaign parameters 134 can be stored in a parameters data store 136 .
- Campaign parameters 134 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria.
- Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms. Selection criteria can also include criteria that indicate that a content item can be eligible for selection by the content selector 120 when one or more characteristics of a user (e.g. interests, demographics) of a requesting user device 106 match interest or demographic criteria associated with the content item. For example, one or more labels assigned to a cookie included in a request for content received from the user device 106 can match a demographic characteristic (or class of a particular demographic characteristic) associated with the content item. Some or all of the labels assigned to the cookie can be labels assigned by the cookie labeler 126 .
- one or more models 123 are trained, for example, using labeled cookies from the cookies data store 124 . Over time, the models 123 can be evaluated and adjusted. As described in more detail below, some models 123 may be tree-based models. Evaluation of the models 123 can include identifying a tree structure to use in a model that has a highest level of accuracy as compared to other tree structures.

- a multi-class demographic can include, for example two classes (e.g., male and female). As another example, a multi-class demographic can include more than two classes. In some implementations, unlabeled cookies for a particular country are identified. The process 200 can be repeated, for example, for each of multiple countries.
- a probability is determined for each unlabeled identifier as to inclusion in a class of the multi-class demographic characteristic based on known user behavior producing a distribution of probabilities for the unlabeled identifiers ( 204 ).
- the known user behavior can be derived, for example, from information contained in the identifier (e.g., cookie). As another example, the known user behavior can be derived from a profile associated with the cookie.
- the probability is adjusted for a given unlabeled identifier based on a known internet distribution with respect to a given class in the multi-class demographic characteristic and distribution of the probabilities among the unlabeled identifiers ( 206 ).

- the known user behavior can be derived, for example, from information contained in the unlabeled cookie.
- the known user behavior can be derived from a profile associated with the cookie.
- All of the unlabeled cookies are ranked based on the scores, creating a ranking ( 306 ).
- the unlabeled cookies can be sorted, in ascending order, according to associated scores.
- An internet distribution is determined for a given class of the multi class demographic characteristic ( 308 ).
- the internet distribution can be based, for example, on survey information.
- the unlabeled cookie is assigned to a class of the multi-class characteristic based on the rank of the unlabeled cookie and the internet distribution ( 310 ). For example, a location in the ranking can be identified that defines a boundary between classes using the internet distribution. A class for the given unlabeled cookie can be determined based on the rank of the unlabeled cookie relative to the identified location.
- the internet distribution may indicate that sixty percent of internet users are male and forty percent of internet users are female.
- a location in the ranking corresponding to a sixtieth percentile score can be determined. If the rank of the unlabeled cookie is less than a rank corresponding to the identified location, the unlabeled cookie can be assigned to a male class. If the rank of the unlabeled cookie is greater than or equal to the rank corresponding to the identified location, the unlabeled cookie can be assigned to a female class.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for labeling user identifiers.
- the process 400 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- the process 400 involves combining classes to create a two class problem relating to a first and second superclass of a multi-class demographic characteristic, solving the two class problem, and repeating processing for an identified superclass or subclass until a single class is identified for assigning to a given unlabeled cookie.
- a multi-class demographic characteristic that includes three or more classes is identified ( 401 ).

- the first class of 18-34 and the second class of 35+ span the six age classes of 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+.
- the tree structure 500 is selected from among other possible tree structures. For example, a determination can be made to split the tree structure 500 into the first class 504 of 18-34 and the second class 506 of 35+ instead of into classes representing some other split. For example, an optimization algorithm can be used that performs a random walk search to find a best tree structure, such as a tree structure that when applied results in a population closer to a benchmark distribution than other candidate tree structures and/or that results in a highest prediction accuracy as compared to other candidate tree structures.
- a probability for a given unlabeled identifier as to inclusion in a given first or second class is determined ( 406 ).
- a probability for the given unlabeled cookie as to inclusion in the first class can be determined based on known user behavior associated with the unlabeled cookie.
- the probability is adjusted ( 408 ) based on a known or estimated internet distribution with respect to the given first or second class and the probabilities of unlabeled identifiers from the set of unlabeled identifiers that are associated with the given first or second class. For example, the probability can be adjusted as described above with respect to FIG. 2 and/or FIG. 3 .
- the given unlabeled identifier can be assigned to one of the first or second classes based on the adjusting ( 410 ). For example, the given unlabeled cookie can be assigned to the first class if the probability for the given unlabeled cookie as to inclusion in the first class is greater than the probability for the given unlabeled cookie as to inclusion in the second class. The probability for the given unlabeled cookie as to inclusion in the second class can be determined as an inverse probability of the probability as to inclusion in the first class. In the example of FIG. 5 , the given unlabeled cookie can be assigned to the first class 504 corresponding to an age range of 18-34.
- the superclass is divided into two subclasses including a new first class and a new second class.
- One or both of the new first and second classes may be superclasses.
- the class 504 e.g., the previous first class
- the class 508 can be divided into a new first class 508 corresponding to an age range of 18-24 and a new second class 510 corresponding to an age range of 25-34.
- the process 400 can continue, with the determination of a probability for the given unlabeled identifier as to inclusion in one of the new first class and the new second class ( 406 ), the adjusting of the probability ( 408 ), and the assigning of the given unlabeled identifier to one of the new first class or the new second class ( 410 ).
- the given unlabeled cookie may be assigned to the new first class 508 , in which case the process 400 ends with the given unlabeled cookie being assigned to the new first class 508 because the new first class 508 is not a superclass (e.g., 412 in the process 400 ).
- processing can continue in a similar fashion, with identification of a third-iteration first class 512 and a third-iteration second class 514 , with the given unlabeled cookie being ultimately assigned to either the third-iteration first class 512 or the third-iteration second class 514 .
