- This invention allows a user to navigate a group of related objects. For example, in one embodiment, a user navigates a series of related images in a digital photo album. Using this invention, the user may open an application and view the first image in the album. When the user wants to navigate to another image in the album, the user may roll a cursor over a part of the image. In one embodiment, when the user rolls the cursor over the right half of the image, a visual cue, e.g. a thumbnail showing the next image, appears near the cursor. If the user clicks on a mouse button while over the right half of the image, then the next image in the album appears. If the user clicks on a mouse button while over the left half of the image, then the previous image in the album appears. Therefore, by clicking on certain parts of the displayed image, the user navigates to other images within the album.
- a visual cue e.g. a thumbnail showing the next image
- a user navigates different parts of a large picture.
- a high resolution picture may not be entirely visible on a computer screen.
- the top left corner of the picture may be visible but not the bottom right corner, for example.
- the user may click on the bottom right corner of the visible portion of the picture.
- the bottom right corner is then displayed. If the user clicks on the top right corner of the visible portion of the picture, then the top right corner is displayed. Therefore, by clicking on certain visible parts of the picture, the user navigates to other parts of the picture.
- This invention is not limited to navigating a series of images or different parts of large picture. For example, a user may navigate pages in a document. This invention is also not limited to visual cues which are thumbnails. For example, a visual cue may be textual. Additionally, this invention is not limited to navigating the related data using a personal computer. For example, the user may be navigating the data using a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile phone.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- an object is transmitted and displayed to a user.
- the object is assigned a coordinate system.
- the cursor will be inside the assigned coordinate system. Therefore, while over the object, the cursor is associated with a coordinate in the assigned coordinate system.
- a value related to the cursor's coordinate in the assigned coordinate system is transmitted to a module which determines the identity of the new object. The new object is then transmitted and displayed to the user.

- the requested object e.g. 116 B
- the front end receives the new object in block 136 , and displays the new object in block 138 .
- the process then repeats if another object in the group of related objects, e.g. 116 C, is to be viewed.
- FIG. 2 depicts a flow diagram of a front end in a system for navigating a group of related data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
- the embodiment of the front end in FIG. 2 varies in several ways from the front end embodiment shown in FIG. 1 .
- block 210 gets a visual object in a group of related visual objects.
- block 210 may encompass both request block 110 and receive block 120 of FIG. 1 .
- block 210 may encompass receive block 120 of FIG. 1 , but not request block 110 .
- a request for the first object may come from a backend module, rather than from a front end module.
- a software program running in the background may automatically launch when a user powers on a computer. The program may request the first image without ever interacting with the user through a front end interface.
- a backend server program may be preconfigured to push a first object in a group of related objects to a client when a specific event, unrelated to the front end, is triggered. This event may be, for example, a specific time or a completion of a computer process.
- the backend may automatically generate a report.
- the pages of the report may be the group of related objects.
- the backend may be preconfigured to transmit the first page of the report upon completion of the backup.
- block 210 correlates to block 120 of FIG. 1 , but not to block 110 .
- object 216 A is displayed in block 222 before a coordinate system is assigned in block 224 .
- object 116 A is displayed in block 124 after a coordinate system is assigned in block 122 .
- the coordinate system is generally not rendered on the display.
- the coordinate system may have its origin at the center of the rendered object, as seen in the block 224 .
- the coordinate system may have its origin at any point within the rendered object, such as the top left corner, the bottom left corner, the top right corner, or the bottom right corner.
- the front end system determines a value in block 225 .
- the value is correlated to the coordinate system assigned to the object in block 224 .
- the method for determining the value and the relationship between the value and the coordinate system depends on the embodiment of the invention.
- the objects are images related to each other through a pre-assigned viewing order.
- the front end indicates that triggering a user input device (e.g. a mouse) will request the next object in the series, as shown in block 225 .
- the front end indicates that triggering the user input device will request the previous object in the series.
- the front end retrieves the location of the cursor in the coordinate system.
- a positive x-coordinate indicates that the cursor was in the right half of the rendered object when an input device was triggered, while a negative value x-coordinate indicates that the cursor was in the left half. Therefore, in the embodiment of FIG. 2 , a positive x-coordinate indicates a desire for the next object in the viewing order, while a negative x-coordinate indicates a desire for the previous object.
- the value sent from the front end to the backend in block 126 may be the x-coordinate itself, a number indicating whether the x-coordinate is positive or negative, or a text string e.g. “next” or “previous.”
- the value may be the y-coordinate, a combination of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate, a filename, a uniform resource locator (URL) string, or an index number, as will be discussed in further detail with regard to FIGS. 9A-9E .
- the front end receives the requested object in block 136 .
- the process then repeats, with the front end system displaying the new object in place of the previous object. In this case, object 216 B will be displayed in place of object 216 A.
- FIG. 3 depicts a flow diagram of a backend in a system for navigating a group of related data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
- the embodiment of FIG. 3 varies in several ways from the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 .
- the backend receives a request for an object in a group of objects.
- the request may not come from the same front end which displays the object, as is indicated in the embodiment of FIG. 1 . Rather, the request may come from a number of sources, including other backend components and/or front ends different from the front end which displays the object.
- the object may be stored locally in the backend system, or remotely in another system.
- the object is stored in the same machine as a machine receiving requests and transmitting objects.
- the object is stored in a machine different from, but coupled to, a machine receiving requests and transmitting objects.
- the object may be stored, along with other objects in the group, in a data collection with other groups. For example, group 216 may be stored in the same data collection as a group 116 .
- the backend system After getting object 216 A, the backend system sends the object in block 118 .
- the backend system then waits in block 314 until it receives a value from the front end indicating a request for another object in the group of related objects, in block 128 .
- the backend system determines from the value the identity of the new object, gets the new object, and transmits the new object.
- the backend determines in block 130 that the requested object is object 216 B from the value received in block 128 .
- the backend gets the new object in block 132 , and sends the object in block 134 .
- a navigation system in accordance with the present invention may exist in various environments.
- a navigation system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention may have a front end that is a client and a backend that is a server.
- a navigation system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention may have a front end that includes software user interfaces (UIs), and a backend that includes software threads, software processes and/or hardware which process user input.

- FIG. 6 depicts a block diagram of one part of a front end in a system for navigating a group of related data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
- a first object with an assigned coordinate system
- the coordinate system may be assigned before or after the object is rendered.
- the front end provides a visual cue to the user, as indicated in blocks 604 A and 604 B.
- a text and/or image overlay indicates that triggering an input device at that time will initiate a request for the previous object.
- a text and/or image overlay may appear near the cursor, overlapping the rendered object, as shown in FIG. 7A .
- a visual cue may appear in a location which does not obscure the rendered object's visibility. For example, the visual cue may appear above the objects or in a window frame, as shown in FIG. 7C .
- a text and/or image overlay indicates that triggering an input device at that time will initiate a request for the next object.
- a text and/or image overlay may appear near the cursor, overlapping the rendered object, as shown in FIG. 7B .
- the visual cue may appear in a location which does not obscure the rendered object's visibility.
- several visual cues may appear in various locations.
- an image overlay may appear over the rendered object while, at the same time, a textual cue appears in a window frame.
- a visual cue indicating “previous” or “next” may not be appropriate and a different visual cue may be used.
- the rendered object is part of a larger single visual image.
- the visual cue may indicate which portion of the visual will be requested and rendered.
- the visual cue may indicate that the bottom half of the larger single visual image will be requested, as shown in FIG. 7C .
- the visual cue is a thumbnail of the object to be requested.
- the visual cue is a thumbnail showing the bottom half of the larger single visual image.
- the visual cue is a thumbnail showing the next or previous image in the series of images.
- the visual cue indicates whether triggering an input device will request a first image in a series or a last image in a series. In another embodiment, the visual cue indicates whether the “next” image will be actually the first image in the series, similar to a “repeat” button on a stereo.
- the visual cue alters its appearance when the cursor is relocated to a different region of the rendered object.
- the cues act as navigational sign posts, and may appear where appropriate and/or convenient.
- the cues appear when the cursor is located within a coordinate system assigned to the rendered object.
- the cursor will be associated with a coordinate in the coordinate system when the input device is triggered.
- the front end system captures the event in block 606 and then proceeds to determine the value to send to the backend system.
- Providing a navigation method in which the navigation correlates with a coordinate system assigned specifically to a rendered object improves navigation time. For example, in one embodiment, after viewing an image, rather than scrolling to another location on the page to navigate to the next image, a user may click on a visible region of the image. This reduces the amount of time to navigate the group of images. In embodiments in which a visual cue overlays the rendered object, navigation time is further reduced.
- the overlay indicates to a user the consequences of clicking a mouse, for example, while not requiring that the user's eye to wander to another location on the display. Additionally, in embodiments where the overlay is a thumbnail, the user may be aware of the content of the next object before requesting that object. The user may decide not to navigate down that particular path.
- FIGS. 8A-8C illustrates several points in which a coordinate system may be assigned to an object in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 8A depicts one system in which coordinate systems are assigned after transmission to a front end in accordance with one embodiment of this invention.
- the client system assigns the coordinate system to the object.
- the coordinate system is assigned in the front end before the object in rendered.
- the coordinate system is assigned in the front end after the object in rendered.
- a coordinate system may be assigned in the backend, before the object is transmitted, as shown in FIGS. 8B-8C .
- FIG. 8B depicts one system in which coordinate systems are assigned before transmission to a front end in accordance with one embodiment of this invention.
- objects 816 are stored with pre-assigned coordinate systems.
- object 816 A may be stored with pre-assigned coordinate system 802 A.
- a coordinate system is a property of each object, assigned when an object is added to the data collection. When the object is transmitted, the coordinate system is also transmitted.
- FIG. 8C depicts another system in which coordinate systems are assigned before transmission to a front end in accordance with one embodiment of this invention.
- object 816 A is stored in the data collection without a pre-assigned coordinate system. Rather, a coordinate system is assigned to object 816 A after the object is retrieved from the data collection, but before the object is transmitted to the client.
- the server system assigns the coordinate system.
- the object may be assigned a coordinate system before transmittal to the front end by a different system, e.g. a separate software application or a separate computing machine.
- the object is transmitted from a data collection to a server.
- the server then transmits the object to a client.
- the navigation systems of FIGS. 8A-8C are client-server systems. It will be appreciated that other systems previously discussed, such as stand-alone systems, are equally applicable.
- FIGS. 9A-9F depicts various systems transmitting values to request a second related object in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- the values are transmitted from a front end to a backend of a navigation system.
- the type of value transmitted affects the method the backend will use to determine the new object to be sent to the front end.
- the front end transmits the x-coordinate of a cursor captured when a trigger event occurred (e.g. a mouse button click).
- a backend system receiving the coordinate determines the identity of the requested object from the coordinate.
- the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the rendered object.
- the backend system is aware of the location of this origin, and therefore is aware that a positive x-coordinate indicates a request for a subsequent object in the series of objects.
- the backend system also determines that a negative x-coordinate indicates a request for a prior object in the series.
- the origin may be at the top left corner of the image.
- the x-coordinate is greater half the image width (i.e. x-coordinate>image width/2)
- a subsequent object in the series of objects is requested.
- the x-coordinate is less than half the image width (i.e. x-coordinate ⁇ image width/2)
- a prior object is requested.
- the y-coordinate may be transmitted.
- a positive y-coordinate may indicate that a prior image is requested, and a negative y-coordinate may indicate that a subsequent image is requested.
- a positive y-coordinate may indicate that the top half of an image is requested, and a negative y-coordinate may indicate that a bottom half of an image is requested.
- both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate may be transmitted.
- significant processing is performed in the backend system to determine the identity of the requested object.
- Such a configuration may be desirable in computing and/or telecommunication systems in which the front end systems have limited computing resources, e.g. in systems with thin clients.
- more processing may be performed on the client side than in the embodiment of FIG. 9A .
- a front end transmits a binary value.
- the front end may transmit 0 to indicate that a prior image is requested and 1 to indicate that a subsequent image is requested.
- the binary values may be a positive and negative number, e.g. ⁇ 1 and +1. A negative number may indicate that a prior image is requested and a positive number may indicate that a subsequent image is requested.
- a text string may be transmitted.
- the string “next” or “previous”, or variations thereof, is transmitted.
- other text strings may be used, e.g. “first,” “last,” “top,” “bottom,” or the like.
- the front end determines a specific relationship (e.g. a navigational direction or a geometric relationship) between the cursor coordinates and the new object being requested.
- the front end e.g. a client
- the backend e.g. a server
- This configuration reduces the amount of backend processing executed to determine the identity of the requested object.
- an index value may be transmitted.
- an index increment number is transmitted, e.g. 2. This increment number may indicate to the backend system the number of rows to increment in a database table to find the filename for the requested object, for example. Thus, if the index increment number is 2, then the front end is indicating to the backend that information about the requested object is two rows down from the current row, which contains information about the currently displayed object.
- the index number may directly represent the position of a requested object in a database, as shown in FIG. 9D .
- the index number may 200, indicating to the backend that the filename of the requested object may be found in row 200 of a certain database table.
- the front end may transmit a text string directly identifying the new object.
- the value is a requested object's filename, e.g. “vacation2.jpg.”
- the backend having received the identity of the requested object, still determines the location of the object in the backend.
- the transmitted value indicates not only the requested object's identity (e.g. filename), but also its location.
- the value is a uniform resource locator (URL), e.g. http://www.helloworld.com/family/dad2.jpg.
- the GET string may include more than one variable (e.g. album and file).
- FIG. 10 depicts consecutive screen shots in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Specifically, FIG. 10 illustrates screen shots of a front end in a navigation system in which a URL GET string is transmitted to the backend system to retrieve the new object.
- the type of value transmitted from the front end system to the backend system determines the allocation and degree of processing between the front end and backend. Certain types of values take less processing by the front end system (e.g. x-coordinate) than other types of values (e.g. filename). Additionally, certain types of values may benefit from querying a data collection (e.g. filename) while other types may not.
