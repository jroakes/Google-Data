Definitions
- This specification relates to content distribution.
- the Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of resources, e.g., video and/or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, news articles, etc. Access to these resources has likewise enabled opportunities to provide additional content with the resources.
- a user device may request a resource, such as a news web page from a news publisher, by submitting a resource request to the publisher.
- the web page can include instructions that cause the user device to request content items for presentation with the web page.
- Content items that may be of interest to a user can be identified by a content management system in response to the request.
- the request can include information the content management system can use to identify content items to be provided to the user device in response to the request.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying an interstitial content item that was presented during a particular device session; identifying two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session; determining that two or more different participating publishers are associated with the two or more participating resources, each participating publisher being a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items; and assigning a revenue share value to each of the two or more participating publishers, each revenue share value specifying a portion of interstitial revenue that the participating publisher is allocated for display of the interstitial content item.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the two or more participating resources may include a destination resource that was presented subsequent to the interstitial content item.
- Identifying two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session may comprise: identifying, from a plurality of resources requested during the particular device session, two or more consecutive resources that are each associated with a participating publisher, where at least one of the consecutive resources is the destination resource; and identifying, as the two or more participating resources, the consecutive resources.
- Assigning a revenue share value to each of the two or more participating publishers may comprise: identifying, for each of the two or more participating resources, a distance of the participating resource from the destination resource; and for each of the two or more participating publishers, assigning the revenue share to the participating publisher based on the distance of each participating resource associated with the participating publisher relative to the distance of each other participating resource that is not associated with the participating publisher.
- the distance for each participating resource may be measured by a number of resource requests between the participating resource and the destination resource.
- the distance for each participating resource may be measured by an amount of elapsed time between a request for the participating resource and a request for the destination resource.
- the destination resource may have caused presentation of the interstitial content item prior to presentation of the destination resource.
- Each participating resource may be a resource that i) does not include a content item slot for displaying a banner content item, and ii) is provided by a participating publisher.
- Each participating publisher may have been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items based on the participating publisher's agreement to provide participating resources.
- Sharing revenue generated by presentation of interstitial content items with participating publishers provides publishers with an incentive to provide participating resources (e.g., resources that don't include banner advertisements).
- Participating resources may have less prominent slots for content items, allowing a participating publisher to utilize space in participating resources for publisher provided content rather than presentation of third party content items.
- Various revenue sharing methods also promote cross-promotion between participating publishers, resulting in shared revenue for participating publishers who promote participating resources of other participating publishers.
- Users who visit participating resources may be provided with more prominent content provided by the publisher of the resource than a non-participating resource that may provide third party content items with more prominence than publisher provided content.
- Content item providers are provided with opportunities to have content items presented at user devices without competing for a user's attention with other content at the same time. Users may be more willing and able to be attentive to interstitial content items presented between resources of participating publishers due to the lack of prominent third party content items on the participating publisher pages. Providing interstitial content items of interest to users may, in turn, lead to satisfaction of users' informational needs.

- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow for requesting and receiving resources and interstitial content items.
- FIG. 3A is an illustration of an example device session.
- FIG. 3B is a block diagram of an example data flow for assigning revenue for an interstitial content item.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process in which revenue is assigned for an interstitial content item.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an example data processing apparatus.
- a content management system assigns a portion of revenue, which is referred to as a revenue share, to participating publishers for an impression of an interstitial content item.
- An interstitial content item is a content item provided to user a device for display between presentations of resources of participating publishers.
- the content management system provides a user device with an interstitial content item, and identifies participating publishers whose resources were previously and/or subsequently visited by the user device during the same device session in which the interstitial content item was provided. In turn, the content management system can assign a portion of the revenue for the impression of the interstitial content item to each of the participating publishers.
- a user device may send a request for an interstitial advertisement to the content management system.
- the content management system determines whether to serve the user device an interstitial advertisement based on various factors, such as the publisher of the website that the user device just requested, which is referred to as the destination resource, and when the user last saw an advertisement.
- the content management system determines which publishers are entitled to advertising revenue for serving the interstitial advertisement. For example, the content management system can identify participating publishers that have web pages which were visited by the user device during the same device session in which the interstitial ad was provided to the user device.
- Participating publishers may be, for example, publishers who have agreed to display no advertisements on their web pages, or no banner advertisements on their web pages, in exchange for receiving revenue from the interstitial ads. Participating publishers may also be publishers that have agreed to other conditions or restrictions regarding the placement of content items on their web pages (or other resources). For example, a publisher that agrees to only present content items at specified portions of their web page (e.g., below the fold) or at specified times of day can be participating resources.
- Revenue can be assigned to the identified participating publishers based on several factors, such as how close a visit to a particular publisher's web page was (in time or in a chain of web page visits) to the serving of the interstitial ad, and whether or not any non-participating publisher web pages were viewed during the device session.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content management system that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content management system.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which interstitial content item revenue sharing can occur.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects publisher web sites 104 , user devices 106 , publishers 108 , and a content management system 110 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of publisher web sites 104 and user devices 106 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a content publisher 108 , which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is data that can be provided by the publisher 108 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website.
- the user devices 106 submit requests for resources 105 of a particular website from the publisher of that website.
- the request may include a unique identifier that identifies the user device 106 that submits the request.
- the unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with the publisher, or some other identifier that identifies the user device 106 or the user using the user device.
- the publisher of the web site 104 receives the request for the resource from the user device 106 and provides the resource to the requesting user device 106 .
- the requesting user device may then render the resource for display to a user.
- the content management system 110 controls distribution of content items with and between presentations of the resources 105 .
- the content management system 110 allows publishers to specify selection rules that take into account a context of a content item request to provide content items for the users.
- Example selection rules include keyword rules, in which content providers are enabled to provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries sent to a search engine or webpage content.
- Content items that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an impression being awarded in response to an auction (or another selection process) are selected for presentation in content item slots of resources.
- Content items can be provided for many different resources, such as a search results page resource, or one of the resources 105 included in a publisher websites.
- Content items may be provided in various forms.
- content items may include graphical advertisements, such as banner ads, text, images, audio, video, or a combination of one of more of any of such components.
- Content items may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- a content item impression refers to any form of presentation of a content item such that it is experienced by a user. In some examples, a content item impression may occur when a content item is displayed on a user device.
- a content item slot is a portion of a resource that is populated with a requested content item.
- the content item slot can be populated, for example, in response to a request for the content item that is initiated by way of the user device executing code corresponding to the content item slot when the resource is rendered at the user device.
- a content item is a discrete unit of content that is provided for presentation at a user device from which a request for the content item originated.
- Example content items include audio files, video files, advertisements, or other units of content that can be presented with a requested resource.
- Content item slots may have properties limiting the types of content items which can be displayed in the content item slot. For example, a banner content item slot may be limited to content items that fit a certain height to width ratio, and a content item slot may restrict content items to those without audio or video.
- An interstitial content item is a content item that is provided to a user device for display prior to display of a requested resource.
- the interstitial content item may be displayed for a predefined period of time, or until it is interacted with—e.g., selected by the user or dismissed.
- a resource requested by a user device includes instructions that cause the user device to request an interstitial content item from the content management system before the requested resource is displayed.
- the requested resource can include instructions that cause the user device to request and present an interstitial content item prior to presenting content of the requested resource.
- the request may include, for example, a publisher identifier, a device identifier that identifies the requesting user device 106 , and/or keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource 105 .
- the content management system 110 provides an interstitial content item to the requesting user device.
- Other methods may be used to provide interstitial content items to user devices, for example, instructions that cause the user device to request an interstitial content item may be provided by a resource the user device is currently viewing or from an application on the user device—such as a web browser.
- the user device 106 When a user of a user device 106 interacts with or otherwise selects a content item, the user device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the content item, which is typically a webpage of the content item provider.
- a landing page of the content item which is typically a webpage of the content item provider.
- an advertiser may have a website that includes web pages, some of which are landing pages for the advertisements of the advertisers.
- the content items can be provided for many different resources, such as the resources 105 of the publishers 108 , and on a search results page resource. In some implementations, certain types of content items may only be presented for certain resources. For example, the content management system 110 may only provide interstitial content items to user devices that are visiting participating resources, or resources of a participating publisher. A content item provider, such as an advertiser, compensates the content management system 110 for distribution of interstitial content items to user devices. The content management system 110 , in turn, can share the revenue received for presenting the content items with one or more publishers of resources associated with user devices' requests for content items.
- a content item provider such as an advertiser
- the content management system 110 may designate certain publishers 108 as participating publishers if the publishers agree to certain conditions regarding the display of content items. For example, participating publishers may be required to provide participating resources that meet certain conditions regarding content items, such as agreeing to not display banner advertisements on their resources and/or agreeing to not allow audio or video content items to be provided with their resources. Participating publishers may also be required to agree to revenue sharing for impressions of interstitial content items. The relationship between the content management system 110 , participating publishers, non-participating publishers, participating resources, and revenue sharing will be described in further detail below.
- the content management system 110 is in communication with a data storage system that stores content item data 112 , such as campaign data and performance data for content items.
- content item data 112 such as campaign data and performance data for content items.
- the campaign data can specify content items, selection information, and budgeting information for content item providers.
- the campaign data may also include information regarding content item providers who are also participating publishers, such as which participating resources they provide.
- the performance data stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data may include, for example, click through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items. Other performance data can also be stored.
- the content item data 112 may be used as input parameters to a content item selection process, such as an auction.
- a content item selection process such as an auction.
- the content management system 110 in response to a request for content items, can conduct an auction to select content items that are provided in response to the request.
- the content items may be ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is a value determined based on a content item bid and one or more parameters specified in the content item data 112 .
- One or more highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
- the content item data 112 may include interaction data that stores data related to user device interactions with resources and/or content items.
- the user device or publisher of the requested resource may provide data to the content management system 110 that indicates a device identifier for the user device along with a timestamp and/or data specifying the requested resource.
- the content management system 110 may store a device identifier for the corresponding user device in the interaction data along with a timestamp and/or data specifying the content item provided to the user device.
- publishers 108 provide the content management system 110 with data that specifies device identifiers and interactions recorded by the publisher for storage in the content item data 112 .
- the content management system 110 uses the content item data 112 to facilitate the distribution of interstitial content items to user devices 106 and to facilitate assigning revenue for the distribution of interstitial content items.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow 200 for requesting and receiving resources and interstitial content items.
- a user device 202 can send resource requests 208 for both participating resources 204 and non-participating resources 206 .
- the resources 210 provided to the user device 202 are rendered by the user device 202 for display to a user.
- a device session includes data identifying resource and content item requests for a period of time.
- a device session can be for any length of time and for any number of resource and content item requests.
- a device session may span a period of time during which a user or user device is logged into a particular network or application.
- requests for particular resources or content items, or a particular category of resource or content item may indicate the end or beginning of a device session.
- device sessions may span multiple browsing sessions of a user device. Other methods may be used to define and identify device sessions.
- the user device 202 sends requests for content items, including interstitial content item requests 212 , to the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 selectively provides content items, including interstitial content items 216 , to the user device 202 .
- each web page the user device 202 renders may include a script that causes the user device 202 to send a request for content items to the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 may also store, in the content item data 112 , a record 214 of the resources visited by a user device 202 during a device session.
- resource requests 208 and content item requests 212 can include a device identifier, e.g., “DID1,” that identifies the user device 202 .
- publishers of the requested resources provide the content management system 110 with the device identifier and data indicating the particular resource requested.
- the content item requests 212 also include the device identifier and data indicating the resource for which content items are being requested.
- the content management system 110 can determine which resources requested by a user device 202 during a device session were participating resources, and which were not.
- the record 214 indicates that the device identifier, “DID1,” requested Resource1 (non-participating), Resource2 (participating), and Resource3 (participating). The order in which the resources were requested is also included in the record 214 .
- only participating resources or requests for participating resources cause the user device 202 to request interstitial content items.
- they may place a script on those participating resources that, when executed by a user device, causes the user device to request an interstitial content item from the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 selectively determines whether to provide an interstitial content item upon receipt of the interstitial content item request. For example, the content management system 110 may only provide an interstitial content item to a user device that has not recently been provided with an interstitial content item. As another example, an interstitial content item may only be provided to a user device after a predetermined number of resources and/or content items have been provided to the user device without presentation of an interstitial content item, e.g., an interstitial content item may only be provided to a user device that has not been provided with an interstitial content item in response to requests for the three most recently requested resources.
- the content management system 110 may condition presentation of interstitial content items on a determination that at least two participating resources are consecutively requested. For example, if a device session begins with a user device visiting a non-participating resource, followed by a participating resource, no interstitial content item would be presented between the resources. In this example, if a third resource requested by the user device is a participating resource, an interstitial content item may be presented before presentation of the third resource, because there are at least two consecutively requested participating resources. Other numbers of consecutive participating resource requests may be used to throttle or condition presentation of interstitial content items.
- an amount of elapsed time may be used to throttle or condition presentation of interstitial content items.
- the content management system may be configured to provide an interstitial content item to a requesting user device only if the user device has not been provided with an interstitial content item within the preceding two minutes.
- Various combinations of time, number of requested resources, and/or consecutive participating resources may be used to throttle or condition presentation of interstitial content items.
- FIG. 3A is an illustration of an example device session 300
- FIG. 3B is a block diagram of an example data flow 350 for assigning revenue generated by presentation of an interstitial content item.
- the example device session 300 is illustrated in chronological order.
- Resource1 301 and Resource5 305 are non-participating resources
- Resource2 302 , Resource3 303 , Resource4 304 , and Resource6 306 are participating content items.
- participating and non-participating resources are identified by, respectively, a “P” and “NP.”
- participating resources are resources that are provided by a participating publisher and that meet certain conditions regarding content items presentation of content items. For example, a web page may only be a participating resource if it does not include an advertisement slot near (e.g., within a specified number of pixels of) the top of the page, or “above the fold.”
- the content management system 110 identifies an impression of an interstitial content item 310 during the device session 300 .
- a record of the resources requested and interstitial content items presented during the device session 300 are stored in the content item data 112 and accessed by the content management system 110 .
- sessions logs may be stored for device sessions that included presentation of an interstitial content item, and the content management system 110 may identify interstitial advertisement impressions recorded in the session logs.
- the content management system 110 identifies participating resources that were presented during the device session 300 . In some implementations, the content management system 110 identifies all participating resources presented during a device session that included presentation of an interstitial content item. In some implementations, the content management system 110 identifies a proper subset of the participating resources that includes only those participating resources that meet certain requirements. For example, the content management system 110 may include in the proper subset only those participating resources that were presented prior to the presentation of the interstitial content item. In such an implementation, Resource2 302 and Resource3 303 in the example data flow 350 were presented prior to the presentation of the interstitial content item 310 , and they may be the only participating resources identified for inclusion in the proper subset. As used herein, a presentation of a resource may include a resource request, as device session data may not, in some implementations, indicate whether a requested resource was actually presented at a user device.
- the participating resources identified by the content management system 110 include a destination resource that was presented subsequent to the interstitial content item 310 .
- resource4 304 is the destination resource that was presented subsequent to the interstitial content item 310 .
- the destination resource is a participating resource that includes instructions that cause a user device provided with the resource to request display of an interstitial content item before the destination resource is displayed.
- the interstitial content item may be in the form of a graphical overlay that is displayed on top of the destination resource, or it may be a separate web page.
- the participating resources identified by the content management system 110 are consecutive participating resources, and at least one of the consecutive resources is the destination resource.
- resource2 302 , resource3 303 , and resource4 304 may be the participating resources identified by the content management system 110 because they are consecutive participating resources and because resource4 304 is a destination resource.
- a distance in time or number of resource requests from the presentation of the interstitial content item 310 may be used to limit the number of participating resources identified.
- identification of participating resources may be limited to participating resources visited before presentation of the interstitial content item, or participating resources visited after presentation of the interstitial content item.
- the content management system 110 determines that two or more participating publishers are associated with the participating resources that were identified by the content management system 110 .
- each participating publisher is a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items.
- participating publishers that provide participating resources e.g., resources that do not include advertisements or certain kinds of content items—may be approved by the content management system 110 to receive revenue for interstitial content item impressions.
- Publisher2, Publisher3, Publisher4, and Publisher6 are all publishers of participating resources. Whether each participating publisher's corresponding resource was one of the participating resources identified by the content management system depends on the criteria used to identify the participating resources. For example, if the content management system identifies only consecutive participating resources, Resource6 would not be one of the identified resources because of intervening and non-participating Resource5 305 , and the content management system would determine that Publisher6 is not associated with one of the identified participating resources.
- the content management system 110 assigns a revenue share value to each of the participating publishers associated with the identified participating resources.
- Each revenue share value specifies a portion of the revenue the participating publisher is allocated for display of the interstitial content item. For example, if a content item provider pays the content management system 110 $1.00 for the impression of the interstitial content item 310 , a portion of the revenue is assigned to each of the participating publishers of the identified resources presented during the device session 300 .
- revenue is assigned to the participating publishers based on the distance of each participating resource from the destination resource.
- distance is measured by a number of resource requests between the participating resource and the destination resource.
- the destination resource, Resource4 304 would have a distance of 0 from itself, while Resource3 303 has a distance of 1, Resource2 302 has a distance of 2, and Resource6 306 has a distance of 2.
- Resource4 304 may receive the greatest portion of revenue
- resources Resource2 302 and Resource6 306 may receive the smallest portion of revenue
- Resource3 303 may receive a portion of revenue greater than Resource2 302 and Resource6 306 , but less than Resource4 304 .
- distance is measure by an amount of elapsed time between a request for the participating resource and a request for the destination resource.
- Resource2 302 and Resource6 306 are both two resource requests away from Resource4 304 , but a difference in elapsed time may result in different revenue share values being assigned to the corresponding publishers. If 10 minutes elapsed between presentation of Resource2 302 and Resource4 304 , but only 2 minutes elapsed between presentation of Resource4 304 and Resource6 306 , then the Publisher6 may be assigned a greater share of revenue than Publisher2.
- revenue is assigned to the participating publishers based on the distance of each participating resource from the presentation of the interstitial content item.
- Resource3 303 and Resource4 304 may both be the same distance from the impression of the interstitial content item 310 .
- the distance from the interstitial content item 310 impression may be measured in resource requests and/or time.
- revenue share is a calculated based on a predetermined formula.
- a graph 360 of an example formula is depicted in the example data flow 250 .
- the graph 360 indicates that revenue decreases as distance increases until no revenue is assigned past a distance of 3.
- revenue share may be split equally among the participating publishers.
- revenue share values are calculated relative to the distance of each other participating resource. For example, in a situation with two participating resources, where a first resource is a destination resource with a distance of 0, and a second resource is a participating resource with a distance of 3, the publisher of the first resource may be assigned a larger revenue share value than if the second resource had a distance of 1.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 in which revenue is from an interstitial content item is assigned to participating publishers.
- the process 400 may be implemented by data processing apparatus, such as the content management system.
- An interstitial content item that was presented during a particular device session is identified ( 402 ).
- impressions of interstitial content items may be recorded in a data storage device along with additional information related to the impression, such as device session data that describes other content items and resources provided to a user device during the same device session in which the interstitial content item was presented.
- Two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session are identified ( 404 ).
- various criteria may be used to determine which participating resources will be identified. For example, while many participating resources may be part of a device session in which an interstitial content item was displayed, only consecutive participating resources that are within a threshold distance of the impression of the interstitial content item may be identified.
- a participating resource is a resource that i) does not include a content item slot for displaying a banner content item, and ii) is provided by a participating publisher.
- participating resources may be identifiable based on other or additional criteria. For example, participating resources may, in some implementations, not have any content item slots, or may have no content item slots “above the fold.”
- the identified participating resources include a destination resource that was presented subsequent to the interstitial content item.
- the resource when a user device requests a resource, if the resource is a participating resource it may include data that, when executed by the user device, causes the user device to request and display an interstitial content item before the requested resource is presented.
- the requested participating resource is the destination resource, and it may be presented after the interstitial content item has either been selected or dismissed.
- the process 400 determines that two or more different participating publishers are associated with the two or more participating resources ( 406 ).
- a participating publisher is a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items.
- each participating publisher has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items based on the participating publisher's agreement to provide a resource that complies with conditions required to qualify as a participating resource and to share revenue generated by interstitial content items. For example, if five different participating resources are identified, the publisher of each resource may have previously agreed to share revenue obtained for the interstitial content item impression with other participating publishers whose participating resources were also presented during the device session.
- a revenue share value is assigned to each of the two or more participating publishers ( 408 ). For example, if there are five participating resources identified for a particular impression of an interstitial content item, and the five participating resources were provided by three different participating publishers, a revenue share value can be assigned to each of the participating publishers. In situations where a single participating publisher is associated with all of the participating resources identified for the device session, the single participating publisher may be the only publisher to whom a revenue share value is assigned.
- assigning a revenue share value includes identifying, for each participating resource, a distance of the participating resource from a destination resource and for each participating publisher, assigning revenue share based on the distance of each participating resource associated with the participating publisher relative to the distance of each other participating resource that is not associated with that participating publisher.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for interstitial content item revenue sharing. In one aspect, a method includes identifying an interstitial content item that was presented during a particular device session; identifying two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session; determining that two or more different participating publishers are associated with the two or more participating resources, each participating publisher being a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items; and assigning a revenue share value to each of the two or more participating publishers, each revenue share value specifying a portion of interstitial revenue that the participating publisher is allocated for display of the interstitial content item.
Description
- This specification relates to content distribution.
- The Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of resources, e.g., video and/or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, news articles, etc. Access to these resources has likewise enabled opportunities to provide additional content with the resources. For example, a user device may request a resource, such as a news web page from a news publisher, by submitting a resource request to the publisher. The web page can include instructions that cause the user device to request content items for presentation with the web page. Content items that may be of interest to a user can be identified by a content management system in response to the request. The request can include information the content management system can use to identify content items to be provided to the user device in response to the request.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying an interstitial content item that was presented during a particular device session; identifying two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session; determining that two or more different participating publishers are associated with the two or more participating resources, each participating publisher being a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items; and assigning a revenue share value to each of the two or more participating publishers, each revenue share value specifying a portion of interstitial revenue that the participating publisher is allocated for display of the interstitial content item. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The two or more participating resources may include a destination resource that was presented subsequent to the interstitial content item.
- Identifying two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session may comprise: identifying, from a plurality of resources requested during the particular device session, two or more consecutive resources that are each associated with a participating publisher, where at least one of the consecutive resources is the destination resource; and identifying, as the two or more participating resources, the consecutive resources.
- Assigning a revenue share value to each of the two or more participating publishers may comprise: identifying, for each of the two or more participating resources, a distance of the participating resource from the destination resource; and for each of the two or more participating publishers, assigning the revenue share to the participating publisher based on the distance of each participating resource associated with the participating publisher relative to the distance of each other participating resource that is not associated with the participating publisher.
- The distance for each participating resource may be measured by a number of resource requests between the participating resource and the destination resource. The distance for each participating resource may be measured by an amount of elapsed time between a request for the participating resource and a request for the destination resource.
- The destination resource may have caused presentation of the interstitial content item prior to presentation of the destination resource.
- Each participating resource may be a resource that i) does not include a content item slot for displaying a banner content item, and ii) is provided by a participating publisher.
- Each participating publisher may have been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items based on the participating publisher's agreement to provide participating resources.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize none, one, or more of the following advantages. Sharing revenue generated by presentation of interstitial content items with participating publishers (e.g., publishers that agree to share revenue and provide resources that don't include banner advertisements) provides publishers with an incentive to provide participating resources (e.g., resources that don't include banner advertisements). Participating resources may have less prominent slots for content items, allowing a participating publisher to utilize space in participating resources for publisher provided content rather than presentation of third party content items. Various revenue sharing methods also promote cross-promotion between participating publishers, resulting in shared revenue for participating publishers who promote participating resources of other participating publishers. Users who visit participating resources may be provided with more prominent content provided by the publisher of the resource than a non-participating resource that may provide third party content items with more prominence than publisher provided content. Content item providers are provided with opportunities to have content items presented at user devices without competing for a user's attention with other content at the same time. Users may be more willing and able to be attentive to interstitial content items presented between resources of participating publishers due to the lack of prominent third party content items on the participating publisher pages. Providing interstitial content items of interest to users may, in turn, lead to satisfaction of users' informational needs.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- A content management system assigns a portion of revenue, which is referred to as a revenue share, to participating publishers for an impression of an interstitial content item. An interstitial content item is a content item provided to user a device for display between presentations of resources of participating publishers. The content management system provides a user device with an interstitial content item, and identifies participating publishers whose resources were previously and/or subsequently visited by the user device during the same device session in which the interstitial content item was provided. In turn, the content management system can assign a portion of the revenue for the impression of the interstitial content item to each of the participating publishers.
- For example, when navigating to a web page of a participating publisher, a user device may send a request for an interstitial advertisement to the content management system. Upon receipt of the request, the content management system determines whether to serve the user device an interstitial advertisement based on various factors, such as the publisher of the website that the user device just requested, which is referred to as the destination resource, and when the user last saw an advertisement. After providing the interstitial ad to the user device, the content management system determines which publishers are entitled to advertising revenue for serving the interstitial advertisement. For example, the content management system can identify participating publishers that have web pages which were visited by the user device during the same device session in which the interstitial ad was provided to the user device. Participating publishers may be, for example, publishers who have agreed to display no advertisements on their web pages, or no banner advertisements on their web pages, in exchange for receiving revenue from the interstitial ads. Participating publishers may also be publishers that have agreed to other conditions or restrictions regarding the placement of content items on their web pages (or other resources). For example, a publisher that agrees to only present content items at specified portions of their web page (e.g., below the fold) or at specified times of day can be participating resources.
- Revenue can be assigned to the identified participating publishers based on several factors, such as how close a visit to a particular publisher's web page was (in time or in a chain of web page visits) to the serving of the interstitial ad, and whether or not any non-participating publisher web pages were viewed during the device session.
- In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content management system that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content management system.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which interstitial content item revenue sharing can occur. Acomputer network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectspublisher web sites 104,user devices 106,publishers 108, and acontent management system 110. Theonline environment 100 may include many thousands ofpublisher web sites 104 anduser devices 106. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 is maintained by acontent publisher 108, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 is data that can be provided by thepublisher 108 over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website. - The
user devices 106 submit requests forresources 105 of a particular website from the publisher of that website. The request may include a unique identifier that identifies theuser device 106 that submits the request. The unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with the publisher, or some other identifier that identifies theuser device 106 or the user using the user device. - The publisher of the
web site 104 receives the request for the resource from theuser device 106 and provides the resource to the requestinguser device 106. The requesting user device may then render the resource for display to a user. - The
content management system 110 controls distribution of content items with and between presentations of theresources 105. For example, thecontent management system 110 allows publishers to specify selection rules that take into account a context of a content item request to provide content items for the users. Example selection rules include keyword rules, in which content providers are enabled to provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries sent to a search engine or webpage content. Content items that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an impression being awarded in response to an auction (or another selection process) are selected for presentation in content item slots of resources. Content items can be provided for many different resources, such as a search results page resource, or one of theresources 105 included in a publisher websites. - Content items may be provided in various forms. In some examples, content items may include graphical advertisements, such as banner ads, text, images, audio, video, or a combination of one of more of any of such components. Content items may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. A content item impression refers to any form of presentation of a content item such that it is experienced by a user. In some examples, a content item impression may occur when a content item is displayed on a user device.
- A content item slot is a portion of a resource that is populated with a requested content item. The content item slot can be populated, for example, in response to a request for the content item that is initiated by way of the user device executing code corresponding to the content item slot when the resource is rendered at the user device. As used throughout this document, a content item is a discrete unit of content that is provided for presentation at a user device from which a request for the content item originated. Example content items include audio files, video files, advertisements, or other units of content that can be presented with a requested resource. Content item slots may have properties limiting the types of content items which can be displayed in the content item slot. For example, a banner content item slot may be limited to content items that fit a certain height to width ratio, and a content item slot may restrict content items to those without audio or video.
- An interstitial content item is a content item that is provided to a user device for display prior to display of a requested resource. In some implementations, the interstitial content item may be displayed for a predefined period of time, or until it is interacted with—e.g., selected by the user or dismissed. In some implementations, a resource requested by a user device includes instructions that cause the user device to request an interstitial content item from the content management system before the requested resource is displayed. For example, the requested resource can include instructions that cause the user device to request and present an interstitial content item prior to presenting content of the requested resource.
- The request may include, for example, a publisher identifier, a device identifier that identifies the requesting
user device 106, and/or keyword identifiers related to the content of theresource 105. Thecontent management system 110, in turn, provides an interstitial content item to the requesting user device. Other methods may be used to provide interstitial content items to user devices, for example, instructions that cause the user device to request an interstitial content item may be provided by a resource the user device is currently viewing or from an application on the user device—such as a web browser. - When a user of a
user device 106 interacts with or otherwise selects a content item, theuser device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the content item, which is typically a webpage of the content item provider. For example, an advertiser may have a website that includes web pages, some of which are landing pages for the advertisements of the advertisers. - The content items can be provided for many different resources, such as the
resources 105 of thepublishers 108, and on a search results page resource. In some implementations, certain types of content items may only be presented for certain resources. For example, thecontent management system 110 may only provide interstitial content items to user devices that are visiting participating resources, or resources of a participating publisher. A content item provider, such as an advertiser, compensates thecontent management system 110 for distribution of interstitial content items to user devices. Thecontent management system 110, in turn, can share the revenue received for presenting the content items with one or more publishers of resources associated with user devices' requests for content items. - The
content management system 110 may designatecertain publishers 108 as participating publishers if the publishers agree to certain conditions regarding the display of content items. For example, participating publishers may be required to provide participating resources that meet certain conditions regarding content items, such as agreeing to not display banner advertisements on their resources and/or agreeing to not allow audio or video content items to be provided with their resources. Participating publishers may also be required to agree to revenue sharing for impressions of interstitial content items. The relationship between thecontent management system 110, participating publishers, non-participating publishers, participating resources, and revenue sharing will be described in further detail below. - The
content management system 110 is in communication with a data storage system that storescontent item data 112, such as campaign data and performance data for content items. For example, the campaign data can specify content items, selection information, and budgeting information for content item providers. The campaign data may also include information regarding content item providers who are also participating publishers, such as which participating resources they provide. The performance data stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data may include, for example, click through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items. Other performance data can also be stored. - The
content item data 112 may be used as input parameters to a content item selection process, such as an auction. For example, thecontent management system 110, in response to a request for content items, can conduct an auction to select content items that are provided in response to the request. The content items may be ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is a value determined based on a content item bid and one or more parameters specified in thecontent item data 112. One or more highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device. - The
content item data 112 may include interaction data that stores data related to user device interactions with resources and/or content items. For example, in response to a user device's resource request, the user device or publisher of the requested resource may provide data to thecontent management system 110 that indicates a device identifier for the user device along with a timestamp and/or data specifying the requested resource. In response to a user device's content item request, thecontent management system 110 may store a device identifier for the corresponding user device in the interaction data along with a timestamp and/or data specifying the content item provided to the user device. In some implementations,publishers 108 provide thecontent management system 110 with data that specifies device identifiers and interactions recorded by the publisher for storage in thecontent item data 112. - As described in further detail below, the
content management system 110 uses thecontent item data 112 to facilitate the distribution of interstitial content items touser devices 106 and to facilitate assigning revenue for the distribution of interstitial content items. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow 200 for requesting and receiving resources and interstitial content items. During a device session, a user device 202 can sendresource requests 208 for both participatingresources 204 andnon-participating resources 206. The resources 210 provided to the user device 202 are rendered by the user device 202 for display to a user. - A device session includes data identifying resource and content item requests for a period of time. A device session can be for any length of time and for any number of resource and content item requests. In some implementations, a device session may span a period of time during which a user or user device is logged into a particular network or application. In some implementations, requests for particular resources or content items, or a particular category of resource or content item, may indicate the end or beginning of a device session. In some implementations, device sessions may span multiple browsing sessions of a user device. Other methods may be used to define and identify device sessions.
- During a device session, the user device 202 sends requests for content items, including interstitial content item requests 212, to the
content management system 110. In response, thecontent management system 110 selectively provides content items, includinginterstitial content items 216, to the user device 202. For example, each web page the user device 202 renders may include a script that causes the user device 202 to send a request for content items to thecontent management system 110. - The
content management system 110 may also store, in thecontent item data 112, arecord 214 of the resources visited by a user device 202 during a device session. For example, resource requests 208 and content item requests 212 can include a device identifier, e.g., “DID1,” that identifies the user device 202. In some implementations, publishers of the requested resources provide thecontent management system 110 with the device identifier and data indicating the particular resource requested. In some implementations, the content item requests 212 also include the device identifier and data indicating the resource for which content items are being requested. Thecontent management system 110 can determine which resources requested by a user device 202 during a device session were participating resources, and which were not. In the example environment 200, therecord 214 indicates that the device identifier, “DID1,” requested Resource1 (non-participating), Resource2 (participating), and Resource3 (participating). The order in which the resources were requested is also included in therecord 214. - In some implementations, only participating resources or requests for participating resources cause the user device 202 to request interstitial content items. For example, when publishers provide participating resources, they may place a script on those participating resources that, when executed by a user device, causes the user device to request an interstitial content item from the
content management system 110. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 selectively determines whether to provide an interstitial content item upon receipt of the interstitial content item request. For example, thecontent management system 110 may only provide an interstitial content item to a user device that has not recently been provided with an interstitial content item. As another example, an interstitial content item may only be provided to a user device after a predetermined number of resources and/or content items have been provided to the user device without presentation of an interstitial content item, e.g., an interstitial content item may only be provided to a user device that has not been provided with an interstitial content item in response to requests for the three most recently requested resources. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 may condition presentation of interstitial content items on a determination that at least two participating resources are consecutively requested. For example, if a device session begins with a user device visiting a non-participating resource, followed by a participating resource, no interstitial content item would be presented between the resources. In this example, if a third resource requested by the user device is a participating resource, an interstitial content item may be presented before presentation of the third resource, because there are at least two consecutively requested participating resources. Other numbers of consecutive participating resource requests may be used to throttle or condition presentation of interstitial content items. - In some implementations, an amount of elapsed time may be used to throttle or condition presentation of interstitial content items. For example, the content management system may be configured to provide an interstitial content item to a requesting user device only if the user device has not been provided with an interstitial content item within the preceding two minutes. Various combinations of time, number of requested resources, and/or consecutive participating resources may be used to throttle or condition presentation of interstitial content items.

For example, a web page may only be a participating resource if it does not include an advertisement slot near (e.g., within a specified number of pixels of) the top of the page, or “above the fold.” - The
content management system 110 identifies an impression of aninterstitial content item 310 during thedevice session 300. In theexample data flow 350, a record of the resources requested and interstitial content items presented during thedevice session 300 are stored in thecontent item data 112 and accessed by thecontent management system 110. For example, sessions logs may be stored for device sessions that included presentation of an interstitial content item, and thecontent management system 110 may identify interstitial advertisement impressions recorded in the session logs. - The
content management system 110 identifies participating resources that were presented during thedevice session 300. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 identifies all participating resources presented during a device session that included presentation of an interstitial content item. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 identifies a proper subset of the participating resources that includes only those participating resources that meet certain requirements. For example, thecontent management system 110 may include in the proper subset only those participating resources that were presented prior to the presentation of the interstitial content item. In such an implementation,Resource2 302 andResource3 303 in theexample data flow 350 were presented prior to the presentation of theinterstitial content item 310, and they may be the only participating resources identified for inclusion in the proper subset. As used herein, a presentation of a resource may include a resource request, as device session data may not, in some implementations, indicate whether a requested resource was actually presented at a user device. - In some implementations, the participating resources identified by the
content management system 110 include a destination resource that was presented subsequent to theinterstitial content item 310. In theexample device session 300,resource4 304 is the destination resource that was presented subsequent to theinterstitial content item 310. In some implementations, the destination resource is a participating resource that includes instructions that cause a user device provided with the resource to request display of an interstitial content item before the destination resource is displayed. For example, the interstitial content item may be in the form of a graphical overlay that is displayed on top of the destination resource, or it may be a separate web page. - In some implementations, the participating resources identified by the
content management system 110 are consecutive participating resources, and at least one of the consecutive resources is the destination resource. In theexample data flow 350,resource2 302,resource3 303, andresource4 304 may be the participating resources identified by thecontent management system 110 because they are consecutive participating resources and becauseresource4 304 is a destination resource. - Other criteria or combinations of criteria may be used to identify participating resources. For example, a distance in time or number of resource requests from the presentation of the
interstitial content item 310 may be used to limit the number of participating resources identified. As another example, identification of participating resources may be limited to participating resources visited before presentation of the interstitial content item, or participating resources visited after presentation of the interstitial content item. - The
content management system 110 determines that two or more participating publishers are associated with the participating resources that were identified by thecontent management system 110. As discussed above, each participating publisher is a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items. For example, participating publishers that provide participating resources—e.g., resources that do not include advertisements or certain kinds of content items—may be approved by thecontent management system 110 to receive revenue for interstitial content item impressions. - In the
example device session 300, Publisher2, Publisher3, Publisher4, and Publisher6 are all publishers of participating resources. Whether each participating publisher's corresponding resource was one of the participating resources identified by the content management system depends on the criteria used to identify the participating resources. For example, if the content management system identifies only consecutive participating resources, Resource6 would not be one of the identified resources because of intervening andnon-participating Resource5 305, and the content management system would determine that Publisher6 is not associated with one of the identified participating resources. - The
content management system 110 assigns a revenue share value to each of the participating publishers associated with the identified participating resources. Each revenue share value specifies a portion of the revenue the participating publisher is allocated for display of the interstitial content item. For example, if a content item provider pays thecontent management system 110 $1.00 for the impression of theinterstitial content item 310, a portion of the revenue is assigned to each of the participating publishers of the identified resources presented during thedevice session 300. - In some implementations, revenue is assigned to the participating publishers based on the distance of each participating resource from the destination resource. In some implementations, distance is measured by a number of resource requests between the participating resource and the destination resource. In the
example device session 300, the destination resource,Resource4 304, would have a distance of 0 from itself, whileResource3 303 has a distance of 1,Resource2 302 has a distance of 2, andResource6 306 has a distance of 2. Accordingly,Resource4 304 may receive the greatest portion of revenue,resources Resource2 302 andResource6 306 may receive the smallest portion of revenue, andResource3 303 may receive a portion of revenue greater thanResource2 302 andResource6 306, but less thanResource4 304. - In some implementations, distance is measure by an amount of elapsed time between a request for the participating resource and a request for the destination resource. For example,
Resource2 302 andResource6 306 are both two resource requests away fromResource4 304, but a difference in elapsed time may result in different revenue share values being assigned to the corresponding publishers. If 10 minutes elapsed between presentation ofResource2 302 andResource4 304, but only 2 minutes elapsed between presentation ofResource4 304 andResource6 306, then the Publisher6 may be assigned a greater share of revenue than Publisher2. - In some implementations, revenue is assigned to the participating publishers based on the distance of each participating resource from the presentation of the interstitial content item. In this implementation,
Resource3 303 andResource4 304 may both be the same distance from the impression of theinterstitial content item 310. As with the destination resource, the distance from theinterstitial content item 310 impression may be measured in resource requests and/or time. - Many methods may be used to determine the actual revenue share values assigned to each participating publisher. In some implementations, revenue share is a calculated based on a predetermined formula. A
graph 360 of an example formula is depicted in the example data flow 250. Thegraph 360 indicates that revenue decreases as distance increases until no revenue is assigned past a distance of 3. In some implementations, revenue share may be split equally among the participating publishers. In some implementations, revenue share values are calculated relative to the distance of each other participating resource. For example, in a situation with two participating resources, where a first resource is a destination resource with a distance of 0, and a second resource is a participating resource with a distance of 3, the publisher of the first resource may be assigned a larger revenue share value than if the second resource had a distance of 1. -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 in which revenue is from an interstitial content item is assigned to participating publishers. The process 400 may be implemented by data processing apparatus, such as the content management system. - An interstitial content item that was presented during a particular device session is identified (402). For example, impressions of interstitial content items may be recorded in a data storage device along with additional information related to the impression, such as device session data that describes other content items and resources provided to a user device during the same device session in which the interstitial content item was presented.
- Two or more participating resources that were requested during the particular device session are identified (404). In some implementations, various criteria may be used to determine which participating resources will be identified. For example, while many participating resources may be part of a device session in which an interstitial content item was displayed, only consecutive participating resources that are within a threshold distance of the impression of the interstitial content item may be identified. In some implementations, a participating resource is a resource that i) does not include a content item slot for displaying a banner content item, and ii) is provided by a participating publisher. As described above, participating resources may be identifiable based on other or additional criteria. For example, participating resources may, in some implementations, not have any content item slots, or may have no content item slots “above the fold.”
- In some implementations, the identified participating resources include a destination resource that was presented subsequent to the interstitial content item. For example, when a user device requests a resource, if the resource is a participating resource it may include data that, when executed by the user device, causes the user device to request and display an interstitial content item before the requested resource is presented. The requested participating resource is the destination resource, and it may be presented after the interstitial content item has either been selected or dismissed.
- The process 400 determines that two or more different participating publishers are associated with the two or more participating resources (406). In some implementations, a participating publisher is a publisher that has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items. In some implementations, each participating publisher has been approved to receive revenue for presentation of interstitial content items based on the participating publisher's agreement to provide a resource that complies with conditions required to qualify as a participating resource and to share revenue generated by interstitial content items. For example, if five different participating resources are identified, the publisher of each resource may have previously agreed to share revenue obtained for the interstitial content item impression with other participating publishers whose participating resources were also presented during the device session.
- A revenue share value is assigned to each of the two or more participating publishers (408). For example, if there are five participating resources identified for a particular impression of an interstitial content item, and the five participating resources were provided by three different participating publishers, a revenue share value can be assigned to each of the participating publishers. In situations where a single participating publisher is associated with all of the participating resources identified for the device session, the single participating publisher may be the only publisher to whom a revenue share value is assigned.
- In some implementations, assigning a revenue share value includes identifying, for each participating resource, a distance of the participating resource from a destination resource and for each participating publisher, assigning revenue share based on the distance of each participating resource associated with the participating publisher relative to the distance of each other participating resource that is not associated with that participating publisher. Using the example of five participating resources provided by three different publishers, if one of the publishers provided the destination resource and the two resources nearest the destination resource, that publisher may be entitled to the majority of the revenue. However, if the publisher's three participating resources were all further from the destination resource than the other two participating resources, the publisher may not receive the majority of the revenue, despite providing three of the five participating resources.
