- these surfaces shall have particular shapes, in particular the constant energy surface (in the k x–k y plane) shall have straight portions with the broadest possible extension, and the group velocities shall be directed outwards with respect to the centre of the diagram. The wider and the flatter are said portions, the larger will be the range of group velocities having the same direction (i.e. the more collimated will be the guided light).

- FIG. 4 b shows the corresponding wave surface (v gx–v gy plane).
- a isotropic distribution of group velocities about a predetermined crystal axis in an angular range of ⁇ /3 for a triangular array, and of ⁇ /2 for a square array has to be considered as a starting condition, and the parameters R, n and ⁇ n may be varied for example as follows.
- the parameter R may be varied in a range that is chosen by taking into account the current technological difficulties in realizing large aspect ratio holes arrays in photonic crystals.
- a suitable range is for example between 0.15 and 0.45.
- the parameter n may be is varied in a range of values including those of the currently most suitable dielectric materials for the manufacturing of photonic crystals, such as SiO 2 , SiO x N y and GaAs: for example the values 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.25 and 3.5 may be considered.

- K ⁇ i ⁇ ( ⁇ i - ⁇ ) 4 ⁇ r ⁇ ( ⁇ i ) ⁇ i ⁇ r ⁇ ( ⁇ i ) .
- the curve of the group velocity distribution is relatively sharp and has the maximum height ⁇ h. If ⁇ n is varied in one direction or the other with respect to its optimum value, the distribution undergoes an abrupt decrease of ⁇ h, and an increase of the kurtosis K and of the variance ⁇ . In particular, variations of the parameter ⁇ n with respect to said optimum condition determine either a broadening of the distribution or the appearance of a ring in the curve, and it can be demonstrated that both conditions are undesirable.
- ⁇ n When the optimum value of ⁇ n is found for a predetermined couple of values of n and R, it is checked if the values of the variance ar and of the percentage of points within the specifies angular range for the considered tern of values of n, R and ⁇ n satisfies the above-mentioned conditions for photon guiding.

- a normalized intensity of the input beam is detected at a detection point DP distant 5 ⁇ m from the interface 802 . It has been observed that the beam intensity at DP is about 98.76% of the input beam intensity. It has also been observed that losses at the interface 802 are small.
Abstract
Description
-
- a predetermined percentage of the group velocities is oriented within a predetermined sub-range of the original angular range;
- the angular distribution of the module of the group velocities shows a peak along the considered propagation axis, and has a width at half-maximum lower than a predetermined value.
where θi indicates the angle with respect to the considered direction, and μ is the average of said distribution about said direction and is equal to 0 for a triangular array and to π/4 for a square array.
-
- for triangular array geometry:
- relative spacing R: between 0.15 and 0.5, more preferably between about 0.20 and 0.45, still more preferably between about 0.25 and 0.4;
- refractive index n: between 1.5 and 4.5, more preferably between 2.5 and 3.5;
- normalized frequency ωn: between about 0.17 and 0.42, more preferably between about 0.25 and 0.40.
