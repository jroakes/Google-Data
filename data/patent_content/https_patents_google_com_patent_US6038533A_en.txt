Definitions
- This invention relates to speech synthesis systems and more particularly to the selection of training text for such systems.
- the limitations described above will generally be intolerable.
- the working vocabulary of such a system must be at least in the tens of thousands of words. And, many of those words will require different inflection, accentuation and/or syllabic stress, depending on context. It will readily be appreciated that the task of recording, storing and recalling the necessary vocabulary of words (as well as the task of recognizing which stored version of a particular word is required by the immediate context) would require immense human and computational resources, and as a practical matter could not be implemented.
- synthesized speech In order to make synthesized speech of more than a few words acceptable to users, it must be as human-like as possible. Thus, the synthesized speech must include appropriate pauses, inflections, accentuation and syllabic stress. Obviously, the staccato delivery style of the rudimentary system would be unacceptable.
- speech synthesis systems which can provide a human-like delivery quality for non-trivial input textual speech must not only be able to handle the necessary vocabulary size but also must be able to correctly pronounce the "words" read, to appropriately emphasize some words and de-emphasize others, to "chunk" a sentence into meaningful phrases, to pick an appropriate pitch contour and to establish the duration of each phonetic segment, or phoneme--recognizing that a given phoneme should be longer if it appears in some positions in a sentence than in others.
- such a system will operate to convert input text into some form of linguistic representation that includes information on the phonemes to be produced, their duration, the location of any phrase boundaries and the pitch contour to be used. This linguistic representation of the underlying text can then be converted into a speech waveform.
- FIG. 1 such a system is depicted in broad functional form.
- input text is first operated on by a Text Analysis function, 1. That function essentially comprises the conversion of the input text into a linguistic representation of that text. Included in this text analysis function are the subfunctions of identification of phonemes corresponding to the underlying text, determination of the stress to be placed on various syllables and words comprising the text, application of word pronunciation rules to the input text, and determining the location of phrase boundaries for the text and the pitch to be associated with the synthesized speech.
- Other, generally less important functions may also be included in the overall text analysis function, but they need not be further discussed herein.
- the system of FIG. 1 performs the function depicted as Acoustic Analysis 5.
- Acoustic Analysis 5 determines the duration of each phoneme in the synthesized speech in order to closely approximate the natural speech being emulated.
- This phoneme duration aspect of the Acoustic Analysis function represents the portion of a speech synthesis system to which our invention is directed and will be described in more detail below.
- Speech Generation operates on data and/or parameters developed by preceding functions in order to construct a speech waveform corresponding to the text being synthesized into speech.
- Speech Generation function operates to assure that the speech waveform for each phoneme corresponds to the duration for that phoneme determined by the Acoustic Analysis function.
- the duration of a phonetic segment varies as a function of contextual factors. These factors include the identities of the surrounding segments, within-word position, word prominence, presence of phrase boundaries, as well as other factors. It is generally believed that for synthetic speech to sound natural, these durational patterns must be mimicked. To realize these durational patterns in a synthesizer, the Acoustic Analysis function operates on parameters derived from test speech read by a selected speaker. From an analysis of such test speech, and particularly phoneme duration data obtained therefrom, speech synthesis systems can be constructed to essentially emulate the durational patterns of the selected speaker.
- the test speech will contain a number of preselected sentences read by the selected speaker and recorded. This recorded test speech is then analyzed in terms of the durations of the individual phonemes contained in the spoken test sentences. From this data, rules are developed for predicting the durations of such phonemes in text which is to be synthesized into speech, given a context in which the words containing such phonemes appear. While the general character of such rules is known for at least the major languages, based on a large body of prior research into speech characteristics--which research has been widely reported and will be well known to those skilled in the art of speech synthesis, it is necessary to adapt those general rules to the durational patterns of the selected speaker in order to cause the synthesizer to mimic that speaker. Such adaptation is accomplished through the valuation of parameters contained in the rules, and this parameter valuation is based on the phoneme duration data derived from the test speech.
- a system and method are provided for selecting units from a corpus of such units based on an analysis of sets of elements corresponding to each such unit with a resultant of an optimum collection of such units.
- the invention involves the combination of mapping, via the design matrix, of a feature space to the parameter space of a linear model and applying efficient greedy methods to find a submatrix of full rank, thereby yielding a small set of units containing enough data to estimate the parameters of the model.
- the method of the invention is applied to the function of speech synthesis and particularly to the determination of a small set of test sentences (derived, by the process of the invention, from a large corpus of such sentences) that yields sufficient data for estimation of parameters for the duration model of the speech synthesizer.
- FIG. 1 depicts in functional form the essential elements of a text-to-speech synthesis system.
- FIG. 2 shows the functional elements of the invention as a subset of the elements of a partially depicted text-to-speech synthesis system.
- FIG. 3 depicts a two factor incidence matrix which provides a foundation for the process of the invention.
- FIG. 4 provides a flow diagram for the operation of the invention.
- An essential idea of our invention is the combination of mapping, via a design matrix, the feature space of a domain to the parameter space of a linear model and then applying efficient greedy algorithm methods to the design matrix in order to find a submatrix of full rank, thereby yielding a small set of elements containing enough data to estimate the parameters of the model.
- processors For clarity of explanation, the illustrative embodiment of the present invention is presented as comprising individual functional blocks (including functional blocks labeled as "processors"). The functions these blocks represent may be provided through the use of either shared or dedicated hardware, including, but not limited to, hardware capable of executing software. For example the functions of processors presented in FIG. 2 may be provided by a single shared processor. (Use of the term "processor” should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software.)
- Illustrative embodiments may comprise digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, such as the AT&T DSP16 or DSP32C, read-only memory (ROM) for storing software performing the operations discussed below, and random access memory (RAM) for storing DSP results.
- DSP digital signal processor
- ROM read-only memory
- RAM random access memory
- VLSI Very large scale integration
- each phonetic segment induces a feature vector representing the set of values corresponding to each speech factor associated with that phonetic segment--e.g., (/c/, word initial, phrase initial, stressed syllable, . . . ).
- Existing text selection methods employ greedy algorithms to select a set of sentences from a corpus of such sentences to cover the induced feature space.
- the resulting subcorpus of test sentences is relatively large.
- our invention we choose a linear model for determining duration and other speech values for phonetic segments, and with such a model are able to map the feature vectors for each associated phonetic segment into a design matrix that is related to the parameter space of the model rather than the feature space of the domain.
- greedy algorithm methods to the design matrix, we are able to achieve a set of test sentences which is substantially smaller than that produced by the prior art method of applying the greedy algorithm to the feature space.
- the method of our invention begins with a large corpus of text to assure reasonably complete coverage of the very large number of speech vectors having a major effect on segmental duration.
- this corpus will include at least several hundred thousand sentences, and for ease of data entry, this text corpus should occur as an on-line data base.
- FIG. 2 illustrates the functional elements of the invention as a subset of the elements of a partially depicted text-to-speech synthesis system.
- text corpus 20 is input, via switch 25 (which, along with companion switch 40, enables commonly used TTS functions to be switched between supporting the process of the invention or the TTS process) to Text Analysis module 30, which may be functionally equivalent to the generalized Text Analysis processor 1 of FIG. 1 and having the capabilities previously described for that processor.
- the function of Text Analysis module 30 is the establishment of a set of feature vectors corresponding to each phonetic segment in each sentence in text corpus 20, along with appropriate annotation of each feature vector in each set to identify the specific sentence from which that set of feature vectors was derived.
- Annotated Text 35 will be a set of feature vectors corresponding to each sentence in the text corpus. Those feature vectors may be grouped into sets corresponding to the individual sentences in Text Corpus 20 or to collections of such sentences.
- Such Annotated Text 35 is then provided, via switch 40, to the input of Text Selection module 45, which, as will be seen from the figure, comprises sub-elements Model-Based Parameter Space Mapping processor 50, and Greedy Algorithm processor 60.
- each set of sentence-bounded feature vectors will initially be mapped into an incidence matrix by Model-Based Parameter Space Mapping processor 50.
- the rows of this exemplary incidence matrix represent various vowel values and the columns represent various stress values.
- the cells in the matrix represent a stress value and a vowel value corresponding to that position actually occurring in the sentence represented by that matrix.
- the process of finding a full-rank design matrix corresponding to a group of sentences which can be used to estimate the duration parameters will be carried out by Greedy Algorithm processor 60, through iterative application of a greedy algorithm to the collection of the design matrices corresponding to the sentences in the text corpus. As will be understood, such a full-rank matrix will ultimately be achieved (if it is possible to reach full rank based on the input data).
- Selected Text 65 which represent an optimal set of sentences from Text Corpus 20 for developing the needed parameters associated with Model 70.
- Selected Text is then operated on, along with input from Model 70, by Parameter Analysis module 80, using known analysis methods, to provide Parameter Data 75, for use by Acoustic Module 90, in conjunction with input from Model 70, for predicting the duration of phonemes in text to be synthesized.
- Acoustic Module 90 may also be made a part of the TTS operations path, by operation of Switch 40, to actually determine duration and other acoustic parameters for text to be synthesized by the TTS. In such a TTS mode, an output of the Acoustic Module will provide an input to other downstream TTS functions, including generation of the synthesized speech, corresponding to Speech Generation function 10 in FIG. 1.
- FIG. 4 A flow diagram illustrating the functional elements of the invention is shown in FIG. 4.
- a corpus of text 100
- Text Processings 105 to produce sets of feature vectors corresponding to each sentence in the text corpus.
- Those sets of feature vectors are then mapped into a plurality of incidence matrices (110), which are in turn converted to design matrices (115) based on the duration model (120) chosen.
- a greedy algorithm (125) for finding the matroid cover for this plurality of design matrices and incorporating modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure (130) is applied to find an optimum full-rank matrix (135).
- an important aspect of the invention is that of model-based selection, and particularly the application of a greedy algorithm to the parameter space of a linear model, as represented by the plurality of design matrices, to find an optimal submatrix of full rank, thereby yielding a small set of elements (sentences 140) containing enough data to estimate the parameters of the model.
- Each phonetic segment corresponds to a feature vector as follows.
- F ⁇ 1, . . . , N ⁇ , for some N, of factors.
- one factor might be the phonetic segment itself.
- the features would be the set of possible phonetic segments--in American English, there are about forty (see, e.g., Olive, J. P., Greenwood, A. and Coleman, J. Acoustics of American English Speech, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1993).
- the two models differ in the constraints on the parameters S I .
- each parameter that depends on multiple factors can be decomposed into a product of parameters, each of which only depends on a single factor.
- the analysis-of-variance model relates directly to the design matrix, which is the input to the matroid cover algorithm.
- Equation 8 is the basis for the design matrix, which we next discuss.
- the TTS must assign a duration to each phonetic segment to be spoken. Given a phonetic segment p, it is straightforward to construct the corresponding feature vector f(p) and the row vector r(f(p)) as defined in Section A2 above. If the vector is available, then the duration of the phonetic segment is simply r(f) ⁇ . The problem in synthesizer construction, therefore, is to determine the vector for the speaker whose voice is being synthesized.
- D(C) ⁇ (D( ⁇ 1 ) ⁇ . . . ⁇ D( ⁇ s ) ⁇ is the column vector containing the durations of all the phonetic segments in the corpus.
- X(C) is the matrix ##EQU12## Equation 9 implies that ##EQU13## We designate X(C) the design matrix of the corpus.
- Equation 10 Equation 10 implies that ##EQU14##
- Equation 11 describes how to recover the parameter vector solely from the durations that are observed when the sentences in C' are spoken.
- Equation 11 describes how to recover the parameter vector solely from the durations that are observed when the sentences in C' are spoken.
- rank(S) is the cardinality of the maximal independent set contained in S.
- rank(M) is defined as rank(X).
- independent sets of cardinality rank(A) are called bases of M (equivalently bases of ).
- Matroids are useful, in part because the structures they describe permit efficient searches for minimum cost bases.
- B ⁇ of minimum cost is, for the graphic matroid, equivalent to finding a minimum spanning tree. Since can have 2.sup.
- the greedy algorithm at each step chooses the ground element of least cost whose addition to the basis-under-construction B, maintains that B as an independent set.
- the analogous minimum spanning tree algorithm which at each step chooses the cheapest edge that does not create a cycle, is commonly referred to as Kruskai's Algorithm (as described in Kruskai, J. B. "On The Shortest Spanning Subtree Of A Graph And The Traveling Salesman Problem", Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 7:53-7, 1956).
- the greedy algorithm is efficient (i.e., runs in time polynomial in the input size) if an efficient procedure exists that determines membership in .
- the greedy algorithm for the matroid cover problem operates analogously to the greedy algorithm for finding the least cost basis of a matroid and at each step chooses the X(C i ) whose inclusion in the matroid cover being constructed results in the maximal increase in rank of that cover.
- the algorithm terminates upon (1) finding a matroid cover, or (2) determining that X(C) itself is not invertible.
- the greedy algorithm returns a matroid cover with cardinality within a logarithmic factor of that of the optimal cover. We will show below that this is computationally the best solution which can be found within the constraints of known analytic processes.
- the naive method first computes that the rank of each set X i of vectors. It assigns B to contain the set of maximal rank. During each phase, it computes the rank of B ⁇ X i ⁇ for each 1 ⁇ i ⁇ s and updates B to be B ⁇ X i ⁇ for an X i that incurs the most increase in rank. The algorithm terminates once B is of rank m or no X i can increase the rank of B.
- the Gram-Schmidt procedure described in the preceding section has poor numerical properties. (See, e.g., Golub and van Loan, id.)
- the following modified Gram-Schmidt procedure has better numerical properties and produces the same results in the same computational time as does the Gram-Schmidt procedure.
- the naive greedy linear matroid cover algorithm described in Section B2 suffers from the flaw that it computes the ranks of matrices in full during each phase, whereas the matrices change only gradually throughout the life of the algorithm.
- B p be the cover-in-progress after phase p
- and let r B p
- ; initially, B o .O slashed..
- b i the i'th vector in B.
- Invariant (3) guarantees us that the choice of V in line 1 is correct; that is, V is such that rank (B p-1 ⁇ V) is maximal.
- Invariant (3) also guarantees us that setting B p to B p-1 ⁇ V in line 2 increases the rank of B by
- each vector in X i p-1 is orthonormalized against the r B p -r B p-1 vectors that have just been added to B as well as the vectors that precede it in the set.
- the number of vector operations in the loop for phase p therefore, is dominated by ##EQU20##
- V in line 1 ensures that for any p>0 and 1 ⁇ i ⁇ s, r i p-1 ⁇ r B p -r B p-1 , so we can rewrite Equation 12 to read ##EQU21##
- n i might simplify the asymptotic time complexity of our algorithm.
- m ranging between 100 and 1000. It is reasonable to assume that the sentences in the corpora have under 100 phonetic segments each. Since each phonetic segment induces a vector in an input set corresponding to a sentence, this leads to the assumption that n i ⁇ m for 1 ⁇ i ⁇ s. Under this assumption, the running time of the algorithm is O(nm 2 ). Furthermore, for a given natural language, the feature space and thus m will be fixed; therefore, running over different corpora for a given natural language, the time is linear in the number of phonetic segments in the corpora.
