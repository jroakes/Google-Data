Definitions
- This invention relates to recognition of human speech by computer. More particularly, it relates to systems for and methods of finding the several most likely word sequences from an observed acoustical utterance based upon acoustical and statistical models of language.
- Speech is modeled at several different levels. Sentences are modeled using a grammar that specifies likely sequences of words; words are modeled using a phonetic dictionary that specifies likely sequences of phonemes, and phonemes are typically modeled using a hidden Markov model, a statistical model of the acoustics of speech, that specifies likely sequences of acoustic spectra. A recognition search is performed to find the most likely sentence, given the input speech spectra and the various models of speech.
- an electrical audio signal containing information representing human speech is divided into frames of 10 millisecond duration, each of which is quantized according to its respective spectral content into one of a finite number of vectors, often called spectra.
- the speech recognition system in order to determine the sentence that was uttered, typically performs what is known as a beam search.
- a new Markov state is considered to exist.
- the probability is calculated that that state, as it succeeds the preceding state, is part of a particular phoneme that can be the next part of a particular word. The calculation is made for each state of each phoneme of each word under consideration. At the beginning of a word, several words in the vocabulary are under consideration.
- the search could further expand with each state, branching in a tree-like structure.
- the beam search is pruned by dropping unlikely branches.
- the specific criteria for dropping a branch, which determine the width of the beam search, are controllable parameters of the search.
- a training process is first implemented; a large number of sentences spoken in the limited vocabulary and context of the system are analyzed, the various state, phoneme and word paths determined, and the associated probabilities assigned.
- the training can be by a single speaker, or a group of speakers. The larger and more diverse the training group, of course, the greater number of likely paths for each word, but the more accuracy that can be expected in recognizing speech from a large number of unknown speakers. Recordings of a few semi-standard training sessions, known as corpora, are commercially available.
- a 1-best search for the single most likely state sequence can be readily performed by the well known time-synchronous Viterbi decoder.
- the basic concept of this decoder is that at each state within a word or grammar node between words, only one theory is kept for the most likely state sequence to get to that state or node at a particular time.
- the decoder finds the single most likely sequence of states, given the input speech.
- the word sequence that corresponds to the most likely state sequence is then selected as the 1-best sentence output, even though this is not necessarily the most likely sequence of words. While this is very efficient in terms of the computation involved, the accuracy may suffer; a full search should compute the sum of the probabilities of all state sequences for each possible word sequence.
- the various available knowledge sources which can contribute to the task of speech recognition are ordered according to their relative power and computational cost. Those that provide more constraint, at a lesser cost, are used first in an N-best search. The output of this search is a list of the most likely whole sentence hypotheses, along with their accumulated probability scores. These hypotheses are then filtered, i.e. rescored, by the remaining knowledge sources, and the highest overall scoring sentence chosen as the solution. This approach has produced some impressive results.
- an N-best search can be used for other related purposes.
- the alternative sentences it produces can be used as additional hypotheses for corrective training techniques.
- the N-best search can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of new knowledge sources as well as the combination of hidden Markov model (HMM) technology with different recognition technologies.
- HMM N-best recognizer system first produces an extensive sentence list including respective scores.
- the alternative recognition system based on the new knowledge source or another technology, such as, for example, a stochastic segment model or a segmental neural network, is used to rescore each of the N-sentence hypotheses.
- the optimal linear combination of the log scores from the different systems is used to reorder the sentence list.
- the effectiveness of the added source or technology is easily evaluated. Since the systems under evaluation need consider only the N-sentences produced by the N-best search, computation is in each case greatly reduced.
- An object of this invention is to provide a system for and method of determining from a spoken utterance the N-best sentence hypotheses that requires much less computation yet retains almost the same accuracy.
- Another object is a speech recognition system and method that can use a fairly complex grammar model and still operate with only a short delay from real time.
- the speech signal is divided into frames, and at least one characterizing vector is generated each frame.
- word theory probability scores are computed for selected Markov states in selected words to generate the combined probability of each partial sentence hypothesis and the sequence of vectors, based on hidden Markov models.
- a separate combined probability score is accumulated for each of n most likely single previous word theories, n being much smaller than N.
- the accumulated probability scores and the identities of their respective previous word theories are recorded.
- the first state of each new word is started with the combined probability score of each of n respective previous words and the new word according to a grammar model.
- the N different word sequences that have the highest accumulated scores are reassembled.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the preferred embodiment of the speech recognition system embodying the present invention
- FIG. 2 is a word-time diagram useful in explaining one step of the method of invention
- FIG. 3 is a distribution plot showing the effectiveness of the method of the invention.
- FIGS. 4A-4G are illustrations of psuedo-code used in the preferred system and method of the present invention.
- FIG. 1 A particularly useful speech recognition system that advantageously may be used to perform the steps of the method of the invention is shown in block diagram form in FIG. 1.
- an audio speech signal resentative of speech sensed for example by a microphone not shown, is applied to an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 8 before being fed to a signal processor 10.
- the converter 8 samples the signal at a predetermined rate, e.g., 16 Khz, and is a commercially-available type well known in the art.
- the signal processor is also a commercially available type adapted to be used for array processing and can be, for example, the plug-in board sold under the name Sky Challenger by the Sky Computers, Inc. of Lowell, Mass.
- the processor divides the samples into frames of 320 samples each of 20 msec duration.
- the frames may then be encoded in processor 10 by Cepstral coding techniques, outputting a Cepstral vector for each frame at a 100 Hz. rate.
- the vectors may be in the form of 8-bit words, reflecting quantization into 256 levels.
- Cepstral encoding techniques are well known in the speech recognition field. Of course, the invention is not limited to this specific coding process; other sampling rates, frame rates and other representations of the speech signal can be used as well.
- the Cepstral vectors generated by signal processor 10 are used as an input to block 12, where an N-best search is performed according to the invention.
- the models used for the N-best search may be, for example, a hidden Markov model and a bigram statistical grammar model, both well known in the art and derived from a corpus resulting from one or more training sessions.
- the output from the N-best search is an ordered list of the N-best sentences along with their respective probability scores. Since the probabilities determined by the N-best search method are cumulative, requiring each new probability to be multiplied by the previous, the scores may advantageously be in the form of logarithms for easy accumulation. N, of course, need be only large enough to ensure that the correct sentence is included in the list an acceptable percentage of the time. Where the degree of uncertainty is high, N can reasonably be as high as 100 or more.
- the sentence list may then be rescored according to another speech recognition program represented by block 14, which may use a more detailed hidden Markov model and more detailed, higher ordered grammar model, e.g., a trigram or higher ordered class grammar model.
- a more detailed hidden Markov model and more detailed, higher ordered grammar model e.g., a trigram or higher ordered class grammar model.
- various steps may be weighted more heavily based upon the particular knowledge sources used. Since the combined probability desired is the product of probabilities, the log scores determined by the two programs can be added directly.
- the revised N-best list with its updated scores may then be evaluated by a natural language model block 16.
- the natural language model may be based on syntax, semantics, pragmatics, etc. to determine which of the N sentence hypotheses make sense.
- the output of the natural language evaluation is the one most likely sentence and its interpretation, which may be acted upon by an application program, block 18.
- the application program may, for example, control a process, execute a command, or query a data base.
- the foregoing block functions 12-18 can be accomplished by a suitable workstation containing a CPU, such as the Sun 4-330 manufactured and sold by the Sun Microsystem Inc. of Mountainview, Calif.
- the system of FIG. 1 represents a good application of the N-best paradigm.
- the total amount of computation required by the system is feasible because the rescoring program 14 and the natural language model 16 need operate only on the limited N-best list of likely sentences provided by the N-best search 12. Since the N-best search performed by the method of the invention is itself feasible because of the reasonable amount of computation it involves, the whole system is feasible and yields accurate results.
- the N-best search method of the invention is based on the premise that the starting point of any word most likely depends upon the immediate prior word but not on any word uttered earlier.
- different state sequence theories within a word are distinguished only by the single immediately prior word.
- the total probabilities need be preserved for only a few different preceding words.
- all of the alternate (word) theories along with their scores, and the name of the corresponding word are saved.
- the best single score for that word is used in generating new forward paths.
- the N-best sentences are determined by chaining backwards from word to word to the beginning of the utterance and assembling the word sequence paths with the highest total probability.
- FIGS. 4A-4G One effective computer program for performing an N-best search according to the method of the invention in carrying out the functions associated with blocks 12-18 is shown in pseudo code form in FIGS. 4A-4G. An explanation of the pseudo code may be useful in gaining a more thorough understanding of the invention.
- the pseudo code is written in two styles: some is in the syntax of the C programming language, and some is plain English. Any line beginning with /* is a comment. Each subroutine is on a separate page. Lines in each subroutine are numbered sequentially. Blocks of code are marked by pairs of ⁇ and indented appropriately.
- the main program shown in FIG. 4A consists of an initialization phase ⁇ 21-29>, a relatively expensive time-synchronous loop on all frames that operates from beginning to end ⁇ 31-53>, and a very fast traceback operation that operates from end to beginning ⁇ 56>.
- Line ⁇ 38> indicates that the states selected to be updated are those based on the score of the most likely word theory at that state. Another efficient and alternative way accomplishing this result is to group the states in a word that correspond to the same phoneme. Then, if any state within a phoneme has a good score, all of the states within that phoneme are updated.
- the global threshold is computed in line ⁇ 46> as some fraction of the most likely word theory score at any state in this frame. This threshold is used until this same point in the computation for the next frame.
- the beamwidth is typically a fraction on the order of 10 -10 or 10 -20 .
- This subroutine computes a new set of word theories at state j, ending at the current frame. It accumulates theories from all states that could precede state j ⁇ 15>. Each of the word theories at each preceding state ⁇ 16> are considered. We combine theories that have the same previous word, which requires that we find any matching word theories in state j for a particular word theory at state i ⁇ 21-22>.
- the pseudo code for setting the fields of the word theory ⁇ 24-32> and ⁇ 34-40> is more detailed here than in similar instances in other routines, where the general comments like "keep the best score and corresponding traceback pointer" are used.
- the sum of the contributions from the preceding states for a particular previous word are computed ⁇ 31>.
- the number of word theories that are kept at a single state are limited to a small number, n ⁇ 42>.
- the theories to those with a score above the threshold can also be limited.
- each word has no spectral probability density associated with it. It can only be followed by a grammar node.
- a permanent traceback structure is allocated and the alternative word theories are saved.
- the traceback pointer on the final state is replaced with a pointer to this new structure ⁇ 33>, so that any future theories that descend from this theory will point back to the saved traceback structure.
- the top theory is sent from this final state to the grammar node that follows the word ⁇ 37-53>.
- Word theories are matched up at the grammar node according to the previous word, in this case, the word that just ended ⁇ 39>. Again, a limited number of word theories are kept at each grammar node, based on their scores ⁇ 52-53>.
- this routine sends all theories scores from one grammar node to all following grammar nodes ⁇ 12-34> and to the initial states of all following words ⁇ 35-40>. Again, at each destination grammar node or word beginning, multiple word theories are kept.
- the grammar probabilities that a particular grammar node will be followed by another grammar node ⁇ 16>, or that a node will be followed by a particular word ⁇ 37> are applied. These grammar probabilities reflect the probabilities of different sequences of words. In practice, these probabilities are often based on the probability of each pair of word classes. This type of grammar is called a statistical bigram class grammar.
- the top level traceback routine is called once. It sets up a recursive call to the routine Trace (see below). In line ⁇ 10> the distinguished "end node" of the grammar that must end all sentences is looked at, resulting in a set of up to N sentence hypotheses that all have a score within a factor of beamwidth of the best sentence hypothesis. Typically, the total computation for the recursive traceback is a small fraction of a second.
- FIG. 2 shows a schematic example of the traceback structures that might result from the N-Best computation.
- This recursive routine illustrated in FIG. 4F, is used to consider the alternative word sequences that can be constructed from various permutations of the alternate word theory choices saved in the traceback structures. It operates backwards, chaining through the traceback structures that were created in the forward direction. It is called with a partial theory, represented by the words in the global "words" array from 1 to pos. "accum” is the score of the best theory that could be constructed using these words so far. It tries to extend the theory by each possible word choice at that point. For each choice, it recursively calls Trace to extend that hypothesis back further.
- each of the choices for the next word are considered. If desired, we can also determine the beginning time of each word in the hypothesis ⁇ 41>.
- the routine shown in FIG. 4G records a single sentence hypothesis, residing in "words" and "word -- start -- times" from 1 to pos (in reverse order), with score "accumscore”. If the number of sentence hypotheses are limited to a fixed limit, N, then the threshold can be reset to the Nth hypothesis ⁇ 17>. This reset threshold, which is used in the Trace routine, will abort more search paths, thus speeding up the recursive computation. Alternatively, we can ignore N, or set it to a large number, to obtain all hypotheses within the beamwidth of the top hypothesis.
- FIG. 3 is a plot showing experimental results comparing the accuracy of these two N-best methods as well as a maximum likelihood state sequence word-dependent N-Best method.
- the experiments were performed using the speaker-dependent subset of the DARPA 1000-word Resource Management Corpus and a weak, first order statistical grammar based on 100 word classes.
- the test set used was the June '88 speaker-dependent test set of 300 sentences.
- the cumulative percent correct is plotted on a truncated ordinate scale against abscissas representing the rank order of the correct answer.
- the two curves are remarkably similar for the sentence-dependent N-best and word-dependent N-best, showing in each case that the correct answer was ranked first over 60% of the time. While the correct sentence showed up in the first 30 slightly more often with the sentence-dependent method, it showed up in the first 100 slightly more often with the word-dependent method. In both cases it was close to 95%, superior to the maximum-likelihood word-dependent N-best approach which provided a 91.3 percent accuracy. With more complex acoustic modelling, even better results can be expected.
- the computational effectiveness of the word-dependent method of the invention can be still further enhanced if it is used in a forward-backward search such as described in the paper, "The Forward-backward Search Algorithm", by Austin, Schwartz and Placeway, IEEE ICASSP, Toronto, Canada, May, 1991.
- This method is performed in two passes, a forward pass which uses a simplified algorithm, and a backward pass which uses information computed in the forward pass to perform a more complicated algorithm in a fraction of the time it would normally take.
- the forward pass may follow for example, the Viterbi 1-best method, using a simplified acoustic model and a simplified language model. While the forward search is performed, the scores of the final state of each active HMM that represents a word ending are recorded at each frame of the utterance, together with a record of which HMMs were active.
- the word-dependent N-best search of the invention is performed in reverse. It starts by taking the final frame of the utterance and works its way back, matching frames earlier in the utterance until it reaches the start of the utterance.
- the first task in the implementation is to make the second pass operate in reverse. This can be done in two ways; the algorithm can be made to scan the utterance in reverse and trace the grammar transitions backwards, which requires a small change in the program. Alternatively, the utterance itself can be reversed as well as the transitions in the HMMs and grammar, which allows the actual algorithm to remain the same.
- the backward pass After the backward pass has been modified to run in reverse, a small additional modification is needed to complete the implementation.
- the backward algorithm must propagate scores from an active word w back through the grammar to another word w', at the same time calculating the HMM/grammar score for w' for the next frame (actually the previous frame in the utterance). In a normal beam search, this score would be compared to the pruning threshold in order to limit the number of theories in the search, but in the forward-backward search two additional tests are applied. First, word w' must have ended with a good score at that time, and second, the product of the forward ending score of w' and the backward score of w' must be within the beamwidth of the maximum such product at this frame. As a result of this pruning, the backward pass runs one or two orders of magnitude faster than it would normally. This increase in speed makes it possible to compute the N-best hypotheses for a 1000 word vocabulary continuous speech system on a work station.
- the word dependent, N-best approach described above is also an improvement over the sentence-dependent N-best approach as being substantial as accurate at a smaller cost, and the tree trellis N-best approach described by Soong et al., supra, since the latter approach is not word dependent, is not time synchronous in the backward path, and does not add sequences that correspond to the same word sequences, and is therefore less accurate.
