Definitions
- This document relates to systems and techniques for recognizing words from speech input.
- keyboards are common input devices, and they typically include single-digit numbers (e.g., in a cellular telephone), each of the letters in the alphabet, and some non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., in Qwerty or Dvorak keyboards).
- keyboards are frequently “virtual” in form, and are displayed on a touch screen of a device.
- Users of computer devices, and particularly of mobile computing devices may be constrained in their use of a keyboard. For example, the keyboard itself may be constrained in size because mobile device displays are small, so that only a sub-set of relevant characters can be displayed or the keys may be too small to press accurately.
- the user may be constrained, in that they cannot easily type on a keyboard while walking through a crowded airport or driving a car. In such situations, spoken input may be preferred over typed input.
- speech-to-text conversion or translation typically requires lots of computer processing power, and mobile devices typically do not have much processing power. Also, such conversion often requires a particular user to “train” the system so that it better understands the user's voice and speech patterns.
- a system may provide for speech-to-text conversion of spoken (uttered) inputs from a user, though at times a user may repeat an utterance, such as when a system does not recognize an initial utterance from the user and prompts the user to repeat the utterance, when the system provides the user with a list of strings that it thinks matches the utterance and the user indicates that none of the strings is a match, or simply when the user repeats the utterance on his or her own.
- the system may select candidate character strings (e.g., words or phrases) for each of the received utterances, may determine that the utterances match each other (e.g., because two utterances in a row sound very much alike or because the second utterance was received in response to the system prompting the user to repeat the first utterance) and may select a candidate string or strings based on the combination of the two utterances, such as by identifying strings that are determined to match both utterances, or if the user indicated that no strings from the first utterance were a match, by selecting strings that were identified for only the second utterance and not the first.
- candidate character strings e.g., words or phrases
- a first spoken input is received from a user of an electronic device where the first spoken input is an original utterance by the user. Based on the original utterance, a first set of character string candidates are determined, wherein each character string candidate represents the first spoken input converted to textual characters. A selection of one or more of the character string candidates are provided in a format for display to the user, in response to receiving the first spoken input.
- a second spoken input is received from the user. A determination is made that the second spoken input is a repeat utterance of the original utterance.
- a second set of character string candidates is determined.

- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- Determining that the second spoken input is a repeat utterance of the original utterance can include determining that the first and second spoken inputs were received within a predetermined time period of each other.

- FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing an example process 300 for converting speech to text using an original utterance and a repeat utterance.
- a first utterance referred to as an “original utterance”
- the process 300 can be described with reference to the system 200 shown in FIG. 2 , although it should be understood that the process 300 can be implemented by a differently configured system.
- the original utterance can be input to an input device 214 to the client electronic device 202 , transmitted over the network 204 and received by the server system 206 .

- a determination is made as to whether the second utterance is a repeat of the original utterance, i.e., a repeat utterance (Box 310 ).
- the repeat utterance detector can be used to make the determination.
- a text conversion is determined based on the original utterance and the repeat utterance (Box 312 ). If the second utterance is determined not to be a repeat utterance, i.e., is a new utterance, then a text conversion is determined based on the second utterance alone (Box 314 ).
- the text conversion is provided (Box 316 ).
- the text conversion can be provided by the server system 206 over the network 204 to the client electronic device 202 for presentation to the user on an output device 216 , such as a display screen.
- the text conversion provided can be the top ranked character string or can be a set of top-n ranked character strings.
- a user of the client electronic device 202 inputs a speech utterance (i.e., the “original utterance”) and receives a text conversion in response (either the top ranked candidate or a selection of n-best candidates) and the correct text conversion is not included in the response, then the user typically repeats the utterance (i.e., the “repeat utterance”).
- the server system 206 e.g., using the repeat utterance detector 213 , is configured to detect a repeat utterance, that is, to determine whether a second utterance is a repeat utterance or a new utterance.
- Various techniques can be used to determine whether a second utterance is a repeat utterance, that is, to implement the step in Box 310 of FIG. 3 , some examples of which are discussed below.
- the second utterance if a second utterance is received within a predetermined time period after receiving the original utterance, then the second utterance is presumed to be a repeat utterance.
- the predetermined time period can be approximately 15 seconds. If the second utterance is received outside of the predetermined time period, i.e., too long afterward, then the second utterance is presumed to be a new utterance (e.g., a new query or relating to a different input field).
- the next utterance is presumed to be a new utterance. For example, by selecting a candidate from the n-best list of candidates presented to the user in response to the original utterance, a next utterance received is presumed to be a new utterance, even if within the predetermined time period.
- the server system in response to the speech input the server system automatically selects the best candidate, and then the best candidate is used as a basis to perform another action, e.g., a search. In this example, the user is presented a set of search results.
- any next utterance is also presumed to be a new utterance.
- the user's actions tends to suggest that the text conversion was accurate, or at least that the user was satisfied with the text conversion and/or results, and therefore a next utterance is probably a new utterance is not an attempt by the user to rearticulate the original utterance.
- Other types of intervening actions can also be used to detect whether a next utterance is a repeated utterance, and the examples provided are illustrative and non-limiting.
- the second utterance if the second utterance is detected to have been uttered by a different voice than the original utterance, then the second utterance is presumed to be a new utterance.
- a universal background model can be adapted to each utterance, and a statistical test or pattern classifier can be used to determine if the two adapted universal background models that correspond to the first and second utterances could have come from the same speaker.
- other techniques for speaker verification can be used.
- acoustic alignment using dynamic programming can be used to detect whether a second utterance is a repeat of the original utterance. That is, the original utterance and the second utterance can be represented by acoustic sequences of vectors and an alignment score that indicates the alignment between the two sequences of vectors can be used to determine whether or not the second utterance is detected to be a repeat of the original utterance. A “poor” alignment score suggests the two utterances are different, and therefore the second utterance is not a repeat utterance. A “good” alignment score suggests the second utterance is a repeat of the original utterance, and a repeat utterance is therefore detected.
- Whether or not a score is “poor” or “good” can be determined empirically.
- training data can be used that includes some pairs of acoustic sequences of vectors that are known to represent the same utterance (i.e., that includes a repeat utterance) and some pairs of acoustic sequences of vectors that are known to represent difference utterances (i.e., that do not include a repeat utterance).
- the alignment scores for the pairs of acoustic sequences of vectors can be used to determine a threshold score value, where scores exceeding the threshold are good and scores below the threshold are poor.
- the user can be prompted to input a repeat utterance. For example, if the confidence level (described further below) of the text conversion of the original utterance is below a predetermined threshold, then the user can be requested to provide a second utterance. In another example, if the confidence level of less than a threshold number of character string candidates generated from the speech-to-text conversion of the original utterance is less than a predetermined threshold level, then the user can be requested to provide a second utterance. In some examples, the threshold number is one, i.e., if none of the character string candidates have the requisite predetermined confidence level, then the user is asked to repeat his or her utterance.
- the second utterance is “detected” as a repeat utterance because the second utterance is received in response to a prompt for a repeat.
- the user in response to the prompt to input a repeat, the user may utter a different word or words than they originally spoke.
- the second utterance can be given precedence in determining the speech-to-text conversion candidates. Whether the second utterance was provided in response to a prompt for a repeat can be given some weight when determining whether or not to treat the second utterance as a repeat utterance.
- all of the above techniques for detecting a repeat utterance can be used and the results combined to generate the determination of whether a repeat utterance is detected.
- the results can be combined in a probabilistic model to generate the determination.
- a support vector machine or neural network can be used to combine results.
- the server system 206 e.g., the speech recognizer 209 , generates an output that includes a set of candidates and a probability corresponding to each candidate that the candidate is the correct text conversion of the utterance. That is, if the utterance is a single word, then the set of candidates can be a set of words and a probability for each word that it is the correct text conversion. Various techniques can be used to determine the candidates and the probabilities.
- the speech recognizer can include Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) encoded in a finite state transducer (FST).
- a relevant language model is selected from the language models 211 .
- the speech recognition is performed, i.e., the utterance is used by the speech recognizer 209 applying the selected language model to determine one or more candidate character strings from the utterance.
- a confidence level (e.g., a probability) can be associated with each character string.
- the confidence level or probability is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being low confidence and 1 representing high confidence.
- the user can be prompted to input a repeat utterance, e.g., if the confidence level of the text conversion of the original utterance is below a predetermined threshold.
- a first set of candidates and corresponding first confidence levels are determined for the original utterance.
- a second set of candidates and corresponding second confidence levels are determined for the repeat utterance.
- the first confidence level is multiplied by the second confidence level for each overlapping candidate, and a combined confidence level is determined.
- the overlapping candidates are ranked based on their combined confidence levels.
- the first confidence level and the second confidence level are given different weightings when combining into the combined confidence level.
- the second confidence levels (i.e., the confidence levels corresponding to the repeat utterance) can be weighted more heavily than the first confidence levels, because it is already known that the top ranked candidate selected from the first set of candidates was the incorrect character string.
- weights are selected by optimization using a validation set. That is, the weights are adjusted to give the best results on a set of real examples, then those weights are used in the system.
- the results can be ranked based on their confidence levels, i.e., the combined confidence levels for the overlapping candidates and the confidence levels determined based on the repeat utterance for the remaining candidates.
- the top ranked candidate or a set of top-n ranked candidates can be provided to the user. If one or more candidates are included in the ranked results that were previously presented to the user, i.e., as candidates in response to the original utterance, they can be withheld from presentation to the user as either the top ranked candidate or in the set of top-n ranked candidates, to avoid presenting the user with one or more candidates that they previously did not select, and presumably considered to be inaccurate.
- the speech recognizer 209 is configured to determine a word lattice corresponding to a speech utterance.
- FIG. 5 shows an example word lattice for a multi-word utterance.
- the word lattice includes several candidates character strings, including the following examples:
- the speech recognizer 209 determines a confidence level (i.e., a probability) that the character string is the correct text conversion of the speech utterance.
- a word lattice can be determined using conventional techniques, for example, Hidden Markov Modeling.
- a first lattice is determined that corresponds to the original utterance, where the speech recognizer 209 uses a first language model from the language models 211 .
- a second lattice is determined that corresponds to the repeat utterance, where the speech recognizer 209 uses the first language model (or a different language model) to determine the second lattice.
- the confidence level from the second lattice is multiplied by the confidence level from the first lattice to generate a combined confidence level.
- the first lattice is re-scored using the confidence levels corresponding to the second lattice to thereby generate a set of combined confidence levels for the first lattice. That is, an intersection or union of the first and second lattices is determined. Combined confidence levels for the overlapping candidates are determined from the intersection or union of the two lattices. Various techniques for determining the intersection or union of the two lattices can be used. The combined confidence levels can be used to select a top candidate or set of top-n candidates of character strings that correspond to the original and repeat utterances.
- a first lattice is determined that corresponds to the original utterance, where the speech recognizer 209 uses a first language model from the language models 211 .
- a second lattice is determined that corresponds to the repeat utterance, where the speech recognizer 209 uses the first lattice as the language model to determined the second lattice. That is, if the correct text conversion is present in the first lattice, even though it may not have scored well when the first lattice was determined, by using the first lattice as the language model for the repeat utterance, the confidence level of the correct text conversion presumably is boosted in the confidence levels that correspond to the second lattice.
- This technique uses the acoustic features from the repeat utterance to effectively re-score the first lattice (i.e., because the first lattice is used as the language model).
- the confidence levels determined for the second lattice i.e., the re-scored lattice
- the confidence levels that correspond to the second lattice can be combined with the confidence levels that correspond to the first lattice for overlapping candidates and the combined confidence levels can be used to determined the top candidate or set of top-n candidates.
- the confidence levels are combined by multiplying them together.
- the confidence levels are combined by using the confidence levels from the second lattice, but weighted using weights embedded in the first lattice. For example, a connector between two word nodes (e.g., the connector between “catalogue” and “inner” in the word lattice shown in FIG. 5 ) can have an assigned weight that can be used to adjust the confidence level determined based on the repeat utterance.
- alignment of acoustic sequences of vectors that represent the original utterance and a second utterance can be used to determine a text conversion.
- an alignment score between acoustic sequences of vectors that represent the original and second utterances can be used to determine whether the second utterance is a repeat utterance. If the second utterance is a repeat utterance, then the probability of a frame of the original utterance (e.g., frame(1,i)) and the probabilities of the one or more frames of the repeat utterance that align to the frame of original utterance (e.g., frame(2,j) . . . frame(2,j+k)) can be combined to provide a combined probability. For each frame of the original utterance, there can be zero or more such aligning frames of the repeat utterance, which can be determined using, for example, dynamic time warping.
- a user may speak the repeat utterance in a more slow and deliberate manner than he/she spoke the original utterance, because the user wants to improve the speech-to-text conversion with the repeat attempt and believes that speaking more slowly and clearly will help.
- dynamic time warping can be used to find an alignment between the original utterance and the repeat utterance to take into account different speeds in vocalizing the two utterances.
- the probabilities from the two utterances can be weighted relative to each other based on, for example, an additional signal that is available that indicates their validity.
- a noise or a speech energy model can indicate when one utterance includes background noise or is muffled, and that utterance can be de-weighted with respect to the other utterance, for all or some of the frames that correspond to the utterance.
- some frames of the original utterance will align to some frames of the repeat utterance, but some frames will not align.
- An aligned sequence of vectors can be generated, where for each frame that aligns between a sequence relating to the original utterance and a sequence relating to the repeat utterance, a combined probability is determined. For each frame relating to the original utterance or the repeat utterance that does not align with a frame from the other utterance, a probability dependent on only that frame (i.e., for that utterance) can be determined. In the instance of partial alignments, frames from either utterance can be discarded.
- the repeat utterance may be a variation of the original utterance. For example, if the original utterance is “map of new york” and the repeat utterance is “directions to new york”, then the aligned sequence of vectors will have “new york” aligned, but “map of” and “directions to” failing to align.
- the utterance “directions to new york” is converted from speech-to-text using the “directions to” frames from the repeat utterance (and discarding the “map of” frames from the original utterance) and using the “new york” frames from both the original and repeat utterances. That is, the second spoken input is actually a repeat for only a portion of the input, in this example, the “new york” portion, and is therefore decoded accordingly.
- a multi-stream HMM recognizer can be used to decode the original utterance and the repeat utterance at the same time.
- a multi-stream HMM is similar to a classical HMM with the particularity that each state contains not one, but several emission probability models, one for each stream, which are combined, for example, through a weighted product. Weights can be dynamically tied to stream reliability, for example, when environment conditions (e.g., signal to noise ratio) change, the weights can be adjusted to emphasize the most reliable modality.
- the probabilities of the original and repeat utterances can be combined while they are being decoded. The results can be used to determine a top candidate or the top-n candidates for text conversion.
- noise in one or both of signals representing the utterances can be detected.
- Weighting the probabilities of the two utterances can be based on the detected noise. For example, with respect to frames that are detected to include noise, the weighting for the corresponding utterance can be decreased, and the weighting can be applied piecemeal throughout the utterance.
- a simple speech model can be used to remove distortion before applying the speech recognizer.
- the ALGONQUIN technique is used to denoise speech features before applying the speech recognizer.
- Various techniques are described above for using a repeat utterance together with the original utterance to provide improved text conversion.
- two or more of the techniques can be used in combination.
- a multi-stream HMM can be used to generate a lattice.
