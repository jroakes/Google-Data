- UMTS is based on CDMA radio access technology.
- uplink and downlink control or data channels typically use a large bandwidth of radio frequency spectrum, for example in the range of 5 MHz for UMTS channels.
- signaling and/or traffic data is multiplied by a respective code prior to being transmitted on uplink or downlink control or data channels.
- the multiplication spreads the original data over a wide bandwidth.
- the received wideband signal is multiplied by the same code that was used in the transmitter, recovering the original signaling or traffic data.
- Separation between different channels is achieved by allocating a different code to each channel.
- Such channels are called code channels. Since different codes are used for different code channels, different code channels may be kept distinct from each other even though they are transmitted using the same radio frequency spectrum.
- Signal power may change over time for an uplink traffic channel, and an associated uplink signaling channel, namely the Dedicated Physical Data Channel (DPDCH) and the Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH) defined for UMTS.

- ACK acknowledgement transmission
- the Node B 610 may transmit a negative acknowledgement signal (NACK), at step 1020 , to indicate that an error was detected in the previously received data signal and that the receiver is ready to accept retransmission of that data signal.
- NACK negative acknowledgement signal
- the Node B 610 detects a power control measure, such as the transmitted data signal, at step 912 , and transmits a power control signal, at step 914 , back to the UE 605 .
- the power control signal is based on the received power measurement of the data signal, and includes sub-frame power information to incorporate into the power control signal H(n).
- the process repeats at step 904 , where the UE 605 uses the previous transmission parameters.
- the UE 605 may store the transmission parameters in the storage 608 for retrieval.
- the sequence diagrams may be encoded in a signal bearing medium, a computer readable medium such as a memory, programmed within a device such as one or more integrated circuits, or processed by a controller or a computer. If the methods are performed by software, the software may reside in a memory resident to or interfaced to the UE 605 , a communication interface, or any other type of non-volatile or volatile memory interfaced or resident to the UE 605 .
- the memory may include an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. A logical function may be implemented through digital circuitry, through source code, through analog circuitry, or through an analog source such as through an analog electrical, audio, or video signal.
- the software may be embodied in any computer-readable or signal-bearing medium, for use by, or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device.
- a system may include a computer-based system, a processor-containing system, or another system that may selectively fetch instructions from an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device that may also execute instructions.
- a “computer-readable medium,” “machine-readable medium,” “propagated-signal” medium, and/or “signal-bearing medium” may comprise any module that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports software for use by or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device.
- the machine-readable medium may selectively be, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium.
- a non-exhaustive list of examples of a machine-readable medium would include: an electrical connection “electronic” having one or more wires, a portable magnetic or optical disk, a volatile memory such as a Random Access Memory “RAM” (electronic), a Read-Only Memory “ROM” (electronic), an Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (electronic), or an optical fiber (optical).
- a machine-readable medium may also include a tangible medium upon which software is printed, as the software may be electronically stored as an image or in another format (e.g., through an optical scan), then compiled, and/or interpreted or otherwise processed. The processed medium may then be stored in a computer and/or machine memory.
Abstract
Description
w(n)=w(n−1)+k(n)ε*(n)
w(n)=[w 0(n) w i(n) . . . w L-1(n)]
and
ε(n)=C{circumflex over (Q)}I(n)−CQI(n)
with
P(n)=λ−1 P(n−1)−λ− k(n)u H(n)P(n−1)
u(n)=[H(n−1) . . . H(n−L)]
where ε(n) is the prediction error and κ is a constant used to determine convergence.
