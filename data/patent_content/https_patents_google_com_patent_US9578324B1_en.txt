Definitions
- Digital video streams typically represent video using a sequence of frames or still images. Each frame can include a number of blocks, which in turn may contain information describing the value of color, brightness or other attributes for pixels.
- the amount of data in a typical video stream is large, and transmission and storage of video can use significant computing or communications resources.
- Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the amount of data in video streams, including compression and other encoding techniques.
- Real-time video streaming, multi-point video conferencing or video broadcasting are examples of applications that employ video stream encoding including compression.
- the encoding itself can require substantial computing resources.
- This disclosure relates in general to encoding and decoding visual data, such as video stream data, for transmission or storage using statistically-based spatially differentiated partitioning.
- One method taught herein describes forming a difference frame using a first video frame and a second video frame of a video stream, calculating a variance for each block of the difference frame, forming a variance histogram using at least some of the calculated variances, determining a threshold variance value wherein a portion of the blocks of the variance histogram have variances less than or equal to the threshold, selecting at least one encoding parameter for a block of the first video frame based on a comparison of a variance of a spatially-correspondent block in the difference frame with the threshold variance value, and encoding the block of the first video frame using the at least one encoding parameter.
- An apparatus described herein includes a memory and a processor.
- the processor is configured to execute instructions stored in the memory to form a difference frame using a first video frame and a second video frame of a video stream, calculate a variance for each block of the difference frame, form a variance histogram using at least some of the calculated variances, determine a threshold variance value wherein a portion of the blocks of the variance histogram have variances less than or equal to the threshold, select at least one encoding parameter for a block of the first video frame based on a comparison of a variance of a spatially-correspondent block in the difference frame with the threshold variance value, and encode the block of the first video frame using the at least one encoding parameter.

- a video stream may be compressed by a variety of techniques to reduce bandwidth required transmit or store the video stream.
- a video stream can be encoded into a bitstream, which can involve compression, and then transmitted to a decoder that can decode or decompress the video stream to prepare it for viewing or further processing.
- Encoding a video stream can involve parameters that make trade-offs between video quality and bitstream size, where increasing the perceived quality of a decoded video stream can increase the number of bits required to transmit or store the bitstream.
- a substantial amount of computing resources can be required to compress the video stream.
- a video frame can be divided into plural partitions that range from 4 ⁇ 4 to 64 ⁇ 64, encompassing all of the rectangular and square sub-blocks of the 64 ⁇ 64 block including 4 ⁇ 4, 4 ⁇ 8, 8 ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, 8 ⁇ 16, 16 ⁇ 8, 16 ⁇ 16, 16 ⁇ 32, 32 ⁇ 16, 32 ⁇ 32, 32 ⁇ 64, 64 ⁇ 32 and 64 ⁇ 64 pixels blocks.
- the optimal partitioning for a frame can be found by exhaustive search using combinations of these partitions.
- the encoder can test all possible partitionings for a frame by performing test encoding for each block in the combinations as part of a rate/distortion loop.
- a rate/distortion loop measures the “rate” or bitstream size for a resulting “distortion” or video quality level for different encoding parameters based on the partitionings and compares the results.
- the encoding parameters and partitioning that scores the best in terms of bitstream size for a desired video quality can be selected to encode blocks of the video frame.
- Motion prediction can base encoding decisions on the motion of objects in the video frame.
- parts of a sequence of video frames may represent static or slow motion. This can be particularly true if the video stream represents video conferencing or screen sharing.
- static or slowly moving portions of the video stream can be identified before encoding, the encoding process can be optimized to speed up the process while maintaining a desired video quality. For example, it is generally more desirable to use larger partitions in static or slow motion areas, while using smaller partitions for fast motion areas.
- a difference frame may be formed using the current frame and a temporally nearby video frame.
- the variances measured for the blocks of the difference frame can be used to form a cumulative histogram.
- the histogram can be used to separate static or slow motion areas from fast motion areas in the presence of video noise. Additional details are described below after a discussion of the environment in which implementations of the invention may be incorporated.

- video sequence 352 includes a number of adjacent frames 354 . While three frames are depicted as adjacent frames 354 , video sequence 352 can include any number of adjacent frames 354 .
- Adjacent frames 354 can then be further subdivided into individual frames, e.g., a single frame 356 .
- a single frame 356 can be divided into a series of segments or planes 358 . Segments (or planes) 358 can be subsets of frames that permit parallel processing, for example. Segments 358 can also be subsets of frames that can separate the video data into separate colors.
- a frame 356 of color video data can include a luminance plane and two chrominance planes. Segments 358 may be sampled at different resolutions.
- frame 356 may be further subdivided into blocks 360 , which can contain data corresponding to, for example, 16 ⁇ 16 pixels in frame 356 .
- Blocks 360 can also be arranged to include data from one or more planes of pixel data.

- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an encoder 470 in accordance with an implementation.
- Encoder 470 can be implemented, as described above, in transmitting station 112 such as by providing a computer software program stored in memory, for example, memory 226 .
- the computer software program can include machine instructions that, when executed by a processor such as CPU 224 , cause transmitting station 112 to encode video data in the manner described in FIG. 4 .
- Encoder 470 can also be implemented as specialized hardware included in, for example, transmitting station 112 .
- Encoder 470 has the following stages to perform the various functions in a forward path (shown by the solid connection lines) to produce an encoded or compressed bitstream 488 using input video stream 350 : an intra/inter prediction stage 472 , a transform stage 474 , a quantization stage 476 , and an entropy encoding stage 478 .
- An input into one or more stages of encoder 470 may be the determination of whether a block is within a static or slow motion area as discussed in more detail below starting with FIG. 6 .
- Encoder 470 may also include a reconstruction path (shown by the dotted connection lines) to reconstruct a frame for encoding of future blocks. In FIG.
- encoder 470 has the following stages to perform the various functions in the reconstruction path: a dequantization stage 480 , an inverse transform stage 482 , a reconstruction stage 484 , and a loop filtering stage 486 .
- Other structural variations of encoder 470 can be used to encode video stream 350 .
- each frame 356 can be processed in units of blocks.
- each block can be encoded using intra-frame prediction (also called intra prediction) or inter-frame prediction (also called inter prediction).
- intra-frame prediction also called intra prediction
- inter-frame prediction also called inter prediction
- a prediction block can be formed.
- intra-prediction a prediction block may be formed from samples in the current frame that have been previously encoded and reconstructed.
- inter-prediction a prediction block may be formed from samples in one or more previously constructed reference frames.
- the prediction block can be subtracted from the current block at intra/inter prediction stage 472 to produce a residual block (also called a residual).
- Transform stage 474 transforms the residual into transform coefficients in, for example, the frequency domain.
- block-based transforms include the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT), the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the Singular Value Decomposition Transform (SVD) and the Asymmetric Discrete Sine Transform (ADST).
- KLT Karhunen-Loève Transform
- DCT Discrete Cosine Transform
- SVD Singular Value Decomposition Transform
- ADST Asymmetric Discrete Sine Transform
- the DCT transforms the block into the frequency domain.
- the transform coefficient values are based on spatial frequency, with the lowest frequency (DC) coefficient at the top-left of the matrix and the highest frequency coefficient at the bottom-right of the matrix. Note that the size of the prediction block may be different from the size of the transform block.
- Quantization stage 476 converts the transform coefficients into discrete quantum values, which are referred to as quantized transform coefficients, using a quantizer value or a quantization level.
- the quantized transform coefficients are then entropy encoded by entropy encoding stage 478 .
- the entropy-encoded coefficients, together with other information used to decode the block, which may include for example the type of prediction used, motion vectors and quantizer value, are then output to compressed bitstream 488 .
- Compressed bitstream 488 can be formatted using various techniques, such as variable length coding (VLC) or arithmetic coding.
- VLC variable length coding
- Compressed bitstream 488 can also be referred to as an encoded video stream or encoded video bitstream, and the terms will be used interchangeably herein.
- the reconstruction path in FIG. 4 can be used to ensure that both encoder 470 and a decoder 500 (described below) use the same reference frames to decode compressed bitstream 488 .
- the reconstruction path performs functions that are similar to functions that take place during the decoding process that are discussed in more detail below, including dequantizing the quantized transform coefficients at dequantization stage 480 and inverse transforming the dequantized transform coefficients at inverse transform stage 482 to produce a derivative residual block (also called a derivative residual).
- the prediction block that was predicted at intra/inter prediction stage 472 can be added to the derivative residual to create a reconstructed block.
- Loop filtering stage 486 can be applied to the reconstructed block to reduce distortion such as blocking artifacts.
- encoder 470 can be used to encode compressed bitstream 488 .
- a non-transform based encoder 470 can quantize the residual signal directly without transform stage 474 for certain blocks or frames.
- an encoder 470 can have quantization stage 476 and dequantization stage 480 combined into a single stage.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a decoder 500 in accordance with another implementation.
- Decoder 500 can be implemented in receiving station 130 , for example, by providing a computer software program stored in memory 226 .
- the computer software program can include machine instructions that, when executed by a processor such as CPU 224 , cause receiving station 130 to decode video data in the manner described in FIG. 5 .
- Decoder 500 can also be implemented in hardware included in, for example, transmitting station 112 or receiving station 130 .
- Decoder 500 similar to the reconstruction path of encoder 470 discussed above, includes in one example the following stages to perform various functions to produce an output video stream 516 from compressed bitstream 488 : an entropy decoding stage 502 , a dequantization stage 504 , an inverse transform stage 506 , an intra/inter prediction stage 508 , a reconstruction stage 510 , a loop filtering stage 512 and a deblocking filtering stage 514 .
- Other structural variations of decoder 500 can be used to decode compressed bitstream 488 .
- decoder 500 can use intra/inter prediction stage 508 to create the same prediction block as was created in encoder 470 , e.g., at intra/inter prediction stage 472 .
- the prediction block can be added to the derivative residual to create a reconstructed block.
- Loop filtering stage 512 can be applied to the reconstructed block to reduce blocking artifacts. Other filtering can be applied to the reconstructed block.
- deblocking filtering stage 514 is applied to the reconstructed block to reduce blocking distortion, and the result is output as output video stream 516 .
- Output video stream 516 can also be referred to as a decoded video stream, and the terms will be used interchangeably herein.
- decoder 500 can be used to decode compressed bitstream 488 .
- decoder 500 can produce output video stream 516 without deblocking filtering stage 514 .
- coding efficiency may be improved when it is known which portions of a frame include static or slow motion areas and which include fast motion areas. For example, if it is known that portions of a current frame include static or slow motion areas, testing for partitioning may be limited to larger partitions (i.e., larger blocks). As another example, the motion search range may be reduced for blocks within static or slow motion areas in the motion search of intra/inter prediction stage 472 .
- Another encoding parameter that can be adjusted/selected based on the determination of whether a block is within a static or slow motion area or within a fast motion area is the quantizer used in quantization stage 476 . The determination of static or slow motion areas and fast motion areas is described next.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of a process 600 for encoding a video stream using statistical-based spatially differentiated partitioning.
- Process 600 can be implemented in a system such as computing device 200 as part of the encoding process for a video stream.
- Process 600 can be implemented, for example, as a software program that is executed by a computing device such as transmitting station 112 or receiving station 130 .
- the software program can include machine-readable instructions that are stored in a memory such as memory 226 that, when executed by a processor such as CPU 224 , cause the computing device to perform process 600 .
- Process 600 can also be implemented using hardware in whole or in part. As explained above, some computing devices may have multiple memories and multiple processors, and the steps of process 600 may in such cases be distributed using different processors and memories.
- Use of the terms “processor” and “memory” in the singular herein encompasses computing devices that have only one processor or one memory as well as devices having multiple processors or memories that may each be used in the performance of some but not necessarily
- process 600 is depicted and described as a series of steps. However, steps in accordance with this disclosure can occur in various orders and/or concurrently. Additionally, steps in accordance with this disclosure may occur with other steps not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated steps may be required to implement a method in accordance with the disclosed subject matter.
- Process 600 assumes that a previous unencoded frame of video data is available in addition to the current unencoded frame of video data. Process 600 may use unencoded versions of both the current frame and previous frame in order to obtain an accurate measure of the variance.
- Encoding a frame followed by decoding can create an approximation of the original input frame that may alter the data enough to cause the variance measure to become less indicative of the contents of the video frame than the original unencoded data.
- An unencoded frame may also be called a raw frame herein.
- a difference frame S d can be formed by subtracting a temporally nearby video frame S′ from a current video frame S.
- the temporally nearby video frame S′ can be a previous frame or a succeeding frame of the sequence of frames forming the video stream.
- the previous frame can be stored temporarily in a buffer until the current video frame is received.
- the current video frame can be stored in a buffer until the succeeding frame is received from the video stream.
- the video frame used to form the difference frame with the current video frame can be selected so as to minimize the differences between the frames and thereby provide a difference frame S d where the variance of the difference frame reflects the contents of the current frame as opposed to differences caused by motion or other changes in the video stream.
- the subtraction may be performed on a pixel-by-pixels basis using luminance values, for example.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart diagram of a process 700 for determining a variance histogram.
- the difference frame is partitioned into N ⁇ N-sized blocks where N can be 16 or 8 or any other size.
- an index is set to 0 to keep track of the blocks within the difference frame, and the first block of the difference frame is selected for processing as the current block.
- the index is equal to the total number of blocks in the difference frame TOTAL_BLOCKS
- process 700 exits.
- the current block is processed if the index is less than TOTAL_BLOCKS.
- a variance value for the N ⁇ N block of the difference frame S d is calculated at step 706 .
- the variance may be the standard deviation a or the actual variance ⁇ 2 .
- the calculated value, variance_N ⁇ N can be compared to a predetermined upper threshold T_stop.
- the upper threshold T_stop is set to reduce false positives by preventing some high variances from being put into the histogram. This prevents process 600 from determining too high a threshold for difference frames S d that may not contain any substantial static or slow-motion areas by eliminating some high variances from the histogram. In other words, T_stop allows a certain low value of variances. Setting T_stop is described in additional detail hereinafter.
- T_stop has been set to 3000. If variance_N ⁇ N is greater than or equal to T_stop, process 700 increments the value of index at step 712 and loops back to step 704 to determine if more blocks remain to be processed and to process the next block as the current block. Blocks may be processed in any order, such as in raster scan order.
- process 700 includes the variance in the variance histogram at step 710 by incrementing a bin of the histogram. For example, variance_N ⁇ N is divided by BIN_WIDTH, which is the width in variance units of a single bin of the variance histogram. The result is used to determine which bin of the histogram to increment. In this example, BIN_WIDTH is equal to 50.
- process 700 increments the value of index at step 712 and loops back to step 704 as described above. After all blocks are processed (index is equal to TOTAL_BLOCKS in step 704 ), process 700 ends, exiting to step 606 of FIG. 6 , discussed below.
- the output of process 700 is a frame-level variance distribution represented graphically by the variance histogram.
- FIGS. 8A and 8B are variance histograms generated using a first video frame as a current frame in process 700 of FIG. 7 .
- FIGS. 9A and 9B are variance histograms generated using a second video frame as a current frame in process 700 of FIG. 7 .
- FIGS. 10A and 10B are variance histograms generated using a third video frame as a current frame in process 700 of FIG. 7 .
- FIGS. 8A, 9A and 10A variance is graphed on the X-axis and the frequency with which each value of the variable occurs is graphed on the Y-axis.
- the Y-axis is a normalized frequency that is proportional to the count of blocks whose variances fall in a respective bin.
- the first video frame has significant static or slow motion areas and low noise.
- the second video frame has significant static or slow motion areas but high noise.
- the third video frame has few static or slow motion areas. The majority of blocks in static or slow motion areas have relatively small variances.
- FIGS. 8A and 9A show these blocks as lying on the left side of the respective histograms.
- This characteristic allows us to statistically set a threshold using the variance histogram as described below to separate the static or slow motion areas from fast motion areas. Due to the relative lack of static or slow motion areas in the third video frame, most blocks demonstrate high variances. In such a case, no threshold may be set.
- FIGS. 8B, 9B and 10B are variance cumulative histograms that graph the same data as FIGS. 8A, 9A and 10A , respectively, except that the Y-axis represents the cumulative number of blocks having a given variance or less for each value of variance on the X-axis.
- the variance cumulative histogram may also be used to statistically set the threshold as described below.
- process 700 exits to step 606 of FIG. 6 .
- process 600 determines a threshold for the variance histogram.
- classifying slow-motion blocks into the fast-motion category is more tolerable than classifying fast-motion blocks into the slow-motion category in video compression. This is because the latter misclassification would more adversely affect video quality than the former. For this reason, a conservative threshold is preferred that limits false positives in the detection of slow motion areas.
- a cutoff frequency C may be set either experimentally or theoretically.
- a corresponding threshold T is found on the X-axis for the cumulative histogram generated using the current frame. In this way, the number of blocks with a variance less than threshold T accounts for (100*C) % of the total blocks. This is demonstrated by FIGS. 11 and 12 .
- Process 1100 can be implemented in a system such as computing device 200 as part of the encoding process for a video stream.
- Process 1100 can be implemented, for example, as a software program that is executed by a computing device such as transmitting station 112 or receiving station 130 .
- the software program can include machine-readable instructions that are stored in a memory such as memory 226 that, when executed by a processor such as CPU 224 , cause the computing device to perform process 1100 .
- Process 1100 can also be implemented using hardware in whole or in part. As explained above, some computing devices may have multiple memories and multiple processors, and the steps of process 1100 may in such cases be distributed using different processors and memories.
- process 1100 is depicted and described as a series of steps. However, steps in accordance with this disclosure can occur in various orders and/or concurrently. Additionally, steps in accordance with this disclosure may occur with other steps not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated steps may be required to implement a method in accordance with the disclosed subject matter.
- variables index and sum are set to zero.
- the first bin is selected.
- the value of the variable index is compared to HIST_BINS, a variable that is set to the total number of histogram bins in the current variance histogram generated using the current frame. HIST_BINS is thus equal to T_stop/BIN_WIDTH. The determination of T_stop is discussed hereinafter. If index is less than HIST_BINS, the variable sum is incremented by the value of the variance histogram at the current bin index at step 1106 . Broadly, the block count in each histogram is accumulated one by one.
- CUT_OFF which is equal to C*TOTAL_BLOCKS
- the procedure stops and returns the threshold T. Otherwise, the accumulated count is low (less than or equal to CUT_OFF) such that process 1100 ends, meaning no threshold is set.
- process 1100 increments index at step 1114 and loops back to step 1104 to see if all of the bins are processed and to get the next histogram bin for processing. If, at step 1104 , process 1100 reaches the end of the bins such that index is equal to HIST_BINS, it is also true that step 1110 has not been executed. Therefore, threshold T has not been set to a valid value. At step 1112 , threshold T is set to the value “INVALID_THRESHOLD,” which means that no threshold is set for the current frame. Process 1100 exits and returns to step 608 of FIG. 6 .
- FIG. 12 is a cumulative variance histogram 1200 generated from a sample difference frame S d .
- FIG. 12 shows the selection of the cutoff frequency C described above.
- the point along curve 1202 at which cutoff frequency C crosses curve 1202 defines the value of threshold T.
- FIG. 12 also shows the value of the stop threshold T_stop.
- T_stop allows the threshold finding process to stop if there is no slow-motion area such as in the case of the third video of FIGS. 10A and 10B .
- T_stop is equal to 3000.
- T_stop may be set experimentally or theoretically.
- the current frame S is encoded at step 608 by passing it to an encoder along with the threshold T and the blocks of the difference frame S d along with their respective variances.
- a threshold is set, the encoding process can consider whether each block of the current frame is within a static or slow-motion area or a fast motion area based on where its variance falls relative to the threshold T.
- the lack of a value for the threshold may also be used for the encoding process. That is, the lack of a threshold value may be used to indicate that all blocks within the current frame should be encoded as if they are located in fast motion areas.
- the encoder can use the threshold T and the variances to achieve greater efficiency in encoding the frame. For example, if the a block of the difference frame S d has a variance less than the threshold T, it means that the corresponding block from the current video frame S likely includes static or slow-motion portions of a scene.
- the subsequent encoding steps can be apprised of this information, thereby speeding up the encoding. For example, motion prediction may be skipped in its entirety for such blocks.
- Other techniques to speed up processing include using larger block partitioning for the areas of the current video frame S that include blocks having variances less than the threshold T, since they likely all include static or slow-motion portions of the scene.
- Other techniques that can be used include reducing the motion search range for motion prediction of some blocks and improving quantizer parameter setting in the rate/distortion loop.
- encoding and decoding illustrate some exemplary encoding and decoding techniques. However, it is to be understood that encoding and decoding, as those terms are used in the claims, could mean compression, decompression, transformation, or any other processing or change of data.
