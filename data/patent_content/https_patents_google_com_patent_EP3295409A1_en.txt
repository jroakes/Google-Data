- the present disclosure relates to providing call context when directing customers to customer service representatives via a communication channel such as a voice or video call.
- content providers may provide content items (e.g., electronic advertisements) for display with a web page.
- the content item may include or be associated with a phone number or other identifier (e.g., click-to-call advertisement, or call only advertisement) that allows a user, potential customer or other viewer of the content item to contact or initiate a communication with the content provider.
- a phone number or other identifier e.g., click-to-call advertisement, or call only advertisement
- the content provider may have minimal information about the customer or context associated with the call.
- the content provider may not have information about the content item that resulted in the call, keywords that were used to select the content item for display on the web page, one or more terms of the user's search query that matched the content item, a type of content network, or other information associated with the display of the content item and/or or the selection of the content item.
- Providing this context may facilitate a content provider providing a customized user experience. For example, if the keywords "red shoes" caused the content item to be selected for display on the webpage, a landing page can be customized for red shoes instead of a generic page showing shoes of different colors.
- Systems and methods of the present solution can facilitate providing such context for customer service calls.
- the present solution can provide tracking value for call advertisements when the call advertisement provides a virtual phone number.
- a data processing system selects and provides a call content item for display with a webpage.
- the call content item may include an advertisement in the form of a sponsored link included by the search engine (e.g., via content selector) in the search results.
- the content item may include a link or button to a phone number that facilitates providing tracking data to a content provider.
- a user selects or clicks on a call button of the call content item, or calls the provided number. This number may be a virtual number or forwarding number provided by the data processing system.
- the data processing system receives the call and identifies tracking values associated with the call and the content item. For example, the data processing system may tie the virtual number with this impression of the content item.
- the data processing system may then access an impression log for this content item, which may include keywords of the content item, the website the content item was displayed with, time of day, content network, search query with which the content item matched, etc.
- the data processing system after obtaining this information, can provide some or all of this information to the content provider or customer service representative that receives the call.
- the data processing system can identify a website or other site, database, electronic mail account, or file path configured by the content provider to receive the tracking values.
- the data processing system may provide the tracking values for display on the site.
- the site may be a secure site that requires authentication credentials prior to gaining access.
- the information may be posted on the site on a temporary basis, e.g., a time interval of 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, two hours, etc. starting with the content item impression or the customer's call to the data processing system.
- the tracking value may be anonymous in that it may not identify any personally identifying information.
- the data processing system may initiate a call to the content provider and then bridge the two legs of the call (e.g., the customer's call to the data processing system with the data processing system's call to the content provider).
- the data processing system may provide the tracking values prior to calling the content provider, simultaneously with calling the content provider, or after initiating or establishing a call with the content provider.
- the content provider can identify, using caller identification, the virtual number used to make the call.
- the content provider may then use the virtual number to lookup the site in which tracking values are posted.
- the customer service representative that received the call may now have additional information around the source of the call in order to provide a better and customized user experience.
- the caller identification may identify the virtual number dialed by the user's computing device, a number of the data processing system, or the number associated with the user's computing device. In some cases, if the virtual number is the only number from the pool of available numbers that is currently allocated, then the content provider may receive this virtual number as the caller identification.
- the present solution can provide differentiated customer service.
- a customer may search for a vacation package to Cancun.
- the data processing system may receive a search query input into a search engine for a Cancun vacation package.
- the data processing system may provide search results responsive to the search query.
- the data processing system may further select and provide a call advertisement that matches the search query for display with the search results.
- the call advertisement may be from an advertiser that provides travel and hotel packages to Cancun, among other destinations.
- the potential customer may click on or otherwise dial the number associated with the call advertisements.
- the call advertisement may display a virtual number for the advertiser.
- the call advertisement may display the virtual number responsive to receiving an indication of interest in the call advertisement (e.g., a click or selection or other interaction with the call advertisement).
- the data processing system can determine that the keywords that matched the advertisement were "vacation package Cancun" and provide these matched keywords to the advertiser. This may improve the user experience because the content provider may value vacation package leads more than other leads and allow them to prioritize this call higher and also assign the potential customer to a gold or higher level customer service representative who can help with the vacation package.
- the data processing system receives a search query input into a search engine for auto insurance.
- the data processing system responsive to the search query, provides search results and further selects and provides a call advertisement for display with the search results that matches the search query.
- the call advertisement may display a virtual number for the advertiser.
- the call advertisement may display the virtual number responsive to receiving an indication of interest in the call advertisement (e.g., a click or selection or other interaction with the call advertisement).
- the user may call the advertiser associated with the call advertisement using the number provided via the call advertisement.
- the data processing system Prior to the data processing system connecting the call to the advertiser, the data processing system can provide the keywords that matched the call advertisement to the advertisement. Thus, the customer representative may understand the user's needs better and provide more specific responses regarding auto insurance.
- the data processing system can also provide improved leads management.
- a content provider may receive leads from various sources, such as a paid search service, contextual content placement service, banner advertisements, social advertisement, retargeting campaigns, etc.
- the content provider may value leads provided by a source higher than leads provided by other sources.
- the content provider may value leads provided by a paid search service higher than leads from banner advertisements.
- the content provider can allocate resources accordingly (e.g., assign a more experienced or higher rated customer representative to answer the call).
- the data processing system can be configured to provide the tracking values to the content provider using in-band or out-of-band, push or pull techniques.
- the data processing system can pass the tracking value using a header of the voice communication protocol (SIP) itself.
- SIP voice communication protocol
- the data processing system can play the tracking value to the content provider in the beginning of the call.
- the data processing system can post the tracking values to a site prior to connecting the call to the content provider and the content provider would be able to access those values via the site.
- a push technique the data processing system can push the tracking data to a content provider's device responsive to receiving or identifying the tracking data.
- the content provider's device may contact the data processing system and request tracking data from the data processing system (e.g., based on user input, periodically, responsive to receiving a call, etc.). For example, the content provider may use a virtual number as an identifier to pull the tracking data from the data processing system.
- the data processing system is configured to use virtual numbers to facilitate providing tracking data.
- a virtual number may refer to a telephone number without a directly associated telephone line. These numbers are programmed to forward incoming calls to one of the pre-set telephone numbers chosen by a client; either Fixed, Mobile or VoIP.
- a virtual number can work like a gateway between traditional calls (PSTN) and VOIP. Subscribers to virtual numbers may use their existing phones, without the need to purchase additional hardware.
- a virtual telephone number can be set to forward calls to different telephone numbers depending on the time of day and the day of the week.
- the data processing system can be further configured to use the virtual number with a content item to track calls made to the content provider.
- the virtual number (or content forwarding number) can facilitate receiving and tracking phone calls resulting from the content item.
- the data processing system can assign, select or otherwise provide a unique virtual number to be displayed with the content item of a content provider.
- the data processing system receives the call and routes the call to the corresponding content provider.
- the content provider may then obtain information about the calls generated by the content item.
- the data processing system may maintain the anonymity of the customer by providing the forwarding number as the caller identification number, rather than the customer's number.
- the content provider can use the tracking data to improve the call experience or better select the representative to receive the call, as opposed to merely reporting purposes at some point after the call is completed.

- the data processing system 120 may provide the tracking data based on time intervals, conditions or events. For example, the data processing system 120 can determine a time interval between when a user selected the content item and made the call, and provide the content item if the time interval satisfies a threshold time interval. To do this, the data processing system 120 may identify a first time stamp for the selection of the content item. The data processing system 120 may identify the time stamp by accessing the impression data structure that includes the impression record that corresponds to the virtual number. For example, when the data processing system 120 receives a call from the user via the first virtual number, the data processing system can perform a lookup in the database to determine the corresponding tracking data, which may include the time stamp of the selection of the content item.
- the data processing system may further identify a second time stamp for the call from the user to the data processing system to initiate the first communication channel.
- the second time stamp may refer to when the user made the call or when the data processing system receives the call.
- the data processing system may access a call log stored in data repository 145 to determine the time stamp of the call.
- the data processing system can determine a time interval between the first time stamp and the second time stamp.
- the time interval may be the difference in time between the second time stamp and the first time stamp.
- the data processing system may then compare the time interval with a time interval threshold (or threshold) to determine whether the time interval satisfies the threshold.
- the time interval may satisfy the threshold if the time interval is less than or equal to the time threshold.
- the time threshold may be, e.g., 2 hours, 3 hours, 30 minutes, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, a week, etc.
- a content provider may set, establish or otherwise assign the time threshold for a content campaign or content item.
- the threshold may be predetermined by the data processing system 120.
- the data processing system may then provide the tracking data for display using an in-band or out-of-band technique. However, if the time interval is greater than the time threshold, the data processing system may determine not to provide the tracking data. For example, the tracking data may no longer be relevant if the time interval between the content item selection and call is too large (e.g., greater than 72 hours).
- the data processing system 120 may receive multiples calls from a same user and provide the tracking data to the content provider reach time. The data processing system 120 may further provide the tracking data responsive to a time interval satisfying a threshold.
- the data processing system 120 may determine a time interval between a last event with the user and the time stamp of the call.
- a last event may refer to a previous call to the data processing system via the first virtual number, the time stamp of initiation or termination of the previous call, a selection of the content item, a conversion on the content item, etc.
- the data processing system 120 can provide the tracking data to the content provider responsive to the time interval satisfying a threshold.
- the data processing system 120 can remove tracking data posted to an electronic site based on a duration or time interval. For example, if a user selected the content item more 2 hours ago (or some other time interval), the data processing system 120 may remove any tracking that may have been posted to an electronic site controlled, managed or hosted by the data processing system 120, or may provide an instruction to an owner of manager of the electronic site to remove such tracking data.
- the data processing system may receive a call via the first virtual number and determine that the first virtual number is no longer linked to tracking data due to a time interval exceeding a threshold.
- the data processing system 120 may determine in these cases to provide an indication to the content provider that the time interval exceeded the threshold and there is no tracking data. In some cases, the data processing system 120 may determine to provide the last available/linked tracking data.
- the data processing system 120 can provide tracking data (or portions thereof) to a call engine 150 of a content provider.
- the virtual number engine of the data processing system 120 can be configured with the functionality of the call engine 150.
- a call engine 150 may refer to an interactive voice response ("IVR") technology that can allow a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and tones.
- IVR interactive voice response
- the data processing system 120 can be configured to interact with the IVR technology of the content provider as opposed to the user. For example, the data processing system 120 receives the first call via the first virtual number from the user, performs a look up to identify the corresponding tracking data, and then conveys the tracking data to the content provider's IVR technology interface or call engine.
- the data processing system 120 or the content provider's call engine 150 may then process the tracking data to determine the appropriate customer service representative, and direct the call to the selected customer service representative.
- the content provider's call engine 150 may be configured with a policy.
- the policy may include one or more parameters, rules or conditions.
- the policy may indicate that if the tracking data includes a first keyword, then the call engine is to direct the call to a first customer service representative or a first pool of customer service representatives.
- Another type of policy may include a ranking or quality based policy.
- the call engine may be configured to determine the first keyword of the tracking data, apply the policy to the first keyword to determine that the call is to be directed to a customer service representative who has a certain rating or meets or exceeds a certain rating (e.g., 3 star, 4 star, 5 star).
- the rating may be based on historical feedback from users. For example, at the end of each call with a customer service representative, the call engine or content provider may provide a survey to the user asking them for feedback on the call. The call engine may store this feedback in a data repository of the content provider. The call engine may then access this data repository responsive to applying the policy to the tracking data to identify one or more customer service representatives that are candidates to receive the call. The call engine may further identify the customer service representative that is currently available or with the shortest queue or wait time.
- the data processing system can provide tracking data in real-time to a content provider, which the content provider can then use to direct the call to the appropriate customer service representative and/or allow the selected customer service representative to provide a tailored or improved customer experience.
- the data processing system can provide the tracking data in an offline manner, such as responsive to a request from a content provider's device for tracking data.
- the data processing system may receive the request for the tracking data from a content provider's device at some time after the tracking data is stored in a data structure or after a call is completed, where the request may include a virtual number that can be used to lookup the tracking data stored in the data structure.
- the data processing system may generate an offline report with tracking data for a plurality calls associated with the virtual number, or a plurality of virtual numbers associated with a content group or content campaign.
- the data processing system 120 can configure the call to the content provider with a caller identification number.
- the caller identification number provided to the content provider may include the first virtual number dialed by the user's computing device to initiate the first
- the data processing system 120 can configure the caller identification number based on a policy or rules. If only the first virtual number of a pool of virtual numbers assigned to the content provider or the content campaign is currently allocated to a content item, then the data processing system may forward first virtual number as the caller identification to the content provider.
