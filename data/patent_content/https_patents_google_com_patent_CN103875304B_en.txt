Description
Technical field
Present disclosure is related to for being retrieved by the wireless telecom equipment with the first and second Radio Access Interfaces
Content, so as to support the method for high-quality content retrieval using multi radio access technology at the same time.It is also disclosed and requires
Wireless telecom equipment and communication system.
Background technology
The transmission of media content streaming is just becoming more commonly on the internet, and recent research indicate that Streaming services structure
Into the maximum ratio of current internet service and expected as mobile equipment (in general, smart phone) is increasingly utilized for mobile stream
Formula transmission service, the percentage future will also increase.As the increasing of the mobile phone user of stream transmission is moved in experience,
In the presence of the needs of stream transmission optimization, to improve the stream transmission of mobile equipment experience.
Some streaming technologies for being designed to effectively operate by the mobile telecommunication channel changed over time are presently, there are,
Such as the live stream transmissions (HLS) of HTTP and the 3GPP dynamic self-adaptings stream transmission (DASH) for passing through HTTP.Entitled " Apple
(apple proposes HTTP stream transmission feature conducts to proposes HTTP streaming feature as IETF standard
Ietf standard) " (can be through http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/07/apple-proposes-http-
Streaming-f eature-as-a-protocol-standard.ars are retrieved) article give the simple general introduction of HLS,
And in 3GPP technical specifications TS 26.247 (V10.0.0), entitled " Transparent end-to-end Packet-
switched Streaming Service(PSS)；Progressive Download and Dynamic Adaptive
Streaming over HTTP (3GP-DASH) (transparent end-to-end packet switch streaming transmission services (PSS)；Pass through HTTP's
Progressive download and dynamic self-adapting stream transmission (3GP-DASH)) " in describe DASH.
HLS and DASH can use transmission capacity by switching the rate-matched of coded media content, and support passes through single communication
The media streaming in path (or single wireless is electrically accessed technology connection) and adaptive streaming transmission.Pass through these technologies, visitor
Sequence of the family end by media content retrieval for small " chunking " constant (being generally near 10s).Can be from for media content
The available multiple chunkings of same percentage retrieve each chunking, for example, can be represented by high quality chunking, mean quality chunking etc.
The share of media content.High quality chunking will have more information, therefore, also will be than mean quality chunking more in terms of size
Greatly.During each client retrieval chunking, the measurement retrieval duration.When the duration exceeding a certain threshold value (or when other realities
During now triggering application), client request has reduction quality, so that with the reduced-size next chunking that can faster retrieve.
In this way, even if when transport channel capacity decline when (such as due to channel variation and transmission influence), although the matter with reduction
Amount, but remain to maintain stream transmission flowing.
The advantages of HLS/DASH, is to adapt to that with transmitting flowable state as a stream transmission capacity can be used and in mobile communication system
In there is the feature of substantially robust property and reliability.However, shortcoming is to perform adaptively in the case where damaging quality：When defeated
When channels deteriorate and cannot support High Data Rate, stream transmission flowing is maintained, but reduce quality.For example, when mobile equipment makes
When transmitting video content as a stream via WiFi with HLS or DASH, when WiFi network becomes obstruction (for example, working as cannot support to exceed
During the TCP handling capacities of 100-200Kbps) and when cannot support that high quality is transmitted as a stream, flowing content will be switched to low quality.
This has negative influence to user experience.
So as to, HLS and 3GPP DASH provide effective and adaptive technique for mobile stream transmission, but when transport channel is shown
When writing deterioration, they cannot keep high quality stream transmission experience.
When attempting to improve stream video performance, it is some it is open propose using it is multiple and meanwhile IP interfaces examine parallel
Rope video chunking.For example, in the entitled of Robert Kuschnig, Ingo Kofler and Hermann Hellwagner
“Improving Internet Video Streaming Performance by Parallel TCP-based
Request-Response Streams (are passed by the parallel request based on TCP-response stream to improve internet video streaming
It is defeated) " article (can be through http://alvand.basu.ac.ir/~nassiri/courses/AdvNetworks/papers/
Paper25.pdf is retrieved) in, author proposes the client driving streaming system based on request-response, non-with HLS/DASH
It is often similar, however, it simultaneously retrieves multiple chunkings using multiple interfaces.The results of property instruction multipath chunking reported
Retrieval can provide relatively stable and the higher compared with single path chunking is retrieved the entirety in big two-way time (RTT) scope
TCP handling capacities.However, in the present disclosure, mobile equipment keeps multiple interface continuous and effectives.Therefore, this multichannel radial-flow type passes
Defeated mechanism can have opposite negative impact to battery consumption.
Another known technology that can be used for enhancing stream transmission experience is that (such as see can be through by multipath TCP (MPTCP)
http:The multipath TCP Internet-Drafts of //tools.ietf.org/wg/mptcp/ retrievals).
By MPTCP, client and server is established is used for the multiple parallel TCP connections for retrieving media content at the same time
(usually via the different communication technologys).Advantage is that MPTCP can be by using the active volume on multiple communication paths, there is provided
Increased entire throughput.Therefore, when carrying out HTTP stream transmission sessions based on MPTCP, overall transmission capacity can be increased, from
And due to seldom requiring low quality media chunking, it is therefore contemplated that the stream transmission experience of raising.However, shortcoming is client
It must upgrade with server to support in most cases unpractical MPTCP.To avoid this problem, such as in Mark
The statement of entitled " mptcp proxies (the mptcp agencies) " of Handley (can be through www.ietf.org/proceedings/
80/slides/mptcp-4.ppt is retrieved) proposed in, it can be acted on behalf of between clients and servers using MPTCP.At this
In the case of kind, only client and agency need to support MPTCP, and stream transmission/media server need not.However, still deposit
In the demand of upgrade of network architecture.Moreover, destroy the end-to-end transparency, Yi Jihui using agency's (or other middle boxes)
Some problem is produced, for example, utilizing the application (FTP, SIP, RTSP etc.) that transport information is carried in payload.In addition,
It is that server performs transmitting and scheduling (that is, media data being distributed to available communication path or TCP subflows) by MPTCP, because
This, client not can determine that using which path or radio access technologies.The shortcomings that this is other, because server may select
Select and data are sent by the communication path of most expensive, and client does not have power to avoid or control the behavior.

In step 300, receive and be used for from being communicatively coupled to UMTS network 104 and WiFi network in mobile equipment 102
110 remote server 118 retrieves the request of content.Only when the first Radio Access Interface 222 is effective or when the one 222 He
When 2nd 220 Radio Access Interface is effective, the request of retrieval content can be received.For example, mobile equipment 102 is in covering
Region 114 and the WiFi Radio Access Interfaces 222 through activation, communicate with WiFi network 110.Can be from mobile equipment 102
User receive retrieval request.Content can be video, webpage, file or the other types that can be obtained from remote server 118
Media content.For example, the user of mobile equipment 102 just browses web sites and identifies that user wishes the video segment of retrieval.
Request content can include different types of media content.In addition, for distributing the distribution of request content or retrieval
Method can be streaming method, such as stream video (live or not live), or can with right and wrong streaming method,
Such as download file.For moving the known streaming method of equipment, such as HLS and DASH (as described above) are to be based on
HTTP stream transmissions.In these streaming methods, by server (such as remote server 118) in a series of chunkings
Content is provided.This is also referred to as piecemeal transmission coding.In general, each of chunkings a series of is with the constant duration.
In response to receiving the request to content, then, mobile equipment 102 connects simultaneously via the first radio access technologies
Through the first Radio Access Interface, from the Part I (such as first chunking) of 118 retrieval request content of remote server, step
302.This can be controlled under the control of content retrieval unit 216 by processing unit 202.When the first Radio Access Interface
Be WiFi Radio Access Interfaces 222 exemplary arrangement in, via the Part I of WiFi chained search request contents.Then,
Mobile equipment 102 determines whether the Part I that retrieved request content is connected via the first radio access technologies meets pair
Required service quality (QoS) threshold value in request content part, step 304.
In a series of exemplary arrangement of request content including chunkings, the Part I of request content is the of request content
One chunking, and include via the Part I of the first radio access technologies chained search request content via the first radio
The request of the first chunking for request content is sent to remote server 118 by access technology connection, and via the first nothing
Line is electrically accessed the first chunking that technology connection receives request from remote server 118.
Request QoS threshold can be the required delay of the retrieval for interior perhaps throughput rate and/or required bandwidth.
In the case of a series of media content encoded in chunkings, required QoS threshold is the maximum needed for the chunking of retrieval request content
Time.Required QoS threshold is supplied to mobile equipment 102.For example, required QoS can be pre-configured with mobile equipment 102,
Mobile equipment 102 can determine that required QoS or mobile equipment 102 can be from the remote service for providing request content from reception content
Device 118 receives the data associated with request content, which includes required QoS threshold.In exemplary arrangement, in response to from shifting
Dynamic equipment 102 receives the retrieval request for the data associated with request content, and remote server 118 will be with request content
Associated data (such as metadata) are sent to mobile equipment 102, the data include description request content information (such as
QoS threshold).The data associated with request content are referred to as playlist or " index ", and can indicate for example
The quantity of the chunking of the media content of composition request, the duration of each chunking etc..
Required QoS threshold is determined to move the playback rate of the request content of equipment 102 with being received in mobile equipment 102
The rate-matched of content.
In the scheme that required QoS threshold is required bandwidth, mobile equipment 102 is wirelessly electrically accessed by that will can be used for first
The bandwidth of technology connection determines whether retrieval meets required QoS threshold compared with required QoS bandwidth.If available bandwidth
Less than required QoS bandwidth, then mobile equipment 102 determines that the connection of the first radio access technologies is unsatisfactory for required QoS threshold.Such as
Fruit available bandwidth is equal to or more than required QoS threshold, then mobile equipment 102 determines that the connection of the first radio access technologies meets
Required QoS threshold.
In content is to retrieve the arrangement of the maximum time needed for chunking including a series of chunkings and required QoS threshold,
Mobile equipment 102 receives Part I (i.e. chunking) by that will be connected to mobile equipment 102 via the first radio access technologies
The time it takes determines whether chunking retrieval meets required QoS threshold compared with maximum time.If receive first group
The time that block is spent is more than maximum time, then it is required that mobile equipment 102 determines that the connection of the first radio access technologies is unsatisfactory for
QoS threshold.If receiving first chunking the time it takes is equal to or less than maximum time, then mobile equipment 102 definite the
QoS threshold needed for one radio access technologies connection satisfaction.
So as to, mobile equipment 102 be arranged to by for the measurement qos parameter of retrieval request content part (for example, mobile
Equipment determines available bandwidth, receives the time that the first chunking is spent) it is compared to determine with the required QoS threshold of qos parameter
Whether the connection of the first radio access technologies meets QoS demand.
Step 306, it is unsatisfactory for when definite via the Part I of the first radio access technologies chained search request content
During required QoS threshold, for example, when to retrieve the first chunking more than the delay of maximum time, mobile equipment 102 is (single in processing
Under the control of member 202) the second Radio Access Interface of activation, for example, UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220.Mobile equipment 102 exists
Under the control of MTS units 218, the second Radio Access Interface is activated.In exemplary arrangement, connect when definite via the first radio
Enter technology connection retrieval request content Part I be unsatisfactory for needed for QoS threshold when and when in mobile equipment 102, such as
When the configuration information stored in memory 206 is allowed via multiple Radio Access Interface retrieval request contents, mobile equipment 102
Activate the second Radio Access Interface.Configuration information can be user-defined, and/or be provided by operator.Configuration information can
Simply to indicate whether to use multiple Radio Access Interfaces and/or can be more dedicated and specified to certain kinds
The content and/or distribution/search method of type, can allow multiple Radio Access Interfaces, and to it is other kinds of it is interior perhaps
Distribution/search method, does not allow multiple Radio Access Interfaces.For example, configuration information can be indicated to by File Transfer Protocol
(FPT) and HTTP retrievals content, multiple Radio Access Interfaces can be allowed, and other agreements are not allowed then.Referring to
Figure 4 and 5 it is described below in, configuration information and referred to as multipath strategy is discussed in more detail.
Mobile equipment 102 (under the control of processing unit 202) is by ensuing second of request content to be retrieved
Point at least it is divided into for via first part of the first radio access technologies chained search and via the second radio access technologies
Connect and through activation the second Radio Access Interface 220 retrieval second part, step 308.First part and second part of selection
So as to estimate or retrieval first part and second part expected satisfaction needed for QoS threshold.Mobile equipment 102 connects via the first radio
Enter technology connection and the request for first part is sent to remote server 118, and connect via the second radio access technologies
Connect and the request for second part is sent to remote server 118.So as to which mobile equipment 102 is via the first and second radio
The Part II of access technology connection request and retrieval request content.This makes it possible to wirelessly be electrically accessed skill via first and second
The Part II of art connection while retrieval request content is faster retrieved to realize.
While the share with receiving request content through the second Radio Access Interface or (that is, it is not substantially simultaneously
Sequentially), in the sense that the share that request content is received through the first Radio Access Interface, while retrieval request content.
In a series of exemplary arrangement that request content includes chunkings, the Part II of request content is connecing for request content
The second chunking got off, and mobile equipment 102 next chunking of request content to be retrieved is at least divided into for via
First part of first length of the first radio access technologies chained search and to connect via the second radio access technologies
Connect second part of the second length of retrieval.First length of first part of selection, to estimate via the first radio access technologies
QoS threshold needed for first part of the retrieval satisfaction of next chunking of connection, and then, second part of the second length of next chunking
Degree depends on the residual share of remaining next chunking after first part of selection.In other words, connect as far as possible via the first radio
Enter the next chunking of technology linkup transmit, while still meet required QoS threshold, and connected via the second radio access technologies
Ask the remainder of next chunking.So as to, when mobile equipment 102 via the first radio access technologies chained search chunking or
During the share of chunking, the achievable handling capacity of measurement the first radio access technologies connection is (for example, by by first part of length
It is divided into the time needed for first part of retrieval) and using the handling capacity of the measurement estimate how long to spend via first
Radio access technologies are connected to retrieve first part of next chunking.In this way, mobile equipment 102 can select next chunking
First part of length so that it is expected that via this first part of the first radio access technologies chained search meet needed for QoS threshold.
In illustrative examples, first part of next chunking sends via WiFi and is 100Kbytes (kilobytes) and at 4 seconds
(sec) received in.Second part of next chunking sends via 3G and is 50Kbytes.Therefore, the handling capacity on WiFi is
100Kbytes/4sec=25Kbytes/sec.If two parts are transmitted via WiF, 6 seconds (150Kbytes/ will be spent
(25Kbytes/sec)).If 6 seconds via WiFi calculated are less than required QoS threshold (in general, 10 seconds), then, only pass through
Next chunking is retrieved and without using 3G by WiFi.If 6 seconds calculated are more than required QoS threshold, then, again via two
A wireless be electrically accessed retrieves next chunking by part.
Then, mobile equipment 102 (under the control of processing unit 202) is via the first radio access technologies chained search
First part and second via the second radio access technologies chained search request content of the Part II of request content
Second part divided, step 310.It is 222 and second radio of WiFi Radio Access Interfaces in the first Radio Access Interface
In exemplary arrangement when access interface is UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220, mobile equipment 102 send for request content with
First part of request of part afterwards, and first part of the subsequent section via WiFi chained search request contents, and movement are set
Standby 102 send second part of requests of the subsequent section for request content, and via UMTS chained search request contents with
Second part of part afterwards.
In exemplary scenario, if mobile equipment 102 is determined to connect via the first radio of QoS threshold needed for satisfaction
Enter first part and second part that technology retrieves follow-up Part III, step 312, then, step 314, mobile equipment 102 deactivates
Second Radio Access Interface 220 living and only via the first radio access technologies chained search request content with rear portion
Point, such as Part III, until having retrieved request content or when definite via the first radio access technologies chained search
The subsequent section of request content be unsatisfactory for needed for QoS threshold when untill.For example, the mobile measurement of equipment 102 first is wirelessly electrically accessed
The handling capacity (passing through the time being divided into first part of length needed for first part of retrieval) of technology connection and definite first nothing
Line is electrically accessed whether technology connection can support whole subsequent section, or chunking (that is, first part of combination in required QoS threshold
With second part) retrieval.If the connection of the first radio access technologies can support entirely next, such as the inspection of the 3rd chunking
Rope, then deactivate the second Radio Access Interface 220.In this way, only when independent first Radio Access Interface 222 cannot
Needed for satisfaction during QoS threshold, using the second Radio Access Interface 220, so as to minimize battery consumption and ensure with required
The chunking of QoS threshold retrieval request content.
Mobile equipment 102 performs restructuring/sequence of retrieval chunking, for being distributed to application layer, so as to solve WiFi 100
Any delay difference between 104 networks of UMTS.
In order to be best understood from the operation of MTS units 218, the operation of MTS units 218, Fig. 4 are described referring now to Figure 4 and 5
Signal stream for retrieving content by mobile equipment 102 is shown with 5：Fig. 4 is to work as to use only one Radio Access Interface (at this
In the case of, be WiFi interfaces 222) when signal stream and Fig. 5 be when using two Radio Access Interfaces when signal stream (
In this case, being WiFi interfaces 222 and UMTS interfaces 220).Figure will be described with reference to a series of stream content for including chunkings
4 and 5.This is not lie in present disclosure being limited to by stream content chunking come in retrieving for example purpose
Hold.
It is assumed that MTS units 218 receive a series of GET requests from such as content retrieval unit 216D applications (App), and often
One GET request is used for single group block content.GET request includes the identifier of the request chunking of content (for example, (unified resource is fixed by URL
Position symbol)) and required QoS threshold (such as 10 seconds).
MTS units 218 receive the GET request of the first chunking for request content, step 400.First, mobile equipment
102 are used for chunking using WiFi Radio Access Interfaces 222 retrieves, and measurement via WiFi retrieve that each chunking spends when
Between.It is assumed that the time is equal to or less than required QoS threshold (such as 10 seconds), then without using UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220
And only follow-up chunking, step 402 are retrieved via WiFi.(it is unknown that Fig. 4 is shown as step 404) to the step for retrieving needed for the first chunking
Carefully describe and will be apparent to one skilled in the art.These steps include being used to asking and receiving group
The typical HTTP signalings of the content of block, the content of chunking are distributed as a series of HTTP packets.After the content of chunking is received,
Application (App) is distributed to, then, the handling capacity on the WiFi of the renewal measurement of MTS units 218, step 406.This measurement
Handling capacity be desirable when QoS threshold needed for the chunking retrieval via WiFi is unsatisfactory for, and MTS units 218 need to count
Calculate by via WiFi ask next chunking number.
(require to examine beyond 10 seconds for example, working as when the time spent via WiFi retrieval chunkings exceeding required QoS threshold
During rope high quality chunking), then, mobile equipment 102 checks multipath strategy and assumes that strategy allows the multichannel of request content
Footpath conveys, and also activates UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220, step 408.Next chunking is retrieved as two parts：Via the of WiFi
A and second part (as shown in Figure 5) via UMTS.Based on measured WiFi handling capacities, the length of first part of calculating.It is more
Path policy is the configuration information (in general, operator's rule or user preference) in mobile equipment 102, it indicates mobile equipment
Whether 102 can be connected to content retrieval by multiple radio access technologies.For example, user can be same with limiting mobile device 102
When connected using multiple radio access technologies to minimize battery consumption or communications cost.Additionally or alternatively, operator
Multipath strategy configuration information can be supplied to mobile equipment 102 to indicate whether to allow multipath resource retrieval.
To retrieve next chunking, MTS units 218 receive the GET request for next chunking, step 500.MTS units 218
It is activation (because not receiving previous chunking in required QoS threshold) to check UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220, then,
MTS units 218 calculate first part of next chunking and second part of length, step 502.Calculate first part of length so that warp
It will not be spent by first part of the retrieval of WiFi and be longer than required QoS threshold (such as 10 seconds).The calculating is based on the recently measured
The handling capacity of WiFi connections.Second part of length is only the remainder of chunking.By calculate in this way first part and
Second part of length, mobile equipment 102 can ensure that uses WiFi as much as possible, and is only supplemented when needed using UMTS
The handling capacity of WiFi.
Then, next chunking is retrieved via WiFi and UMTS.Retrieve the step needed for next chunking and (step is shown as in Fig. 5
504) do not describe in detail and will be apparent to one skilled in the art.These steps include being used to ask
With the typical HTTP signalings of the content of the share of reception chunking, the content of the share of chunking is distributed as a series of HTTP packets.
Correspond to bytes range per portion, for example, first part of energy corresponds to byte 0-9999 and second part of energy corresponds to byte
10000- ends.Note that any 1.1 compliant servers of HTTP support bytes range and can be only by requested words in chunking
Adjusting range is distributed to mobile equipment.After receiving first part via WiFi and receiving second part via UMTS, MTS units 218 will
They are combined into chunking and combination chunking are distributed to application (App).Then, MTS units 218 update the WiFi of measurement again
On handling capacity, step 506.
If MTS units 218 determine that (such as WiFi handling capacities based on measurement) only receives received group via WiFi
First part of block and second part (if only receiving whole chunking via WiFi i.e., in the case of the required QoS threshold of satisfaction),
This means compared with the handling capacity previously measured, the increase of WiFi handling capacities, and can only be received via WiFi next group whole
Block.Then, MTS units 218 deactivate UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220, step 508.As before on step 400,
Then next chunking is retrieved via WiFi.
The request for being sent to remote server 118 by mobile equipment 102 can use following forms：
GET http://example.com/folder/chunk1.avi
GET http://example.com/folder/chunk2.avi
Etc. ...
Therefore, each request is only comprising request chunking.
Fig. 6 and 7 is the different channels condition shown on WiFi, have WiFi Radio Access Interfaces and UMTS without
Line is electrically accessed the figure of the experimental result of the mobile equipment of interface.These illustrate a series of groups of the request content received with the time
Block 600：Each peak value on figure corresponds to chunking.Y-axis represents that service rate, and X-axis represent the time with bit per second.Close
Different " packetization delay " and different " packet loss rate " are shown as in the different channels condition of WiFi Radio Access Interfaces
(PLR).Fig. 6 shows that the chunking 600 received via singular association (only WiFi), and Fig. 7 are shown according to present disclosure, via
The chunking that multiple connections receive.
As can finding out in figure 6, originally, meet the needs of required QoS threshold (they via the WiFi chunkings 600 received
Far faster than 10 seconds it is received).After time T1, the delay of WiFi connections increases to 100ms from 10ms (millisecond), cause via
The chunking retrieval cost of WiFi is longer than 10 seconds.Therefore, in required QoS threshold, mobile equipment cannot receive chunking, and stop
Flowing-stopping type transmission is until after the time T2 when delay again returns to 10ms and stream transmission starts again at.So as to,
In the case shown in fig. 6, between T1 and T2, otherwise stop content streaming being transferred to mobile equipment completely, otherwise it will connect
Receive low quality chunking (if for example, using HLS or DASH).
As seen in Fig. 7, originally, via the WiFi chunkings 700 received meet needed for the requirement of QoS threshold (they are remote
It is received with being faster than 10 seconds).After time T1, the delay of WiFi connections increases to 100ms from 10ms again, causes via WiFi
Chunking retrieval cost be longer than 10 seconds.The condition causes the activation of UMTS Radio Access Interfaces and via WiFi and UMTS
Receive next chunking.First part 702 of next chunking is received via WiFi, and second part of next chunking is received via UMTS
704.Most business is scheduled on WiFi.The share of chunking is received via WiFi and UMTS, until in T2, mobile equipment
Determine WiFi handling capacities increases (since WiFi connection delays are again reduced to 10ms) and can be 10 seconds in required QoS threshold again
It is interior receive two parts of next chunking via WiFi untill.Then, mobile equipment deactivates UMTS Radio Access Interfaces and again
It is secondary only to receive chunking 700 via WiFi.Due to the WiFi conditions of change, first part 702 and second part 704 of peak value is in time T1
Change between T2.Business (that is, second part of length) on UMTS depends on the business (that is, first part of length) on WiFi
And change.Delay on WiFi is bigger, then the business on UMTS is more.So as to even if when the deterioration of WiFi conditions is less than acceptable
The QoS limit, still high quality can be kept to transmit as a stream.
This disclosure has described more RAT (radio access technologies) ability by using modern mobile devices, improves
The novel method (for example, supporting high quality stream transmission or other handling capacity intensive services) of content retrieval experience.Flowed with reducing
Formula data rate is compared to tackle the other technologies (such as described in introduction) of handling capacity deterioration, in present disclosure
Method is by activating other Radio Access Interface and being retrieved at the same time in media using two (or multiple) radio interface
The different piece of appearance, to tackle handling capacity deterioration.Therefore, also can be with high-quality even if an available radio access technology obstruction
Amount continues to transmit as a stream session and total throughout and can be maintained at relatively high level.When via different radio access interface
The feature of different paths or connection with low cross correlation so that, obstruction on different radio access interface or low gulp down
The appearance for the amount of spitting across be independent in time domain when it is especially such.
Can select how to connect using available radio access technology according to mobile equipment in the present disclosure.For example,
In the case that mobile equipment supports WiFi and UMTS, mobile equipment can be accessed preferably using WiFi as far as possible, and only work as WiFi
Off-capacity is when maintaining the high quality to transmit as a stream, just to utilize some UMTS capacity.So as to if the second Radio Access Interface
More expensive, such as UMTS then moves equipment and can be arranged to only wirelessly to be electrically accessed (low cost, such as WiFi) when first and is not enough to tie up
When holding high quality stream transmission, the second Radio Access Interface is just utilized.For example, when stream transmission session occurs via WiFi
When, mobile equipment will continue that WiFi is used only, as long as WiFi connections have enough capacity for the high quality stream to be received.When
(this is high quality movement stream transmission when WiFi becomes clogged up and cannot support to exceed 800-1000Kbps (kilobytes per second(KBPS))
It is generally required), then UMTS interfaces are just activated and for supplementing the handling capacity provided via WiFi interfaces.In this way,
Battery consumption will not be significantly affected and wide area mobile network is unloaded Streaming services as far as possible.
So that (and deactivation) radio interface is dynamically activated by the transport condition based on measurement, and in introduction
Described in, by requiring mobile equipment to keep multiple interfaces to activate all the time improve the known arrangement of stream video performance
Compare, battery consumption can be reduced according to solution in the present disclosure.
Compared with HLS/DASH, according to solution in the present disclosure when active volume is reduced, do not switch to relatively low
Quality stream, on the contrary, but activating the 2nd TCP/HTTP connections (being wirelessly electrically accessed via second) and connecting to correct the first TCP/HTTP
Connect the capacity of (or first be wirelessly electrically accessed).So as to compared with HLS/DASH methods, high quality be maintained to transmit as a stream, this is carried
High user experience.
In the case where such as downloading so through non-stream transmission method retrieval content, if available bandwidth is little, then
It will take longer for carrying out retrieval file.In this case, can detect to be unsatisfactory for according to mobile equipment in the present disclosure
QoS threshold (for example, QoS threshold is required bandwidth), then retrieved more quickly using two kinds of radio access technologies connections
File.
According in another embodiment in the present disclosure, including for the first access network (such as WiFi network
110) communication the first Radio Access Interface (such as WiFi Radio Access Interfaces 222) and for second access network
The movement of second Radio Access Interface (for example, UMTS Radio Access Interfaces 220) of (for example, UMTS network 104) communication
Equipment 102 is multiple to determine whether to use using the configuration information of (such as in memory 218) storage in mobile equipment 102
Radio Access Interface carrys out retrieval request content and still carrys out retrieval request content using only a Radio Access Interface.In the reality
Apply in example, when judge use a Radio Access Interface or multiple Radio Access Interfaces when, move equipment without considering with
In the QoS of content retrieval.Request in response to receiving retrieval content from remote server (118), movement equipment 102 (for example,
Under the control of processing unit 202) according to the configuration information (such as multipath strategy) stored in mobile equipment 102, determine be
It is no to allow mobile equipment 102 via multiple Radio Access Interface retrieval request contents.When configuration information instruction can be via multiple
During Radio Access Interface retrieval request content, movement equipment (such as the control in processing unit 202 and content retrieval unit 216
Under system) it is configured to simultaneously retrieve via the first Radio Access Interface 222 and via the second Radio Access Interface 220 and asks
Seek content.When configuration information instruction cannot be via multiple Radio Access Interface retrieval request contents, mobile equipment 102 by with
It is set to only via 222 retrieval request content of the first Radio Access Interface.It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that with reference to figure 1-7
It is obvious that the above-mentioned details of the embodiment described, which can also apply to another embodiment,.

Second part of the Part I for the request content that access technology is connected and received at the same time through the second Radio Access Interface.
For example, when request content is to include the file of 100000 bytes, the Part I of request content can include word
1-2000, subsequent section byte 2001-4000, subsequent section byte 4001-6000 etc. are saved, untill the end of file.So
Afterwards, byte 1-1000 can be retrieved as the Part I of request content by mobile equipment 102 through the first Radio Access Interface
First part, and through the second Radio Access Interface, byte 1001-2000 is retrieved as to the Part I of request content at the same time
Second part.Then, byte 2001-3000 can be retrieved as request content by mobile equipment 102 through the first Radio Access Interface
First part of subsequent section, and through the second Radio Access Interface, byte 3001-4000 is retrieved as request content at the same time
Second part of subsequent section.In a series of another example that request content includes chunkings, mobile equipment 102 can be arranged
