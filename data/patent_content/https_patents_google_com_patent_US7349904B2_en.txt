Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to managing access to a variety of documents and applications, and more specifically to converging entitlement resources from a plurality of entitlement resource repositories to a single entitlement resource repository.
- dBlue DigitalBlue
- IBM Corporation DigitalBlue
- dBlue a digital interface between IBM Corporation and its customers.
- dBlue enables customers to search for IBM technical support information using natural language and produces results that are categorized, prioritized and personalized.
- the dBlue architecture connects three important elements from the information search world—information sources, search engines, and end users—on the basis of IBM's WebSphere software platform. This is done through a series of components called the “Knowledge Builder”.
- Information sources are data sources such as document repositories, DB2 and Lotus Notes databases, Web sites, etc.
- Search engines are programs that can index content and enable searching of the indexed data. End users access dBlue through a front-end interface; the current default interface is a Web interface.
- the content is extracted from information sources using the Document Extractor and mapped to a unified XML Schema, then it is processed by the Document Processor and stored in the Knowledge Repository.
- FIG. 1 presents a high-level block diagram of the IBM dBlue system architecture, shown generally at 100 .
- the Query Manager processes the query, along with all of the submitted parameters.
- the Query Builder collects the query and parameters submitted by the user, along with information coming from the user's profile and the system configuration, to build a standard Query object.
- the object is submitted to the search engine through the Search Engine Adapter.
- the search results flow back to the user through the Search Engine Adapter, the Search Query Manager, and the View Builder.
- the View Builder uses the Remote Site Customization component and data to construct a personalized view of the search hit list.
- the View Builder which accesses the Knowledge Repository to get the document content and builds a coherent document view.
- DBlue contains technical information from many different web sites, with different ways of entitling (i.e., authorizing) customers to the technical information based on the contracts the customer has purchased from the company/site. If these different web sites wanted to converge all of their technical documents onto a single entitlement repository, they would need to determine how to entitle the right customers.
- a single entitlement repository for entitled content can also promote synergy between companies sharing the entitlement repository.
- the entitlement resources should include not only technical documents, but also problem reporting functions, user forums, discussion databases, fix delivery solutions, tools, software download delivery resources, software upgrades, etc.
- a method for managing a set of entitlement resources. The method begins by converging the set of entitlement resources from multiple entitlement resource repositories onto a single, converged entitlement resource repository. Next, each of the converged entitlement resources within the converged entitlement resource repository is marked with one or more entitlement identifiers. An entitlement request from a requestor to access one or more of the entitlement resources residing within the entitlement resource repository is then received. An authentication token corresponding to the requestor is then passed to one or more entitlement authorities associated with each of the one or more requested entitlement resources.
- a set of entitlement identifiers associated with the authentication token is created at the entitlement authorities, and if any such entitlement identifiers exist, the set of entitlement identifiers is returned to the entitlement resource repository. Finally, it is determined if the requestor has access to the requested entitlement resources by comparing the set of entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities with the entitlement identifiers associated with each of the requested entitlement resources.
- the method further includes the steps of: a) enabling requestor access to the requested entitlement resource if a match exists between the set of entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities and the entitlement identifiers associated with each of the requested entitlement solutions; and b) returning an informational message to the requestor if a match does not exist between the set of entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities and the entitlement identifiers associated with each of the requested entitlement resources. If such a match does not exist, the requester is then presented with an opportunity to obtain access to the desired entitlement resource.
- Entitlement solutions may include, but are not limited to: technical documents, problem reporting functions, user forums, discussion databases, fix delivery solutions, tools, software download delivery resources and software upgrades.
- the method may further include the step of marking each of the converged entitlement resources with an entitlement type, wherein the entitlement type determines which of the one or more entitlement authorities are passed authentication tokens.
- the present invention also provides an apparatus for managing a set of entitlement resources.
- the apparatus includes an entitlement resource repository having a set of merged entitlement resources.
- the apparatus also includes a user workstation coupled to the entitlement resource repository, wherein the user workstation issues an entitlement request to access one or more entitlement resources within the entitlement resource repository, and receives the results of the entitlement request from the entitlement resource repository.
- the apparatus further includes one or more entitlement authorities coupled to the entitlement resource repository, wherein the entitlement authorities determine whether an issuer of the entitlement request has authority to access the one or more requested entitlement resources residing within the entitlement resource repository.
- Each of the set of merged entitlement resource may include an entitlement identifier and/or an entitlement type.
- the entitlement resource repository includes an authentication module for assigning an authentication token to the issuer of the entitlement request, and passing the authentication token to the entitlement authorities.
- the entitlement authorities may include an entitlement identification creator for creating a set of entitlement identifiers corresponding to the passed authentication token, and passing the set of entitlement identifiers back to the entitlement resource repository.
- the document repository may include a comparator to determine if the issuer of the entitlement request has access to the requested entitlement solutions by comparing the set of entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities with the entitlement identifiers associated with each of the issuer requested entitlement resources.
- the apparatus in another embodiment, includes an entitlement resource repository having a set of merged entitlement resources.
- the apparatus further includes a user workstation coupled to the entitlement resource repository, wherein the user workstation issues an entitlement request to access one or more entitlement resources within the entitlement resource repository.
- the apparatus further includes a session entitlement broker (SEB) coupled to the entitlement resource repository, the SEB receiving the entitlement request from the user workstation and determining whether the issuer of the entitlement request has authority to access the requested entitlement resource.
- SEB session entitlement broker
- the apparatus includes one or more entitlement authorities coupled to the SEB, wherein the entitlement authorities assign a set of entitlement identifiers associated with the issuer of the entitlement request, then returns the set of entitlement identifiers to the SEB.

- FIG. 2 illustrates a first embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary process flow for granting a requestor access to a generally entitled entitlement resource where the requestor has been determined to be entitled, the process flow superimposed over the second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources, shown previously in FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary process flow for denying a requestor access to a generally entitled entitlement solution where the requestor has been determined not to be entitled, the process flow superimposed over the second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources, shown previously in FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary process flow for determining whether a requestor has authority to access to a specific entitlement resource, the process flow superimposed over the second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources, shown previously in FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram representing a method for managing a set of entitlement resources in accordance with the present invention.
- the present invention provides a method, apparatus and program product for managing user access to a converged set of entitlement resources residing within an entitlement resource repository.
- Each of the entitlement resources is marked with an entitlement identifier.
- a requester e.g., user
- an authentication token corresponding to the requestor is sent to one or more entitlement authorities associated with the entitlement resource.
- the entitlement authority creates a set of entitlement identifiers associated with the requestor. This set of entitlement identifiers associated with the requestor is then compared with the entitlement identifiers associated with the entitlement resource to determine if the requestor has authority to access the entitlement resource.
- FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources in accordance with the present invention, shown generally at 200 .
- the apparatus/system 200 includes an entitlement resource repository 204 , where a set of entitlement resources (e.g., 212 A and 212 B) from multiple entitlement authorities are converged.
- Entitlement resources 212 A, 212 B may include, but are not limited to: technical documents, problem reporting functions, user forums, discussion databases, fix delivery solutions, tools, software download delivery resources, software upgrades, etc.
- entitlement solution repository 204 is a central database on a single computer server.
- a user workstation 202 is coupled to entitlement resource repository 204 , enabling a requestor to access the set of entitlement resources 212 A and 212 B residing within entitlement resource repository 204 .
- a requester e.g., user
- a requester may also include any type of entity (e.g., users, systems, websites, etc.) which may request access to the entitlement resource repository.
- a set of entitlement authorities 206 A, 206 B, 206 C and 206 D are also coupled to entitlement resource repository 204 .
- the entitlement authorities 206 A, 206 B, 206 C and 206 D are the entitlement providers for the converged entitlement resources 212 A, 212 B found on the entitlement resource repository 204 . Entitlement authorities 206 A, 206 B, 206 C and 206 D further determine whether a specific requestor (via the authentication token established at the entitlement resource repository 204 ) has authority (i.e., is entitled) to access a particular entitlement resource 212 A and 212 B.
- Each of the converged entitlement resources 212 A and 212 B residing within the entitlement resource repository 204 is marked with one or more entitlement identifiers, 220 A and 220 B, respectively.
- the entitlement identifier 220 A, 220 B is a credential which establishes which set of requestors are entitled to access a particular entitlement resource.
- each entitlement resource 212 A and 212 B may further include an entitlement type, 222 A and 222 B, respectively.
- the entitlement type 222 A, 222 B determines which of the entitlement authorities 206 A- 206 D are passed authentication tokens.
- entitlement types 222 A, 222 B there are many other potential entitlement types 222 A, 222 B that may be employed within the present invention, and still remain within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- other potential types of entitlement types include, but are not limited to: product entitlement (available to anyone who has the proper product entitlement code returned from an entitlement authority), free entitlement (available to everyone), and internal entitlement (available only to employees of the entitlement provider).
- each entitlement authority 206 A- 206 D includes an entitlement identifier creator 228 A- 228 D.
- the entitlement identifier creator 228 A- 228 D analyzes the authentication token passed by entitlement resource repository 204 to determine what credentials are available for that particular requestor.
- a set of credentials i.e., entitlement identifiers
- the passed set of entitlement identifiers is then compared against the entitlement identifier 220 A, 220 B associated with each entitlement resource selected for access by the requestor to determine if the requestor has authority to access the selected entitlement resource.
- comparator 214 This comparison is performed by comparator 214 . If there is a positive match identified by comparator 214 for a particular entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B selected by the requester, the requestor is then provided access to the selected entitlement resource. In one embodiment of the present invention, if comparator 214 determines that a requestor does not have access authority to a particular entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B, the entitlement resource repository 204 then directs the requester to a entitlement resource access enablement interface (not shown), where the requestor has the opportunity to obtain access to the desired entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B.
- the entitlement resource access enablement interface may offer a variety of ways for a user to access the entitlement resources, including but not limited to, purchasing a support contract, registering for access, etc.
- FIG. 3 is another embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources in accordance with the present invention, shown generally at 250 .
- a session entitlement broker (SEB) 210 is placed between the entitlement resource repository 204 and each of the entitlement authorities 206 A- 206 D.
- the SEB 210 receives the following from the entitlement resource repository 204 : 1) the entitlement resource(s) 212 A, 212 B (along with the associated entitlement identifiers 220 A- 220 B, and entitlement types 222 A- 222 B) that the requestor wishes to access; and 2) an authentication token from authentication module 216 identifying the requester that is attempting to access the entitlement resources.
- the SEB 210 passes this information to the appropriate set of entitlement authorities 206 A- 206 D, based on the entitlement type 222 A- 222 B associated with the entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B that the requestor is attempting to access (i.e., whether the entitlement resource is generally enabled, specifically enabled, etc.).
- the entitlement authorities 206 A- 206 D then return to the SEB 210 a set of entitlement identifiers associated with the authentication token.
- the SEB 210 then compares the entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities 206 A- 206 D against the set of entitlement identifiers 220 A- 220 B associated with the entitlement resources that the requestor has selected to access. This is done by comparator 214 . If there is a positive match identified by comparator 214 for a particular entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B selected by the requestor, the requestor is then provided access to the selected entitlement resource.
- the entitlement resource repository 204 then directs the requestor to a entitlement resource access enablement interface (not shown), where the requestor has the opportunity to obtain access to the desired entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B.
- the entitlement resource access enablement interface may offer a variety of ways for a user to access the entitlement resources, including but not limited to, purchasing a support contract, registering for access, etc.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary process flow for granting a requestor access to a generally entitled entitlement resource, the process flow superimposed over the second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources, shown previously in FIG. 3 .
- the requestor is found to be entitled to access the selected entitlement resource.
- a requestor selects an entitlement resource (e.g., document) to access at the user workstation 202 .
- the entitlement resource 212 A desired by the requestor has an entitlement type 222 A of “general”. Since generally entitled user resources require user registration to access, the requestor is next directed to an authentication module 216 (e.g., sign-on screen), where an authentication token is established if the requester is registered, as shown at step B.
- the registration information is sent to the SEB 210 . If the requestor is not registered, the requestor can pursue registration from the appropriate registration site (not shown) then navigate back to the search results screen (e.g., by pushing the back button on their browser).
- step D since the entitlement resource desired by the requestor has been marked as generally entitled (via entitlement type 222 ), the SEB 210 calls all entitlement authorities 206 , passing the authentication token established at requestor authentication. Each entitlement authority 206 then determines what authority the requester has, and passes the entitlement identifier back to the SEB 210 , as shown at step E. The SEB 210 then compares the entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities 206 against the set of entitlement identifiers 220 associated with the entitlement resources 212 that the requester has selected to access. In this instance, the requestor has been determined by the SEB 210 to have been entitled to the selected entitlement resource, thus the selected entitlement resource 212 is made available to the requester.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary process flow for checking whether a requestor has access to a requested entitlement resource, the process flow superimposed over the second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources, shown previously in FIG. 3 .
- the requestor is found to be not generally entitled to access the selected entitlement resource.
- a user selects an entitlement resource (e.g., document) to access at the user workstation 202 .
- the entitlement solution 212 desired by the requestor has an entitlement type 222 A of “general”. Since generally entitled entitlement resources require user registration to access, the requester is next directed to an authentication module 216 , where an authentication token is established, if the requestor is registered, as shown at step B.
- the registration information is sent to the SEB 210 . If the requester is not registered, the requestor can pursue registration from the appropriate registration site (not shown) then navigate back to the search results screen (e.g., by pushing the back button on their browser).
- step D since the entitlement resource desired by the requestor has been marked as generally entitled (via entitlement type 222 ), the SEB 210 calls all entitlement authorities 206 , passing the authentication token established at requestor authentication. Each entitlement authority 206 then determines what authority the requestor has, and passes the entitlement identifier back to the SEB 210 , as shown at step E. The SEB 210 then compares the entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authorities 206 against the set of entitlement identifiers 220 associated with the entitlement resources 212 that the requestor has selected to access. In this instance, the requestor has been determined by the SEB to not be entitled to the selected entitlement resource. In this instance, the requester is then shown a page listing the user's currently active agreements 213 , shown at step F.
- requestors are then directed to an entitlement resource access enablement interface 230 , where the requestor has the opportunity to obtain access to the desired entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B.
- the entitlement resource access enablement interface 230 offers a variety of ways for a requestor to access the entitlement resources, including but not limited to, purchasing a support contract, registering for access, etc.
- the entitlement resource access enablement interface 230 utilizes the entitlement identifier passed from the entitlement resource repository to present the requestor with one or more potential opportunities to grant access to the requested entitlement resource.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary process flow for determining whether a requestor has authority to access to a specific entitlement resource, the process flow superimposed over the second embodiment of an apparatus/system for managing a set of entitlement resources, shown previously in FIG. 3 .
- a requestor selects an entitlement resource (e.g., document) to access at the user workstation 202 .
- the entitlement resource 212 desired by the requestor has an entitlement type 222 A of “specific”. Since specific entitlement resources require user registration to access, the requester is next directed to an authentication module 216 , where an authentication token is established, if the requestor is registered, as shown at step B.
- the registration information is sent to the SEB 210 . If the requestor is not registered, the requestor can pursue registration from the appropriate registration site (not shown) then navigate back to the search results screen (e.g., by pushing the back button on their browser).
- step D since the entitlement resource desired by the requestor has been marked as having “specific” entitlement (via entitlement type 222 ), the SEB 210 calls only the entitlement authority that authored the document (e.g., element 206 A), passing the authentication token established at requestor authentication. Entitlement authority 206 A then determines what authority the requester has, and passes the entitlement identifier back to the SEB 210 , as shown at step E. The SEB 210 then compares the entitlement identifiers returned by the entitlement authority 206 A against the set of entitlement identifiers 220 associated with the entitlement resources 212 that the requestor has selected to access. If the requestor has been determined by the SEB 210 to have been entitled to the selected entitlement resource, the entitlement resource 212 is made available to the requestor. However, if the requestor has been determined by the SEB 210 to not be entitled to the selected entitlement resource, the requestor is then shown a page listing the requestor's currently active agreements 213 , shown at step F.
- the entitlement resource 212 is then shown a page
- users are then directed to an entitlement resource access enablement interface 230 , where the requestor has the opportunity to obtain access to the desired entitlement resource 212 A- 212 B.
- the entitlement resource access enablement interface 230 offers a variety of ways for a user to access the entitlement resources, including but not limited to, purchasing a support contract, registering for access, etc.
- the entitlement resource access enablement interface 230 utilizes the entitlement identifier passed from the entitlement resource repository to present the user with one or more potential opportunities to grant access to the requested entitlement resource.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram representing a method for managing a set of entitlement resources in accordance with the present invention, shown generally at 700 .
- the method begins at block 702 .
- a set of entitlement resources from multiple resource repositories are converged onto a single entitlement resource repository.
- each of the converged entitlement resources residing within the entitlement resource repository is marked with one or more entitlement identifiers.
- an entitlement request is received from a requestor to access one or more of the entitlement resources residing within the entitlement resource repository.
- an authentication token corresponding to the requestor is passed to the entitlement authorities associated with each of the one or more requested entitlement resources.
- a set of entitlement identifiers associated with the authentication token is created, and if any such entitlement identifiers exist, the set of entitlement identifiers is returned to the entitlement resource repository.
- the method ends.
- signal bearing media examples include, but are not limited to: (i) information permanently stored on non-writable storage media (e.g., read-only memory devices within a computer such as CD-ROM disks readable by a CD-ROM drive); (ii) alterable information stored on writable storage media (e.g., floppy disks within a diskette drive, a CD-R disk, a CD-RW disk, or hard-disk drive); or (iii) information conveyed to a computer by a communications medium, such as through a computer or telephone network, including wireless communications, and specifically includes information downloaded from the Internet and other networks.
