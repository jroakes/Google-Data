Definitions
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting one implementation of an environment for re-messaging with alternative content items based on tracking client device interactions in a computer network environment, according to an illustrative implementation
- the pre-conversion model and the post-conversion model can be of the form f(x 1 , x 2 , . . . x N ), where x 1 , x 2 , . . . x N each represent a SII interaction term for a specified user segment determined using various artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks and deep learning, among others. Each term may take into account exogenous factors, such as time of day, day of week, and weather patterns, among others. As the system accumulates more data about the user, the system can assign the user to segments of finer granularity.
- the model f(x 1 , x 2 , . . . x N ) can be viewed as an approximation of a high-dimensional model representation or a Volterra expansion with 2 N dependencies to account for the cold start problem, namely the lack of sufficient data particular to the user.
- the system can instantiate a pre-conversion model assigning the user to a general user segment parameter, x 1 .
- the system can then track the subsequent user interactions with the advertisement and other content associated with the advertiser, such as click throughs, hover overs, revisits of a website, writing reviews, and physical visits of the user.
- the system can assign ever more granular segments and terms to the user x 2 . . . x N .
- the term x 2 can, for example, represent users that have performed a search query for the advertiser's products.

The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation.
- The present disclosure is generally directed to re-messaging with alternative content items based on the user's evolving interests. The present disclosure described herein relies on a pre-conversion model and post-conversion model to calculate a shopping intent index (SII) for a particular user to determine how and when to provide content items for display.
- Remarketing campaigns are a very effective advertising technique that convinces online consumers to continue their interactions with the advertiser such as purchasing the advertiser's products online. One challenge, however, is that advertisers may not know which of their alternative, related products and services to advertise to already interested consumers. A subset of consumers may continue to be interested in the related products and services, even those of the advertiser after the initial transaction with the advertiser. The pre-conversion model and post-conversion model can leverage user interactions and other information tracked over a multiplicity of users to determine the SII for a particular user. From a psychological perspective, the SII can represent the interest or intent expressed by the user with regards to product or service advertised by the advertiser. From a human-computer interaction perspective, the SII can represent the likelihood or probability of the end user computing device associated with the user interacting again with an advertisement or webpage of the advertiser.
- More specifically, the pre-conversion model and the post-conversion model can be of the form f(x1, x2, . . . xN), where x1, x2, . . . xN each represent a SII interaction term for a specified user segment determined using various artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks and deep learning, among others. Each term may take into account exogenous factors, such as time of day, day of week, and weather patterns, among others. As the system accumulates more data about the user, the system can assign the user to segments of finer granularity. Mathematically, the model f(x1, x2, . . . xN) can be viewed as an approximation of a high-dimensional model representation or a Volterra expansion with 2N dependencies to account for the cold start problem, namely the lack of sufficient data particular to the user.
- Chronologically, when a user first interacts with an advertisement or other content associated with the advertiser, the system can instantiate a pre-conversion model assigning the user to a general user segment parameter, x1. The system can then track the subsequent user interactions with the advertisement and other content associated with the advertiser, such as click throughs, hover overs, revisits of a website, writing reviews, and physical visits of the user. As more and more user interactions from and data about the user are aggregated, the system can assign ever more granular segments and terms to the user x2 . . . xN. The term x2 can, for example, represent users that have performed a search query for the advertiser's products. Finally, when the user converts however defined by the advertiser (e.g., purchase of an advertiser's product) or determined by the system, the system can assign the user to the conversion term xC. To determine conversion influences of the parameters, the system can instantiate a separate model of the form f′(x1′,x2′), where x1′ and x2′ are the respective subsets of user segments as x1 and x2 that have converted. Using these calculations, the system can generate the post-conversion model, f(x1, x2, . . . xC), based on f′(x1′,x2′) and xC.
- Using these terms, the system can generate the SIIs for various interrelated goods, products, and services for the particular user. The related products and services can be obtained from a list of predetermined related products and services or a interrelated product and services graph determined by the system. The system can then rank the related products and services by SII, and select the advertisements for the related products and services with the highest SII. The advertisement can be selected from a interrelated products and services advertisement feed provided by the advertiser. This advertiser may be associated with the initial conversion or may be another advertiser different from the initial conversion.

provider computing devices 115 can include servers or other computing devices operated by a content provider entity to provide content items such as advertisements for display on information resources at the end user computing device 125. The content provided by the contentprovider computing device 115 can include third party content items (e.g., ads) for display on information resources such as a website or web page that includes primary content, e.g. content provided by the contentpublisher computing device 120. The content items can also be displayed on a search results web page. For example, the contentprovider computing device 115 can provide or be the source of ads or other content items for display in content slots of content web pages such as a web page of a company where the primary content of the web page is provided by the company, or for display on a search results landing page provided by a search engine. The content items associated with the contentprovider computing device 115 can be displayed on information resources other than web pages, such as content displayed as part of the execution of an application on a smartphone or other end user computing device 125. - The content
publisher computing devices 120 can include servers or other computing devices operated by a content publishing entity to provide primary content for display via thenetwork 105. For example, the contentpublisher computing device 120 can include a web page operator who provides primary content for display on the web page. The primary content can include content other than that provided by the contentpublisher computing device 120, and the web page can include content slots configured for the display of third party content items (e.g., ads) from the contentprovider computing device 115. For example, the contentpublisher computing device 120 can operate the website of a company and can provide content about that company for display on web pages of the website. The web pages can include content slots configured for the display of third party content items such as ads of the contentprovider computing device 115. In some implementations, the contentpublisher computing device 120 includes a search engine computing device (e.g. server) of a search engine operator that operates a search engine website.

network 105 to display data such as the content provided by the content publisher computing device 120 (e.g., primary web page content or other information resources) and the content provided by the content provider computing device 115 (e.g., third party content items such as ads configured for display in a content slot of a web page). The end user computing device 125, the contentprovider computing device 115, and the contentpublisher computing device 120 can include desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, mobile devices, end user computing devices, consumer computing devices, servers, clients, and other computing devices. The end user computing device 125, the contentprovider computing device 115, and the contentpublisher computing device 120 can include user interfaces such as microphones, speakers, touchscreens, keyboards, pointing devices, a computer mouse, touchpad, or other input or output interfaces. - For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's location), or to control whether or how to receive content from a content server or other data processing system that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content server.
- The
interaction cataloguer module 130, theintent predictor module 135, and the contentitem provider module 140 can include combinations of software and hardware, such as one or more processors configured to execute one or more scripts to: (a) assign an account identifier associated with an end user computing device 125 to a first segment for a pre-conversion model; (b) assign the account identifier to a second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving an interaction from the end user computing device 125; (c) assign the account identifier to a third segment, responsive to receiving a conversion interaction from the end user computing device 125; (d) generate a post-conversion model based on the third segment and the pre-conversion model; (e) determine an intent index for an alternative item based on the post-conversion model; and (f) select a content item associated with the alternative item based on the intent index. - The
data processing system 110 can also include one or more content repositories ordatabases 140. Thedatabases 140 can be local to thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thedatabases 140 can be remote to thedata processing system 110 but can communicate with thedata processing system 110 via thenetwork 105. Thedatabases 140 can include, store, or otherwise contain web page, content items (e.g., advertisements), pre-conversion models for various user segments, post-conversion models for various user segments, intent index data for various user segments and for various items, and advertisement campaign management controls, among others. The pre-conversion models for various user segments, post-conversion models for various user segments, the intent indices for various user segments and the various items, and the advertisement campaign management controls can include those illustratively depicted inFIGS. 2A-2C ,FIG. 3 , andFIGS. 4A-4G . Additional details of the contents of thedatabase 145 will be provided below. - The
interaction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign an account identifier to a first segment for a pre-conversion model. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to the first segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving a first interaction from the client device. An account identifier can include any identifier used to identify a user. For example, the account identifier can include an email, account number, or randomly generated numerical identifier. The account identifier can be associated with one or more end user computing devices 125. The first interaction can be associated with acontent provider 115. For example, the first interaction can include an impression of an advertisement created by thecontent provider 115 shown on a webpage hosted by thecontent publisher 120. The first interaction can also be associated with a first item of thecontent provider 115. The first item can include a product, good, or service, or a plurality thereof, advertised by thecontent provider 115. For example, the first interaction can be associated with a line of headphone sets advertised by a digital audio provider. The first segment can include the general user segment. The general user segment can be stored and accessed from thedatabase 145. For example, the general user segment may be over all users that have had an interaction with thecontent provider 115. - The
interaction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to a second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving a second interaction from the client device. The second segment can include a subset of the first segment. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to determine that the second interaction is one of a plurality of interactions. The plurality of interactions can be specified, predetermined, or otherwise predefined by thecontent provider 115. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to the second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to determining that the second interaction is one of the plurality of interactions. The plurality of interactions can include, for example, mouse-hover over a content item associated with thecontent provider 115, muting an audio or audiovisual content item associated with thecontent provider 115, visits or revisits of a webpage or website of thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120, visits or revisits of a webpage or website containing information about thecontent provider 115, use of search queries containing terms associated with thecontent provider 115, writing reviews about thecontent provider 115 on webpages or websites such as social networking websites, making purchase orders online or offline for products or services associated with thecontent provider 115, and visits of a physical store location associated with thecontent provider 115, among others. The second interaction can also be associated with the first item of thecontent provider 115. The first item can include a product, good, or service, or a plurality thereof, advertised by thecontent provider 115. The second segment can include a subset user segment that may be associated with a particular location identifier, interaction type, device type of end user computing device 125, or applications used on the end user computing device 125, among others. For example, the second segment may define the user segment associated with location identifiers with the zip code 90210 and associated with tablets as the device type of the end user computing devices 125. - The
interaction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to receive account data. The account data can include location identifier of the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier, information inputted by the user associated with the account identifier, and device type or specifications of the end user computing device 125, among others. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to the second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving the account data associated with the account identifier. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to select the second segment from one or more segments for the pre-conversion model based on the account data, responsive to receiving the account data associated with the account identifier. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to the second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to the selection from the one or more segments for the pre-conversion model. - The
interaction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to a third segment, responsive to receiving a third interaction from the end user computing device 125. The third interaction can include a conversion event associated with thecontent provider 115. The third segment can be indicative of the conversion event. The third segment can also include a subset of the first segment or the second segment. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine that the third interaction is a conversion event. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to access a list of predefined conversion events from thedatabase 145. The list of predefined conversion events can be defined by thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120. The list of predefined conversion events can include placement of an order for a product or service associated with thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120, and visit of the physical store location associated with thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120, among others. The list of predefined conversion events can also include a plurality of interactions, including for example, mouse-hover over a content item associated with thecontent provider 115, muting an audio or audiovisual content item associated with thecontent provider 115, visits or revisits of a webpage or website of thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120, visits or revisits of a webpage or website containing information about thecontent provider 115, use of search queries containing terms associated with thecontent provider 115, writing reviews about thecontent provider 115 on webpages or websites such as social networking websites, making purchase orders online or offline for products or services associated with thecontent provider 115, and visits of a physical store location associated with thecontent provider 115, among others. The third interaction can also be associated with the first item of thecontent provider 115. The first item can include a product, good, or service, or a plurality thereof, advertised by thecontent provider 115. The third segment can include a subset user segment that may be associated with a particular location identifier, interaction type, device type of end user computing device 125, or applications used on the end user computing device 125, among others. For example, the third segment may define the user segment associated with location identifiers with the State of California and associated with smartphones as the device type of the end user computing devices 125 that have converted. The list of predefined conversion events can also include interactions determined to have a statistically significant influence on the intent index. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine that the third interaction is a conversion event based on the list of predefined conversion events. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to maintain the pre-conversion model. The pre-conversion model can include one or more interaction terms. Each of the interaction terms can correspond with a respective segment. Each of the interaction terms can include an intent index associated with the particular segment. The pre-conversion model can be implemented using, for example, an artificial neural network. This artificial neural network can include a plurality of input nodes, a plurality of hidden nodes, and a plurality of output nodes. Each input node can correspond to a different user segment and each can have the input of intent index fed back for the respective segment and exogenous factors. Exogenous factors can include, for example, time of day, day of week, holidays, changes in weather patterns, and stock prices, among others. Each output node can correspond to different user segment and output the intent index for the corresponding user segment. The weights for the connections between the nodes can be predefined or adaptively or iteratively tuned based on error propagation. Using the interaction terms, the pre-conversion model can also be implemented using, for example, linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bayesian learning, deep learning, and other statistical machine learning techniques. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to generate a post-conversion model based on the third segment and the pre-conversion model. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to segment, divide, partition, or otherwise limit a first segment subset and a second segment subset. The first segment subset and the second segment subset each can include the subset of the first segment that converted and the subset of the second segment that converted respectively. The first segment subset and the second segment subset each can include the subset of the first segment that have done the same interaction as the third interaction and the subset of the second segment that have done the same interaction as the third interaction respectively. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine, measure, estimate or otherwise calculate a first influence measure for the subset of the first segment that converted and a second influence measure for the subset of the second segment that converted. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine a third interaction term, responsive to assigning the account identifier to the third segment. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to generate the post-conversion model based on the one or more interaction terms. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to generate the post-conversion model based a function of the one or more interaction terms. The intent predictmodule 135 can be configured to determine or otherwise generate the post-conversion model, responsive to receiving a fourth interaction from the end user computing device 125 or responsive to assigning the account identifier to a fourth segment. For example, suppose there are two user segments corresponding to two interactions by the end user computing devices 125 associated with the account identifier prior to the conversion event. In this example, theintent predictor module 135 can determine the statistical influence measures of each of the interaction terms to the intent index. Theintent predictor module 135 can also wait until more interactions from the end user computing device 125 are received to gather more information about the account identifier in order to calculate higher order interaction terms between the two user segments. Theintent predictor module 135 can then determine or generate the post-conversion model based on determining the statistical influence measures of each of the interaction terms to the intent index. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine or attribute which one of the previous interactions lead to the conversion event based on the post conversion model. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to rank the one or more interaction terms of the post-conversion model. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine, select, or otherwise identify the interaction event associated with the interaction term with the highest influence measure as the interaction event that lead to the conversion event. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine the interaction term with the highest influence measure based on an F-Test, T-Test, or any other statistical inference technique. For example, suppose the p-value for the first user segment is 75.3%, for the second user segment is 30.7%, for the third user segment is 32.1%, and for the fourth user segment is 3.8%. In this example, theintent predictor module 135 can rank the interaction terms and determine that the fourth interaction term corresponding to the fourth user segment is the one with the highest influence measure. Theintent predictor module 135 can also identify the interaction event associated with the fourth user segment and the interaction term as the one that lead to the conversion event. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine an intent index for the account identifier based on the post-conversion model. From a psychological perspective, the intent index can also represent the interest or intent expressed by the user associated with the account identifier with regards to product or service of thecontent provider 115 or thecontent provider 115 itself. From a human-computer interaction perspective, the intent index can represent the likelihood or probability of the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier interacting again with a content item associated with thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120. The intent index can be a numerical measure, such as an integer or decimal, or an enumerated score. For example, the intent index can be a floating point between 0 and 1. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to generate the intent index based on a statistical aggregation, weighted sum, or otherwise amalgamation of the one or more interaction terms of the post-conversion model. For example, at the sampling time, after having generated the post-conversion model, theintent predictor module 135 can calculate the intent index as a weighted sum of the intent indices of the assigned user segments for the account identifier. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to store, categorize, or otherwise classify the account identifier to an interest cluster based on the intent index. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to store the account identifier into one or more clusters based on the interest index and the one or more thresholds of the respective interest cluster. Each intent cluster can indicate a level of interest as measured by the intent index. Each intent cluster can include a threshold or range of intent indices categorized under the respective intent cluster. For example, at the sampled time, an intent index between 0 and 0.1 can be categorized as a “low” interest cluster, between 0.1 to 0.7 can be categorized as a “medium” interest cluster, and between 0.7 to 1 can be categorized as “high” interest cluster. - The content
item provider module 140 can be configured to determine a content item serving parameter based on the interest cluster. The contentitem provider module 140 can be configured to select a content item based on the intent index. The content item selected can be associated with thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120, or any other entity associated with either thecontent provider 115 or thecontent publisher 120. The content item serving parameter can include a frequency, a time frame, and a size at which to provide the content item for display at the end user computing device 125. The content item serving parameter can specify one or more types of the content item to provide for display at the end user computing device 125. One or more types of the content item can include a text, static, animated, video, and audiovisual advertisement, among others. For example, suppose account identifier “r312a8K” has a computed intent index of 0.883 for bicycles made by thecontent provider 115 “JKL, Inc.” and is categorized into the high interest cluster. Based on the categorized interest cluster, the contentitem provider module 140 can specify that an advertisement for JKL, Inc.'s bicycles be displayed at the end user computing device 125 of account identifier “r312a8K” once every 5 hours between 9:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekends as one of a full screen interstitial advertisement or large video advertisement. The contentitem provider module 140 can be configured to provide the content item for display at the end user computing device 125 according to the content item serving parameter. - Referring to
FIGS. 2A-2C ,FIGS. 2A- 2C show graphs 200A-C depicting examples of intent index trajectories of user segments for an item, according to illustrative implementations. InFIGS. 2A-2C , the vertical index is intent index and the horizontal index is time starting from T0. The time T0 may represent time at which the first interaction by the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier was logged. The trajectories plotted are for various user segments.Trajectory 205A represents the intent index over time foruser segment 1, or the general user segment.Trajectory 205B represents the intent index over time foruser segment 2.Trajectory 205C represents the intent index over time foruser segment 3. Over time, as theinteraction cataloguer module 130 and theintent predictor module 135 acquires more information about the account identifier, intent index trajectories of granular, finer resolution can be measured, predicted, or otherwise determined. For the purposes of presentation, the trajectory indexes for 205A-205C have been plotted fully to time t. - Referring now to
FIG. 2A ,FIG. 2A depicts theintent index graph 200A depicting when theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can first assign the account identifier to the first segment for the pre-conversion model at time T0. At time T0, the account identifier is assigned to the general user population, since theinteraction cataloguer module 130 has no prior information about the account identifier. In addition, theintent predictor module 135 can have measure, predict, or otherwise determine thetrajectory 205A over time t for the general user population. In this illustration, astrajectory 205A represents the intent index for products or services of thecontent provider 115 or thecontent provider 115 itself over the general user population, thetrajectory 205A is generally flat throughout time t. Thetrajectory 205A may vary due to exogenous factors such as time of year that may affect the general user population. - Referring now to
FIG. 2B ,FIG. 2B represents when theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can first assign the account identifier to the second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving one or more interactions from the end user computing device 125 at time T1. At time T1, theinteraction cataloguer module 130 has received a user interaction from the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier and the account identifier is assigned to theuser segment 2. In addition, theintent predictor module 135 can measure, predict, or otherwise determinetrajectory 205B over time t foruser segment 2. In this illustration, since theinteraction cataloguer module 130 andintent predictor module 135 has acquired more detailed, granular information about account identifier anduser segment 2 compared to the general user population,trajectory 205B is generally more uneven and finer detailed. Moreover, sinceuser segment 2 may have more of interest than the general user segment, as indicated by more interactions byuser segment 2 with content items or webpages associated with thecontent provider 115, theintent index trajectory 205B is higher thantrajectory 205A. - Referring now to
FIG. 2C ,FIG. 2C represents when theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can first assign the account identifier to the third segment, responsive to receiving a third interaction that is a conversion event from the end user computing device 125 at time T2. At time T2, the account identifier is also assigned touser segment 3.User segment 3 can include user segments or populations have converted. The conversion event may be defined by thecontent provider 115 or determined by theintent predictor module 135 based on statistical inference techniques. Furthermore, at time T2, theintent predictor module 135 can measure, predict, or otherwise determinetrajectory 205C over time t foruser segment 3. In this illustration, since theinteraction cataloguer module 130 and theintent predictor module 135 has acquired more detailed, granular information about account identifier anduser segment 3 compared to theuser segment 2 and the general user population,trajectory 205C is generally even more uneven and finer detailed. Moreover, sinceuser segment 3 may have more of interest thanuser segment 2 or the general user segment, as indicated by more interactions byuser segment 3 with content items or webpages associated with the content provider, theintent index trajectory 205C is higher thantrajectory trajectory 205C, the contentitem provider module 140 can determine content item serving parameters. For example, the contentitem provider module 140 can specify that a higher frequency of providing the content item for display at the end user computing device 125 around the time thetrajectory 205C reaches peak value after T2 and adjust accordingly after the peak. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to identify or otherwise find a second item. The second item may or may not be associated or otherwise provided by thesame content provider 115 that provided first item, as the second item may be provided by acontent provider 115 different from that of the first item. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to access a predefined taxonomy list or a interrelated item area graph stored at thedatabase 145. For example, the predefined taxonomy list can specify that the item “handbags” may be related to the item “sports shoes.” Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to generate the interrelated item area graph based on collaborative filtering of one or more items and time of the one or more interactions for each item. The interrelated item area graph can represent the chronological co-occurrence of conversion events. The interrelated item area graph can track conversion events on the one or more items made within a predefined timeframe. For example, the interrelated item area graph can track the relationship among the purchases for related items, such as handbags and shoes, that occur within a day. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to identify or otherwise select the second item based on the conversion event. Theintent predictor module 135 can identify the second item based on a webpage of thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120. For example, theintent predictor module 135 can select the second item by applying natural language processing algorithm such as semantic analysis, information extraction, keyword extraction, and automated summarization, among others on the landing page of the advertisement. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine an intent index for the second item for the account identifier based on the post-conversion model. The post-conversion model may have been generated for the first item. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine the intent index for the second item for each of the segments associated with the account identifier. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine the statistical influence for one or more interaction terms for the intent index for the second item. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to generate the intent index based on a statistical aggregation, weighted sum, or otherwise a function of the one or more interaction terms of the post-conversion model for the second item. For example, suppose the user has converted by purchasing an airplane ticket to a popular holiday destination, the first item for thecontent provider 115. Further suppose that the account identifier for the user has been assigned to the general user segment, the user segment that visited the webpage of the tourism board of the destination, and the user segment that made a purchase order for the airplane ticket on the webpage of thecontent provider 115. In this example, if the second item were a local museum in the popular holiday destination, theintent predictor module 135 can determine the intent indices for the local museum for each of the user segments that the account identifier has been assigned to using machine learning algorithms. Theintent predictor module 135 can then determine the determine intent index for the account identifier by aggregating or amalgamating the intent indices for the local museum. Theintent predictor module 135 can generate the intent index for the second item for the account identifier even before conversion based on the post-conversion model generated for the first item. - The
intent predictor module 135 can be configured to select the second item based on the intent indices for one or more items. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine the intent indices for each of the one or more items. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine the intent index for the respective item based on the post-conversion model for the respective item. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to rank the one or more items based on the respective intent index. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to select the item with the highest intent index as the second item. - The content
item provider module 140 can be configured to select a content item accessed from a content item database based on the second item. The content item can be associated with the second item. The content item database can includedatabase 145 or a database associated with thecontent provider 115 orcontent publisher 120. The content item database accessed for the second item can include a database different from the one accessed for the first item. The contentitem provider module 140 can be configured to identify asecond content provider 115 based on one or more user segments, such as the first user segments, the second user segment, and the third user segment. Thesecond content provider 115 can be different from thefirst content provider 115. Thesecond content provider 115 may share the same or similar user segments as thefirst content provider 115. - The
interaction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to assign the account identifier to a fourth segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving a fourth interaction from the end user computing device 125. Theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can be configured to generate the post-conversion based on the fourth interaction. The fourth segment can include a subset of the first segment. Subsequent to determining the intent index for the second item, theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine that the intent index for a third item of the one or more items may be greater than the intent index for the second item based on the post-conversion model. Theintent predictor module 135 can be configured to determine that the intent index for the third item may be greater than the intent index for the second item by a predefined threshold. The contentitem provider module 140 can be configured to select another content item associated with the third item, responsive to determining that the intent index for the third item is greater than the intent index for the second item. For example, suppose the second item originally selected by theintent predictor module 135 was a lawnmower advertised by thecontent provider 115. Further suppose that the interactions received by theinteraction cataloguer module 130 thereafter were with websites for waterskies and using the updated post-conversion model, theintent predictor module 135 has determined that the intent index for waterskies is greater than the intent index for lawnmowers. In this example, the contentitem provider module 140 can select content items for waterskies to provide for display at the end user computing device 125. - Referring to
FIG. 3 ,FIG. 3 shows a graph depicting an example of intent index trajectories of items, according to an illustrative implementation. InFIG. 3 , the vertical index is intent index and the horizontal index is time starting from T0. Time T0 represents time at which the first interaction by the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier was logged. Time TC represents the time at which the conversion event by the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier was logged or occurred. The trajectories plotted are for various items.Trajectory 305A represents the intent index over time foritem 1, or the general user segment.Trajectory 305B represents the intent index over time foritem 2. Trajectory 305 represents the intent index over time foritem 3. In this example, theintent predictor module 135 may have already calculated theintent index trajectories 305A-305C. Theintent predictor module 135 can then select theitem 2 astrajectory 305B at time of conversion, TC. Thecontent item provider 140 can select and provide for display at the end user computing device 125 an advertisement foritem 2. After some time T1, theinteraction cataloguer module 130 can receive more interactions from the end user computing device 125 associated with the account identifier, and theintent predictor module 135 can determine that the intent index foritem 3 may be greater than theintent index item 2 based on the newly received intent indices. As seen inFIG. 3 , the intent index trajectories foritem 2 305B may decrease and be over taken by the intent index trajectory foritem 3 305C. At this time, the contentitem provider module 140 can select and provide for display at the end user computing device 125 advertisements foritem 3. - In addition,
data processing system 110 can be configured to provide an advertisement campaign management user interface for display for thecontent provider 115,content publisher 120, or the end user computing device 125. Using the advertisement campaign management user interface, the content provider 115 (e.g., advertiser) can adjust the advertisement campaign in accordance with the average intent index for particular user segments or products or services advertised by thecontent provider 115. The advertisement campaign management interface can be stored at thedatabase 145. An example of an advertisement campaign management interface can be seen inFIGS. 4A-4G . - Referring to
FIGS. 4A-4G ,FIGS. 4A-4G show displays depicting an advertisementcampaign manager interface 400 including graphs of intent index trajectories, according to illustrative implementations. Thecampaign management interface 400 can display to thecontent provider 115 the average intent index trajectories for various user segments, thereby, for example, allowing thecontent provider 115 to specify the onset and offset times of the remarketing campaign. Using thecampaign management interface 400, thecontent provider 115 can examine or analyze the intent index trajectories for a selected user segment. InFIG. 4A , depicted is thecampaign management interface 400 with the predicted averageintent index trajectory 405A for user segment U. Using the average intent index trajectories, thecampaign management interface 400 can allow thecontent provider 115 to define the onset and offset of the remarketing campaign. InFIG. 4B , depicted is thecampaign management interface 400 with theonset 410A and offset 410B set on the predictedaverage intent trajectory 405A by thecontent provider 115 for the remarketing campaign for user segment U. Thecontent provider 115 can also set or otherwise define the onsets and offsets of the remarketing campaign for particular user segments or subsets of user segments. InFIG. 4C , depicted is thecampaign management interface 400 with predictedaverage intent trajectories campaign management interface 400, thecontent provider 115 can set the onset of the remarketing campaign for user segments U and V at 415A. Thecontent provider 115 can set different offsets for the remarketing campaign at 415B and 415C for user segments U and V respectively. - The
campaign management interface 400 can also allow thecontent provider 115 to set the content item serving parameters.

The data processing system can assign the account identifier to the first segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving a first interaction from the client device. An account identifier can include any identifier used to identify a user. For example, the account identifier can include an email, account number, or randomly generated numerical identifier. The account identifier can be associated with one or more end user computing devices. The first interaction can be associated to a content provider. For example, the first interaction can include an impression of an advertisement created by the content provider shown on a webpage hosted by the content publisher. The first segment can include the general user segment. The general user segment can be stored and accessed from the database. For example, the general user segment may be over all users that have had an interaction with the content provider.
- The data processing system can assign the account identifier to a second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to receiving a second interaction from the client device (ACT 510). The second segment can include a subset of the first segment. The data processing system can be configured to determine that the second interaction is one of a plurality of interactions. The plurality of interactions can be specified, predetermined, or otherwise predefined by the content provider. The data processing system can be configured to assign the account identifier to the second segment for the pre-conversion model, responsive to determining that the second interaction is one of the plurality of interactions. The plurality of interactions can include, for example, mouse-hover over a content item associated with the content provider, muting an audio or audiovisual content item associated with the content provider, visits or revisits of a webpage or website of the content provider or content publisher, visits or revisits of a webpage or website containing information about the content provider, use of search queries containing terms associated with the content provider, writing reviews about the content provider on webpages or websites such as social networking websites, making purchase orders online or offline for products or services associated with the content provider, and visits of a physical store location associated with the content provider, among others. The second segment can define a subset user segment that may be associated with a particular location identifier, interaction type, device type of, or applications used on the, among others.

Each output node can correspond to different user segment and output the intent index for the corresponding user segment. The weights for the connections between the nodes can be predefined or adaptively or iteratively tuned based on error propagation. Using the interaction terms, the pre-conversion model can also be implemented using, for example, linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bayesian learning, deep learning, and other statistical machine learning techniques.

The data processing system can generate the post-conversion model based a function of the one or more interaction terms. The data processing system can determine or otherwise generate the post-conversion model, responsive to receiving a fourth interaction from the or responsive to assigning the account identifier to a fourth segment. For example, suppose there are two user segments corresponding to two interactions by the end user computing devices associated with the account identifier prior to the conversion event. In this example, the data processing system can determine the statistical influence measures of each of the interaction terms to the intent index. The data processing system can also wait until more interactions from the are received to gather more information about the account identifier in order to calculate higher order interaction terms between the two user segments. The data processing system can then determine or generate the post-conversion model based on determining the statistical influence measures of each of the interaction terms to the intent index.

The data processing system can rank the one or more interaction terms of the post-conversion model. The data processing system can determine, select, or otherwise identify the interaction event associated with the interaction term with the highest influence measure as the interaction event that lead to the conversion event. The data processing system can determine the interaction term with the highest influence measure based on an F-Test, T-Test, or any other statistical inference technique. For example, suppose the p-value for the first user segment is 75.3%, for the second user segment is 30.7%, for the third user segment is 32.1%, and for the fourth user segment is 3.8%. In this example, the data processing system can rank the interaction terms and determine that the fourth interaction term corresponding to the fourth user segment is the one with the highest influence measure. The data processing system can also identify the interaction event associated with the fourth user segment and the interaction term as the one that lead to the conversion event.
- The data processing system can determine an intent index for the account identifier based on the post-conversion model (ACT 525). From a psychological perspective, the intent index can also represent the interest or intent expressed by the user associated with the account identifier with regards to product or service of the content provider or the content provider itself. From a human-computer interaction perspective, the intent index can represent the likelihood or probability of the associated with the account identifier interacting again with a content item associated with the content provider or content publisher. The intent index can be a numerical measure, such as an integer or decimal, or an enumerated score. For example, the intent index can be a floating point between 0 and 1. The data processing system can generate the intent index based on a statistical aggregation, weighted sum, or otherwise amalgamation of the one or more interaction terms of the post-conversion model. For example, at the sampling time, after having generated the post-conversion model, the data processing system can calculate the intent index as a weighted sum of the intent indices of the assigned user segments for the account identifier.
- The data processing system can store, categorize, or otherwise classify the account identifier to an interest cluster based on the intent index (ACT 530). The data processing system can store the account identifier into one or more clusters based on the interest index and the one or more thresholds of the respective interest cluster. Each intent cluster can indicate a level of interest as measured by the intent index. Each intent cluster can include a threshold or range of intent indices categorized under the respective intent cluster. For example, at the sampled time, an intent index between 0 and 0.1 can be categorized as a “low” interest cluster, between 0.1 to 0.7 can be categorized as a “medium” interest cluster, and between 0.7 to 1 can be categorized as “high” interest cluster.
- The data processing system can determine a content item serving parameter based on the interest cluster (ACT 535). The content item serving parameter can include a frequency, a time frame, and a size at which to provide the content item for display at the. The content item serving parameter can specify one or more types of the content item to provide for display at the. One or more types of the content item can include a text, static, animated, video, and audiovisual advertisement, among others. For example, suppose account identifier “r312a8K” has a computed intent index of 0.883 for bicycles made by the content provider “JKL, Inc.” and is categorized into the high interest cluster. Based on the categorized interest cluster, the data processing system can specify that the advertisement for JKL, Inc.'s bicycles be displayed at the of account identifier “r312a8K” once every 5 hours between 9:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekends as one of a full screen interstitial advertisement or large video advertisement. The data processing system can select a content item based on the intent index (ACT 540). The content item selected can be associated with the content provider or content publisher, or any other entity associated with either the content provider or the content publisher. The data processing system can provide the content item for display at the according to the content item serving parameter (ACT 545).

interaction cataloguer module 130, theintent predictor module 135, or the contentitem provider module 140 can include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, systems, computing devices, or processors. - A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs (e.g., components of the data processing system 110) to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatuses can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- The subject matter described herein can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system such as
system 100 orsystem 700 can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network (e.g., the network 105). The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server. - While operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations are required to be performed. Actions described herein can be performed in a different order.
- The separation of various system components does not require separation in all implementations, and the described program components can be included in a single hardware or software product. For example, the
interaction cataloguer module 130, theintent predictor module 135, the contentitem provider module 140 can be a single module, a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or part of an online content item placement system. - Having now described some illustrative implementations, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example. In particular, although many of the examples presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, those acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to accomplish the same objectives. Acts, elements and features discussed in connection with one implementation are not intended to be excluded from a similar role in other implementations or implementations.
- The phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including” “comprising” “having” “containing” “involving” “characterized by” “characterized in that” and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter, equivalents thereof, and additional items, as well as alternate implementations consisting of the items listed thereafter exclusively. In one implementation, the systems and methods described herein consist of one, each combination of more than one, or all of the described elements, acts, or components.
- Any references to implementations or elements or acts of the systems and methods herein referred to in the singular may also embrace implementations including a plurality of these elements, and any references in plural to any implementation or element or act herein may also embrace implementations including only a single element. References in the singular or plural form are not intended to limit the presently disclosed systems or methods, their components, acts, or elements to single or plural configurations. References to any act or element being based on any information, act or element may include implementations where the act or element is based at least in part on any information, act, or element.
- Any implementation disclosed herein may be combined with any other implementation or embodiment, and references to “an implementation,” “some implementation,” “an alternate implementation,” “various implementation,” “one implementation” or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation may be included in at least one implementation or embodiment. Such terms as used herein are not necessarily all referring to the same implementation. Any implementation may be combined with any other implementation, inclusively or exclusively, in any manner consistent with the aspects and implementations disclosed herein.
- References to “or” may be construed as inclusive so that any terms described using “or” may indicate any of a single, more than one, and all of the described terms.
- Where technical features in the drawings, detailed description or any claim are followed by reference signs, the reference signs have been included to increase the intelligibility of the drawings, detailed description, and claims. Accordingly, neither the reference signs nor their absence have any limiting effect on the scope of any claim elements.
- The systems and methods described herein may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the characteristics thereof. The foregoing implementations are illustrative rather than limiting of the described systems and methods. Scope of the systems and methods described herein is thus indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are embraced therein.
