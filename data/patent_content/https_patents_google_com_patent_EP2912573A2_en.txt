- Users may be able to receive help on certain topics from their most qualified friends, while searching the web. Users are reminded that they can ask questions of their friends, not just the web. This may be particularly useful when a user is looking for information that is hard to obtain through web searches, such as opinions, personal stores, collective opinions or personal accounts.
- the advantages may also include enabling users to get answers to difficult questions more easily and quickly by routing the users' questions to their friends.
- User's queries regarding certain topics are thus routed to user's friends who, according to various processes disclosed herein, are identified by the system as having knowledge that is pertinent to the queried topic.
- An additional advantage of an aspect of the disclosed technology is that a user's friends who are identified based on their personal online activity are not disclosed to the user as an expert on the queried topic until the user's friend decides that he or she wishes to be disclosed and chooses to respond to the user's query. The friend's identity and personal online activity are therefore kept private, until the user's friend wishes to share his or her identity and expertise.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an exemplary system for routing queries.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process for routing queries.
- FIG. 3 conceptually illustrates a diagram of an example graphic user interfaces from which a query may be routed to a contact associated with the user.
- FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates an example of system 400 for routing queries.
- FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some aspects of the subject technology are implemented.
- Quality information such as the most relevant or interesting opinions about a particular topic may, in fact, be that, from people with whom the user is associated or affiliated in some way. For example, opinions of people associated with the user at a social networking site may be useful and interesting to a user because of the pre-existing relationship and, perhaps, common values.
- a user searching the web may contemporaneously ask his personal contacts for help on a topic the user is researching.
- the user searches the web and reviews search results returned by a browser, the user is provided with a user interface element such as a text box into which the user may type a question directed to one or more contacts associated with the user.
- a query may be received at a system by user entry at a graphic user interface for routing queries to contacts.
- a query may be received from the web browser search box when the user enters the search query at the time the user searches the web.
- the query may automatically be populated by the system in a graphic user interface for routing queries to contacts.
- a query may also be received from a user at a web browser or other online account's search box and processed according to the methods disclosed herein.
- Contacts associated with the user may include the user's contacts at a social networking site, contacts from the user's email list, a user's followers at an online blogging service, or other contacts associated with the user.
- contacts who are able to help the user on the topic of the query are identified.
- Contacts may be identified based on their public or personal online activity.
- Contacts are identified when it is determined that the contact's online activity data contains information that is relevant to the user's query and that the contact may be able to help the user or respond to the user's query. For example, a contact's browsing or posting history may be used for determinations regarding whether the contact may help with a query.
- a contact is identified based on his or her public online activity, the contact is presented to the user in a list of recommended contacts, from which the user may select one or more contacts for responding to the user' query.
- Selected contacts receive a public notification that they may be able to answer the user's question.
- the public notification may include, but is not limited to, posting the query to the contact's online account, such as, for example, a social networking site.
- social networking site encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, an online service, platform or site that focuses on building and reflecting social associations and interactions among users.
- Users of a social networking site may create social associations with one another (e.g., identify other users as connections).
- Such user associations may be defined on a user-to-user basis, or as a group of users associated through membership within a group.
- the user associations may be symmetrical or asymmetrical.
- the user's query may be published in a web browser or an online blogging service.
- the contact may then type his or her answer in the same account where the query was published.
- the query may be published in the social network streams of the one or more selected contacts.
- the query may be published as a special kind of social network post.
- the selected contact may answer the published query by posting a comment in the post's comment string.
- the query may be sent along with the notification to the selected contacts.
- the notification may be displayed to the contact in a graphic user interface of an online account at which the user is logged in.
- the online account may include but is not limited to, a social networking site, a web browser, an online blogging service or the like.
- the public online activity that may be relevant to identifying contacts for responding to the user's query includes the contact's public social network content, such as posts, photos, links, online activity, or public profile data.
- the contacts may be associated with the user through, for example, a social network, or be selected from the user's email contact list.
- another category of contacts is identified by the system, but those contacts' identity is not disclosed to the user until such contact agrees to answer the user's query.
- Such contacts are referred to herein as "anonymous contacts.”
- Anonymous contacts are not openly recommended to the user, to help safeguard the anonymous contacts' privacy.
- the anonymous contacts are associated with the user, but they are selected based on their personal online activity, rather than public online activity. Relevant personal online activity that is used to identify anonymous contacts may include private social network posts, web browsing history, or privately shared photos, for example.
- the contact is automatically notified of the user's query via a private notification.
- the notification may include the user's query.
- the query and notification may be sent to the identified contact via a private message at a social networking site or another online account such as a web browser.
- the user is not aware of the private notifications to the anonymous contacts.
- Anonymous contacts are not known by the user until the anonymous contact answers the user's query and agrees to have his identity disclosed.
- private notifications to anonymous contacts may include a request for authorization to provide the contact's answer to the user. Once the authorization is received, the answer may be published in the contact's social network stream, the user's social network stream or another online account of the user.
- the user may also independently select and add contacts whose help is desired.
- the user's question is then published in the one or more independently selected contacts' social network streams or another online account such as a web browser, and the independently selected contacts receive a notification that the user has asked them a question. Any contact may opt out of receiving questions from other users.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network environment which provides for routing queries.

- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process 200 for routing a query.
- a query is received at the system.
- the query may be entered by a user at a client device, during, for example, a web browsing session or in another online environment.
- the query may be entered at a graphic user element such as search box and may consist of free-form text, images, links, photographs or other electronic content.
- the received query may be the same query that was entered by the user for the web browsing session.
- the received query may also be a new query that was entered at a graphic user interface for routing queries to contacts.
- the query may be entered after the search results for the web browsing session have been returned by the web browser. Or, the query may automatically be generated by the system based on the user's last search in the web browsing history.
- the received query is categorized into one or more query topics.
- Various known language and image processing techniques may be employed to categorize the received query into one or more query topics.
- Query topics may also be generated by the system in response to a received query and presented for selection to the user. The user may be provided with an option to approve a system-generated query topics.
- contacts associated with the user are identified for responding to the received query at block 204.
- the contacts are identified based on the contacts' public online activity or private online activity.
- the contacts may be separated into a first set of contacts and a second set of contacts, based on the kind of online activity that is used.
- a first set of contacts for responding to the received query may be identified based on public online activity.
- a second set of recommended contacts may be identified for responding to the received query based on private online activity.
- the public online activity that may be relevant to identifying contacts for responding to the user's query includes, but is not limited to, a contact's public social network content, such as posts, photos, links, online activity, or public profile data.
- Private online activity may include, but is not limited to, private social network posts, web browsing history, or privately shared photos, for example.
- the various types of online activity are analyzed with respect to the received query and the query topics. For example, text processing techniques may be implemented to analyze a particular online activity of a contact to determine whether the activity relates to the query and the query topics. Image processing may also be done to determine whether a particular online activity of a contact relates to a query and the query topics. Sentiment analysis may also be performed to better identify an online activity that relates to the query. Contacts whose online activity relates to the query and the query topics are thus identified.
- identified contacts may be filtered based on additional parameters such as geography, affinity scores, frequency of communication, or other factors. That is, contacts who are geographically closer to a user may be preferable when the user is searching for local information. Also, contacts with whom the user interacts frequently may be deemed preferable to contacts who rarely interact with the user. Contacts who appear to be closer connected to the user and have a higher affinity score may be rated higher than other contacts. There may also be a category of contacts who are deemed "global experts" who may be suggested to the user even when they are not associated with the user at a social networking site.
- a global expert may be suggested to the user when the global expert is knowledgeable in the query topic, as indicated by the global expert's history of responding to other users on the query topic or similar topics.
- Global experts may be suggested whether the expert is known or unknown to the user, when the level of expertise on a given query topic high and such suggestion may be beneficial to the user.
- Global experts may also be suggested when not enough contacts who are associated with the user are identified or when the level of expertise among the contacts associated with the user appears low.
- a list of recommended contacts identified based on their public online activity is provided to the user.
- the user may select from the list of recommended contacts one or more contacts to whom the user wishes to send the query.
- the user's selection of contacts from the list of recommended contacts is received.
- a public notification is transmitted to each of the contacts selected by the user.
- the notification may include the received query.
- Notifying a contact may include, but is not limited to, providing the transmitted public notification for display in a social network stream of each of the recommended contacts selected by the user from the list of recommended contacts.
- the notification may also be provided in another online account at which the contact is logged in.
- a notification may appear on a web browser screen when the contact is logged in at a web browser that is associated with the same ID as the social networking site at which the user and contact are connected. Any online account that is associated with a selected contact and shares the same ID with a social networking site at which the user and the contact are connected, may receive the notification.
- a private notification is automatically transmitted to each of the contacts identified based on private online activity.
- Such contacts are referred to herein as anonymous contacts.
- the notification to the anonymous contacts may include the received query.
- the user is not aware of the anonymous contacts receiving such private notifications. Only when an anonymous contact has indicated that he or she wishes to answer the user's query and to have his or her identity disclosed to the user, does the user learn about the anonymous contact having received the user's query.
- private notifications to anonymous contacts may include a request for authorization to provide the contact's answer to the user. Once the authorization is received, the answer may be published in the contact's social network stream, the user's social network stream or another online account of the user.
- One or more contacts identified based on private or public online activity may respond the user's query, and the response may be provided for display in, for example, a social network stream of the user, an online account associated with the user or the social network stream of the identified contact
