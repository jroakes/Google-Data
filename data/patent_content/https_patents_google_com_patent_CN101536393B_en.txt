The Turbo decoding
As discussed above, be used for the SDMA of IEEE802.16e system or disturb the current method that suppresses only to use frequency pilot sign.If the frequency pilot sign on specific just in time conflicts with the pilot frequency sequence of interference signal or reverse pilot sequence, then can't separate interference signal from desired signal.This will make the performance of whole receiver descend.In order to simplify and to be without loss of generality, least mean-square error only is discussed is disturbed inhibition (MMSE) to disturb inhibition as an example of the present invention.Yet the present invention can easily expand to other technologies.
As discussed above, current receiver utilizes conventional aerial array to be used for the SDMA of IEEE802.16e system or disturbs and suppress.Disturbing the purpose that suppresses is to find N antenna weight, to be applied to each antenna branch and then composite signal to be delivered to channel decoder after FFT.For instance, suppose that two users share identical piece jump pattern in having the sector of SDMA.For MMSE, be the solution of following formula about user 1 combining weights:
W(k,b)＝argmin{E|W
H(k,b)Y(k,b)-X
1(k,b)|

Wherein k and b are respectively applied to tone index and OFDMA notation index; (k b) is N * 1 vector of the tone k of OFDMA symbol b to W; X
1(k, b) be current be required user's user's 1 frequency pilot sign; (k b) is N * 1 vector of representing respectively the signal that receives from N antenna to Y.Under the situation of normalization data and pilot tone, that is, and for all users, E|X

Here, H

2(k b) is user 1 and the user's 2 of N antenna branch channel estimating, and σ

1(k, b) and H
2Therefore (k, b), if two users have identical pilot frequency sequence, if perhaps negative sequence that pilot frequency sequence is another pilot frequency sequence in the piece, then this piece can not decompose at user 1 and user 2.
Can see, for each tone in each user's the piece and OFDMA symbol, have different MMSE combining weights potentially.This means the intensive calculating for the interference inhibition of SDMA.For trading off between complexity and performance, can determine identical MMSE weight for all tones in the piece or all OFDMA symbols, even each piece is only determined a weight.
An advantage of the present invention is that the data recovered symbol is used as pilot tone, reduces interference between a plurality of users with iteration.In other words, thus the antenna technology that the present invention has reduced by routine can't make a plurality of users separate the probability that causes the interference between the user.Another advantage of the present invention is, than recodification, by directly generating all yards position from the turbo decoder of revising, has limited wrong propagation.
For example, conventional method makes decoded information bit by the channel encoder identical with encoder in the transmitter, is used for data symbol and recovers required all yards position to rebuild.This is called as the recodification technology.This is acceptable for convolution code, but the turbo sign indicating number needs more consideration.Because the component code such as the turbo sign indicating number of the CTC among the 802.16e is the recursive convolution sign indicating number with the infinite impulse response that is associated with encoder, therefore any signal error in decoded information bit may cause a plurality of mistakes in the recodification bit sequence, this so that cause a plurality of mistakes in data symbol.Because this mistake propagation effect the invention provides a kind of turbo decoder 314(Fig. 3), in order to directly generate all yards position to avoid recodification from decoder 314, make extra calculating to ignore simultaneously.
Actual turbo decoding is made of grid search, and this grid search makes the error probability minimum of the information bit of given receiving sequence, and its also provide the information bit of given receiving sequence be 1 or-1(is corresponding to binary digit 0 and 1) probability.In decoding program, the log-likelihood ratio of each information bit (LLR) is calculated as

Receiver
Fig. 3 is the diagram block diagram that comprises the OFDM receiver 300 of novel all yards position (allcode bits) turbo decoder 314 according to an embodiment of the invention.In one embodiment, receiver 300 can reside in Wireless Telecom Equipment 204,206 or base station/site controller in.In one embodiment, receiver 300 comprises pretreatment module 302, and this pretreatment module 302 comprises symbol time block 304 and one or more fast Fourier transform (FFT) module 306,308,310.In one embodiment, receiver 300 can also comprise that demodulator 330, position de-interleaving block 312, all yards position turbo decoder 314, decision threshold module 316, position interleaving block 318, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbol recover module 320, channel estimation module 322 and antenna weight computing module 324.In one embodiment, each mutual communicative couplings in these assemblies.Should be appreciated that the computer program that use is carried out in suitable digital signal processor, one or more discrete component, one or more programmable logic device or its any combination, can realize various assemblies and/or the subsystem of receiver 300.
In one embodiment, receiver 300 comprises at least two nested loops.First loop 326 that is called as turbo decoding loop can refer to as the iteration turbo decoding that is realized by turbo decoder 314 to be handled.Second loop 328 that is called as joint demodulation-decoding loop is characterised in that the feedback processing level that the forward direction that comprises demodulator 330, position de-interleaving block 312, turbo decoder 314 is handled level and comprised decision threshold module 316, position interleaving block 318, qam symbol recovery module 320, channel estimation module 322 and antenna weight computing module 324.In one embodiment, position interleaving block 318 receives signal from turbo decoder 314, and qam symbol recovery module 320 can be with signal guide channel estimation module 322 and antenna weight computing module 324.If the LLR of specific data or parity bit surpasses threshold value, then it is used to make the data constellation degeneracy, this means may selecting of the constellation symbol of dwindling transmission.
In case eliminated some constellation symbol and selected owing to causing from the information with the high decoded data of putting letter or parity bit, then selected the constellation point that may put close to the residue of soft receiving symbol.This decoding constellation point and soft receiving symbol are sent to channel estimation module 322 and antenna weight computing module 324.Institute's data recovered and parity character produce channel estimating at its character position separately together with frequency pilot sign, and these channel estimating formed channel estimating augmented matrix H (k, b).(k is that channel estimating by each antenna branch of each user of tone k and OFDMA symbol b constitutes b) to H.(k, solution b) can be illustrated as the weight matrix W by module 324 calculating

1(k, b) and H
2Therefore (k, b), if two users have identical pilot frequency sequence, if perhaps negative sequence that pilot frequency sequence is another pilot frequency sequence in the piece, then this piece can not decompose at user 1 and user 2 at first.Yet, in this iteration, frequency pilot sign and have the high recovery data of putting letter and parity bit is used for augmentation H
1(k, b) and H
2(k, b), so that they now can be separated.
In one embodiment, time block 304 can select to use the sample that the FFT in one or more FFT modules 306,308,310 handles.In one embodiment, the signal that can demodulation receives of demodulator 330.As mentioned above, demodulator 330 also can be configured to carry out following function: include but not limited to channel estimating, equilibrium and automatic frequency control (AFC).The decoded signal that is formed by soft symbol can be provided to de-interleaving block 312.De-interleaving block 312 can descrambling or the contrary processing of the initial interleaving treatment of using in transmitter of application effectively.Then, de-interleaved signal can be provided to turbo decoder 314, and this turbo decoder 314 can be attempted from deinterleaved data stream recovery information.In operation, as mentioned above, can be basically with in conventional OFDM receiver, carry out first in the same manner by receiver 200.
Although it is wrong that successful turbo decoding can not guarantee that the code block of decoding does not have, such condition misdirection probability is low.Error probability is the anti-exponential function of code block length of the turbo sign indicating number of good design.Under any circumstance, (CRC) can detect this mistake by Cyclical Redundancy Check, and CRC may be implemented as one type hash function, and this hash function is at bigger data block, i.e. Network grouping or computer documents piece produce verification and.Use relates to automatic repetitive requests (ARQ) function on upper strata can handle this mistake.The ARQ function refers to the technique for error control for transfer of data, wherein the error of transmission in the receiver detect-message and automatically ask to transmit again from transmitter.
The such time that can continue until the turbo decoding iteration of having carried out predetermined number is handled in decoding in the receiver 300.If reached the turbo decoding iteration of predetermined number, then can enter second loop 328.
When entering second loop 328, the LLR of data and parity bit tolerance can be used as feedback and is provided to decision threshold module 316 from turbo decoder 214.Then, decision threshold module 316 can be launched the interleaving block 318 that put in place with its signal.In one embodiment, position interleaving block 318 interweaves the position by the reverse function of carrying out the deinterleaving function of being carried out by position de-interleaving block 312.Then, the interleaved bits that obtains is provided to qam symbol and recovers module 320.In one embodiment, qam symbol recovers the hard decision that module 320 produces the qam symbol that is associated with the code word that receives.
In one embodiment, the qam symbol of recovery combines with the reference symbol that is associated, and is provided to channel estimation module 322 and antenna weight computing module 324.Refer to the frequency pilot sign that be embedded in data service as the reference symbol of using herein.Frequency pilot sign is used for channel estimating traditionally.For layout disclosed herein, frequency pilot sign can be used for generating in the channel estimating of the first treatment channel process and antenna weight.Subsequently, the QAM data symbol of frequency pilot sign and recovery can be used for channel estimating and antenna weight generation.
The number that joint demodulation-decoding loop 328 can repeat to be scheduled to.More specifically, when having moved the turbo decoding iteration of predetermined number, joint demodulation-decoding loop 328 can be carried out once.Loop 328 can be as the utilization of discussing, until the iteration of the predetermined number of having carried out loop 328.The total number N of the turbo decoding iteration of certain code word can be provided with reference to figure 3 illustrated frameworks
Turbo* (N
Joint+ 1), N wherein
TurboBe turbo decoding iteration, namely loop 326, number and N
JointIt is the iteration number of loop 328.And framework described herein has reduced the computation complexity of receiver 300, and particularly when than conventional receiver, conventional receiver uses handles the predetermined number of loop, no matter whether signal decoding is successful.
May be based on the situation that has many mistakes from the hard decision of the position of the middle soft decision of turbo decoder 314.For example this situation may be set up in following data structure, in this data structure, intermediate symbols with situation for referencial use under seven continuous OFDM symbols of same tone organized into groups to form pause (dwell), and each pause can be assigned to different mobile radio stations.As known in the art, pause can be by tone in the frequency domain and seven minimum data units that the OFDM symbol forms in the time domain.Similarly, pause can have six qam symbols and the middle reference symbol as payload, and each qam symbol takies a tone and an OFDM mark space.At the receiver place, can use channel estimating to each demodulation that pauses based on the reference symbol of centre.This situation also may be set up for the operation of low signal-to-noise ratio.If the recovery of Q AM symbol that then is associated comprises many mistakes probably.Should be noted that the pause topology example only is used for illustrative purposes, and do not limit the present invention.For example, an embodiment uses aforesaid block structure.
In one embodiment, in case generated all yards position by turbo decoder 314, then only have to have high decoding and put those positions of letter and be used for data symbol and recover.This technology that is used for the qam symbol recovery helps to alleviate wrong the propagation, and in one embodiment, is based on from the trit of turbo decoder 314 feedbacks.In one embodiment, pass through decision threshold module 316 by making all soft decisions from turbo decoder 314, realized this selection.In one embodiment, having position greater than the soft decision value of threshold value is selected for data symbol and recovers.In other words, the feedback bit sequence from the turbo decoder of revising can be represented as
In above rule, LLR (b
k) soft decision of expression position k, and T represents predetermined threshold value.Usually, only there are those detecting positions with big confidence level to be used or to be accepted as accurately.
Because feedback sequence comprises trit, therefore be used for making constellation degeneracy and qam symbol to recover to recover the M-QAM data symbol after module 320 finds the degeneracy constellation point near soft receiving symbol at binary digit stream.A kind of method for trit-QAM mapping has hereinafter been proposed.In order to simplify and to be without loss of generality, has the 16-QAM modulation of constellation shown in Figure 4 as the example of this method.
For the purpose of explanation and simplification, each 16QAM symbol 402 is s corresponding to 4 hytes and a mapping ruler to symbol
I=2b
0+ b
1And sQ=2b
2+ b
3, wherein the 16QAM symbol is defined as s=s
I+ js
QIf 4 hytes that formed by the trit from turbo decoder 314 do not comprise zero, then can recover module 320 by qam symbol by this mapping ruler and recover related 16QAM symbol.Yet, if one or more position is zero, for example, for k 16QAM symbol, b
k=1 and b
K+1=b
K+2=b
K+3=0, then by using the wafer breaker (slicer) of planisphere shown in Figure 5 500 definition, make corresponding soft 16QAM symbol burst, by k the 16QAM symbol that module 320 can be recovered to be associated, this soft 16QAM symbol is stored in the antenna weight computing module 324 as the result of last passage.Usually, wafer breaker is determined in the constellation and the immediate point of estimation point, and is recovered module 320 by QAM and carry out.
The qam symbol that recovers is limited to the constellation point 504 of degeneracy, the i.e. point of the right-hand side of Fig. 5.Using full 16QAM wafer breaker, is (1-j3) but not (1-j3) based on the recovery 16QAM symbol corresponding to soft symbol 502 of turbo decoder 314 feedback.In addition, if b
k=1, b
K+3=-1, and b
K+1=b
K+2=0, then wafer breaker will be by planisphere 600 definition as shown in Figure 6.For soft symbol 602, the hard 16QAM that obtains will be (3-j3) but not (3-j), because the burst of soft symbol 602 will be limited to constellation point 604,606,608,610.If b
k=1, b
K+1=1, and b
K+3=-1, and b
K+2=0, then wafer breaker will be by planisphere 700 definition of Fig. 7.For soft symbol 702, the 16QAM symbol of recovery will be (3-j3) but not (1-j), because the explanation of soft symbol 702 is limited to constellation point 704,706 then.When the qam symbol that recovers such as the QAM modulation of the more high-order of 64QAM and 256QAM, this technology can be more useful.
After having recovered all qam symbols of data, qam symbol can be used as for the reference symbol of channel estimating and uses in second treatment channel.In a layout, during the first demodulation passage, can be determined the channel estimator coefficient of a tap by channel estimator based on the reference symbol in the middle of pausing.These coefficients can be in 328 loops the second demodulation passage during be used for all 6 data symbols of identical pause.
Channel estimator 322 removes the amplitude and the phase place that are caused by fading environment to be changed.In one embodiment, whenever by channel estimator 322 time, carry out equilibrium.Whole loop 328 can the needed number of iteration to obtain further better frame.Can calculate the channel estimator coefficient and the channel estimator coefficient is applied to all 6 data recovered symbols based on reference symbol.During the second channel channel estimating, mean value is applied to all 6 data symbols.
This on average can be simple average, average or weighted average.That is, the channel estimator coefficient of i tone in the specific pause can be represented as
Perhaps
Therefore, s
I, kWith
Be respectively the qam symbol and the soft symbol that is associated in given pause.Middle qam symbol is known reference, and remaining qam symbol is the data recovered symbol.w
kIt is the weight of the estimation that is applied to be associated.w
kValue depend on the ternary place value of the qam symbol that is associated.For example, under the situation of 16QAM, w
kCan be corresponding with feedback 4 hytes with 0,1,2,3 and 4 zero 1,0.75,0.5,0.25 and 0.
As is known, under the situation of Doppler frequency shift and frequency error, ofdm communication system may suffer to rotate about FFT leakage and the phase place of the interference between the tone.The channel estimator of a tap can compensate this phase error, attempts to alleviate the influence of frequency error.Similarly, the channel estimator coefficient of a tap can be based on the frequency error of estimation or Doppler frequency shift in the phase place of a pause adjusted.This frequency error is estimated and can be carried out based on the QAM data symbol of reference symbol and recovery.
For example, if
Expression is along the relative phase difference of two of the same tone index adjacent qam symbols, and then the frequency error of a mobile radio station is estimated and can be represented as
Here, M represents the sum of the phase difference of a plurality of pauses and euphonic mobile radio station.For different OFDM notation indexs, can calculate relative phase difference along identical tone.T
OFDMRepresent that an OFDM symbol time at interval.In estimation, all data recovered qam symbols are as " reference symbol ".And, can estimate by with previously described identical mode weighted average being used for frequency error.Then, can be based on the data symbol of Δ f and the concern relative position at reference symbol, determine the phase adjusted of equalizer coefficients of a tap of the different pieces of information character position in given pause.For example, ΔΦ
k=(4-k) 2 π T
OFDMΔ f, wherein k=1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7.In one embodiment, Φ is based on the phase error of each symbol in 7 symbols of pause of frequency error Δ f.Here, k is indicated in the data symbol positions in the pause.
Utilize above-described all methods, that is, the qam constellation of all decodings, trit feedback and degeneracy, the data recovered symbol is quite reliable for the combination of antennas weight calculation.Any reliable recovery data symbol will reduce the probability of two user's phase mutual interference in piece significantly.For example, under the situation of 16QAM, the probability that will disturb fully as the individual data symbol of pilot tone has reduced by 1/16, and two data symbols have reduced by 1/256 with probability, etc.Therefore, improved the overall performance of SDMA significantly.
