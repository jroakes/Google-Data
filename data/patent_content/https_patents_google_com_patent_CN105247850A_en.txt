Fig. 3 is the flow chart illustrating the automatic adjustment to video direction according to embodiment.The method 300 be by hardware (circuit, special logic etc.) can be comprised, the processing logic of software (such as operating on general-purpose computing system or special purpose machinery) or the combination of both performs.In one embodiment, method 300 is performed by the server machine 110 of Fig. 1.Method 300 can be performed by the video regulating system 130 operated on server machine 110 or other computing equipments one or more.
When receiving video content, method 300 starts from the stage 302.In an embodiment, video reception module 202 receives the video content comprising multiple video frame image.Such as, video reception module 202 can receive and record and the video content be stored on identical calculations equipment.In another embodiment, video reception module 202 can receive the video content from another such source of such as different computer system.
In the stage 304, detect the direction occurred in video content and change.In an embodiment, the video frame image of analysis module 204 to the video content come received by the comfortable stage 302 is analyzed.Such as, analysis module can be analyzed to determine when occur that direction changes in video to the position be stored within video frame image and/or direction metadata.
Such as, when record video content, video recording apparatus can comprise and monitor the device sensor that such as one or more gyroscope is so continuously.After this video recording apparatus can using from the position received by one or more transducer and/or directional information as metadata store in video frame image.In one embodiment, by video recording apparatus catch position and/or bearing data and it can be used as metadata store in each corresponding video frame image continuously.In another embodiment, when having occurred changing during videograph only in video frame image the change of catch position and/or bearing data using as metadata.
In one embodiment, compare to determine whether occur that direction changes in video to the bearing data be stored in one or more picture frame.Such as, the single or cumulative error on the direction between two or more video frame image can detect that direction changes when exceeding the threshold value of one or more definition.
In another embodiment, can compare to detect to the direction be associated with one or more video frame image and/or position data and correct rocking and/or other unintentional or destructive movement of occurring during the video recorded.In one example, the direction be associated with one or more video frame image and/or position data are for setting up baseline directrix (such as reference direction or another normal place).The video frame image departing from set up baseline directrix can be adjusted to determined baseline directrix with to rocking of occurring across video frame image and/or other unintentional or destructive movement corrects.
In the stage 306, determine the reference direction of display of video content.In an embodiment, reference direction is the single fixed-direction for display of video content.Such as, reference direction can be based on its original orientation of video, modal direction detected during whole video, user's preferred playback direction, user-selected direction, will the equipment of display of video content or the direction of video player and/or one or more attributes of the video player of display of video content (such as video player height, width, screen position, direction are fixing, can revise) are determined.
In the stage 308, video content is adjusted to reference direction.In an embodiment, the one or more video frame images in video adjustment module 208 pairs of videos perform and regulate and size adjustment.Such as, video adjustment module 208 can calculate and video frame image will be adjusted to degree of rotation needed for reference direction from its its original orientation.Video content size can also be adjusted to standard display resolution by video adjustment module 208.
In an embodiment, video adjustment module 208 is determined video frame image to be adjusted to the degree of rotation needed for reference direction.In one example, video adjustment module 208 calculates the direction of the frame of video recorded and is the difference between the determined reference direction of video.This rear video direction module 208 can be determined to regulate frame of video to correct this change based on this.
In addition, video adjustment module 208 can also adjust the size of video frame image.Such as, video adjustment module 208 can be carried out cutting to video frame image and thought that adjusted video provides standard to show a size and/or part for video image is fitted to different directions or playback window.
In an embodiment, video adjustment module 208 calculates the standard display size of video based on the shortest side in all frequency view picture frames.Such as, the video with the scape horizontal direction resolution of 3000 × 2000 and the longitudinal direction resolution of 2000 × 3000 will have the standard display size of 2000 × 2000.Therefore, 2000 × 3000 longitudinal direction video frame images can be adjusted to reference direction with the square area of the centre 2000 × 2000 of both 3000 × 2000 horizontal direction video frame images and with 2000 × 2000 common display size together with show.
In one example, cutting is carried out to each 2000 × 3000 longitudinal direction video frame images so that 2000 × 2000 regions in the middle of retaining.After this can rotate the longitudinal direction video frame image of institute's cutting, show together with 3000 × 2000 horizontal frame of video between two parties and in adjusted video.
In another example, can rotate centre 2000 × 2000 square of 3000 × 2000 horizontal direction video frame images, show together with 2000 × 3000 longitudinal direction frame of video between two parties and in adjusted video.
In another embodiment, the video with original 3000 × 2000 horizontal direction resolution can be rotated to 2000 × 3000 longitudinal direction resolution.In addition, after this can rotate to mate with the direction of adjusted transverse view picture frame to 2000 × 3000 longitudinal direction video frame images in video and its size be adjusted to 1500 × 2000 regions to keep length-width ratio.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart illustrating the other aspect of the automatic adjustment of video content according to embodiment.Method 400 be by hardware (circuit, special logic etc.) can be comprised, the processing logic of software (such as operating on general-purpose computing system or special purpose machinery) or the combination of both performs.
In the stage 402, receiver, video content.According to embodiment, can receive from one or more source or assembling video content.Such as, video content can arrive as the single video file with successive image frame set.In addition, can from there is two or more image assembling of consecutive order or relation and/or creating video file.Stage 402 can be performed by such as video reception module 202.
