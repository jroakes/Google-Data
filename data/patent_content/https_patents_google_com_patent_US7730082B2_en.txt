It should be appreciated, however, that container server 12 may reside on user system 22 as well so that a network connection may not be used.
- container server 12 may comprise a word processing module.
- Module server 14 may provide data from modules to container server 12 for incorporation into a container document. It should be appreciated that in one embodiment, container server 12 and module server 14 may comprise a single unit performing both functions. Module server 14 may provide data for the container document by interpreting and/or parsing instructions in the module specification associated with the module. According to one embodiment, module server 14 may serve the module content to the container document through the use of a browser IFRAME. An IFRAME may be generally understood to be an independently operated browser window instance inside the container document.
- IFRAME is protects the container document from the IFRAME's content and vice versa, e.g., JavaScript on the container document may not be permitted to access any JavaScript code in the inner IFRAME (same for CSS, DOM, or cookie objects).
- modules may be displayed inline within the container document.
- Inline display may be understood as referring to display with other document elements.
- One example is a display generated from code for HTML in the body according to HTML standards.
- module server 14 or some other component may determine whether the module is deemed trusted prior to including it in the container document inline due to the risks of various security issues an inline module could create.
- the module may incorporate an indicia of approval (e.g., digital certificate) issued by the container module or an entity associated with the container module as described in detail below. If the indicial of approval is present, module server 14 may render the data from a module for inline presentation in the container document.
- Specification server 16 provides the module specification file to module server 14 .
- the module specification may be cached and stored in a database accessible to the module server 14 and/or specification server 16 or may be retrieved from a location associated with the specification as detailed later.

- the module may comprise an XML specification file or module specification file stored on a specification server.
- the specification server may comprise any server, including one on the site from which the container page is hosted or any other site.
- the user or another person may then include this new module on a personalized homepage (container document).
- the server that serves the container document may operate as the module server and the server that generates the mapping data through an inquiry from its API may be considered to be the backend server.
- analysis module 28 may analyze modules at various times (e.g., when the module is first selected by a user, each time the module is called by a container for inclusion or at any other time determined to be advantageous for safety and security and other times). Analysis module 28 may perform a number of actions, including comparing the module with a list of disapproved or dangerous modules or a list of approved modules. The comparison may involve exact or substring (e.g., prefixes, suffixes and regular expressions) matching by name or location (e.g., URL), contents of the specification, contents of the location where the specification resides, or information that may be ascertainable about the module.
- exact or substring e.g., prefixes, suffixes and regular expressions
- Analysis module 28 may take one or more actions in response to a determination that the module is disapproved or dangerous, including, for example, silently blocking the request, (i.e. providing a generic error), blocking the request with an error that explains the reason it was blocked or redirecting the request to a different module specification that has been determined to be safe and related to the disapproved module (e.g., another module that relates to maps, if the first one was a disapproved mapping site or a module that includes the keyword “basketball” if the disapproved module was a basketball module). For example, through redirection, the URL of the original module may be passed to the “safe” module. The safe module may then use a proxy server, as described below, to retrieve the original URL's content.
- silently blocking the request i.e. providing a generic error
- blocking the request with an error that explains the reason it was blocked or redirecting the request to a different module specification that has been determined to be safe and related to the disapproved module e.g., another module that relates to
- analysis module 28 may parse the module content to determine whether it is safe, such as by compiling JavaScript or other scripts contained in the module to try to identify unsafe or undesired actions the module may perform.
- module creation servers 32 may be provided. This server may operate as a “wizard” to enable module creators to create a module through an interactive process controlled by module creation server 32 .
- module creation server 32 may provide a series of user interfaces that enable the module creator to provide inputs that are then used by the module creator to automatically generate a module specification.
- various module specification templates may be provided with corresponding inputs.
- Module creation server 32 may then take inputs supplied by a module creator, insert them into the template and then generate the module specification for the module.
- a preview, testing and debugging function may also be offered as part of this “wizard.” This module may be downloadable as well so it may be installed and operated at any node on the network.
- a syndication server 34 may prepare data for transmission to one or more syndication recipient servers 38 related to modules.
- Syndication server 34 may receive a request for a module and/or module content and deliver that module or content to a syndication recipient server 38 over network 26 .
- Syndication server 34 may reside at host server system 10 or at another location on the network. For example, if an operator of a sports web site (an example of a syndication recipient system 38 ) desired to include a maps module created by a remote source system 24 , it may do so through a request to syndication server 34 .
- Syndication server 34 may then cooperate with module server 14 to generate data for the container document (here the sports web site page of the syndication recipient system 38 ).
- Syndication server 34 may thus syndicate modules accessible to it. It may do so based on requests for specific modules or other criteria it determines (e.g., content matches, keyword matches, monetary values associated with modules and/or syndication requestors, etc.)
- Ad server 36 may provide advertisements associated with modules to containers. For example, an advertisement may be incorporated with module data when data is delivered to a container document. Ad server 36 may operate with syndication server 34 to deliver advertisements to syndication recipient servers 38 based on a syndication request for a module. The advertisements may be selected by ad server 36 based on a wide variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, the relationship between the content of or information about the container, module, other modules in the container, syndication recipient server information, monetary elements/relationships related to any of the foregoing and/or combinations thereof. Ad server 36 may comprise the Google AdSense system, according to one embodiment of the present invention.

- modules may provide scroll bars, and others may not. Some modules may be different sizes or shapes than other modules.
- some modules may offer the opportunity for the user to edit the display preferences and/or per-use data associated with the module. (See, for example, modules 102 , 104 , 105 , 106 and 110 that provide an edit link.) For example, if the module relates to a maps module 106 , the user may be provided the opportunity to edit an address or addresses that are mapped in that module.
- inlined modules may be automatically sized by a container document so no scrolling, height or scaling information may be provided.
- an inlined module may be wrapped with a fixed size ⁇ DIV> tag and content placed in the tag.
- the scroll bar, height and other characteristics may be then specified for the inlined content.
- One of the functions provided with this example container document 100 is the opportunity to add content to the container page through selecting the add content element 103 .
- the system may offer the user the opportunity to interactively indicate an additional element to be included in the container page.
- Various forms of an interface to receive that input may be provided.
- One illustrative form is presented in FIG. 2 toward the bottom of the page in section 120 .
- the user may be presented with an interface element to select from a browsable list of modules that may be arranged into a categorization structure.
- Another section of input section 120 may enable the user to specify a reference to a location for a module to be incorporated into the container document.
- Such a section may be such as that depicted through an input box 126 with a submit element 128 .
- the user may specify a location reference (e.g., the uniform resource locator (URL)) where data exists related to a module to be incorporated.
- a location reference e.g., the uniform resource locator (URL)

- location reference e.g., URL
- data e.g., an XML file
- a preview of a module, author name, author affiliation and/or author email may be provided.
- an anonymized email forwarding feature may be used to help protect against spammer-crawlers.
- the display may also provide information about what a module requires or works best with using a May-Require attribute from a module preference (as described in detail below).
- the module works only with the Firefox browser and so that information is provided. Locality information may also be provided.
- this module is designed for the Untied States and for English and Spanish.
- AJAX AJAX
- a module may be added to a container document without a refresh of the container document page (perhaps only a refresh of the IFRAME in which the new container is presented), or use of AJAX to remove a module without the container document being refreshed or when a developer is developing a module, being able to change modules without the container document in which they are populated having to have a page refresh in order to incorporate the changed module.
- FIG. 14 depicts another illustrative example of a container.
- This container may be operated from a container server that is not affiliated with the module server.
- the container 1400 may be a third party website (here Joe's Real Estate Web Page) that lists real estate listing information.
- a remote module 1401 may be incorporated through syndication from a module server.
- the remote module may comprise a mortgage calculator that Joe's Real Estate Web Page may find useful for visitors to its site.
- one or more advertisements 1403 may also be provided, as illustrated.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example of a method 300 used to add a module to a container document.
- a container document may be opened into which a new module is to be added. This may be performed by presenting the container document to a user or by a computer software element opening the container document to determine its contents, for example.
- a selection of content to be added is received. This content selection may be received from a user such as through the inputs described with reference to FIG. 2 or FIG. 4 or through some other mechanism by which the user may provide an indication of a module to be added to the container.
- modules may be provided through an automated process whereby the system determines a module to be added based upon various inputs.
- a user input of, for example, a request to add content through module 103 of container page 100 in block 308 it may be determined whether the user is requesting the addition of a module through a list of available modules or through a reference. If the user is providing an input from a list, the content from a menu selection may be received in block 310 . That may be achieved by interaction of the user with an interface such as that depicted in FIG. 2 or FIG. 4 by selecting one or more modules presented such as that in 124 or 403 for example. Other methods of receiving a selection of a module may also be provided. If the user is providing a selection of a module from a reference, then in block 312 , a location reference may be received.
- an optional block 313 and 315 may also be provided.
- Block 313 if the user's remote location identifier ends with a slash, for example, or other indicator that the user is asking for files at the location to be retrieved, then in block 315 , a list of possible modules may be displayed.
- Block 315 may involve taking the remote location identifier provided by the user and quering that location for a listing of files or data representing module specifications, and presenting the received response to that query in a list for the user to choose. For example, the user may be provided a list of files of module specifications at the location provided whereby the user may select in block 317 one of those presented files.
- the system may in block 315 retrieve a listing of all files containing module specifications at the location of the URL whereby the user may choose one of the files, such as one of the XML files in block 317 .
- the system may automatically guess from the content or provide a directory listing or object listing (e.g., through a database query) using web server resources, such as an Apache webserver directory call or IIS directory call.
- the list may be formatted in a way to make it easy to select such as by highlighting more likely choices.
- the system may optionally enable the user to confirm the selection of the module to be added before the container page is updated.
- an optional approval block 318 may occur after blocks 310 and/or 312 and/or 317 .
- the operator of the container document may desire to protect the security of the container as well as the security of the user systems interacting with the container. Accordingly, one or more actions may be taken to determine whether the module is approved prior to enabling the content to be incorporated in the container. For example, an evaluation of the content may occur to determine whether a module is trustworthy, for example if there are not HTML tags or other characteristics determined to be trusted. These actions are described in greater detail below. If the approval is not met, then in block 320 , one or more unapproved responses may occur as described above with reference to analysis module 28 .
- the updated container document may be presented to the user or to whomever has provided the input of the module to add to the container.
- FIG. 5 depicts a module specification according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the specification may comprise a plurality of elements including the XML version information, module preferences, which may be optional, user preferences, which may be optional, a content type designator and then a content element that is used to populate the portion of the container allocated for the module.
- the content may be specified in various forms of code, typically code that is interpretable by a user system when generating the container for presentation. Such code may include HTML, JavaScript, or other forms of code that may be used to depict the format of a web page.
- the module specification may be embedded in one or more other files or computer instructions.
- the module server 14 may, when provided with the identification of data for generating a module, look for a module specification within the data.
- One of the forms of data may be another HTML file, as depicted in an illustrative example of FIG. 6 .
- a document specification may be provided as shown for example in FIG. 6 . This example is a simple form of a module that would depict the words, “Hello world!”, within the portion of the container to which it has been allocated.
- the document specification is contained within another HTML page and accordingly the file in which the document specification is located likely would have the suffix of .htm or .html.
- a computer instruction such as “debut,” “about” or some other instruction may be identified that provides the specification.
- the document specification may comprise an XML type file
- the source of the module specification may actually be another form of data or file type from which the module specification may be identified.
- a repository of data may alter, modify, change, or corrupt a module specification.
- many data repositories “escape” HTML or XML content when it is stored and used as a source. Some system may then unescape the source code for presentation. Accordingly, if a module specification is included in data that has been escaped, a module server or specification server may detect that the code has been escaped, determine the manner of unescaping to be used (e.g., based on the source, based on the type of codes used or other techniques) and then unescape the data to return it to its original form.
- FIG. 6( b ) illustrates an example of the file of FIG. 6 after it has been escaped. In this example, the symbol “ ⁇ ” has been changed to “<” and the symbol “>” has been changed to “>” and several other changes have been made.
- the module server or specification server may detect the alteration or modification, determine how to reverse the alteration or modification or otherwise output the module specification to its intended form.
- a method may be performed to generate the data from the module for inclusion in the container.
- One illustrative method of doing so may be depicted in FIG. 7 in process 700 .
- a module reference may be received from the container.
- the container for a user may specify a plurality of different modules that are to be incorporated. It may indicate those modules by a reference to the location of the module. If the module is specified as type URL, then the module is located at a place potentially remote from the server of the container.
- block 704 and 706 may be provided.
- the status of the remote module may be determined, for example, by an analysis module 28 . If the remote module is approved in block 706 , then processing may proceed to block 710 . If it is not approved, then one or more unapproved responses may be taken in block 708 .
- block 710 the server associated with the remote module reference may be called and the data received may be evaluated.
- block 710 may involve retrieving the remote module from a cache associated with the container server.
- one or more of the activities associated with block 704 may be performed to determine whether the remote module is approved. This may be desired because as remote modules are under the control of another party, they are subject to possible change on a frequent basis. Accordingly, in between the time that a module is included into a container the first time and the time which it is displayed a second time changes may have been made to the remote module that would render it unapproved.
- the data that has been retrieved from the remote module reference is parsed to identify a module specification.
- the data may comprise a file that merely includes the module specification and therefore step 714 is used to extract the module specification from the data provided.
- the module specification is parsed to determine how to generate data and in block 718 , data is returned to the container whereby the container when accessed by a user system or other system opening the container may be able to view the contents of the remote module.
- the various activities associated with parsing the module specification 716 are provided in greater detail herein.
- FIG. 8 depicts more details regarding the activities involved in block 716 .
- the parsing operation may identify the content type specified in the module specification and take action appropriate based upon the content type. For example, for an HTML content type, the module data is resident on the server.
- module preferences may be applied if available. Greater detail regarding module preferences and how they may be applied are provided below.
- user preferences may be applied if available. Greater detail about user preferences are provided in greater detail below.
- data may be generated for delivery to the container.
- the modules may be created according to a specification.
- the module specification may specify elements that are required and those that are optional.
- content type and content may be required and user preferences and module preferences optional.
- Other embodiments may have no required elements.
- a module may be specified by an XML file, placed somewhere on the Internet where it can be found by a module server.
- the XML file that specifies a module may contain instructions on how to process and render the module that in turn may then be interpreted by the module server to render the data.
- the XML file may contain all of the data and code for the module or it can have references (e.g., URLs) for where to find the rest of the elements.
- HTML HyperText Markup Language
- URL Uniform Resource Identifier
- XSLT XSLT
- the body of the ⁇ Content> is html and may be hosted by the host server system 10 . This may be useful for modules that incorporate JavaScript.
- the container may embed untrusted HTML within an IFRAME for safety. Implementations may also parse the HTML content and determine that it is safe to display without a surrounding IFRAME.
- This may be a useful content type for server-side dynamic content generation.
- a url type may be served in an IFRAME. This enables the container system to obtain cookies from the site serving the data at the URL, parse user preferences correctly and other advantages.
- the default for this type of module may be IFRAME presentation as one way to protect against malicious HTML/JavaScript.
- HTML module One example HTML module is shown below:
- a module may have a content section as shown below.
- Module preferences may be optional per-module configuration information, such as preferred sizing, title, author, and so. For example,
- An example table of module preference attribute ⁇ ModulePrefs . . . > names may include:
- Modules that can automatically scale vertically may elect to set this to true, but modules which have a fixed height should set this to false. The default may be true.
- Scrolling Optional boolean that provides a vertical and/or horizontal scrollbars if the content exceeds the space provided. If false, then the content is clipped to the height and width provided. The default may be false.
- a ⁇ MayRequire . . . > element may specify information for compatibility and may be displayed in the directory. This information may also be used for attribute searches of modules. It may be used to provide information or validated by software within the analysis module for accuracy. In one embodiment, this attribute may be used in presenting modules in search results or browsing to enable users to understand what the module may need to operate in the way the module creator intended.
- one module that requires QuickTime may provide the following module preference attribute values.
- Predefined values for type and value attributes may be specified, which may be updated over time to include additional possible values.
- a logical OR may be used to interpret multiple attributes of the same type and a logical AND may be used to interpret multiple attributes of a different type. For example, multiple browsers may be specified and the interpreter understands that any of the specified browsers may be used. If a browser attribute and a plugin attribute are provided, the interpreter understands that both may be expected (the logical AND). It is also possible to use an attribute that specifies what a module will not operate with.
- it may be possible to provide an optional attribute for a code which may allow specification of a standardized code, such as an ISO 3166 code. In this variation, specification of such a specific code may override language and country attributes if present.
- Providing values for “lang” and “country” values may be optional. If one is missing, it may be interpreted as an ALL value (i.e., all languages for a specified country or all countries for a specified language).
- the interpreter may assume one country and language (e.g., US and English) or a predefined set of countries and languages.
- Shorthand values may be used as well, such as known two-digit values for countries (e.g., NZ for New Zealand, MX for Mexico, etc.).
- the list of countries may also be determined, such as by scanning content for certain words, strings, characters, etc. that are characteristic of certain locales, looking at the author information or other possible choices.
- Shorthand values may be used as well, such as known ISO two-character representations of countries (e.g., NZ for New Zealand, MX for Mexico, etc.).
- the reader_inline attribute may be an optional preference.
- predetermined values may be provided including “required” which means the module must be inlined to work properly; “never” which means the module will not work properly if inlined, and “optional” which means it will work either way.
- module specifications may be desirable to cache module specifications that would ordinarily be available from a specification server remotely located over a network from the module server. For example, if a specification server is operating on a slower connection its transmission of the module specification may cause the generation of data for the container document to be slow or unavailable.
- a caching element in the module preferences may set one or more attributes that indicates the caching rule to be applied.
- a cache rule preference may specify attributes including a size element (e.g., cache the module content only when the screen size is identical, otherwise reload). This may be a default caching behavior for modules that do not want the user identification to be specified.
- Another attribute may be based on a “user” value (e.g., cache the content per-user only, for any rendering dimensions).
- Another attirbute may be based on a “user,size” value combination (e.g., cache the content for a given user and given screen dimensions only). This may be the default caching behavior for modules of a url type and that accept a user identification.
- an age attribute may be specified such that modules may be cached for a certain period of time.
- the value of this attribute may be the maximum number of seconds to cache the content. This number may be suffixed with “s” for seconds, “m” for minutes, “h” for hours or “d” for days.
- ⁇ ModulePrefs CacheMaxAge 0> effectively disables caching.
- Modules may comprise “small” versions of applications suitable for containers such as personalized home page(s), HTML emails, portable digital devices (PDA's), telephones, cell-phones, interactive media devices, video game consoles, television overlays, etc. or any other device configured to display content based on a format (e.g., HTML).
- a format e.g., HTML
- the application may be adapted to be more concise and less cluttered with promotions and ads, etc.
- Sizing may be achieved through module preferences, with different output devices having different preferences, for example or the module specifying how to behave on different output devices that render the data for display.
- Module preferences may thus be used to enable module creators to specify screen dimensions, visibility state—e.g., full, minimized-titlebar-only, minimized-visible (e.g., visible icon on bottom or in a toolbar), minimized-invisible (e.g. only available from a menu) or closed.
- visibility state e.g., full, minimized-titlebar-only, minimized-visible (e.g., visible icon on bottom or in a toolbar), minimized-invisible (e.g. only available from a menu) or closed.
- visibility state e.g., full, minimized-titlebar-only
- minimized-visible e.g., visible icon on bottom or in a toolbar
- minimized-invisible e.g. only available from a menu
- closed closed.
- the module may be still “on” the user's page in the sense of able to response to events (including timed events) and able to interact with the system (e.g. including changing its state).
- states such as “active.”
- Illustrative examples include a weather module that remains minimized (for some definition) until there is unusual or extreme weather.
- a traffic module could remain minimized until a relevant traffic alert occurs.
- a stock module may display only stocks with changes greater than a predetermined percentage.
- a fantasy football module may be only active on weekends or within a predetermined period of time of the first game. The user may have the option to manually override these preferences from a menu, for example.
- an email module may size itself to reflect emails deemed important by some criteria.
- modules may elect to access large databases and dynamic services hosted elsewhere on the Internet.
- Google Maps module which uses the Maps API:
- a weather module may expect to receive the postal code(s) the user wants to watch.
- An example module with user preferences expected is shown below.
- any previous user values may get out-of-sync with the new module spec.
- the server may choose to pass preference values anyway. Old user preferences may be deleted, ignored or also passed along where the specification server may ignore them.
- An example table of user preference attribute names includes the following:
- the name field may use only letters, number and underscores, i.e. the regular expression ⁇ circumflex over ( ) ⁇ [a–zA–Z0–9_]+$.
- other designators may also be used.
- the options may include “string,” “bool” and “enum” required Optional boolean argument (“true” or “false”) indicating whether this user pref is required.
- default_value Optional string value to provide as this user pref's default value.
- num_minval Optional numeric value that indicates the minimum allowed value for this user pref.
- num_maxval Optional numeric value that indicates the maximum allowed value for this user pref.
- str_maxlen Optional numeric value that specifies a maximum string length for this user pref.
- modules may have logins and other authentications to obtain the data. This information may be passed to the specification server through the preferences.
- Other techniques may also be used to facilitate these systems, including creating special user preferences for certain module creators, anonymous user identifications passed to the specification server, placing cookies in an IFRAME for the specification server, per-user login screens and other such techniques.
- JavaScript preferences interface may be included with a JavaScript-based module to obtain user preference passed in.
- This interface may comprise a plurality of JavaScript functions including the following:
- container preferences, module preferences, user preferences, syndication recipient system preferences and users of the syndication recipient system may specify preferences that might apply to a module.
- a protocol may be established that determines which preferences take precedence over others if a conflict exists. For example, if a container limits a module to 100 ⁇ 120 pixels and a module preference indicates that the module should be larger than that, the container preference may override the module preference. Or, if different time zones apply to the container, the user system and the syndication server, the time zone of the syndication server might override a user preference.
- Other protocols are also possible.
- the content section in the remote module XML file contains information about the module's content type. For example:
- the content section can also contain pure HTML.
- An example table of module preference attribute names is shown below:
- Name Description type Optional string that gives the type of the content.
- the possible values may be “html,” “javascript,” “xslt,” and “url” for example.
- the default is “html.”
- the default value is “”.
- cdata Optional string that indicates that the data generation portion of the specification follows.
- modules may be CGI-based front-ends to other services.
- the user may create a directory, copy an example CGI script into it, and test the CGI script.
- Scalable Vector Graphics objects e.g., Macromedia FLASH, MPEG4, etc.
- video players e.g., video players, audio players, and the like
- the module server may check for this information and determine a module to be untrusted based on inclusion of a flash object and thus serve it in an IFRAME. It is also possible that such modules may be deemed safe and rendered inline.
- Module creators may update modules. Accordingly, the module creator may have several options for users to learn about and/or begin using the newer version of a module. For example, the module creator may provide a new version of a module in the same location, thus forcing users to upgrade to the new version when the container includes a reference to that location. When a call is made to retrieve a module specification at that location reference, the specification of the new version may be retrieved. If a module creator and/or user does not want to have new versions mandatory for the users, then a new version may be made available at a different location reference in the Module Prefs.
- a new version may be notified through various mechanisms that a new version is available and provide them with the new location reference (e.g., URL) to use in identifying the newer version of the module in a container document.
- the module creator may publish to a new version to a new reference locator (e.g., URL), then modify the old location reference (e.g., URL) to provide notice to users of the upgrade.
- a new reference locator e.g., URL
- the module specification may include a field or a preference that enables a module creator to indicate that a new version of the module has been created.
- the module server may then identify an indication that a new version is available during the parsing process and modify the module data output (e.g., annotating the module titlebar with an indication such as “upgrade available,” with a link to a confirmation window, which upon confirmation updates the user's module location reference in the container document to the newer version).
- module 105 in FIG. 2 includes a selection “upgrade available” 105 a .
- module server may automatically (or based on an input in a module specification) present an option to a user to return to a previous version.
- module 106 has been provided with an “undo upgrade” selection 106 a . This may be done for a predetermined period of time, until another upgrade is available or indefinitely. Indeed, repetitive selection of “undo upgrade” may return the selection to several versions earlier of a module.
- Information related to location references of earlier versions may then be stored and accessible to the module server and/or be stored in the module specification to enable those location references to be used.
- specification server 16 may thus run a local web server (e.g., Apache server) or use a managed hosting facility which typically provides faster connection responses.
- module content may be presented in an IFRAME hosted on a domain separate from the domain of the container server.
- the IFRAME may be hosted by the same or different container server but served from a different host name (or IP address) in the URL. This may help protect users from malicious modules that might (for example) attempt to “steal” any cookies associated with the domain of the container server.
- a host server system may not want to include untrusted HTML inline without precautions.
- a malicious module if rendered inline may read or modify cookies, including authentication credentials, set by the host server system.
- the malicious module may also read or modify the container (e.g., personalized homepage associated with the host server system). It may also utilize phishing (e.g., imitating a login box) or code that replaces the entire page (via document.location) with a phishing site that looks like the personalized homepage. It may also utilize undesired pop-ups, dialog boxes or infinite looping codes.
- a malicious module could also pass information to IFRAMEs, which may then generate any of the foregoing problems in the IFRAME.
- the content may be placed in IFRAMEs.
- the content in the IFRAME may be served on numeric IP addresses.
- Another level of protection may involve HTML type modules utilizing a library of scripts that hide user preferences from being generated in the output HTML in the container.
- IFRAMEs In addition to use of IFRAMEs to render data of modules, other security features may be utilized. For example, users of the container page may be requested to acknowledge risks when adding untrusted modules to the container page. Also, untrusted models may be indicated in some manner (e.g., visual demarcation, such as a colored border).
- various functions may be disabled in the IFRAME, such as the JavaScript alert( ), confirm( ), and prompt( ) functions, which may be accomplished, in one embodiment by inserting dummy function definitions (e.g. function alert( ) ⁇ ; ⁇ ) before the actual content. Because an additional IFRAME in the content could be used to circumvent this disabling, the container may refuse to include a module that includes an IFRAME or uses the JavaScript eval( ) function.
- a module may be desired to enable a module to become inlined a container upon becoming “trusted” by the system.
- a module may be deemed trusted according to various techniques including if the module uses HTML and other codes that have been statically proven to be safe through various known techniques.
- FIG. 9 Another method of achieving sufficient level of trust for the system might involve a methodology based upon digital signatures.
- One illustrative example methodology may be depicted in FIG. 9 .
- This process 900 may involve a number of one or more blocks.
- a digital signature may be created.
- Various functions and techniques for creating digital signals are known and may be used herein.
- One such system takes various data as an input and randomly generates based upon those input a series of numbers that are unique for the particular purpose (i.e., no two people have the same digital signature).
- the digital signature may be provided by the container server and/or host server system based on a validation of the module.
- it may be manually inspected by a person associated with the container server and/or host server system or a person approved by those operators.
- the creator of a module may incorporate that digital signal into the module.
- the creator of the module may update that module design specification with code that indicates that the module supports inline generation. When this occurs, the module when rendered by the container server is presented inline with the container.
- User preferences may be accessed from an IFRAMEd or inlined module using a preferences interface described below.
- ⁇ script> // May be constructed using the —— MODULE_ID —— token. It may // get replaced at runtime with the actual ID of the remote module.
- both inlined and IFRAMEd modules may be placed in an artificial ⁇ div>.
- one of the elements of data stored in databases 20 may comprise preferences.
- preferences may be stored for each user of the system that has a personalized container document.
- preferences may be stored in association with one or more modules in the personalized container of the user.
- the system may allocate a large volume of storage for preferences for users.
- FIG. 10 illustrates an example of preferences for two users.
- one user Bob Brown, which may be a username rather than a real name, has three modules designated for inclusion in his container.
- Each module may be identified by an identifier (e.g., a numeric identifier or index to a database where the data is stored) and a location reference.
- the location reference is a URL of an XML file located at a website on the Internet.
- various preferences may be stored. In this instance, the preferences have been stored as follows: his name which equals Bob, his favorite color which equals blue, and his favorite sandwich which equals reuben. These preferences may be stored based upon the module specification for the module at www.smith.com.
- the smith.com module may specify that preferences may include the name, address, and age.
- preferences may include the name, address, and age.
- only the preferences specified in the module specification may be stored in the preferences database.
- all preferences that the user has provided may be stored in association with this module entry in the preferences database. For example, if the Smith.com module specification only calls for name and color preference information but used to also call for sandwich information, it is possible that the preference entry for this module may save the age information. When that information is passed to the module, the module may simply ignore that preference information because it is not used by the module. Also the system may track the preferences associated with the module and delete any preferences that have been stored in association with that module from the preference database that are no longer relevant.
- entries may be provided for each user that accesses the system to receive a personalized container.
- preferences may be duplicated for each module (e.g., name equals Bob is stored in association with each of the three modules for Mr. Bob Brown) it is also possible that preferences may be stored in a global table associated with the user with references made to the modules to which they apply. Any other techniques for storing preferences in association with the various modules to be included in the container for the user may also be used within the scope of the present invention.
- another security feature may be implemented with relationship to preference storage.
- preference values for users may be stored for various modules, it is important that one module not be able to modify preferences to be used for other modules, unless that is desired by the users and/or module creators (e.g., two modules that operate together, such as a maps module and weather module that show a weather map imposed on a street map based on a commonly supplied user zip code preference).
- the module server may include a token in the IFRAME or code of a module in HTML.
- the token may comprise a digital signature since the module and user may already have been deemed to be trusted. Inlined modules may then modify other modules, the container or itself.
- the IFRAME may be served on a numeric IP address without cookies associated with the container server and any associated credentials that may be included in the cookies (in contrast to an inline presentation where any cookies set by the container are accessible to the module running inline on that page, including cookies that might include a container user identification and/or module identification).
- a token may be generated that includes information about the container and/or module and/or user.
- the IFRAME may be provided with a module identification (e.g., the index of the module being displayed) and/or a container user identification (which may be encrypted).
- a token may be passed to the IFRAME and the module may then be expected to pass back that token with any request to modify, add or remove preferences.
- the token may be generated according to known token techniques, but one illustrative example is calculated as follows: Here K 1 and K 2 may be secret alphanumeric characters to the server.
- the module server may decrypt the data, validate that the timestamp is within a predetermined period of time of issuance (e.g., 15 minutes), look up the container user identification and module identification, calculate the signature and encrypted data and then use the module identification to update the preferences if everything matches and all requested update parameters refer to the correct module identification.
- a module identification may be generated for each version of a module as well.
- the module location reference may not be passed in the token, but may be used in the calculation to generate the encryption (e.g., HMAC encryption).
- the timestamp may be used to provide additional security. It may serve to limit the damage that could be done if an unauthorized user was able to decode the token on a particular instance. Everything in the token may be encrypted for additional safety, although lesser levels of security may also be used.
- JavaScript in a module may be created to programmatically store preference information for the user/module through use of the token system.
- a module may, with a valid token (e.g., within the time stamp range accepted), pass data to the preference storage without the user having to indicate.
- a module that provides tasks for a user may automatically upload newly added tasks to the preference storage upon entry of the new task through the module. The task list then may be stored at the preference storage.
- preference information may be used to generate data from one or more remote modules and that information may then be supplied to another remote module.
- preference information related to one or more geographic locations may be stored. Those one or more geographic locations may be provided to remote modules to generate information that may be supplied to map server 39 .
- Map server 39 may then generate a map overlayed with data based on the geographic location information, including locations of places, images of places and the like. Also, map server 39 may obtain this information and provide it to another remote module that may generate mapping output or other output.
- a string such as San Francisco, Calif. may be provided in preference information. That string may be converted to a geocode location using geocode server 37 and passed to a remote module.
- the geocode location may comprise a latitude and longitude value.
- the remote module may generate data for a map server to display a world map highlighting San Francisco, Calif. on the map. If other preference information, such as “restaurants”, is provided, then restaurant locations near San Francisco may be shown on the map. Many other examples are certainly possible within the scope of the present invention.
- a method for collecting data from a target site and reformatting it in a manner desired for display by the user may be realized.
- a module may be designed with a script that collects data from the golf site applying code that modifies and manipulates the data collected from the golf website to generate the data for presentation in the container.
- the code used by the module to collect the data from the golf website may be viewed by the golf website as a robot or other unapproved access method. This may be true particularly if the request would have been originated from a source that is unfamiliar to the golf website. For example, if the creator of such a module were a unknown operator of a website, this request may be blocked or otherwise precluded by the golf website.
- the operator of the host server system may be a known entity to the individual golf site or to the community at large. Accordingly, requests for data from this site would not ordinarily be precluded.
- a proxy server may be used to act on behalf of the module creator system to request the information from the golf site (e.g., the target collection site) by using a server associated with the host server system (the proxy server address).
- the information from the golf site may then be received by the module creator system, manipulated into a format desired by that module creator, e.g., removing all articles on a page related to the PGA tournament, highlighting information about amateur golfing, replacing names of terms in the text to suit the module creator (replacing 7 iron for mashie niblik), rearranging the content in the page to suit the module creator or any other modification, replacement, substitution, deletion, addition or action the module creator wants to apply to the data from the target collection site.
- a format desired by that module creator e.g., removing all articles on a page related to the PGA tournament, highlighting information about amateur golfing, replacing names of terms in the text to suit the module creator (replacing 7 iron for mashie niblik), rearranging the content in the page to suit the module creator or any other modification, replacement, substitution, deletion, addition or action the module creator wants to apply to the data from the target collection site.
- FIG. 11 One illustrative embodiment of such a system is depicted in FIG. 11 .
- FIG. 11 should be understood in relation to FIG. 1 in that the placement and relationship between elements as described in relation to FIG. 1 should apply to FIG. 11 as well.
- a proxy server 52 may be provided that may operate in conjunction with module server 32 and container server 12 .
- a specification server 24 may operate as the module creator system 54 as well.
- a target content server 56 is depicted.
- a module specification may be stored in a place accessible to specification server 24 .
- a target collection module may be identified.
- Module server 32 may then be called to provide the data for the module.
- Module server 32 may determine that the specification server is located at a location of specification server 24 on the network.
- the code for the target collection module may be retrieved by module server 32 from specification server 24 . That code may then be delivered to container server 12 to display to the user.
- User system 22 may open the module and, based on code in the module data, transmit a request for data from proxy server 52 to retrieve data from target content server 56 .
- the data from target content server 56 may be provided to proxy server 52 and then provided to the user system, where additional code in the module may modify and/or manipulate that data based on the code in the module. Any modifications or manipulation to that data may occur at specification server 24 and then the data may be provided to module server 32 to provide to container server 12 to generate data to the user.
- proxy server 52 and the browser systems may employ an authentication technique, such as the use of a token, as described above related to updating preferences.
- Proxy server 52 may perform requests when a specified and valid token is passed from the user system, because it was part of the module code provided to the user system.
- caching both on the proxy server and the user system may be used to expedite delivery of data and reduce the number of calls made to the target site server.
- proxy server 52 may also connect to other systems over the Internet.
- proxy server 52 may utilize an address associated with and/or approved or authorized or certified by host server system 10 to leverage the reputation of host server system 10 so that target content server 56 may respond with data.
- FIG. 12 An illustrative proxy method 1200 is depicted in FIG. 12 .
- a container document may be opened.
- a module may be identified that includes code to collect data from a target site.
- module content is transmitted in HTML to user by module server 32 .
- a user system e.g., a browser
- interprets the HTML including the code e.g., the JavaScript to collect and manipulate data
- the user system passes a request for collection of target site data to the proxy server.
- the proxy server collects data from the target site and transmits it to the user system.
- a program referred to as trawler may be used to collect data from the target site.
- Such a service typically respects the so-called robot exclusion information and host load issues, similar to techniques used to cache web page data used by web search engines.
- the user system manipulates data collected from the target site based on code in the module specification and generates display data based on the manipulated target site data.
- the user system displays a container document with manipulated (optional—the data could be the target site data without manipulation) target site data in format specified by the module.
- proxy server 52 may be operatively connected or include an analysis module 26 that performs the functionality described above in the context of proxy requests.
- proxy server 52 and analysis module 26 may analyze requests against a list of disapproved sites, disapproved actions, disapproved content, etc.
- the requests may be compared against approved site, actions, contents.
- the evaluation may be based on the location reference (e.g., URL) or the target site, the format of the request, the preference values to be provided to the target site, time, user information, module specification source, requesting system or any other input.
- the module specification may provide instructions that may control the proxy server.
- Proxy server 52 may use those instructions for operation.
- One instruction may indicate how the proxy server should obtain the data from a target site, such as by serving a fresh copy rather than using a cached version.
- Another instruction may control the cache and its operation, including indicating when the clean the cache or update the cache.
- the target sites may be able to control the proxy server operations or at least provide indications as to how it would prefer that the proxy server operate.
- a robot exclusion file (e.g., robots.txt) may be included indicating how proxy server may operate or that the proxy server may not collect data at all.
- Proxy server 52 may respect instructions provided by the target site. Mega tags may also be provided by the target sites. Other manners of providing instructions may also be provided.
- the instructions provided may indicate to proxy server 52 a number of things, including a refresh rate, attributes as to when or for whom proxy server 52 may collect content (e.g., a list of users, module specifications (by URL or otherwise denoted), types of data to be collected, etc.).
- the modification to the data may include taking data from multiple target site sources to merge results into a module output.
- a module may take a data feed from a news source and merge it with content from a blog into a single output.
- Examples may include formatting, transforming and/or reformatting RSS/Atom data feeds into an HTML output; collecting webpage HTML to create a module, e.g., for prototyping, “mashing up” content from multiple web pages and/or data feeds, applying internationalization to content, transcoding content, cleaning up “busy” content for easier presentation, including multimedia content with other forms and the like.
- Specific illustrative examples might include taking a RSS feed from a newspaper source, changing the font and adding the newspaper's logo; bolding headlines that mention a specific key word or phrase, including a fictional article periodically, turn place-names into mouse-over maps in data feeds, take data from a relatively active web site and create a module that contains essential links and/or features that a user selects and many more.
- FIG. 13 One illustrative example of a container document that includes data generated through modification of proxy data is depicted in FIG. 13 .
- a horoscope module is included in the container document that includes data collected from a horoscope RSS and then modified with text specific to the user.
- Another proxy server example is depicted in the “news” module in which news, weather and maps may be included.
- text from a news source has been collected with the term “George Bush” highlighted in the resulting information collected.
- the modules may be generated for users in a way that it is readily usable by user systems, such as browsers, without a download being required (although a download of software is certainly possible within the scope of the present invention). Users may be able to discovery content through distribution of modules that incorporate them and promotion of them on various locations. Creating a module using proxy techniques may be readily done through a set of tools that the system may publish. Further, providing a scalable back-end server for proxying and storing user preferences also provides users with the benefits of these modules.
- various embodiments of the present invention enable third parties to a host server system to create modules that are used on containers served by one or more host server systems or syndicated by one or more host server systems.
- These modules are created according to a specification that may be easy to understand and apply.
- Complex modules may be possible, e.g., https, authentication, support for resizing, access to built-in libraries, etc. and remote content creators may be able to develop and debug modules without downloading or learning a software development kit (SDK).
- SDK software development kit
- a standardized platform such as XML, may be used and thus, the actual code used may be any that may be interpreted by the user systems that eventually will display data related to the module.
- support for JavaScript and other languages, including more and richer libraries, documentation and example modules, and better debugging facilities may be provided.
- code may be generated for modules that performs custom rendering for RSS/Atom feeds.
- RSS/Atom is a technique to publish read-only content to the web, and many modules used on container pages are often read-only with links to pages offering richer interactivity.
- host server system 10 may maintain data about modules to enable reporting on their use. This may include information about each individual use of the module, history of the module, modifications to the module, syndication of the module, accounting information related to monetary values and agreements related to the module and many other types of information that may be useful for reporting on the module.
- Additional module types may be created as well, including an XHTML type or modules from other systems may be possible. Additional example modules that may be created include a module that takes RSS information and renders it into a format for inclusion in a container, including data from photoblogs, for example. Other modules may include an email reader for popular web-based email systems, such as Gmail, AOL Mail, MSN Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail. A module may be created to incorporate chat data and instant messaging data. Simple applets may be incorporated into modules such as clocks, calculators, notepads and the like. Other modules may be created that operate as an interface to online marketplaces for buyers and sellers of goods, such as eBay, Amazon and other online marketplaces. Modules may also be created for internal data for various entities. For example, intranet services of an entity may be rendered into modules for inclusion in a container.
- modules may involve users trading the URLs of module specs, e.g. through search engines, email, etc.
- an interface may be possible that allows various features to be added to a container through input of a request on another page. For example, on a golf site, there may be a link or button that says “add as a module to a container.” The container may be specified in advance or may be input from the user. That link or button would be operated based on code included by the creator of the underlying page as a way to have users include that content on their container, such as their personalized home page.
- an index of modules may be created through providing of module information to a search system, such as when the container document retrieves a module specification, it may be passed by the container server to the search system.
- a feedback module may be provided to collect feedback, statistics, and other data regarding modules, including information provided by users of modules, container document providers, target site operators and other parties involved in the system and/or network. This information and data may be presented to users through a ranking module or other module.
- a ranking module may rank modules based on feedback, approval, use, statistics or other criteria and may include a ranking based on user or editorial commentary.
- modules may be proposed based on input about the user or container page, including search history, keywords in documents viewed, etc. Other techniques may be used to promote modules for syndication as well.
- a module may be created that, based on a determination that it is trusted, modify the container document to allow the user to personalize certain elements of the container document (e.g., adding the user's name, image, features, logos, etc.).
- Another illustrative example module may obtain a list of other modules on the container page through interaction with the container page and obtain metadata about them, including, for example, the ability to modify the module(s), obtain user preferences for them.
- a developer module may be developed to inline or IFRAME other modules for testing purposes, refresh modules (e.g., flush or renew caches) and other actions.
