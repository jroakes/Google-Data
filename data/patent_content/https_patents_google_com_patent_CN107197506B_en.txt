Processing.In terms of these and other functions that user terminal is described further below.
In Fig. 2,230, when base station is in first operator scheme, base station, which also emits, has uplink access configuration
The message of information.Uplink access configuration information is usually launched into multiple user terminals.In a 3GPP LTE is realized,
Uplink accesses configuration information and is included in PDCCH message, and PDCCH message does not distribute physical down link sharing channel
(PDSCH) any resource on.In another embodiment, more than one PDCCH of Base Transmitter, each PDCCH, which have, to be addressed to
The uplink of multiple user terminals accesses configuration information.In Fig. 3,330, first based on system information of user terminal
Divide and configuration information is accessed to obtain uplink on the PDCCH for being addressed to multiple user terminals based on synchronizing information.One
In a embodiment, user terminal receives PDCCH in the beginning of subframe, and wherein the subframe includes control in the beginning of subframe
Region processed.Emit PDCCH in the control area for the beginning for being located temporarily in downlink subframe, as it allows UE to detect rapidly
Control channel (in the first few OFDM symbol of subframe), then closes its acceptor circuit to the remaining person of subframe, with
Save power (that is, exploitation " microsleep ").However, in other cases, PDCCH can also be located at certain fixations or it is variable when
Between/frequency/space resources, that is, it is carried across one or more in one or more subframes and/or one or more space layers
Wave.For example, uplink access configuration information can be placed in and logically limit that UE is specific or the specific search space of cell, and
And search space candidate is mapped in the region typical version 8PDSCH (for example, not including its remaining part of the subframe of PDCCH
Point) or be configured for enhancing or increased PDCCH transmission one group of PRB in (time/frequency/space) resource.
Under any circumstance, UE is determined based on the first part of synchronization signal, system information for by the decoded resource of access information.
Alternatively, UE can be signaled, uplink access information is detected based on the signaling from another base station.
It includes at least one of following information: uplink that the uplink obtained by user terminal, which accesses configuration information,
Road system bandwidth information；Or block of uplink resources assignment information；Or uplink frequency assignment information；Or preceding dragline
Draw；Or Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) mask index.In one embodiment, uplink accesses configuration information packet
Include signature waveform characteristic information.However, in other embodiments, previously signature waveform was stored on the subscriber terminal.It is logical
Often, PDCCH is sent by base station in downlink subframe, wherein prolonging relative to the received of PDCCH downlink subframe
After late, signature waveform is sent by user terminal.Delay can be signaled, as uplink access configuration information
A part, or can locally store delay on the subscriber terminal, as some first times.
In some embodiments, uplink access configuration information further includes uplink access waveform trigger, on this
Line link accesses waveform trigger and indicates waveform characteristic.For example, waveform trigger may include with one in the following state of instruction
The field of a one or more bits: " 0 "-instruction sends uplink and accesses waveform；Or " 1 "-instruction does not send uplink
Link accesses waveform.In other examples, uplink access waveform trigger can also include channel quality measurement threshold value (example
Such as, channel quality indicator (CQI) threshold value or reference signal receive power (RSRP) threshold value or reference signal receives matter
(RSRS) threshold value is measured, UE can use them and determine if that uplink access configuration waveform should be emitted).In addition, triggering
Device may also include counter threshold, wherein it is predetermined to allow UE only to detect in the predetermined lasting time such as indicated by threshold value when it
Just transmitting uplink accesses waveform when the message of number.These methods allow eNB while keeping the service to legal UE,
Reduce wrong signaling (because erroneous detection is without necessarily waking up).Before modulating and transmit on channel, error detection generation can be passed through
Codeization (for example, 8,16 or 24 bit cyclic redundancy codes) and/or error-correcting code (for example, convolutional code (tail or tail biting),
Turbo code, low density parity check code, Reed Solomon code etc.) and/or cell is specific or the specific scrambled code of UE is by message
Coding.
For Home eNodeB, additional triggers can be provided, wherein only legitimate user is (for example, possess ordering for Home eNodeB
Family and/or the user for allowing the power save state for modifying Home eNodeB) it can receive uplink access configuration information, or
Only legitimate user can emit uplink access configuration information.When configuring HeNB, such as during initial setting up phase
Or, by being suitably set license, this point may be implemented using during applying in the mobile device of user.Therefore, exist
During HeNB is arranged, device can reach at least first part of the predefined characteristic of uplink access waveform based on shaking hands
At consistent.Then, such as typical base station, the second part of uplink access waveform can be emitted, as earlier paragraphs are retouched
It states.Because any malice or illegal user equipment do not know first of the predefined characteristic of uplink access waveform

Fig. 5 A shows the SI transmission window 502 of the transmission for SIB (other than other SIB, including SIB1, SIB2)
Explanation.As described above, by each SIBx x=1 in SI transmission window, 2 ... codings and transmitting are multiple.Therefore, such as Fig. 5 A institute
Show, emits SI-2 (or SIB2) in first 40ms window together with SIB1.For example, Fig. 5 B is shown in SI-x transmission window

SIB1, but potentially emit SIB2 in the remaining DL subframe of 40ms SIB2 transmission window 504.Because being dispatched via PDCCH
SIBx, so having the appearance of the DL DCI format by the scrambled cyclic redundancy check of SI-RNTI (CRC) is whether subframe wraps
The indicator of the transmission containing SIBx.Therefore, SIB1 and SIB2 transmission is time-multiplexed in sub-frame level.After SIB2 transmission,

SI transmission window is restarted, as signaled in SIB1.If changing SIBx transmission window, in generally hint SIB1
The change of appearance, this implies that eNB must page the UE in cell to wake up and reacquire SI.Above-mentioned mechanism runs FDD good
It is good.For TDD system, the same concept of transmission window, wherein typically, being only considered that the DL subframe in transmission window for SI-x
(x=1,2 ...) transmission is effective.Therefore, uplink subframe is excluded when considering SI-x from the transmission of base station.However, for
ENB can dynamically assign the subframe of the uplink subframe configuration as the SI-x transmission on DL to be used for again.This requires eNB
The signaling of additional DL resource schedulable in the UL sub-frame is found including notice UE.By requiring UE can be with by UL subframe blind decoding
Realize this point, and if detecting effective PDCCH region, UE may assume that and be reconfigured and use by eNB
UL subframe, to dispatch effective DL resource.
