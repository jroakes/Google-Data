1, summarize
Embodiment based on the positioning system of balloon can be integrated with the balloon data network comprising multiple balloon; Such as, by mesh network that the High aititude balloon of affixing one's name at Middle Atmosmiddle stratosphere is formed.Because the wind in stratosphere may affect the position of balloon by different way, so each balloon in network can be configured to change its horizontal level by modulating its upright position (that is, height above sea level).Such as, by adjusting its height above sea level, balloon can find by its flatly (that is, latitude ground and/or longitude ground) deliver to the wind of the horizontal level of expectation.
In a balloon network, balloon can relative to each other move to form the topology expected in latitude ground and/or longitude ground.But, due to wind reason and may due to other reasons, it may be difficult for single balloon being remained on ad-hoc location.Therefore, the topology expected can be defined for opposing frame and/or the rule of balloon location relative to each other, makes balloon can keep the topology of expectation relative to ground moving simultaneously.Therefore, given position on earth, provides the specific balloon of service or multiple balloon to change in time.
An embodiment based on the positioning system of balloon comprises multiple balloon, and each balloon has position determination module (PDM) and position broadcast module (PBM).Each PDM is arranged to the position determining corresponding balloon, and each PBM is arranged to the balloon signal of broadcast packet containing balloon locator data.Balloon locator data comprises position and the corresponding airtime (that is, when instruction broadcasts balloon signal) of the corresponding balloon determined.This system also comprises the receiver based on ground, should be configured to receive these balloon signals based on the receiver on ground and balloon locator data based on the set be included in wherein determines its position.
PDM can be configured to the position determining corresponding balloon in every way.In one embodiment, the satellite location data that PDM can be configured to based on receiving from gps satellite determines position.In another embodiment, PDM can be configured to determine position based on measurement point (such as based on station and/or the celestial body on ground).In another embodiment, PDM can be configured to determine position based on corresponding balloon relative to the relative position of another balloon.
Embodiment based on the positioning system of balloon can provide multiple advantage.Such as, as an example, and from gps satellite to compared with the typical range of the receiver based on ground, relatively short to the typical range of the receiver based on ground from balloon.As a result, compared with parallel GPS scene, balloon signal may be stronger, and more may arrive receiver.
As another example, balloon is positioned in below ionosphere.As a result, balloon signal does not need to arrive receiver based on ground through ionosphere, and therefore they can avoid the interference based on refraction that caused by ionosphere.Again, this means that balloon signal may be stronger, and more may arrive receiver with wherein satellite-signal through compared with ionospheric parallel GPS scene.
Especially, in order to make the effect of interference based on refraction minimize, satellite-signal is broadcasted usually simultaneously on two different channel frequencys.Because balloon signal avoids such interference, so they can broadcast in individual channel frequency.In addition, with use in GPS must be configured to Received signal strength over multiple channels those compared with, this allows receiver more uncomplicated.
Although not necessarily, some embodiments based on the positioning system of balloon can comprise a large amount of balloons, comprise several thousand, several ten thousand or more.These embodiments provide the given receiver of increase and will have the further advantage of the possibility of the direct sight line of one or more balloon.Therefore, compared with being limited to the parallel GPS scene of its 32 satellite queues with wherein GPS, balloon signal more may arrive receiver.
Should be appreciated that, the advantage more than provided is only example and unrestricted.Embodiment based on the positioning system of balloon can provide additional advantage, those advantages such as more described in detail in the disclosure and/or general's those advantages apparent for those skilled in the art.

In the exemplary embodiment, balloon 102A to 102F is High aititude balloon, and they are deployed in stratosphere.At suitable latitude place, stratosphere comprises the height above sea level between about 10 kms (km) in surface and 50km.At limit place, stratosphere starts at the height above sea level place of about 8km.In the exemplary embodiment, High aititude balloon usually can be configured to have in stratosphere in the altitude ranges of lower wind speed (such as, between 5 to 20 miles per hour (mph)) and operate.
More specifically, in High aititude balloon network, balloon 102A to 102F can be configured to height above sea level place operation (although other height above sea level are also possible) between about 17km and 25km usually.This altitude ranges has profit due to some reasons.Particularly, this layer stratospheric has gentle breeze and turbulent flow (wind such as, between 5 to 20 miles per hour (mph)) usually.Further, although the wind between 17km and 25km can change with height above sea level and season, this change can carry out modeling in reasonable mode accurately.In addition, the height above sea level of more than 17km is being specified on the ceiling altitude being used for commercial aviation transport usually.Therefore, when balloon is deployed between 17km and 25km, not the problem needing to be concerned about with the interference of commercial aircraft.Relevant to this altitude ranges by more discussing in detail below, the additional advantage that especially relevant to location feature combines.
In order to transmit data to another balloon, given balloon 102A to 102F can be configured to link 104 transmitting optical signals via light.In the exemplary embodiment, given balloon 102A to 102F can use one or more High Power LED (LED) to carry out transmitting optical signal.Alternatively, some or all balloons 102A to 102F in balloon can comprise the laser system for being carried out free space optical communication by light link 104.The free space optical communication of other types is also possible.Further, in order to receive the light signal from another balloon via light link 104, given balloon 102A to 102F can comprise one or more optical receiver.The additional details of example balloon is discussed in more detail referring to Fig. 3.
In in another, balloon 102A to 102F can utilize one or more RF air interface protocols in various different RF air interface protocol for communicating with 112 with the station 106 based on ground via RF link 108.Such as, some or all balloons 102A to 102F in balloon can be configured to be used in that agreement, various cellular protocol (such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, EV-DO, WiMAX and/or LTE) and/or one or more suitable agreements of developing to the RF communication on ground for balloon of describing in IEEE 802.11 (comprising any IEEE802.11 to revise) are next communicates with 112 with the station 106 based on ground.
More on the one hand in, wherein RF link 108 can be there is not for balloon to provide the scene of the link capacity of expectation to the communication on ground.Such as, the capacity of increase can make us expecting, to provide the backhaul link from the gateway based on ground, and is also like this in other scenes.Therefore, example network can also comprise descending balloon, and this descending balloon can provide high power capacity Air-Ground to link.
Such as, in balloon network 100, balloon 102F can be configured to descending balloon.Similar with other balloons in exemplary network, descending balloon 102F can be used to and carry out optical communication via light link 104 with other balloons.But descending balloon 102F can also be arranged to and carry out free space optical communication via light link 110 with the station 112 based on ground.Therefore, light link 110 can link (linking compared with in the of 108 with RF) by the high power capacity be used as between balloon network 100 with the station 112 based on ground.
Note, in some embodiments, descending balloon 102F additionally can be used to and communicate with the station 106 based on ground.In other cases, descending balloon 102F can only use the light for balloon-ground communication to link.Further, although the layout shown in Fig. 1 only comprises a descending balloon 102F, example balloon network can also comprise multiple descending balloon.On the other hand, the balloon network without any descending balloon can also be realized.
In other embodiments, substitute free-space optical communication system or except free-space optical communication system, descending balloon can be equipped with for special, the high bandwidth RF communication system of balloon to ground communication.High bandwidth RF communication system can adopt the form of radio ultra wide band system, and it provides the RF substantially linking 104 identical capacity with light to link.Other forms are also possible.
Except based on except the communication linkage on ground or as the alternatives of the communication linkage based on ground, balloon can be configured to set up and the communication linkage based on the satellite in space.

Further, some are based on the station on ground, such as based on the station 106 and 112 on ground, can be configured to the gateway between balloon network 100 and other networks one or more.Therefore, this station 106 and 112 based on ground can be used as balloon network and the interface between internet, the network of cellular service provider and/or the network of other types.Also be possible to the change of this configuration at the station 106 and 112 based on ground and other configurations.
2a) mesh network function
As noted, balloon 102A to 102F can acting in conjunction be mesh network.More specifically, intercom mutually, so balloon can acting in conjunction be free space optical mesh network because balloon 102A to 102F can use free space optical to connect.
In mesh network topology, each balloon 102A to 102F can act as the node of mesh network, and this node operable is that reception is directed to its data and data are routed to other balloons.So, by determining the suitable sequence of the light link between source balloon and destination balloon, data can be routed to destination balloon from source balloon.The link of these light can be referred to as " light path " for the connection between source balloon and destination balloon.Further, each light link in light link can be called as one in light path " jumping ".
In order to be operating as mesh network, balloon 102A to 102F can adopt various route technology and Self-healing Algorithm.In certain embodiments, balloon network 100 can adopt self-adaptation or dynamic routing, and wherein when needs connect, the light path between source balloon and destination balloon is determined and set up, and is released in the time after a while.Further, when using self-adaptation route, dynamically can determine light path according to the state of the current state of balloon network, past state and/or prediction.
In addition, network topology can relative to each other move with balloon 102A to 102F and/or change relative to ground moving.Therefore, example balloon network 100 can apply MESH protocol upgrades network state with the change along with network topology.Such as, in order to solve the movability of balloon 102A to 102F, balloon network 100 can adopt and/or adapt to the various technology adopted in mobile ad hoc network (MANET).Other examples are also possible.
In some embodiments, balloon network 100 can be configured to transparent network mesh network.More specifically, in transparent balloon network, balloon can comprise the parts for physical exchange, and this physical exchange is the complete flash of light preceding an earthquake, and does not have any electricity related in the physics route of light signal to operate.Therefore, in the transparent configuration with light exchange, the multi-hop light path of signal through being light completely.
In other embodiments, balloon network 100 can realize opaque free space optical mesh network.In opaque configuration, some or all balloons 102A to 102F can implement light-electrical-optical (OEO) and exchange.Such as, some or all balloons can comprise the optical cross connect (OXC) that the OEO for light signal changes.Other opaque configurations are also possible.In addition, the network configuration comprising the routed path with transparent and opaque segmentation is possible.
More on the one hand in, the balloon in example balloon network 100 can realize Wave division multiplexing (WDM), and WDM can help to increase link capacity.When utilizing transparent exchange to realize WDM, can be limited by " wavelength continuity constraint " by the physics light path of balloon network.More specifically, because the exchange in transparent network is light completely, must be that identical wavelength is assigned in all light links in given light path so possible.
On the other hand, opaque configuration can avoid wavelength continuity to retrain.Particularly, the balloon in opaque balloon network can comprise the OEO exchange system for wavelength convert.As a result, balloon can at the wavelength of each the jumping place transmitting photo-signal along light path.Alternatively, light wavelength conversion can occur over just along jumping place selected by light path.
Further, various routing algorithm can be adopted in opaque configuration.Such as, in order to determine the main light path of given connection and/or one or more different backup light path, example balloon can adopt or consider Shortest path routing technology (such as dijkstra's algorithm and k shortest path) and/or edge is different with node or disjoint path by (such as Suurballe algorithm).Additionally or alternatively, the technology for maintaining certain quality of service (QoS) can be adopted when determining light path.Other technologies are also possible.
2b) position keeps (Station-Keeping) function
In one embodiment, balloon network 100 can realize the network topology that position retaining function helps provide expectation.Such as, position keeps comprising each balloon 102A to 102F and keeps relative to one or more other balloons in network and/or move to certain position (and may relative in certain position on ground).As a part for this process, each balloon 102A to 102F can realize position retaining function to determine its location of expectation in the topology expected, and if necessary, to determine the position how moving to expectation.
The topology expected can change according to particular implementation.In some cases, balloon can realize position maintenance to provide basically identical topology.In this case, given balloon 102A to 102F can realize position retaining function himself to be positioned at the adjacent balloon in balloon network 100 at a distance of substantially identical distance (or in certain distance range).
In other cases, balloon network 100 can have uneven topology.Such as, example embodiment can comprise the topology be wherein distributed in thick and fast more or less balloon area due to a variety of causes in some region.Exemplarily, in order to help to meet the higher bandwidth requirement usually in urban area, balloon can be assembled more thick and fast on urban area.For similar reason, the distribution of balloon can on land than more intensive on large water body.Other examples many of non-homogeneous topology are also possible.
More on the one hand in, the topology of example balloon network can be adaptable.Particularly, the position retaining function of the example balloon topology that balloon can be allowed to expect according to network change and adjust them and locate accordingly.Such as, one or more balloon can move to reposition to increase or to reduce the density of balloon in given area.Other examples are also possible.
In certain embodiments, balloon network 100 can adopt energy function whether should move and/or should how to move balloon to provide the topology of expectation to determine balloon.Particularly, given balloon state and near some or all the state of balloon can be input to energy function.The current state of given balloon and neighbouring balloon can be applied to the network state (such as, corresponding to the state of the topology expected) of expectation by energy function.Then, can by determining that the gradient of energy function determines the vector of the movement of the expectation indicating given balloon.Then, given balloon can determine that the suitable action taked is so that complete the movement of expectation.Such as, balloon can determine that height above sea level adjustment makes wind move balloon by the mode expected.
The control of balloon 2c) in balloon network
In certain embodiments, mesh network and/or position retaining function can be concentrated on.Such as, Fig. 2 be a diagram that the block diagram of the balloon network control system according to exemplary embodiment.Particularly, Fig. 2 shows dcs, and it comprises central control system 200 and several area control system 202A-202B.This control system can be configured to coordinate certain function for balloon network 204, and so, can be configured to some function controlling and/or coordinate for balloon 206A-206I.
In the embodiment shown, central control system 200 can be configured to communicate with balloon 206A-206I via several area control signal 202A-202C.These area control systems 202A-202C can be configured to from the balloon received communication the corresponding geographic area of they coverings and/or aggregate data, and trunking traffic and/or data are to central control system 200.Further, area control system 202A-202C can be configured to the balloon that the communication from central control system 200 is routed in their corresponding geographic areas.Such as, as shown in Figure 2, area control system 202A can between balloon 206A-206C and central control system 200 trunking traffic and/or data, area control system 202B can between balloon 206D-206F and central control system 200 trunking traffic and/or data, and area control system 202C can between balloon 206G-206I and central control system 200 trunking traffic and/or data.
In order to promote the communication before central control system 200 and balloon 206A-206I, some balloon can be configured to descending balloon, and this descending balloon is operable as and communicates with area control system 202A-202C.Therefore, each area control system 202A-202C can be configured to and the descending balloon communication in the corresponding geographic area of its covering.Such as, in the embodiment shown, balloon 206A, 206F and 206I are configured to descending balloon.So, area control system 202A-202C can communicate with 206I with balloon 206A, 206F with 210 via light connection 206,208 respectively.
In shown configuration, only some balloons wherein in balloon 206A-206I are configured to descending balloon, balloon 206A, 206F of being configured to descending balloon can act on communicate other balloons be relayed in balloon network, such as balloon 206B-206E, 206G and the 206H from central control system 200 with 206I.But should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, likely all balloons can act as descending balloon.Further, although Fig. 2 shows multiple balloon be configured to descending balloon, balloon network also only may comprise a descending balloon.
Note, in fact area control system 202A-202C can be the station based on ground of particular type, and it is configured to and descending balloon communication (such as, the station 112 based on ground of Fig. 1).Therefore, although not shown in fig. 2, can combine to realize control system with the station based on ground of other types (such as, access point, gateway etc.).
In the control of concentrating is arranged, as shown in Figure 2 all, central control system 200 (and also Probability Area control system 202A-202C) can coordinate some the mesh network function for balloon network 204.Such as, balloon 206A-206I can send certain status information to central control system 200, and central control system 200 can utilize this status information to determine the state of balloon network 204.Status information from given balloon can comprise the information of position data, light link information (such as, the identity of other balloons of light link set up by this balloon with it, the bandwidth of link, the wavelength that chains use and/or availability etc.), the wind data collected by balloon and/or other types.Therefore, central control system 200 can assemble status information from some or all balloons 206A-206I so that determine the overall status of network.
Then, the overall status of network can be used to coordinate and/or promote some mesh network function, such as determines the light path connected.Such as, central control system 200 can determine present topology based on the status information of the polymerization from some or all balloons 206A-206I.The picture that topology can provide current light link available in balloon network and/or the wavelength availability chained.Then, this topology can be sent to some or all balloons in balloon, makes it possible to the suitable light path (with possible backup light path) using route technology to select for the communication by balloon network 204.
In in another, central control system 200 (and possible area control system 202A-202C) can also coordinate some position retaining function for balloon network 204.Such as, the status information received from balloon 206A-206I can be inputed to energy function by central control system 200, the present topology of network and the topology of expectation can compare by this energy function effectively, and provide instruction for the vector of the moving direction (if existence) of each balloon, balloon can be moved towards the topology expected.Further, central control system 200 can use the wind data of height to determine that corresponding height above sea level adjusts, and the adjustment of this height above sea level can be initiated to realize the movement towards the topology expected.Central control system 200 also can provide and/or support other position retaining functions.
Fig. 2 shows provides central controlled distributed arrangement, and area control system 202A-202C coordinates the communication between central control system 200 and balloon network 204.This layout provides centralized control to be useful for the balloon network for covering large geographic area.In certain embodiments, distributed arrangement even can be supported to provide the global balloon network covering each place on the earth.It also can be useful in other scenes that distributed AC servo system is arranged in.
Further, should be appreciated that, it is possible that other control system is arranged.Such as, some embodiments can comprise the centralized control system with extra play (subregion system such as, in area control system etc.).Alternatively, can by directly providing controlling functions with the single concentrated control system of one or more descending balloon communication.
In certain embodiments, according to embodiment, balloon network-based control and coordination can to share in various degree between the gentle net network of control system based on ground.In fact, in certain embodiments, the control system based on ground can not be there is.In such an embodiment, all-network control and coordination function can be realized by balloon network self.Such as, some balloon can be configured to provide and central control system 200 and/or the same or analogous function of area control system 202A-202C.Other examples are also possible.
In addition, balloon network-based control and/or coordination can be decentralized.Such as, each balloon can to the balloon relay state information near some or all and the status information received from the balloon near some or all.Further, each balloon relays status information that it can be received from a neighbouring balloon is to the balloon near some or all.When all balloons all so operate, each balloon can determine the state of network independently.Alternatively, some balloon can be designated as the given moiety aggregation status information for network.Then, these balloons can coordinate the overall status determining network mutually.
Further, in certain aspects, balloon network-based control can a part or whole part be localized, and makes it not rely on the integrality of network.Such as, single balloon can realize the position retaining function only considering neighbouring balloon.Particularly, each balloon can realize energy function, and this energy function considers the state of himself state and neighbouring balloon.Energy function can be used to the position keeping and/or move to the expectation relative to neighbouring balloon, and need not consider the topology of the expectation of network as a whole.But when each balloon realizes this energy function for position maintenance, balloon network can keep the topology of expectation as a whole and/or move towards the topology expected.
Exemplarily, each balloon A can receive the range information d relative to each adjacent balloon in its k immediate adjacent balloon
1-d
k.Distance to each balloon in k balloon can be considered as virtual spring by each balloon A, and this virtual spring has the vector and and d that represent from the first nearest neighbor balloon i towards the force direction of balloon A
iproportional power size.Balloon A can by each vector addition in k vector, and the vector be added is the vector of the movement of expectation for balloon A.Balloon A can attempt by controlling its height above sea level to realize the movement expected.
Alternatively, such as, this process can be assigned to each fictitious force in these fictitious forces and be equaled d
i× d
ipower size, wherein d
iproportional with the distance of the second nearest neighbor balloon.
In another embodiment, similar procedure can be performed to each balloon in k balloon and the mobile vector that each balloon can plan transfers to its locally adjacent balloon.The refinement entering to take turns of the mobile vector of the plan to each balloon can be made based on the mobile vector of the correspondence plan of its adjacent balloon.Other algorithms can be realized in balloon network so that one group of balloon spacing remaining on above given geographic position and/or specific network capacity grade by it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that.

PDM 504 can be configured in every way, such as comprise use based on GPS, based on measure and/or the position of determining corresponding balloon 502 based on relative technology.In certain embodiments, PDM 504 can be configured to the part or the combination that use these technology and other technologies.
4a) use the position determination module based on the technology of GPS
In one embodiment, PDM 504 can use the technology based on GPS to determine the position of corresponding balloon 502.Figure 6 illustrates the example system that can use this technology.Particularly, Fig. 6 shows the block diagram of the simplification of the positioning system 600 based on balloon, and should have multiple gps satellite 602A-602E and two balloon 604A and 604B based on the positioning system 600 of balloon, each balloon has corresponding PDM 606 and PBM 608.Each PDM 606 is configured to use the technology based on GPS to determine the position of corresponding balloon 604.Each satellite 602 is traditional gps satellite and is configured to the respective satellite signal 610 of broadcast packet containing satellite location data, and this satellite location data can comprise the position of respective satellite 602 and corresponding airtime.
Each PDM 606 comprises gps receiver and antenna system.Each gps receiver be configured to use now the known or technology (such as by use pseudo random binary sequence code) that finds after a while via the one or more satellite-signals in corresponding antenna system reception satellite-signal 610.Note, identical satellite-signal 610 can once be broadcasted by satellite 602 and be received (such as satellite-signal 610C and 610D) by multiple balloon 604.
Each PDM 606 is configured to further by applying to the satellite location data be included in the satellite-signal 610 that receives the position that one or more position treatment technologies determine corresponding balloon 604.Position treatment technology can comprise the known or technology that finds after a while now.Such as, PDM 606 can determine the position of corresponding balloon 604 to the satellite location data application triangulation technique from least three satellites 602.
Note, although can be enough to use triangulation technique to determine the position of balloon 604 from the satellite location data of three satellites 602, but still the satellite location data from additional satellite can be expected.Such as, the satellite location data from four satellites 602 may be needed to determine the height above sea level (that is, except its longitude and dimension position) of balloon 604 further.Equally, along with the satellite location data from more satellites 602 is received and process, PDM 606 more accurately can determine the position of balloon 604.So, although the example embodiment in Fig. 6 shows PDM 606A and 606B and receives four and three satellite-signals respectively, but should be appreciated that, in certain embodiments, can receive and process many satellite-signals (that is, comprising the satellite location data from other satellites 602) to determine the position of corresponding balloon 604.
Embodiment based on the positioning system 600 of balloon combines reception and the expectation processed from multiple satellite-signals of different satellite 602 provides specific advantage.Particularly, the High aititude of given balloon 606 is arranged, gps receiver on each balloon, such as compared with the gps receiver based on ground, have the possibility had with the increase of the sight line of multiple satellite 602, ground GPS receiver may have its potential sight line stopped by buildings or other objects based on ground.
In addition, even if be arranged in open environment (such as, outdoor) based on the gps receiver on ground, it also only has the sight line of the most about 11 to 12 satellites usually.This is because the earth itself act as barrier.But based in the positioning system of balloon, the High aititude of balloon arranges that reducing the earth will be the possibility of barrier.Really, the given gps receiver on balloon all may have the sight line of nearly 13 even more satellites 602 at any given time.
As another advantage, there is the overlying regions operation of ground interference wherein in the gps receiver be included on balloon usually.Further, due to relatively short satellite-signal path (such as, compared with the classical satellite signal gone to based on the receiver on ground) always, signal attenuation is lower and the signal intensity received (RSS) is higher.
In an alternative embodiment, PDM 606 can be adapted to similarly with non-gps satellite and/or now other positioning systems that are known or that find after a while cooperate.
4d) use the position determination module based on the technology measured
In another embodiment, PDM 504 can use the position determining corresponding balloon 502 based on the technology measured.Fig. 7 shows the block diagram of the simplification of the positioning system 700 based on balloon comprising the balloon 702 with PDM 704 and PBM 706.System 700 comprises a kind of or multiple measurement point further, such as based on station 708A-708C and/or the celestial body 710 on ground.PDM 704 is configured to use the technology based on measuring, such as by considering the position determining balloon 702 based on the station 708 on ground and/or celestial body 710.
In one embodiment, PDM 704 can be configured to by analyzing based on the imaging data (such as, obtaining from the frequency still camera be included in PDM) at the station on ground and/or identifying the specific station 708 based on ground by using any communication connection of describing in this disclosure to communicate with the station 708 based on ground.According to the mark at the station 708 based on ground, PDM704 (such as, from look-up table) can determine the position at the station based on ground.
PDM 704 can also be configured to determine balloon 702 and based on ground station 708 between measurement, such as by analyzing imaging data further and/or by a kind of communication linkage in the communication linkage disclosed in using.Such as, PDM 704 can be configured to by use balloon 702 and based on ground station 708 between light chain fetch and determine this measurement.Except being provided for the mode exchanging representative network and other data, light link can be used to measuring distance.Such as, balloon 702 can by optical signal transmission to the station 708 based on ground, and this light signal comprises the time sending signal.When receiving the light signal of band timestamp, land station 708 can determine that light signal is advanced the spent time between balloon 702 and the station 708 based on ground.Then, based on the known speed of determined traveling time and light signal, can determine balloon 702 and based on ground station 708 between distance.
By determining from the distance of balloon 702 to the three or more station 708 based on ground and the position at each station based on ground, PDM 706 can use now the known or position treatment technology developed after a while to determine the position of balloon 702.

In certain embodiments, the data obtained from the inertia be included in PDM 708 or other sensors (such as, wind sensor) can be used to the position of the determination adjusting balloon 706 further.Similarly, the flight time measurement for balloon 706 can be considered.
4c) use the position determination module based on relative technology
In another embodiment, PDM can use the position determining balloon 502 based on relative technology.Fig. 8 illustrates the block diagram of the simplification illustrating the positioning system 800 based on balloon with balloon 802A-802D.Each balloon 802 has corresponding PDM 804 and PBM 806.In the embodiment shown, can suppose that balloon 802A-802D has determined they self relevant position (that is, utilize them corresponding PDM 804).
Exemplarily, PDM 804A can be configured to use the position determining balloon 802A based on relative technology, namely based on the known location of balloon 802B-802D and the balloon 802A relative position relative to balloon 802B-802D.In one embodiment, PDM 804A can be configured to by using the balloon running through disclosure description to connect to a kind of balloon in balloon communication link the known location determining balloon 802B to balloon communication.Such as, balloon 802A can send position requests via free space optical link to balloon 802B.Responsively, its position can be sent to balloon 802A via light link by balloon 802B.
Similarly, PDM 804A can be configured to use described by communication linkage in a kind of communication chain fetch and determine the relative position of balloon 802A relative to balloon 802B.Such as, balloon 802A can send light signal to balloon 802B, and this light signal comprises the time sending signal.When receiving the light signal of band timestamp, balloon 802B can determine that light signal is advanced the spent time between balloon.Then, based on traveling time and the known speed of light signal, PDM 804 can determine the distance between two balloons.
Note, the communication via light link is especially effective at High aititude place, such as when the balloon in the embodiment for the positioning system based on balloon is to balloon communication.At this height above sea level place, air comprises minimum dust, water and can the aerosol of stray light signal.
Then, PDM 804A can repeat said process to determine the relative position of balloon 802A relative to each balloon in residue balloon 802C and 802D.Then, these relative positions can be transmitted in system 800, make each balloon 802 can determine its position relative to the every other balloon 802 in system.As a result, once a balloon in balloon 802 is such as by using a kind of location determination techniques in above-mentioned location determination techniques to determine its position, each balloon in system 800 can determine its position.
4d) position broadcast module
Turn back to Fig. 5, looked back each balloon 502 and comprised the PBM 506 being configured to broadcast (such as, via antenna) and comprising the corresponding balloon signal 508 of balloon locator data.Balloon locator data comprises the position (that is, as determined by corresponding PDM 504) of the corresponding balloon determined and corresponding airtime.Balloon receiver 510 is configured to the one or more balloon signal in balloon signal 508 and determines its position based on the balloon locator data of the set be contained in wherein.Such as, as shown in Figure 5, receiver 510 can receive balloon signal 508A-508D, and they comprise the balloon locator data for each balloon in balloon 502A-502D jointly.Then, receiver can process balloon locator data to determine its position by position treatment technology that is known or that find after a while now.
Note, in certain embodiments, each PBM 506 can broadcast corresponding balloon signal 508 in individual channel frequency.Specific advantage on the conventional alignment systems this providing such as GPS, in GPS for the object of attempting the delay detecting and eliminate caused by the interference based on refraction usually simultaneously at two different channel frequency (being generally at the L1 of 1575.42Mhz and the L2 at 1227.6Mhz place) above broadcast satellite signals.Look back the height due to gps satellite, directly sent to the satellite-signal based on the receiver on ground to pass ionosphere, and be therefore subject to such interference.
Due to gps satellite broadcast satellite signals on two channel frequencys, so traditional gps receiver must be configured to reception two channel frequencys.On the other hand, in the embodiment of the positioning system based on balloon, wherein balloon signal transmits in individual channel frequency, and corresponding receiver only needs to be configured to receive individual channel frequency.In addition, this allows receiver more uncomplicated, and therefore, usual production cost is lower.Note, the individual channel frequency used can be any characteristic frequency, although in selected embodiment, it is different from the frequency of L1 and L2 or other conventional frequencies to reduce or to avoid potential interference.
Further, because balloon may be advanced with relatively slow speed (that is, compared with gps satellite), so receiver does not need to compensate the Doppler shift (Doppler shifts) as used when gps receiver.Again, complexity and the production cost of receiver is it reduced.
4e) other example advantages
In the context of GPS, receiver can not determine its position usually, because it can not receive the signal of being broadcasted by one or more gps satellite.These signals are difficult to due to many reasons arrive gps receiver, such as due to weak signal intensity and due to reflection, refraction and/or multipath propagation the signal disturbing that causes.Attempting to make in the process about the minimise issues of weak signal strength, GPS adopts Serial No. spread spectrum (DSSS) coding techniques, and this technology strengthens signal intensity by utilizing the amount of bandwidth increased.But this technology only marginally enhances signal intensity.
As above noting, gps satellite orbits the earth at the height of approximate 20000km usually.The result of so long distance of advancing as satellite-signal, signal attenuation is usually comparatively large, even if it is also like this for utilizing DSSS to encode.On the other hand, based in the positioning system of balloon, to advance fully shorter distance from the balloon balloon signal be sent to based on the receiver on ground.In one embodiment, balloon signal is advanced the distance in the scope of about 17km to 25km.Further, the balloon signal going to receiver comes from below ionosphere, and therefore can not suffer the above-mentioned interference based on refraction.For those reasons, compared with parallel GPS scheme, signal may be stronger, and more may arrive receiver.
Finally, when in some environment in such as city of given gps receiver, high constructure or other objects may stop or undesired signal.As discussed above, some embodiments based on the positioning system of balloon can comprise a large amount of balloons disposed across stratosphere.Some embodiments can comprise several thousand, several ten thousand even more balloons.As a result, any given receiver based on ground all may have the sight line to many balloons, and in certain embodiments, once nearly 50-100 is individual.As a result, compared with such as may having the gps receiver of the sight line of the most about 11 to 12 gps satellites, receiver has the larger possibility that can receive balloon signal.
