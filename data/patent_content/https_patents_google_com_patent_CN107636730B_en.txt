<character object>
One aspect of the present invention is the ability of any scaling primarily two-dimensional role and assets.The form of vectogram can be used
To indicate primarily two-dimensional role and assets.It can complete to scale by adjusting the parameter in vectogram object.For example, role
Head can be represented as semicircle in vectogram object.It in this case, can be by changing in the vectogram object
Half diameter of a circle adjusts the size of shown head.In a similar way, the arm of role can be represented as ellipse.It can be with
The size of shown arm is adjusted by changing elliptical length or width.It in this case, can be by with identical
The other objects of scaling reflect the size variation of shown object.
One aspect of the present invention be maintain basic role part with the hierarchical data structure of such as JSON or XML can
Adjustment parameter.One aspect of the present invention is, when user changes the size of shown role part, the size through adjusting,
E.g. change relative to the percentage of the initial value of the parameter of the basic role, is stored in for respective corners color part
In JSON object.For example, the head object for being represented as semicircle can have diameter parameters.The numerical value of the diameter parameters can be
20%, this refers to the 20% of the diameter of the head of basic role.By being standardized to role and assets, by those Standardization Sectors
Divide any primarily two-dimensional role constituted with assets that can zoom in and out to common parameters set.In other words, it is stored in
Parameter in JSON object can be associated with many basic roles.It can in addition, providing scaling using role part for object
Avoid problem associated with more complicated object is scaled as in the state of the art.
Then, one aspect of the present invention is the character object data format for being represented as JSON object, described JSON pairs
As the scaled data for maintaining to be used for basic role and associated assets.Moreover, when repainting two-dimensional character, it can be in JSON
Scaled data is updated in object.
The example character object data format for being represented as JSON object is shown in Fig. 4.JSON object defines attribute-
Value pair.In the example character object data format of Fig. 4, role part is object, they all have relative to primarily two-dimensional angle
The ratio of color.Ratio corresponds to the numerical value of scaled basic role.Role's partial objects may include: arm, leg, head, body
Body and clothes.Arm object 501 can be used to define the both arms of character object.As an alternative, arm object can be used to list
Solely define each arm.
Arm object 501 can have attribute " x ", and the width of instruction arm is basic role object (multiple) arm
Width percentage.Arm object 501 can have attribute " y ", indicate that the height of the arm is basic role object
The percentage of the height of (multiple) arm.
The percentage can be the numerical value less than 100%, and such as 50%, and may be greater than 100% numerical value, such as
150%.In other words, the part of basic role can be zoomed in or out relative to basic role part.
In a similar manner, leg object 503 can be used for the both legs of character object.As an alternative, leg object can be used to
Individually define every leg.
Leg object 503 can have the attribute " x " of the width percentage of the leg for basic role and for basic angle
The attribute " y " of the height percent of the leg of color.
Head each of object 505 and body object 507 may have for being based respectively on associated basic role
Head and body width percentage attribute " x " and height percent attribute " y ".
In the case where clothes and accessories, clothes object 506 maintains the prefix for asset file title.With this side
Formula creates assets object for associated basic object.Initially, character object can have clothes attribute, clothes attribute tool
There is the numerical value for indicating blank assets.Clothes attribute can be specified with alternative value when assets are replaced by alternative assets.
The other parameters of character object may include skin and hair color.In addition, the optional parameters of character object can be with
Including theme (theme).In the exemplary embodiment, theme can be movement, school, contemporary games or film etc., indication clothing
Clothes and animation classification.As an example, theme can be NBA basketball, in such a case, it is possible to for team's underlying assets
Specific NBA team customizes character object.In the exemplary embodiment, team can have the related joint debugging for special team color
Colour table can be used to the color that modification is designated as to modify the region that colors in of theme.
<animation object>
In order to be reduced to the animation creation of a large amount of two-dimensional characters, in the way of being similar to character object, moved for providing
The data for drawing type can be stored with hierarchical data structure.It is dynamic for establishing to each role that such method alleviates creation
The needs of the code of picture.
One aspect of the present invention is the animation for indicating to be applied to the animation effect of any scaled two-dimensional character
Data object.In other words, animation data object provides the animation data for two-dimensional character, and wherein the type of data is independent
In the scale of role.Then, single animation data object can be applied to the two-dimensional character of any any scale.
For example, role SVG object leg can be defined as include (multiple) joint geometric element.Given such table
Show, configures annotating data object to provide the sequence rotated from the limb rotating of such as leg of the relative position of glenoid and joint
