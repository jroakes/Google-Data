- cards can be presented at a determined time by hardware processor 402 on user device 312 directing display/audio drivers 410 to present the card and any accompanying content to display/audio output 412.
- Process 501 can begin by requesting cards with suggestions of media content to present to a user at 503.
- the request can be sent from a user device to an external device, such as card server 302.
- Requests for cards with suggestions of media content can be made at any suitable frequency, and the determination of whether to send a request can be made based on any suitable information.
- a request for cards can be sent at a fixed frequency (e.g., once per second, once per minute, once per hour, or any other suitable frequency).
- a request for cards can be sent based on a user's activity.
- a request for cards can be sent when it is determined that a user has submitted a search query pertaining to media content.
- a request for cards can be sent when it is determined that a user has just arrived at the user's home.
- process 502 can begin by determining media content to suggest to a user at 504.
- the media content can be determined based on any suitable information.
- the information can include information about a user device, the presence of detected nearby device(s), a user's preferences, a user's past choices, aggregate ratings of media content, current events, and/or any other suitable information.
- the information can indicate that a user has previously watched a particular television program, and the information can therefore indicate that the particular television program is a candidate for suggestion to the user.
- the information can indicate that a user has previously watched situational comedies frequently, and the information can therefore indicate another television program within the genre of situational comedies is a candidate for suggestion to the user.
- Process 502 can determine the probabilities of a user watching the media content at one or more points in time at 505.
- the one or more points in time can include any suitable times and any suitable number of times.
- the points in time can include the current time and any times in the future over any suitable time period.
- the points in time can include points in time such as the current time, an hour from the current time, six hours from the current time, the next day, the next weekend, or any other suitable points in time.
- the determined probabilities can include a probability of a user watching the media content at the one or more points in time, and, in some implementations, each probability can be different.
- the determined probabilities can indicate that the probability of the user watching the media content now is 0.8, the probability of the user watching the media content 6 hours from now is 0.2, the probability of the user watching the media content tomorrow morning is 0.4, and/or any other suitable probability corresponding to the media content and a point in time.
- Any suitable method for determining the probabilities can be used. For example, information from multiple factors can be combined to determine the probabilities. As a more particular example, in some implementations, information regarding a user device, the presence of detected nearby device(s), a user's preferences regarding the media content, aggregate group preferences regarding the media content, a user's preferences regarding content viewing at one or more points in time, aggregate group preferences regarding content viewing at one or more points in time, and a user's location can be used to generate a model of the probabilities of the user watching the media content, as shown in and described in connection with FIG. 6.
- Process 502 can create card(s) suggesting media content based on the determined probabilities at 506.
- the card(s) can contain any suggestions for suitable times for watching the media content. For example, a card can be created suggesting that a user watch the media content at the point in time with the highest determined probability. As a more particular example, if the determined probabilities suggest that a user is most likely (with the highest determined probability) to watch a particular program at 9 p.m., a card can be created which suggests that the user watch the program at 9 p.m. Any suitable number of cards (including none) can be created by process 502 at 506.
- a pre-determined threshold e.g., 0.2, 0.5, or any other suitable threshold.
- process 502 can create cards corresponding to all points in time where the determined probabilities of a user watching the media content exceed a pre-determined threshold (e.g., a probability of greater than 0.5 or any other pre-determined threshold).
- a pre-determined threshold e.g., a probability of greater than 0.5 or any other pre-determined threshold.
- process 502 can create cards corresponding to the top N points in time, where N can be any suitable number less than or equal to the number of points in time.
- Process 502 can determine time(s) to present the created card(s) at 507. Any suitable time(s) can be determined including the current time and/or any suitable time in the future. For example, it can be determined that a card which was created at block 506 should be presented the next day. Any suitable mechanism for determining the time for card presentation can be used. For example, in some implementations, the future times can be determined based on the time suggested on the created cards. As a more particular example, if a card suggesting that a user watch a particular program on Sunday was created at block 506, process 502 can determine that the card should be presented on Saturday. As another particular example, if a card suggesting that a user watch a particular program which begins in one hour was created, process 502 can determine that the card should be presented at the current time.
- Process 502 can transmit the created cards and the determined times at 508.
- the cards and/or the times can be transmitted from any suitable device (e.g., card server 302) to any suitable device (e.g., a user device 312).
- process 502 can loop back to 504 and wait for another request to determine media content to suggest.
- process 501 can receive one or more cards with suggestions of media content and one or more times to present the cards at 509.
- the cards and times can be received by any suitable device, for example, a user device 312.
- Process 501 can store the received cards and the received times to present the cards at 510.
- the cards and the times can be stored in any suitable location (e.g., in memory 404 of a user device 312).
- Process 501 can wait for the times to present the cards at 511. As a particular example, if the time to present a received card is six hours from the current time, process 501 can wait for six hours. Note that in some implementations, each card received at 509 can have a different corresponding time to present the card, and process 501 can therefore wait a different amount of time for each card.
- Process 501 can determine if it is time to present a card at 512. Determination of if it is time to present a card can be implemented with any suitable mechanism. For example, in some implementations, process 501 can iterate through each card and each card's time for presentation in a set of stored cards and determine whether or not the current time matches the time for presentation. [0064] If, at 512, it is determined that the time to present a card has not arrived, process
- 501 can loop back to 511 and continue waiting for the time to present a card.
- process 501 can cause the card to be presented on a user interface at 513.
- the card can be presented with any suitable mechanism and with any suitable accompanying content, as described in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2.
- process 501 After process 501 causes the card to be presented at 513, process 501 can loop back to 503 to request another card with suggestions of media content.
- the media content can be a particular instance of media content, for example, a particular television program, news broadcast, concert, movie, or any other suitable media content.
- the media content can be a more general type of media content, for example, a genre of media content (e.g., situation comedies, dramas, documentaries, concerts in general, news in general, or any other genre).
- Process 600 can be implemented on any suitable one or more devices.
- process 600 can be partially or fully implemented on a data server 306, which can contain information received in blocks of process 600.
- process 600 can be partially or fully implemented on card server 302.
- information received in blocks of process 600 can be sent from data server 306 to card server 302 via communication network 310.
