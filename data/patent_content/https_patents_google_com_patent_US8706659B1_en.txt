Definitions
- This specification relates to training and selecting a predictive model.
- Predictive analytics generally refers to techniques for extracting information from data to build a model that can predict an output from a given input. Predicting an output can include predicting future trends or behavior patterns, or performing sentiment analysis, to name a few examples.
- Various types of predictive models can be used to analyze data and generate predictive outputs.
- a predictive model is trained with training data that includes input data and output data that mirror the form of input data that will be entered into the predictive model and the desired predictive output, respectively.
- the amount of training data that may be required to train a predictive model can be large, e.g., in the order of gigabytes or terabytes.
- the number of different types of predictive models available is extensive, and different models behave differently depending on the type of input data. Additionally, a particular type of predictive model can be made to behave differently, for example, by adjusting the hyper-parameters or via feature induction or selection.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving over a network predictive modeling training data from a client computing system.
- the training data and multiple training functions obtained from a repository of training functions are used to train multiple predictive models.
- a score is generated for each of the trained predictive models, where each score represents an estimation of the effectiveness of the respective trained predictive model.
- a first trained predictive model is selected from among the trained predictive models based on the generated scores. Access to the first trained predictive model is provided to the client computing system.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Using the training data to train each of the predictive models and generating a score for each of the trained predictive models can include partitioning the training data into k partitions, performing k-fold cross-validation and generating a cross-validation score for each of the trained predictive models that indicates the accuracy of the trained predictive model, where k is an integer greater than 1.
- Providing access to the first trained predictive model can include providing access to the first trained predictive model trained with all k partitions of the training data.
- the multiple training functions can include two or more training functions for training predictive models of a same type, where each predictive model is trained with a different training function.
- the multiple training functions can include two or more training functions for training predictive models of a same type, where each predictive model is trained with a different hyper-parameter configuration.
- Providing access to the first trained predictive model can include providing a universal resource locator (URL) to the client computing system that identifies the first trained predictive model as an addressable resource.
- a training request can be received over the network over an HTTP connection at a universal resource locator (URL) address.
- URL universal resource locator
- Generating a score for each of the trained predictive models can include generating an estimate of resource usage costs for each of the trained predictive models and generating the score based at least in part on the estimates.
- the training data includes at least a gigabyte of training data. In another example, the training data includes at least a terabyte of training data.
- the multiple trained predictive models can include (without limitation) a Na ⁇ ve Bayes model, a Perceptron model, a Support Vector Machine model, a linear regression model, a logistic regression model, and/or a k-nearest neighbor model.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of uploading predictive modeling training data over a network to a server system.
- An address to access a trained predictive model trained using the training data and selected from multiple predictive models based on an estimation of an effectiveness of each of the trained predictive models in modeling the training data is received from the server system.
- Input data and a request for a predictive output is sent to the address to access the trained predictive model.
- the predictive output generated by the trained predictive model based on the input data is received.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving over a network multiple sets of predictive modeling training data from a first set of multiple client computing systems.
- the training data and multiple training functions obtained from the repository are used to train multiple predictive models.
- a score is generated for each of the trained predictive models, where each score represents an estimation of the effectiveness of the respective trained predictive model.
- a trained predictive model is selected from among the multiple trained predictive models based on the generated scores. Multiple trained predictive models are thereby generated. Access to the multiple trained predictive models is provided to a second set of multiple client computing systems.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Data can be received from a first client computing system included in the first set of multiple client computing systems indicating that permission is granted to a second client computing system included in the second set of multiple client computing systems for the second client computing system to access the trained predictive model that was trained using training data received from the first client computing system.
- a predictive model can be selected for a client computing system based on an exploration of multiple different predictive models.
- An optimal type of predictive model for the particular type of input data that will be supplied by the client computing system can thereby be selected.
- the training, selection, and prediction operations can occur remote from the client computing system, i.e., over a network (or “in the cloud”), and therefore can be performed in a way that avoids expending client-side resources, both computing resources and human resources.
- Large volumes of training data can be used to train a predictive model, for example, in the order of gigabytes or terabytes.
- Access to the trained predictive model can be integrated into a client's application, for example, a web-based application.
- Requests to the trained predictive model for a predictive output can be automated within the client's web-based application.
- a predictive modeling server system that performs the training, selection and prediction operations remote to the client computing system can from time to time, or continually, update the server system and improve the training, selection and/or prediction operations. For example, new training functions, hyper-parameter searching, feature induction or selection procedures can be applied to existing training data sets to provide improved models for existing training data.
- the client computing system can thereby be provided with access to an improved trained predictive model, without any additional client-side expenditure of resources. Additional sources of knowledge (e.g. similar training data) can be integrated into training without additional client-side support.

- the client computing system can also include “clients of the client”. For example, if the client computing system provides a service, such as a web-based application, an end-user client computer (i.e., a computer used by a customer of the client) can send a request for a predictive output to the predictive modeling server system 109 directly, in which instance the end-user client computer is included in the description of the client computing system.

- the client computing system 202 receives access to a trained predictive model, for example, trained model 218 (Step 304 ).
- the trained model 218 is not itself provided to the client computing system 202 .
- the trained model 218 resides and executes at a location remote to the client computing system 202 .

- the training data can be provided using a comma-separated value format, or a sparse vector format.
- the client computing system 202 can specify a protocol buffer definition and upload training data that complies with the specified definition.
- the process 400 and system 200 will be described using an example that is typical of how predictive analytics are often used.
- the client computing system 202 provides a web-based online shopping service.
- the training data includes multiple records, where each record provides the online shopping transaction history for a particular customer.
- the record for a customer includes the dates the customer made a purchase and identifies the item or items purchased on each date.
- the client computing system 202 is interested in predicting a next purchase of a customer based on the customer's online shopping transaction history.
- the training data is uploaded using an HTTP web service.
- the client computing system 202 can access storage objects using a RESTful API to upload and to store their training data on the predictive modeling server system 206 .
- the training data is uploaded using a hosted execution platform, e.g., AppEngine available from Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.
- the training data can be large, e.g., many gigabytes.
- the predictive modeling server system 206 can include a data store, e.g., the training data store 214 , operable to store the received training data.
- the predictive modeling server system 206 includes a repository of training functions for various predictive models, which in the example shown are included in the predictive model store 216 .
- types of predictive models include (without limitation) regression models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression), classification and regression tree models, multivariate adaptive regression spline models and other machine learning models (e.g., Na ⁇ ve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Perceptron).
- Multiple predictive models which can be all or a subset of the available predictive models, are trained using some or all of the training data (Step 404 ).
- a model training module 212 is operable to train the multiple predictive models.
- a training function is applied to the training data to generate a set of parameters. These parameters form the trained predictive model. For example, to train (or estimate) a Na ⁇ ve Bayes model, the method of maximum likelihood can be used.
- a given type of predictive model can have more than one training function. For example, if the type of predictive model is a linear regression model, more than one different training function for a linear regression model can be used with the same training data to generate more than one trained predictive model.
- a predictive model can be trained with different features, again generating different trained models.
- the selection of features i.e., feature induction, can occur during multiple iterations of computing the training function over the training data.
- feature conjunction can be estimated in a forward stepwise fashion in a parallel distributed way enabled by the computing capacity of the predictive modeling server system, i.e., the data center.
- each type of predictive model may have multiple training functions and that multiple hyper-parameter configurations and selected features may be used for each of the multiple training functions
- trained predictive models there are many different trained predictive models that can be generated.
- different trained predictive models perform differently. That is, some can be more effective than others.
- the effectiveness of each of the trained predictive models is estimated (Step 406 ).
- a model selection module 214 is operable to estimate the effectiveness of each trained predictive model.
- cross-validation is used to estimate the effectiveness of each trained predictive model.
- a 10-fold cross-validation technique is used.
- Cross-validation is a technique where the training data is partitioned into sub-samples. A number of the sub-samples are used to train an untrained predictive model, and a number of the sub-samples (usually one) is used to test the trained predictive model. Multiple rounds of cross-validation can be performed using different sub-samples for the training sample and for the test sample.
- K-fold cross-validation refers to portioning the training data into K sub-samples. One of the sub-samples is retained as the test sample, and the remaining K ⁇ 1 sub-samples are used as the training sample. K rounds of cross-validation are performed, using a different one of the sub-samples as the test sample for each round. The results from the K rounds can then be averaged, or otherwise combined, to produce a cross-validation score. 10-fold cross-validation is commonly used.
- the effectiveness of each trained predictive model is estimated by performing cross-validation to generate a cross-validation score that is indicative of the accuracy of the trained predictive model, i.e., the number of exact matches of output data predicted by the trained model when compared to the output data included in the test sub-sample.
- one or more different metrics can be used to estimate the effectiveness of the trained model. For example, cross-validation results can be used to indicate whether the trained predictive model generated more false positive results than true positives and ignores any false negatives.
- techniques other than, or in addition to, cross-validation can be used to estimate the effectiveness.
- the resource usage costs for using the trained model can be estimated and can be used as a factor to estimate the effectiveness of the trained model.
- the predictive modeling server system 206 operates independently from the client computing system 202 and selects and provides the trained model 218 as a specialized service.
- the expenditure of both computing resources and human resources and expertise to select the untrained predictive models to include in the predictive model store 216 , the training functions to use for the various types of available predictive models, the hyper-parameter configurations to apply to the training functions and the feature-inductors all occurs server-side. Once these selections have been completed, the training and model selection can occur in an automated fashion with little or no human intervention, unless changes to the server system 206 are desired.
- the client computing system 202 thereby benefits from access to a trained model 318 that otherwise might not have been available to the client computing system 202 , due to limitations on client-side resources.
- each trained model is assigned a score that represents the effectiveness of the trained model.
- the criteria used to estimate effectiveness can vary.
- the criterion is the accuracy of the trained model and is estimated using a cross-validation score.
- a trained predictive model is selected (Step 408 ).
- the trained models are ranked based on the value of their respective scores, and the top ranking trained model is chosen as the selected predictive model.
- the selected predictive model is fully trained using the training data (e.g., all K partitions) (Step 410 ), for example, by the model training module 212 .
- a trained model i.e., “fully trained” model
- the trained model 218 can be stored by the predictive modeling server system 206 . That is, the trained model 218 can reside and execute in a data center that is remote from the client computing system 202 .
- Access to the trained model is provided to the client computing system 202 (Step 412 ) rather than the trained model itself.
- providing access to the trained model includes providing an address to the client computing system 202 that the system can use to access the trained model; for example, the address can be a URL (Universal Resource Locator).
- the client computing system 202 desires to access the trained model 218 to receive a predictive output, the client computing system 202 can transmit to the URL a request that includes the input data.
- the predictive modeling server system 206 receives the input data and prediction request from the client computing system 202 (Step 414 ).
- the input data is input to the trained model 218 and a predictive output generated by the trained model (Step 416 ).
- the predictive output is provided to the client computing system (Step 418 ).
- input data and a request to the URL can be embedded in an HTML document, e.g., a webpage.
- JavaScript can be used to include the request to the URL in the HTML document.
- a call to the URL can be embedded in a webpage that is provided to the customer.
- the input data can be the particular customer's online shopping transaction history.
- Code included in the webpage can retrieve the input data for the customer, which input data can be packaged into a request that is sent in a request to the URL for a predictive output.
- the input data is input to the trained model and a predictive output is generated.
- the predictive output is provided directly to the customer's computer or can be returned to the client computer system, which can then forward the output to the customer's computer.
- the client computing system 202 can use and/or present the predictive output result as desired by the client.
- the predictive output is a prediction of the type of product the customer is most likely to be interested in purchasing. If the predictive output is “blender”, then, by way of example, an HTML document executing on the customer's computer may include code that in response to receiving the predictive output cause to display on the customer's computer one or more images and/or descriptions of blenders available for sale on the client computing system's online shopping service.
- This integration is simple for the client computing system, because the interaction with the predictive modeling server system can use a standard HTTP protocol, e.g. a POST request to a URL that returns a JSON encoded output.
- the customer using the customer computer can be unaware of these operations, which occur in the background without necessarily requiring any interaction from the customer.
- the request to the trained model can seamlessly be incorporated into the client computer system's web-based application, in this example an online shopping service.
- a predictive output can be generated for and received at the client computing system (which in this example includes the customer's computer), without expending client computing system resources to generate the output.
- the client computing system can use code (provided by the client computing system or otherwise) that is configured to make a request to the predictive modeling server system 206 to generate a predictive output using the trained model 218 .
- the code can be a command line program (e.g., using cURL) or a program written in a compiled language (e.g., C, C++, Java) or an interpreted language (e.g., Python).
- the trained model can be made accessible to the client computing system by an API through a hosted execution platform, e.g., AppEngine.
- the trained model 218 is hosted by the predictive modeling server system 206 and can reside and execute on a computer at a location remote to the client computing system 202 .
- the client may desire to download the trained model to the client computing system 202 .
- the client may wish to generate and deliver predictive outputs on the client's own computing system.
- the trained model 218 is provided to a client computing system 202 , and can be used locally by the client.
- Components of the client computing system 202 and/or the predictive modeling system 206 can be realized by instructions that upon execution cause one or more computers to carry out the operations described above.
- Such instructions can comprise, for example, interpreted instructions, such as script instructions, e.g., JavaScript or ECMAScript instructions, or executable code, or other instructions stored in a computer readable medium.
- the components of the client computing system 202 and/or the predictive modeling system 206 can be implemented in multiple computers distributed over a network, such as a server farm, in one or more locations, or can be implemented in a single computer device.

- the operator can enter an input to initiate the training and selecting operations to be performed “in the cloud”, i.e., by the predictive modeling server system 206 , or these operations can be automatically initiated in response to the training data having been uploaded.
- the operator of the client computing system 202 can access the one or more trained models that are available to the client computing system 202 from the web page. For example, if more than one sets of training data had been uploaded by the client computing system 202 , then more than one trained predictive models may be available to the particular client computing system. Representations of the available predictive models can be displayed, for example, by names listed in a drop down menu or by icons displayed on the web page, although other representations can be used. The operator can select one of the available predictive models, e.g., by clicking on the name or icon.
- a second web page e.g., a form
- a second web page can be displayed that prompts the operator to upload input data that can be used by the selected trained model to provide predictive output data
- the form can be part of the first web page described above.
- an input field can be provided, and the operator can enter the input data into the field.
- the operator may also be able to select and upload a file (or files) from the client computing system 202 to the predictive modeling server system 206 using the form, where the file or files contain the input data.
- the selected predicted model can generate predictive output based on the input data provided, and provide the predictive output to the client computing system 202 either on the same web page or a different web page.
- the predictive output can be provided by displaying the output, providing an output file or otherwise.
- the client computing system 202 can grant permission to one or more other client computing systems to access one or more of the available trained predictive models of the client computing system, which is described in more detail below.
- the web page used by the operator of the client computing system 202 to access the one or more available trained predictive models can be used (either directly or indirectly as a link to another web page) by the operator to enter information identifying the one or more other client computing systems being granted access and possibly specifying limits on their accessibility.
- the operator of the client computing system 202 can access the third party's trained models using the web page in the same manner as accessing the client computing system's own trained models (e.g., by selecting from a drop down menu or clicking an icon).
- the operator of the client computing system 202 can use a web page provided by the predictive modeling server system 206 to browse a collection trained models that are available for use by the client computing system 202 that were trained using training data provided by a third party (i.e., by a different client computing system).
- the third party that provided the training data would have given permission for the third party's trained model to be included in the collection of trained models that can be browsed.
- the operator of the client computing system 202 can select to license for use (i.e., rent) a trained model from the collection, typically in exchange for a fee.
- the predictive modeling server system 206 can serve multiple client computing systems in addition to the client computing system 202 shown, as has been described above.
- the predictive modeling server system 206 can therefore accumulate multiple trained models in addition to the trained model 218 .
- the predictive modeling server system 206 can provide a marketplace for the trained models, as mentioned above.

- the licensee-client computing systems provide input data and a request for a predictive output to the trained model and receive the predictive output in response.
- the licensee-client computing systems therefore do not have access to the training data that was provided by the client computing system 202 , and therefore any private information that was used for training remains private.
- Security access control to limit access to the licensees of the trained model, accounting and collection of fee can be implemented using any convenient conventional technique of electronic commerce.
