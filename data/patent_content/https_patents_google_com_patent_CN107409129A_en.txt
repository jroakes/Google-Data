Abstract
Between entities in the method for shared object, processor will identify object and generate the accesses control list (ACL) of object so that ACL includes clause's list in controlling distributed system.Each clause is by the Licensing Model including will match with one or more licenses, and at least one clause may also include the reference to one or more groups.Each group represents character string collection, and the string representation Licensing Model perhaps can schema fragment.ACL each clause can be generated as allowing clause or refuse clause by processor, to indicate that one or more entities with the license to be matched by Licensing Model are allowed to access the object.ACL is saved in data storage by processor, and the request of object is accessed for response.
Description
Related application and priority
Patent document require the U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.62/167,000 submitted on May 27th, 2015 and
In the U.S. Patent application No.14/824 that August in 2015 is submitted on the 12nd, 727 priority, its disclosure is entirely incorporated into by reference
Herein.
Background technology
The present disclosure describes for identifying, certification and the mechanism for authorizing the communication between two or more electronic equipments.
When the electronic equipment of such as mobile electronic device and server is communicated via network, it is important that communication quilt
Certification and access control.Distributed system be (electronic equipment that can be such as communicated with one another via one or more communication networks
Set) participant usually require to know that whom whom it communicate and expressing and can perform with and some act or access some services
Mode.Mark and/or checking equipment or the process of its user can be referred to as " certification ".Identify one or more equipment or use
Family can perform or can be referred to as " authorizing " using the process of which action or service.
Group provides useful indirect rank, those particularly described by accesses control list (ACL) for authorization policy.
When ACL refers to group, ACL can be simple and brief.As an example, ACL can allow to access group
All main bodys in " FriendlyClients (friendly client) ", itself is by via group, " (trusted should by TrustedApps
With) " in program there is user in the friend group of the equipment in equipment group to form.The definition of these groups can be with
ACL separate managements, and shared by many other ACL.
In a distributed system, the use of group is not flat-footed.For example, it needs point for naming group
Cloth scheme.Even if using this scheme, when ACL is checked, group definition may not can use all.In addition, group may
Have unexpected consequence, it is also possible to include the cyclicity for not having single participant to be detected in local in system.
In addition, the entity of control group not necessarily all may comparably be trusted.It may result in remotely in addition, searching membership for group
The cost of communication, and need appropriate safety and privacy measures.
This document describes the method and apparatus for improving certification and/or mandate in a distributed system.
The content of the invention
In various embodiments, system implements the method for shared object between entities in control distributed system.Processing
Device will identify object and generate the accesses control list (ACL) of the object so that ACL includes clause's list.Each clause will wrap
The Licensing Model that will be matched with one or more licenses is included, and one or more clauses can also include to one or more
The reference of group.Each group represents character string collection, and the string representation Licensing Model perhaps can schema fragment.Processor can
So that ACL each clause to be generated as allowing (allowing) clause or refuses clause to indicate to be permitted with what is by Licensing Model matched
Can one or more entities whether be allowed access to the object.ACL is saved in data storage by processor, is visited for response
Ask the request of the object.
After ACL is generated, then when processing equipment receives the request for accessing the object from client device, processing is set
It is standby to access ACL.If it is determined that ACL includes at least one of the related Licensing Model with the license presented in matching request
Clause, then it can parse ACL it is each determined by clause with determine the clause whether include allow clause or refusal clause,
And it can be decided whether to permit or refuse the client device access object using the result of parsing, and as sound
Should, permit or the refusal client device access object.
Alternatively, when it is determined that ACL includes at least one clause, system can determine that ACL includes the license with matching
Multiple clauses of pattern.If it is, then decide whether to permit or refuse client device when using the result of parsing
When accessing the object, only when relatively the latter of identified clause includes allowing clause, system can be with granting client equipment
The object is accessed, otherwise system can refuse the client device access object.Alternatively, determined when using the result of parsing
When whether permitting or refusing the client device access object, only when the more early person of identified clause includes allowing clause
When, system can access the object with granting client equipment, and otherwise it can refuse the client device access object.
Alternatively, when it is determined that ACL includes at least one clause, system can determine that ACL includes group.If this
Sample, system can send request to determine whether the request is associated with the member of group to cluster server, from group service
Device receives response, and is also used when deciding whether to permit or refusing the client device access object and come from cluster server
Response.When receiving response from cluster server, system can receive the part including the request associated with group
First instruction, and also receive the second instruction of the remainder including the request unconnected to group.
In certain embodiments, each license and group can be represented by one or more human-readable names.In addition,
At least one of group name can be embedded in the separate constituent of Licensing Model.
In certain embodiments, system can also include the cluster server with cluster server processing equipment.If
It is that then the definition of group can be saved in computer-readable memory by cluster server so that when the definition of group is with first
Between be associated, and the definition of the group of renewal is also saved in computer-readable memory so that update the definition of group with
Second time correlation joins.When generating response, then cluster server can determine the time associated with asking, and it can
Which determined with usage time in assessment request using version of group definition.

Embodiment
The term related to the disclosure includes：
" electronic equipment " or " computing device " refers to include processor and the computer-readable memory hardware of nonvolatile
Equipment.Memory can include or receive programming instruction, and the programming instruction is when being executed by a processor so that electronic equipment according to
Programming instruction performs one or more operations.The example of computing device includes personal computer, server, large scale computer, game system
System, television set and such as smart phone, personal digital assistant, camera, tablet personal computer, laptop computer, media play
The mobile electronic device of device etc..In client-server arrangement, client device and server are electronic equipment respectively.
" object " is process, data set or other resources, function or transaction, and the client that server controls are authorized is to it
Access.
" main body " is to send the entity (such as networked resources) of request.Main body has an identity, and can by title and/
Or key identifies.
" license (blessing) " is the voucher collection of the encryption or the presentation of other electronics for main body, and it includes one or more
Individual human-readable title.(for simplicity, herein can also be clear based on contextual meaning to refer to using abbreviation " license "
The license title of Chu).Human-readable title is properly termed as " license title ".
" human-readable title " is the expression of data that the mankind can naturally read and understand, such as by English or its
The expression of the data of the character composition of its human language, alternatively it is meant that with it and is accorded with by the one or more of human intelligible
Number.Example includes the name of the mankind, comprising e-mail address of@symbols for representing " at " etc.).
Term " group " is when as noun, it is intended to refers to the object for representing character trail, mould is permitted in the string representation
Formula perhaps can schema fragment.Because Licensing Model is made up of human-readable title, group name and its content
Can be human-readable.
" Licensing Model " is the components series of a slash separation, wherein each composition is the character string of the license of no oblique line
Or group quotes.
" warning (caveat) " is the constraint for the mandate for accessing entity object.For example, warning may only limit entity
For some functions of service, or some services being only limitted in one group of service.Warning can also include must be adapted for having permitted
The predicate that can be used entirely.
" accesses control list " or " ACL " be mark be attached to the list of permission of special object or object set, table or its
Its data structure.Allow to may relate to single entity or multiple entities.In the embodiment being described herein, ACL can also be by
Human-readable title is formed.
" certificate " is that main body can be presented to prove what title electronics text associated with the public keys of main body
Shelves.
" chain " of certificate means private counterpart keys label of each certificate by the public keys associated with previous certificate
Name.First Certificate (i.e. root certificate) in chain can (although unnecessary) signed in person by client (that is, by being carried in First Certificate
The private counterpart keys signature of the public keys arrived).Second certificate also by the client signature as previous holder of certificate,
But the 3rd certificate is by by the client signature of the second certificate.
" certificate chain " is the orderly certificate group being signed as described above by chain.
Unless otherwise specified, singular references " processor " or " processing equipment " are intended to the reality for including single processing equipment
Apply together with example and plurality of processing equipment or the common embodiment for performing processing.Similarly, unless otherwise specified, art
Language " memory ", " data storage ", " data storage facility " etc. are intended to the embodiment for including individual equipment, plurality of memory
Equipment is together or the embodiment of common data storage collection or each sector in instruction set and these equipment.
As used herein, clearly provide unless the context otherwise, otherwise singulative " one ", "one" and " institute
State " include plural reference.Unless otherwise defined, all technologies used herein and scientific terminology has and ordinary skill
The identical implication that personnel are generally understood that.As used herein, term " comprising " refers to " include but is not limited to ".
Fig. 1 figures show the various embodiments of distributed system, wherein one or more client devices 12a...12n warps
By such as wireless telephone network, internet, Intranet, LAN, wide area network, another network or these is any combination of
One or more communication networks 20 communicate with such as server 16a...16n one or more of the other processing equipment.Server
Any server in 16a...16n may be used to one or more objects and can be used for authorized client device.In addition,
One or more of server (for example, 16b) can be used as certificate server, or otherwise by client device
The access credentials (such as encryption key) of any client device in 12a...12n are stored in structure, and (such as access control arranges
Table) in.Any server in server 16n can also be the cluster server for the details for storing one or more groups, all
Such as the list of group member.In addition, any client device (for example, 12a) can be accessed the mandate commission of various objects
Give one or more of other client devices (for example, 12b).
This document describes the design for being used for group access control in new storehouse collection, instrument and service, it can help letter
Change the process of structure Distributed Application.The various embodiments of system can support the form of commission via native name.System
Can also support in ACL when group definition is unavailable or comprising cyclicity with conservative semantic negative clause.In addition, it
It can help to ensure that the privacy and efficiency of membership for group inspection.
In the disclosed embodiment, each main body is identified with public keys, and one or more license is (with human-readable name
The form of title) it is bound to the public keys.Specifically, these licenses can be in the public affairs for the public keys for being bound to main body
Provided altogether in chain of cipher key certificates.For example, may be with by the television set that possesses of main body with license " Alice (Alice) "
Permit " Alice/TV (Alice/TV) ".Herein, TV is a native name, and any main body can be autonomous
Generate and apply the title.Main body might have multiple licenses, and each license, which reflects, permits its main body.It is for example, same
Platform television set may also have the license " SomeCorp/TV123 (some company/TV 123) " from its manufacturer.
When using term " license " in the singular herein, it is intended to permit or multiple licenses including the use of single
Form, it is unless specified single licensed option.License can be stored in data storage.Client and server can be with base
Optionally to be permitted mutually presentation in the rank for the information that they want to disclose each other.
License is certification and the basis authorized.When client is communicated with server, client can be based on service
The one or more main bodys and license that device is presented carry out identification server.Similarly, server can be based on client presentation one
Individual or multiple main bodys and license are to identify, certification and authorized client.Specifically, " license " operation, which tolerates main body and extends it, is permitted
Can in one, and create bind another main body public keys license, so as to entrust the mandate related to permitting.Example
Such as, ACL can include clause's " Allow Alice/TV (allowing Alice/ TVs) ", have matching " Alice/TV " so as to all
License main body by have to ACL protection object access, and with license " Alice " main body can select to its electricity
Permit license " Alice/TV " depending on machine.In practice, the commission of mandate is seldom unconditional.It is lower perhaps that warning may be limited to it
But useful condition, such as its validity is limited in certain period of time.
In various embodiments, group can the not only atomic name comprising such as " Alice " and " TV " etc, can be with
Include longer compound license, such as " Alice/TV ".In addition, the definition of group can refer in top (such as " Friends
Includes OldFriends (friend includes old friend) ") and as compound license part (such as
" FriendlyClients " includes " Friends/Devices/TrustedApps (friend/equipment/trusted applications) ") it is other
Group.Therefore, group can be considered as to formal language (formal language), wherein group definition triggers grammer achievement.So
And it is different from traditional form language, grammer achievement is distributed, therefore system described herein may consider such as to lead to
Believe the misgivings such as cost, availability and privacy.
In the UNC of the disclosed embodiments, system assume that group name collection, and can be referred to as general
Disjoint other title collection that general term claims.Herein, g represents that group name, and n represent common name.
Common name and group name have very different form and purposes.Especially, each group name is enough really
Surely suitable server the problem of on group can be answered and be enough to inquire about the server.On the other hand, common name
Be probably basic native name, can be with simple characters string that cross-system is explained by different way.They also refer to various realities
Body (user, service, program, program version etc.), but although they may follow the practice.
The syntax of license and Licensing Model can use such as following grammer：
In above-mentioned grammer, B is in the scope of license and P is in the scope of Licensing Model；And slash mark (/) is
For forming the binary opertor of license and Licensing Model.Therefore, license can be represented with the nonempty sequence of common name,
Separated with slash mark (/), and Licensing Model can be represented with the nonempty sequence of common name and group name, use slash mark
(/) separates.Slash mark (/) is considered as association by we.
For example, " if Alice " and " Phone " is common title, and " friend " and " equipment " is group name, then：
(1) " Alice " and " Alice/Phone " is license, and they are also Licensing Model；(2)“Alice/Alice”、“Phone/
Phone " and " Phone/Alice " and license and Licensing Model, although they may be unnecessary meaningful；And (3)
" Friends ", " Friends/Phone ", " Alice/Devices " and " Friends/Devices " is all Licensing Model, without
It is license, because each of therein include group.
The human-readable title of such as " all licenses " can represent the collection of all licenses.When B and B' are licenses,
Herein, we can be written as B≤B', and if the sequence of the common name in B is the sequence of the common name in B'
Prefix, we can say that B is B' prefix.We are using this prefix relation to be not strict reflexive.In other words, each is permitted
It can all be the prefix of oneself.
In some embodiments as described above, group quotes and can be embedded in Licensing Model.Alternatively, in order to just
In mark, group quotes and can bound by additional character, such as beginning "<" and ending at ">”.Therefore, it is allowed to access
Run in any equipment run in X company personnel John Doe " AllMyDevice (my all equipment) " group
The Licensing Model of " CloudMail (cloud mail) " application may be as follows：
XCcorp/johndoe/<grp:xcorp/grp/johndoe/AllMyDevices>/CloudMail
In addition, when group quotes and is embedded in Licensing Model, in certain embodiments, group name can appear in
In the single composition of Licensing Model, without the whole composition being included in two oblique lines.For example, it is contemplated that following acl entry：
wombat/foo<group_name>bar
In the acl entry, " group_name " refers to the group for including " 1 ", " 2 " and " 3 ".Therefore, acl entry represents
Following group：
wombat/foo1bar
wombat/foo2bar
wombat/foo3bar。
Fig. 2 figures show the general introduction of the embodiment for the process that will be described in further detail below.Server with processor
Or miscellaneous equipment can be controlled in distributed system by identifying object 201 and generating the accesses control list 203 of object
Shared object between entities so that ACL includes clause's list.Each clause in ACL includes permitting comprising one or more
Licensing Model.One or more of clause can also include the reference to one or more groups, wherein each group table
Show Licensing Model collection.Each clause can be " permit (permission) " clause or " deny (refusal) " clause to indicate to have by being permitted
Can one or more entities of license of pattern match whether be allowed access to object.ACL is saved in data storage by system
205, the request of object is accessed for response.
When system receives the request 209 of client device access object, access is controlled list (ACL) 211 by it,
And determine whether ACL includes at least one son with the related Licensing Model to match to the license presented in the request
Sentence 213.If it is, it by parse the ACL with related license it is each determined by clause to determine that the clause is fair
Perhaps clause still refuses clause 215.It will determine that allowance or refusal client device access should using the result of parsing
Object, and then correspondingly permit 219 or the refusal 221 client device access object.
System may need or wish to manipulate licence list and Licensing Model list.In following example, licence list
It is the input that ACL is checked；Licensing Model list is appeared in group definition.Therefore, we introduce syntactic category for them：
We represent empty list using constant " empty (sky) ", and enter using comma as forming the two of list
Operator processed.Herein shown in example in, when occurring in lists, we can omit " empty ", and for example I
List " empty, Alice, Bob (empty, Alice, Bob) " can be simply written as " Alice, Bob (Alice, Bao
Suddenly) ".
Group name can be at least two types：The group name of built-in group and the group name for defining group.
Under both of these case, group is considered Licensing Model collection.
Built-in group can be those provided by underlying platform, therefore the definition that need not extend.We with
All license collection that the title of " AllBlessings (all licenses) " refers to, are an examples.Generally, built-in group can lead to
Cross and particularly answer the suitable any section code of membership query and implement.We discuss what this code should provide below
Interface.Formally, we can assume that each g ∈ BuiltInGroups (built-in group) are mapped to license collection by function Elts
(intuitively, g element).For example, we allow Elts (AllBlessings)=AllBlessings.Such as in this case,
Elts (g) collection can be unlimited.
Defined group can be associated with by the group name definition equal with Licensing Model list：
G=L
Provide definition collection DefSet { g1=L1,...,gk=Lk, system may require group name giIn pairs distinguish and
Distinguish over the element in BuiltInGroups (built-in group).Each group name can be associated with server, to contribute to
Perform in a distributed way.
On the other hand, system can need not in definition deletion cycle.Some simple circulations may be useful once in a while
's.
System can allow some group names neither in BuiltInGroups (built-in group) also without definition
The possibility of (or not at least being the available definition of system).
System can allow one or more electronic equipments to generate and export user interface (or automation construction process), use
Family (or system) can pass through the new group of the interface creating, deletion group and modification membership for group.
The code associated with built-in group and the definition associated with other group names both can be over time
And change.They can even change during ACL is checked.Correctness it is expected correspondingly to relax (for example, to hold
Perhaps server is resequenced and inquired about).
ACL is clause's list, the license that each clause allows or denied access matches with specific Licensing Model.ACL can be with
By defined below：
For example, in one embodiment, (it can also be referred to as, and " Permit (permits all " Allow (allowing) " clauses
Perhaps clause) ") can be before all " refusal " clauses, but opposite arrangement or no particular requirement can be applicable.Dependent on
In the semantic arrangement of order, system will appreciate that：
" Allow Friends, Deny Alice (allowing friend, refuse Alice) "
With it is following be different
" Deny Alice, Allow Friends (refusal Alice, allow friend) ".
In one embodiment, acl entry below will be prior to entry earlier (although opposite in alternative embodiment
Priority can be genuine).In the present embodiment, when " Alice " is in " Friends " group, ACL below will give
Access to " Alice ", and above will refuse it.
In the disclosure and various embodiments, we can by combining continuous Allow clause come the ACL that abridges, such as
" Allow Friendes, Allow Alice (allowing friend, allow Alice) " is written as to " Allow Friends, Alice
(allowing friend, Alice) ", and similarly so done for continuous refusal clause.Many ACL can be a simple shape
Formula, such as " Allow g ", wherein g are group names.More generally, many can be " Allow P1,...,Pk" form, or
As another example：
Allow P1..., Pk, Deny Pk+1..., Pk+k′
Wherein P1..., Pk+k′It is Licensing Model.
In certain embodiments, system can be impermissible for specified ACL.This limitation means to occur by the group of name
It is shared.
Each Licensing Model-particularly each group name-representative license collects.Following discussion explains system can be how
Licensing Model is mapped to license collection.
Assuming that the semanteme (from group name to the mapping of license collection, being provided as parameter ρ) of group name, function
" Meaning " collects Licensing Model and Licensing Model list mapping to license.Inductively it is defined as follows, is for permitting mould first
Formula：
Meaningρ(n)={ n }
Meaningρ(g)=ρ (g)
Meaningρ(n/P)=n/s | s ∈ Meaningρ(P)}
Meaningρ(g/P)=s/s ' | s ∈ Meaningρ(g), s ' ∈ Meaning ρ (P) }
Then for Licensing Model list：
Meaningρ(L, P)=Meaningρ(L)∪Meaningρ(P)
The semanteme of group name consists essentially of the function ρ that each group name is mapped to the member of group and collected.Work as table
When directly or indirectly referring to the group not yet defined up to formula (for example, ACL), then in distributed context (under this example,
When definition is located at different servers), system, which may have to decide on, whatsoever reason group definition there may be but not
When can be searched, it may occur that what.If it is desirable that system is conservative (failure safety), it is in Allow and Deny clauses
Decision may be different.For this reason that in this context, system can use herein refer on behalf ofWithTwo
Individual function.In the case where that can be solved to all references of group, they are consistent.
For constructionGroup definition list DefSet can be considered as initiating species language by we, as follows.
- common name and oblique line (/) are terminals.
- group name is nonterminal.
- system can be associated with group definition by achievement, such as will definition：
g1=Alice/Phone, g2/Phone
Change into two achievements
g1→Alice/Phone
g1→g2/Phone
- system can also be associated with each built-in group name by achievement, for each B ∈ Elts (g), g：G → B,.
- last, system can not be (neither defined in DefSet nor interior by achievement and any remaining group name
Put the group name of group name) it is associated.
For each group name g, system can makeIt is the license collection generated by these achievements from g.Therefore, group
The problem of group membership, may be reduced to the problem of formal language membership qualification.
When Elts (g) for each g ∈ BuiltInGroups are limited when, achievement above forms no context
Grammer.Otherwise, system still can obtain each group name g formal languageAlthough these language need not be supreme
Language hereafter.More precisely, just as Formal Language Theory,It is function F least fixed-point, so that for each
Individual g,
If-g is defined by g=L, F (ρ) (g)=Meaningρ(L)
- for g ∈ BuiltInGroups, F (ρ) (g)=Elts (g)；And
- it is other in the case of
Except in the case of last one kind, system can make beyond F (ρ) (g)=AllBlessings,Construction be
Similar.Especially, system still takes the fixed point (not being maximum fixed point) of minimum.
In practice, system may not always need to calculate minimum fixing point：Some group definitions can be considered as not by it
(or finding that some group definitions are unavailable) can be used, such as is calculated in advance when corresponding server failure, or when we have
Calculation has exhausted or during close to the limit.Result is probably conservative approximation.
In other systems, regular-expression is for example used in firewall rule is defined in access control.By upper
Definition is stated, system may exceed conventional language, to avoid syntactic conditions cumbersome in group definition.
When processor receives license collection (and alternatively, group definition) and for object in ACL from request entity
It is middle (alternatively, to use received group definition, and other) when the license presented is matched with each Licensing Model,
ACL, which will be checked, to be carried out.The example of the process figure 3 illustrates.System can iteratively compare the text component in license title
With the text component in Licensing Model, it is continued until that system is run into pattern 301 untill group name.System can determine
With with the presence or absence of 303.If any text component is not found in Licensing Model, system can determine that it is to mismatch
, and refuse request 313.If license title is the prefix of pattern, system can be defined as matching.When system runs into
305 during the group name of the very first time, it can send the residue of license title via cluster server API to cluster server
Non-matching part (residue discussed below) 307.Cluster server will use identical matching algorithm (recursively applying) surplus
It is remaining to be matched with each group member and return to new residual set.If residual set is non-NULL after whole pattern is consumed,
Then system can state matching 309 and allow request 313.Otherwise, it can refuse request 303.Terminated (such as if pattern is $
It is lower described), then alternatively, only when residual set includes null character string (meaning to match completely), system can just be stated
Match somebody with somebody.Alternatively, if cluster server is unreachable, group can be considered as empty (if Licensing Model is Allow clause) by it
Or include (if Licensing Model is Deny clause) entirely.
We can illustrate this matching algorithm with a simple example.Assuming that we have：
Title (being provided by client) is provided：“a/b/c/d/e”
Licensing Model (in server end)：“a/b/<grp：v/g1>”
Group definition (v/g1)：{ " c ", " c/d ", " c/d/e ", " e " }
If we use the definition mode of extension of group, resulting pattern is " a/b/c ", " a/b/c/d ", " a/b/
C/d/e " and " a/b/e ".Permit title " a/b/c/d/e " successful match pattern " a/b/c ", " a/b/c/d " and " a/b/c/d/e "
(as described above, if pattern is the prefix of title, license title can match Licensing Model.)
However, in order in the case where not learning the definition of group (using Rest functions as described above and as described below)
It is determined that matching, system can be by the way that each license title composition be matched to carry out with the composition in pattern.Permit title
The first two composition " a ", " b " and the first two mating chemical composition of pattern.Then, system can be by license block " c/d/e " and group " v/
G1 " matches.Therefore, we send Rest (" c/d/e ") RPC to cluster server.Provide group definition, cluster server
Set after matching somebody with somebody remaining as { " e ", " d/e ", " " }.This residual set returns as the output that Rest () is called.System can be with sound
Bright matching, since it has the non-NULL (that is, not being { }) set in the end remaining.
Subset is presented in the purpose that having collected the main body of multiple licenses can determine for mandate.It may decide that and does not present
Its all license, it may is that the misgivings because to performance or confidentiality.But it should not be obtained due to retaining some licenses
The right that must be added.
Correspondingly, the function of authorization check is performed, for example, " IsAuthorized " is applied to license M and ACL A row
In table.When the license in M is presented, it can decide whether permit accessing according to A.It is defined as auxiliary function
IsAuthorized1(B, A), it is applied to single license B and ACL A.Because each license B is treated separately, so such as
Desirably, IsAuthorized (, A) is dull in its first independent variable.
This definition depends on above-mentioned mapping " Meaning ".Be intended to as explanation, it is not necessary that specific reality
Apply mode.
According to the present embodiment, ACL semanteme is to rely on order, while ACL clause surpasses clause earlier below.Example
Such as, for any Licensing Model P, ACL " Allow P, Deny P " always denied access.
By dependent on according to clause typesWithUndefined group is referred to conservatively to handle (directly or indirectly)
The ACL clause of group.This conservative processing can once carry out an entry.In some cases, this method may produce
The result of somewhat astonishing (but safety).Consider, for example, abnormal ACL " Allow Alice, Deny Friends,
Allow Friends (allowing Alice, refuse friend, allow friend) ", wherein " Friends (friend) " is group name, but
Defined without corresponding, or its definition is unavailable, and " Friends " in BuiltInGroups.Assuming that system is wished
Know whether the ACL allows to conduct interviews to the request for permitting " Alice ".System may analyze ACL since ending.Clause
" Allow Friends " do not allow to access, because it is empty conservative hypothesis that system, which makes " Friends ",.Clause " Deny
Friends " denied access, because system makes the conservative hypothesis that " Friends " includes all licenses.Therefore, originally showing
In example, system may never check " Allow Alice ", and it may denied access.
Definition checks Allow and Deny clauses using prefix relation≤(rather than requiring accurate equal).At least exist
In the case of following two ,≤selection there is different meanings：
Firstly, for Allow clause, relation≤be for convenience is used.For example, as a people for its hope with having
The shared object of the main body of license " Alice " is written as ACL " during Allow Alice ", even if this access can be via with perhaps
Can " Alice/Phone " phone occur, this main body obtain access be generally also it is expedient.Therefore, extending license will not subtract
The mandate of Allow clause in few inspection on ACL.But longer license is not equal to shorter license in other side：
Longer license may trigger Deny clause, and the main body for possessing license " Alice/Phone " generally can not obtain such as
Other extensions of " Alice " of " Alice/TV ".
This semanteme accurate equal semanteme can define as needed.For example, under semanteme below, can be written as
ACL " Allow Alice, Alice/AllBlessings ", rather than " Allow Alice ".On the contrary, even if using≤language
Justice, it is also possible to which accurate equal ACL is adhered in definition.For example, it can be written as " Allow Alice, Deny Alice/
AllBlessings”.Alternatively, it is assumed that " $ " is only to appear in the reserved name in license at the end, can be written as " Allow
Alice/$”
Second, for Deny clause, from the view of security, forbid allowing using longer using B access is permitted
License accesses typically no meaning.Who has B cans to extend it, to evade Deny inspections.
The replacement criterion matched in Allow clause can be used, we are referred to as " prefix matching ".For example,
Using this criterion, " Allow Alice/Phone " will allow to conduct interviews using license " Alice " ACL.This is determined main
Motivation, which is that refusal is this, accesses no clear security interests.Who, which possesses " Alice ", can form " Alice/Phone ", to obtain
It must access.
As the example of authorization check, function IsAuthorized as defined above can be by calculating letter at relying party
Number" Meaning " is implemented, then blindly application definition.However, these are calculated needs group definition on general
Knowledge, system may be not desired in order to which the reason for efficiency and privacy propagates the group definition.Related group is possibly even nothing
Limit, and therefore can not be listed.In addition, it need not be used to determine some specific licenses are also whether to correspond to sometimes
License collection member " Meaning " total calculation.Therefore, embodiment can use IsAuthorized distribution to look into
Ask the embodiment of driving.In the following discussion, IsAuthorized is reduced to basic function R by us first, is then begged for
By the required calling for how implementing R.This is considered a form of parses from top to bottom.
Other algorithmic methods can be from the work export on formal language.
Specifically whether permit assuming that system wishes to know in Meaningρ(P) in.When license is common name n, it is
System can be carried out as follows：
- for each m ≠ n and each group name g, if P=m or P=m/P1Or P=n/P1Or P=g/P1, then lose
Lose.
If-P=n, succeeds.
If-P=g, inquire be responsible for g server whether n be g element and returning result.
When license is compound license n/B1When, system is readily modified as being carried out as follows：
- for each m ≠ n, if P=m or P=m/P1, then fail.
If-P=n, fails.
If-P=n/P1, then B is utilized1And P1Recurrence.
If-P=g, inquire be responsible for g server whether n/B1It is g element and returning result.
If-P=g/P1, then inquire that the server for being responsible for g whether there is B2、B3So that n/B1=B2/B3, and B2It is g
Element, and if utilize B3And P1Recurrence is (for the sake of completeness, for each suitable B3)。
Therefore, the problem of following form can be answered by being responsible for g server：
Whether B is in Meaning for-licenseρ(g) in,
Can-license B be written as B2/B3Form, wherein B2It is Meaningρ(g) element.
Although each problem of species can be reduced to Railway Project (each B prefix B of above species below2One
It is individual), there is provided interface the problem of for inquiring species below can allow more directly, effective interaction.
Therefore, system assume that with function R described below (this article can be called " Rest functions ")：R is this
Sample, provide license B and license collection S, R (B, S) return to the collection consisted of：
If-B is S element, ∈, and
- each permit B " so that for some B ', we have B=B '/B " and B ' is S member.
Pay attention to, R (B, S) is typically upper can to include both license and null character string ∈.If for example, S={ n1, n1/n2,
n1/n2/n3Then R (n1/n2, S) and={ ∈, n3}.Title R represents " residue ", " remaining " or " residual ".Rest functions can be used for true
Whether fixed license or Licensing Model are the member of particular demographic, while allow cluster server from the whole of request entity shielding group
Individual content.How the system of we will consider below can implement this Rest function, R.
Using R, system can reformulate IsAuthorized definition：
Next, it is contemplated that system how can to calculate and approximationWithAnd not exclusively extendWith Meaning definition.We are presented basic example and calculated first
Method, then elaborate distributed embodiments.
First, it is assumed that for each g ∈ BuiltInGroups, we have R (B, Elts (g)).In fact, this is assumed
Might mean that the code of group g built in implementing should provide the interface of the inquiry for inquiring R (B, Elts (g)) form.Note
Meaning, even if Elts (g) is unlimited, R (B, Elts (g)) is always limited.In the case of AllBlessings, the set bag
Include null character string and B appropriate suffix.We can write S (B) to represent the set.If we want to want functionWithMake
：
Implicit parameter is wherein used as,WithThere is group definition DefSet.For brevity, herein, when we are uncommon
Hope and quoteWithBoth when, we can be written as RX(but in such as RX(...)=... RXIn the equation of (...) ..., I
Refer to both sides identical RX).Provide Licensing Model list L=P1..., Pk, we allow RX(B, L)=∪I=1..kRX(B,
Pi)。
Desired functionWithMeet equation：
RX(n, n)={ ε }
RX(n/B, n)={ B }
RX(n/B, n/P)=RX(B, P)
When orienting from left to right, these equations prompt to be used to calculate R immediatelyXThe algorithm of (B, P).The system by by
Carried out according to the situation of p-shaped formula to implement the algorithm.When P is not group name and when not started with group name, algorithm is pressed
Carried out according to the situation of B forms.When P is the group name g with the g=L defined in DefSet, it is fixed that algorithm expands this
Justice.When P is group name g ∈ BuiltInGroups, algorithm simply returns to R (B, Elts (g)), and we are according to ours
Assuming that there is it.Finally, (therefore, do not define if P is any other group name g or embodiment is available group
Title), algorithm returnsOr
By this way, if control ACL entity sends the request of cluster server, and the request is included such as
The Licensing Model of " A/B ", then it is that the one or more of " B " mark that cluster server, which can return to group including " A ", remaining R,.
This allows system to tailor response for made specific request, without revealing the other information on group.
RXThe calculating of (B, P) is approximately equivalent to parse B from top to bottom, the element as the formal language associated with P.
When any grammer achievement is left recusion (form g → g... wherein g are nonterminal), top-down parsing does not work
Or inoperable is normal very well.Here, left recusion may cause algorithm to be absorbed in Infinite Cyclic.In theory, Ke Yizong
It is to avoid left recusion achievement (especially by Greibach normal forms are used).However, in one embodiment, in order to prevent
Left recusion, we may not want that limitation or rewrite group definition.
Therefore, system, which can use, does not consider to assume and work weakerWithDefinition.For conservative implementation
Mode, we only need：
System can apply the algorithm adapted to realize these attributes, while improve its efficiency and ensure its termination.Especially
Ground, the computation budget no matter when provided have been used up, and system can allow to calculate the conservative decision of termination-utilization.As spy
Different situation, system may allow the query timeout on server.In addition, pass through toWithAdditional parameter is transmitted, system can
With tracking we group on inspection collects, and reuse conservative decision when detecting circulation and terminate.It there may be
Detect all circulations or merely due to the variant of those circulations caused by left recusion.Circulation behind only can lead to divergence, and preceding
The variant in face is then little simpler.
Respectively theseWithApproximation be written asWithSystem can obtain IsAuthorized conservative embodiment：
Therefore, Wo MenyongThe appearance for replacing R is checked and used for " Allow "Replace R appearance for
" Deny " is checked.
ACL inspections corresponding to the ACL of license part are directed into the first processing equipment, and corresponding with group
The inspection of ACL part is directed into single cluster server.If so, so control ACL's (with reference to figure 2)
Entity can communicate with cluster server, to obtain the correlative detail of group, to determine whether request is authorized to, and only allow
The request associated with authorizing group 230 in the request.
When ACL and group according to other groups to define when, we now explain corresponding to server or it is other processing set
Standby how to check ACL contributes.The client or the entity by holding ACL that this process can be accessed by request carry out group
Knit.For example, if ACL refers to itself according to group g2The group g of definition1, then client can obtain and present on g1With
g2Evidence, or hold ACL entity can be Liang Ge groups be searched.As an alternative, the entity can contact responsible g1's
Server, the server can with so that contact be responsible for g2Server.
Alternatively, system can use alternative as its major programme.If so：
-IsAuthorizedimp(M, A), which is assessed, local at the entity for holding A to be occurred, and is called other to assess RX；
-RXThe assessment of (B, P) can be by RXDefine and use local recursive call under all situations of instruction, except RX(B,
G) except in the case of, such case should seek advice from responsible g server (unless as described above, this will cause to circulate).
In practice, the program can be subjected to various optimizations, and such as caching, the batch processing of inquiry and client " push away
Send " voucher.
Using the program, ACL and membership for group only (can be directed to ACL's in response to inquiry
IsAuthorizedimpInquiry, the R of groupXInquiry) when partly disclose.It can be seen that the observer of enough message flows also may be used
To infer dependence, i.e., specific ACL or group depend on some other groups.But ACL and the full content of group can
Energy will not be open by batch.
There is no atomicity it is assumed that in IsAuthorizedimpDuring the assessment of (M, A), group definition change is possible.
For example, A is allowed to turn into ACL " Allow Friends, Deny Friends ", and assume that member (Alice) is added to group
In " Friends ".If the addition to group occurs between the processing of ACL two clauses, IsAuthorizedimp
(Alice, A) will be returned very, and this behavior may be before addition and afterwards all without generation.In order to prevent this behavior, it is
System may may require that responsible related group server or other processing equipments via RXExtra " time " parameter provide and exist
ACL checks the information of the current time of interest.Assuming that processing equipment retains the daily record of nearest group's change, this technology will help
Checked in the ACL for completing quite quickly to be subjected to the synchronous limitation of clock.
We describe above-mentioned prefix matching in detail now.Alternatively, system can not use it.Reason may be with Deny
There are relation in clause and group；If any one in these features is not present, they are weaker.Because prefix matching is for expression
What property or availability were not required, therefore can be omitted preferably to handle these features.However, various embodiments can be with
Including prefix matching.
The principle of prefix matching is as follows.Assuming that license B' matching ACL, and B≤B'.Who, which possesses B, to be extended to
B', so as to be checked by ACL；Therefore, B matchings ACL is not allowed to may result in inconvenience, and if B malicious acts, then without vertical
Be benefited.(but unexpected improper activity may be prevented.)
It will imply that for example using prefix matching when n is permitted in presentation1When, ACL " Allow n1/n2" permit accessing.
Further contemplate ACL " Allow n1/ g ", and contemplate g and be defined as sky.As license n1When being presented, it should permit accessing
Positive answer is seemingly surprising, and is not proved by the principle proposed of prefix matching：Have no idea to prolong
Stretch n1, it is strictly matched n1/g.Prefix matching for Licensing Model P (is in this example n1/ g) on match P license
Prefix, rather than matching P prefix license.In other words, it is the prefix of the implication (meaning) on P, rather than
The implication (meaning) of P prefix.
Next ACL " Allow n1/n2, Deny n1/n2 " are considered.As license n1When being presented, it should permit accessing
System can (it utilizes prefix matching, implies and authorizes n by calculating the implication of Allow clause1), the implication of Deny clause
(refusal n is not implied that1), and difference is then obtained, pro to answer this problem.Due to having no idea to extend n1Make it
Match n1/n2But mismatch n1/n2, so this behavior may not be proved by the principle proposed of prefix matching.
The method of replacement includes all licenses that the whole ACL of calculating allows and (subtracts Deny clause, but no is Allow
Sentence prefixing), and then add all of which prefix.As the example shows, subtracting Deny clause will not use addition prefix to exchange.
This replacement method meets the principle of prefix matching really.
In practice, replacement method is likely difficult to implement.Consider ACL " Allow n1/g1/ $, Deny n1/g2/ $ ", wherein
g1And g2It is group name, and $ is specified terminal symbol title.According to the method for replacement, and if only if has g1In not
In g2In some elements when present license n1When, it can just permit accessing.
In summary, as described above, many systems of prior art support distributed authorization.Include group in its feature
In the case of, the model's solution for the problem of prior art does not provide such as missing, unavailable and circulation group definition etc.
The disclosed embodiments can be difficult to mitigate these by providing group and negative clause to ACL.This selection is also
Enable us to provide that different (according to this, the group comprising " Alice " need not include from group semantic for ACL
" Alice/Phone ") free semantic (wherein, for example, ACL " Allow Alice " allow to access " Alice/Phone ").
In the prior art, permit Alice access ACL it is general on will not permit being " Alice op Phone's " to form automatically
The access of composite host, wherein op are binary opertors, unless the operator is precisely conjunction (∧).Conjunction is difficult
With/similar, such as because it is tradable；The other operators previously considered seem closer to/.Except these differences it
Outside, the present embodiment can only have an operator (/) and it be association the fact allow the system strengthen and formal language
Useful connection.
All licenses of main body can be stored in license storage, similar to the cookies jar (cookie in web browser
jar).When as server, the storage mark license to be presented.
Therefore, various embodiments can use several unique features.For example, system can be according to the specific commission of main body
Rather than ACL is write out in all commissions of main body.For example, user may want to ACL allow user client electronic device it is every
" calendar " application (or another interactive application) on individual accesses " my calendar " data of user, and is impermissible for other application
Or equipment so accesses.
Moreover, system can refer to the specific commission collection of any identity using group.This makes us using group to represent
Any substring of identity, and more than prefix.For example, it is assumed that user have purchased entitled " product X " specific productivity set
The version of part, it includes the particular version of some applications.System can be write out allows when being run in the equipment in any user
The ACL of any some files of these routine accesses.When being run on the phone in user, one in those applications may make
With identity " company/mike/phone/productx_v4 ".
If product X copy is upgraded to v5 by user from v4, or adds another application from same provider, he or
It is still effective that she may want to ACL.Therefore, system may be written as { mikes_devices }/{ provider_suite } (names
Cheng Zhi groups) form acl entry, it expands on any user equipment any in the product suite of the provider run
Using." mikes_devices " group will be planned by user, but " provider_suite " group is by by product X provider
Planning.
In addition, system can allow " deny " clause in its ACL.For example, system can allow all employee access pair
As except trainee-trainee can be mentioned in " deny " clause.
System can provide the peer-to-peer communications between the equipment that (temporary transient) disconnects from internet.For example, set when two
For all aboard, when being disconnected with internet, an equipment may interact with another equipment, and access control inspection
It must guard, even if the up-to-date information about membership for group is unavailable.
System can provide the cluster structure of open layering, and any of which people can be defined with any membership qualification
Group, including other groups.Therefore, the identity provided may be widely dispersed in it is any number of in distributed system
In group or by its hint.In other words, it is possible to it is not easy to find that a people must seek advice from all visits for being related to specific identity
Ask group's collection of " complete " that control determines.
System protection privacy：The owner of group, which may not want that to systems inspection ACL, discloses its complete membership.
The ACL owner may not want that all groups mentioned to client's announcement ACL.Client, which may not want that to other people, discloses them
The identity of affiliated group.According to example, it is contemplated that the developer of calendar application wishes to set ACL on the calendar data of user,
And assume that user currently there are two equipment：His tablet personal computer and his laptop computer.Developer be envisioned that in ACL
It is upper to include identity " user/tablet/calendar (user/tablet personal computer/calendar) " and " user/laptop/calendar use
Family/laptop computer/calendar ".But when user obtains the class that must be then added in the ACL and all users application
Like ACL phone when, this will be inconvenient.
Alternatively, simple indirect rank can be obtained using group, therefore ACL is permitted to including body listed above
The access of the group " users_calendar " of part.This is also inconvenient, because again, each application possesses the group of oneself
Group, and when user buys phone, each application must be edited.
For the embodiments herein by allowing user to have single group to solve this problem, the single group enumerates his
Equipment but the identity set that may be employed to export each application that its ACL quotes the single group.Therefore, group G may be included
" user/tablet (user/tablet personal computer) " and " user/laptop (user/laptop computer) ", acl entry " G/
Calendar " will then obtain desired result.
In certain embodiments, system over time can be stored membership for group or Query Result using caching
To cluster server.By this way, request can also join with time correlation.Consider that the time can allow request to consider license mould
Formula whether be special time group part.It may also help in management off-line operation, and/or ensure if carried out
The group is updated or modified during request, and correct option is returned in the request that special time is made.
In order to solve these problems, client and/or cluster server can be safeguarded pair in computer-readable memory
The caching of the Query Result of cluster server.In order to describe this point, following discussion using term " client ", " server " and
" cluster server " refers to the tripartite being related in access request/inspection.Any processing equipment may be used as in three entities
Any entity.
Cached using server side, server continues access after execution from cluster server caching Get/Rest responses
The response (if available) of these cachings is used during inspection.Server can keep caching within the limited period, and such as one
Hour, one day, one week, one month or any other reasonable time section.Then, when the server receives the request, it can be with
Time is associated with request.The associated time can with request together be received, such as by clock generation timestamp or
Other time represents.Alternatively, server can associate different time, the time of such as editing acls, or editor and be asked
Object quilt time (such as nearest editor).Server can identify the caching corresponding with the time (such as with identical
Time or the cache entries of immediate previous time).Then, it can use identified caching determine request whether with
Group is authorized to be associated.
Using client-cache, client can be by time encoding into ACL.For example, client can be from group service
Device or other servers obtain opaque or anti-tamper Get/Rest responses, and it can be in the subsequent request to server
Include any related response.For example, server can include opaque (server for encrypting in its response to client
) " ticket ", and any related cluster server response is encoded.Client can store this ticket and be presented
In subsequent request.Ticket is opaque, therefore does not reveal information to client.Alternatively, the response of caching can pass through
Cluster server is set to calculate verification and it be encrypted using its private key, and by encrypted verification and be attached to sound
Should be anti-tamper to carry out.Either party with corresponding public keys then can decrypt and verify verification and.
