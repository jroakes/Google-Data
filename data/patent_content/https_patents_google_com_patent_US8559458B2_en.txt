- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary frame 100 , and in particular a WiMAX frame, of prior art.
- frame 100 comprises a downlink (DL) sub-frame 120 that is sent by a RAN to users served by the RAN and an uplink (UL) sub-frame 130 that is sent by users to the RAN.
- DL downlink
- UL uplink
- DL sub-frame 120 includes a DL scheduling field (DL-MAP) 124 , an UL scheduling field (UL-MAP) 126 , and a DL data packet field 128 .
- DL sub-frame 120 further may include a preamble field 122 .
- DL-MAP 114 provides a frame duration, a frame number, a DL sub-band allocation for DL bursts, and a coding and modulation scheme used for each DL burst.
- UL-MAP 116 provides UL sub-band scheduling for UL bursts by served mobile stations (MSs), a coding and modulation scheme used for each UL burst, and a start time for each UL burst.
- MSs served mobile stations
- DL data packet field 128 comprises the DL bursts, that is, is the field in which the RAN transmits data packets to the served MSs based on the sub-band scheduling.
- Preamble field 122 typically comprises pilots that may be used by MSs for timing synchronization, frequency synchronization, and channel estimation.
- UL sub-frame 130 includes a control region comprising a Ranging Code field 132 , a channel quality information (CQI) feedback field 134 (that is, CQI channels (CQICH)), and a Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) acknowledgement field 136 (that is, HARQ Acknowledgement channels (HARQ ACKCH)).
- UL sub-frame 130 further comprises an UL data packet field 138 .
- UL data packet field 138 comprises UL bursts, that is, is the field in which the MSs transmit data packets to the RAN based on UL-MAP 126 .
- a location of an MS's data packet in UL data packet field 138 that is, the sub-bands(s) (sub-carriers and times) used by the MS to transmit data, is determined by the assignment received by the MS in UL-MAP 126 .
- One embodiment of a typical WiMAX communication system is to have a fixed UL-MAP size, such as 100 bytes.
- UL-MAPs and DL-MAPs are heavily encoded, and providing scheduling information to an MS requires a non-trivial number of bytes.
- the size of the UL-MAP can constrain frame utilization, that is, can cause less than full use of the UL data packet field. This is particularly a problem for the UL-MAP where any MS with Best Effort traffic can request a data packet channel allocation, that is, an allocation of one or more sub-bands in UL data packet field 138 .
- an MS randomly picks a Ranging Code and a symbol and conveys this to the RAN in the Ranging Code field 132 of a DL-sub-frame.
- the Ranging Code and symbol are anonymous and the MS then looks for this Ranging Code and symbol, in association with a bandwidth allocation, in a subsequent UL sub-frame from the RAN.
- the RAN gets the Ranging Code, the RAN allocates UL bandwidth, that is, sub-band(s) in UL data packet field 138 , to the MS for the purpose of permitting the MS to identify itself and request bandwidth for a particular connection.
- the RAN then informs the MS, via UL-MAP 126 of an UL sub-frame, of the bandwidth allocated to the MS in UL data packet field 138 for identification and bandwidth request purposes.
- the MS then sends a Bandwidth Request Header, in the allocated sub-band(s) in UL data packet field 138 , that requests bandwidth for a particular connection.
- the Bandwidth Request Header is a small-size allocation that typically consumes only six to eight bytes.
- Other similarly small allocations of bandwidth include polls, for example, for a real time polling service (rtPS) or a non-real time polling service (nrtPS), which may occur as often as every 20 milliseconds (ms).
- rtPS real time polling service
- nrtPS non-real time polling service
- the UL-MAP 116 can fill up allocating bandwidth to such small bandwidth requests. This can result in a corresponding under utilization of an UL data packet field 138 of a subsequent UL sub-frame.
- the UL-MAP 126 can be completely filled with 12 small bandwidth allocations, whereas Best Effort bandwidth requests also may have been received from some larger bandwidth users.
- the RAN may allocate bandwidth in an UL data packet field of an UL sub-frame, such as UL data packet field 138 of an UL sub-frame 130 , to 12 small bandwidth users. These 12 users then respectively transmit back to RAN in allocated sub-bands 0-11 of the UL data packet field.
- a result is that as much as 80% of the UL data packet field is left empty and correspondingly is wasted.

- the scheduler allocates bandwidth in a UL data packet field of a UL sub-frame to the bandwidth allocation requests in order of priority and when the allocated bandwidth does not fill the UL data packet field and one or more bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range remains unallocated, substitutes an allocation of bandwidth to an unallocated bandwidth allocation request of the second size range for an allocation of bandwidth to a bandwidth allocation request of the first size range.

- a logic flow diagram 500 is provided that illustrates a method for uplink scheduling of MSs by a serving RAN, that is, RAN 220 and in particular scheduler 222 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Logic flow diagram 500 begins ( 502 ) when each MS of the multiple MSs 201 - 214 conveys to scheduler 222 , and the scheduler receives ( 504 ) from each such MS and stores in at least one memory device 404 , a request for a bandwidth allocation, that is, a request to be allocated bandwidth in an UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame, wherein the bandwidth allocation requests include one or more requests to be allocated bandwidth of a first size range, such as a request to be allocated bandwidth less than 10 bytes, and one or more requests to be allocated bandwidth of a second size range, wherein each bandwidth allocation request of the second size range requests more bandwidth than any bandwidth allocation request of the first size range.
- a request for a bandwidth allocation that is, a request to be allocated bandwidth in an UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame
- the bandwidth allocation requests include one or more requests to be allocated bandwidth of a first size range, such as a request to be allocated bandwidth less than 10 bytes, and one or more requests to
- a request for a bandwidth allocation may be a Ranging Code and symbol used by an MS to anonymously request bandwidth for a subsequent conveyance of a Bandwidth Request Header, may be a Bandwidth Request Header that requests bandwidth for a subsequent conveyance of user data, or may be an infrastructure-based or MS-based application requesting bandwidth for a conveyance of control data, such as polling data.
- Other applications or functions that may submit a request for a bandwidth allocation may occur to one of ordinary skill in the art, and any such application or other function may be applicable here as long as one or more of the applications and/or functions submits a request for to be allocated more bandwidth in an UP sub-frame than is requested by another application or function.
- scheduler 222 sorts ( 506 ) the requests in order of priority. Scheduler 222 then allocates ( 508 ) bandwidth to the requests in order of sorted priority, highest priority first. When enough allocations are made such that a maximum size of UL-MAP is reached, scheduler 222 determines ( 510 ) whether the bandwidth allocations will fill the UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame and further determines ( 512 ) whether any bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range remain unallocated. If the bandwidth allocations will fill the UL data packet field of the subsequent UL sub-frame or no bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range remain unallocated, then logic flow diagram 500 ends ( 518 ).
- scheduler 222 determines ( 514 ) whether there is sufficient space in the UL data packet field of the UL sub-frame to replace an allocation of bandwidth to a bandwidth allocation request of the first size range with an allocation of bandwidth to a bandwidth allocation request of the second size range that has not been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame. If there is not sufficient space, then logic flow diagram 500 ends ( 518 ).
- scheduler 222 substitutes ( 516 ) an allocation of bandwidth to a highest priority bandwidth allocation request of the second size range that has not been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame, for an allocation of bandwidth to a bandwidth allocation request of the first size range.
- This allocation need not be a full allocation provided that fragmentation is allowed for the connection of the second group being scheduled, and that sufficient space exists to allocate a minimum sized allocation.
- Logic flow diagram 500 then may return to step 510 and the process may continue until no further bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range remain unallocated or until the UL data packet field of the UL sub-frame does not have sufficient unallocated space to accommodate a next highest priority bandwidth allocation request of the second size range.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an exemplary frame 600 , and in particular a WiMAX frame, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- frame 600 comprises a downlink (DL) sub-frame 62 that is sent by a RAN 220 to users, such as MSs 201 - 214 , served by the RAN and an uplink (UL) sub-frame 630 that is sent by the users to the RAN.

- UL uplink
- DL sub-frame 620 includes a DL scheduling field (DL-MAP) 624 , an UL scheduling field (UL-MAP) 626 , and a DL data packet field 628 .
- DL sub-frame 620 further may include a preamble field 622 .
- DL-MAP 624 provides a frame duration, a frame number, a DL sub-band allocation for DL bursts, and a coding and modulation scheme used for each DL burst.
- UL-MAP 626 provides UL sub-band scheduling for UL bursts by served mobile stations (MSs), a coding and modulation scheme used for each UL burst, and a start time for each UL burst.
- DL data packet field 628 comprises the DL bursts, that is, is the field in which the RAN transmits data packets to the served MSs based on the sub-band scheduling.
- Preamble field 622 typically comprises pilots that may be used by MSs for timing synchronization, frequency synchronization, and channel estimation.
- UL sub-frame 630 includes a control region comprising a Ranging Code field 632 , a channel quality information (CQI) feedback field 634 (that is, CQI channels (CQICH)), and a Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) acknowledgement field 636 (that is, HARQ Acknowledgement channels (HARQ ACKCH)).
- UL sub-frame 630 further comprises an UL data packet field 638 .
- UL data packet field 638 comprises UL bursts, that is, is the field in which the MSs transmit data packets to the RAN based on UL-MAP 626 .
- a location of an MS's data packet in UL data packet field 638 that is, the sub-bands(s) (sub-carriers and times) used by the MS to transmit data, is determined by the assignment received by the MS in UL-MAP 626 .
- MSs 201 - 212 requested a bandwidth allocation of the first size range and that MSs 213 and 214 requested a bandwidth allocation of the second size range. Further, it is assumed herein that, when sorted in priority of their requests, the requests of MSs 201 - 212 were of a higher priority, or at least a same priority, as the requests of MSs 213 and 214 . Under the prior art, UL-MAP 626 would fill up with bandwidth allocations to MSs 201 - 212 , and the sub-band allocations of UL data packet field 638 would look the same as UL data packet field 138 of frame 100 .
- scheduler 222 determines that, after allocations are made to MSs 201 - 212 (wherein bandwidth allocated to each of MSs 201 - 214 in UL data packet field 638 is represented by a corresponding reference number 601 - 614 ) resulting in a maximum size of UL-MAP 626 being reached, the bandwidth allocations will not fill UL data packet field 638 of a subsequent UL sub-frame 630 .
- Scheduler 222 further determines that one or more bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range (that is, the requests of MSs 213 and 214 ) remain unallocated.
- scheduler 222 determines that there is sufficient space in UL data packet field 638 to replace a lowest priority bandwidth allocation to a bandwidth allocation of the first size range that has been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame, for example, the allocation made to MS 212 , with an allocation of bandwidth to a highest priority bandwidth allocation request of the second size range that has not been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame, for example, the bandwidth allocation request of MS 213 .
- Scheduler 222 then replaces the lowest priority bandwidth allocation to a bandwidth allocation request of the first size range that has been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame 638 , that is, the allocation to MS 212 , with the highest priority bandwidth allocation request of the second size range that has not been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame, that is, the request of MS 213 .
- scheduler 222 After substituting the allocation of bandwidth of MS 213 for the allocation of bandwidth to MS 212 , scheduler 222 again determines that the bandwidth allocations will not fill UL data packet field 638 and that one or more bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range (that is, the request of MS 214 ) remain unallocated. Scheduler 222 further determines that there is sufficient space in UL data packet field 638 to replace a next lowest priority allocation of bandwidth to a bandwidth allocation request of the first size range, for example, the allocation made to MS 211 , with an allocation of bandwidth to a next highest priority bandwidth allocation request of the second size range that has not been allocated bandwidth in the UL sub-frame, for example, the bandwidth allocation request of MS 214 . Scheduler 222 then replaces the bandwidth allocation to MS 211 in the UL sub-frame 638 with an allocation of bandwidth to MS 214 . Scheduler 222 then determines that UL data packet field 638 is full.
- scheduler 222 assures a fuller utilization of an UL data packet field of a UL sub-frame that is being scheduled.
- scheduler 222 may utilize a lookup table in determining whether to substitute one or more requests for an bandwidth allocation of the second size range for one or more allocations of bandwidth to bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range when allocating bandwidth in a UL data packet field of a UL sub-frame.
- a logic flow diagram 700 is provided of a method for uplink scheduling of MSs by a serving RAN, that is, RAN 220 and in particular scheduler 222 , in accordance with a ‘lookup table’ embodiment of the present invention.
- logic flow diagram 700 begins ( 702 ) when each MS of the multiple MSs 201 - 214 conveys to scheduler 222 , and the scheduler receives ( 704 ) from each such MS and stores in at least one memory device 404 , a request for a bandwidth allocation, that is, a request to be allocated bandwidth, in an UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame, wherein the bandwidth allocation requests include one or more requests to be allocated bandwidth of a first size range, such as a request to be allocated bandwidth anywhere in a range of less than 10 bytes, and one or more requests to be allocated bandwidth of a second size range, wherein each bandwidth allocation request of the second size range requests more bandwidth than any bandwidth allocation request of the first size range.
- a request for a bandwidth allocation that is, a request to be allocated bandwidth, in an UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame
- the bandwidth allocation requests include one or more requests to be allocated bandwidth of a first size range, such as a request to be allocated bandwidth anywhere in a range
- scheduler 222 determines ( 706 ) a number of registered MSs residing in a coverage area serviced by RAN 220 , such as a cell or a sector that is serviced by the RAN. Scheduler 222 then compares ( 708 ) the determined number of MSs to one or more threshold values to produce one or more comparisons. Based on the one or more comparisons, scheduler 222 determines ( 710 ) a maximum number of bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range that can be allocated bandwidth in a UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame.
- Scheduler 222 then schedules ( 712 ) bandwidth in a UL data packet field of a subsequent UL sub-frame accordingly, such that no more than the maximum number of bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range are scheduled for the UL data packet field of the UL sub-frame.
- Scheduler 222 schedules ( 714 ) bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range for use of the remainder of the available bandwidth in the UL data packet field of the UL sub-frame, and logic flow 700 then ends ( 716 ).
- scheduler 222 If scheduler 222 fully allocates all bandwidth allocation requests in the second size range, and there remains available bandwidth in the UL data packet field of the UL sub-frame, and there also remains additional outstanding bandwidth allocation requests in the first size range, the scheduler will resume scheduling the additional outstanding bandwidth allocation requests in the first size range until these allocations are fully allocated, or there is no available bandwidth in the UL data packet field of the UL sub-frame, or there is no available bandwidth in the UL-MAP size.
- the threshold values are maintained in table 406 of at least one memory device 404 of scheduler 222 .
- Table 406 further maintains, in association with each threshold value of the one or more threshold values, which threshold values each corresponds to a predetermined number of registered MSs in a coverage area, a maximum number of bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range that can be scheduled for a scheduling time period.
- a number of registered MSs exceeds a given threshold value, then the number of bandwidth allocations that may be scheduled at any particular time for bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range prior to an attempt to schedule the second size range is limited to the corresponding maximum number associated with that threshold value.
- the table may include multiple such threshold values, wherein the larger the threshold value, the lower the maximum number of bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range that may be scheduled for an UL data packet field.
- the scheduler may be limited to fewer bandwidth allocations to bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range.
- the particular threshold values employed, and the maximum number of bandwidth allocations to bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range corresponding to each threshold value, are up to a designer of communication system 200 and are not critical to the present invention.
- scheduler 222 may determine, by reference to table 406 and based on a number of registered MSs residing in a coverage area serviced by RAN 220 , that a maximum of ten bandwidth allocation requests of the first size range can be allocated bandwidth in a UL data packet field 638 .
- scheduler 222 allocates sub-bands in UL data packet field 638 to MSs 201 - 210 and skips over the requests of MSs 211 and 212 (wherein each of MSs 201 - 212 requested an bandwidth allocation of the first size range), instead allocating the remaining sub-bands available in UL data packet field 638 to MSs 213 and 214 (wherein each of MSs 213 and 214 requested an bandwidth allocation of the second size range).
- communication system 200 By employing these threshold values and limiting a number of possible small bandwidth allocations when increasing numbers of MSs are being served, communication system 200 better assures a fuller utilization of an UL data packet field of a UL sub-frame that is being scheduled.
- bandwidth reservations or by substituting an allocation of bandwidth to an unallocated bandwidth allocation request of the second size range for an allocation of bandwidth to a bandwidth allocation request of the first size range when the allocated bandwidth does not fill the UL data packet field and one or more bandwidth allocation requests of the second size range remains unallocated, communication system 200 more fully utilizes a UL data packet field of a UL sub-frame than is provided in the prior art.
