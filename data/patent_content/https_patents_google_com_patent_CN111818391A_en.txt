Description
The present application is a divisional application of an inventive patent application having an application date of 29/09/2017, an application number of 201780052359.5, entitled "customizing a media item for playback on an alternative playback device paired with a user device".
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to a technique of providing content, such as media from a resource of such content, to a user device or system via a communication network. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a technique that ensures that content provided to a user of a user device is compatible with playback on an alternative playback device if the user device is paired with the alternative playback device.
Background
Existing systems for providing media content (e.g., video, music) from a server to one or more user devices typically use protocols to stream (stream) such content from the server to a playback mechanism (i.e., video and/or audio player) on the user device, so long as such player is capable of receiving such content for display on the device. On a typical user device, an application or player may be available to receive and use/play such content. The user device may be proximate to an external media streaming device that streams content for presentation on an output device, such as a television and/or home theater audio system. The user device may display various media content (e.g., video, music) to the user, and the user may select the media content for playback on an output device of the user device or the media streaming device. In existing systems, a server typically transmits media content (e.g., video, music) to a user device for playback on the user device. The user device may have a smaller display and underlying speaker system than the output devices (e.g., television and/or home theater audio system) connected to the media streaming device. In existing systems, the media content provided by the server to the user device is typically not customized to the hardware of the output device of the media streaming device. This is because existing techniques rely on the settings of the user device without a mechanism to determine whether the user device is capable of initiating and/or controlling playback of media content on an output device of the media streaming device.
Conventionally, when a user device loads a web page with placeholders for additional media content (e.g., recommended videos or advertisements), the user device typically sends a request for the additional media content to a server. The server receives the request, selects additional media content, and transmits the additional media content to the user device. The server typically does not know whether the user device is capable of initiating and/or controlling playback of the additional media content on the output device of the media streaming device. The user device loads additional media content in the web page. In the case of conventional content sharing systems, after loading the additional media content, the user device then determines whether the user device can communicate with the media streaming device. If the user device can communicate with the media streaming device, a media player on the user device may display an indicator (e.g., an icon) to inform the user that additional media content items may be played on an output device of the media streaming device.
In existing systems, the server typically provides additional media content regarding the user request without knowing the user device's ability to initiate and/or control playback of the additional media content on the media streaming device. Thus, the server typically provides additional media content formatted for playback on the user device, which may not be the best format to use if it can be played on an output device of the media streaming device, such as a television and/or home theater sound system.
Conversely, the server may provide the user device with additional media content formatted for playback on an output device of the media streaming device, such as a television and/or home theater sound system. However, if the user device is unable to communicate with the media streaming device, a large amount of broadband data bandwidth and memory may be used to transmit and play additional media content in a format that is incompatible with the user device.
Furthermore, in existing systems, when additional media content is loaded on a user device and then played on an output device of a media streaming device, the content sharing system typically allocates two different sessions for loading the additional media content on the user device and playing the additional media content on the output device of the media streaming device. Conventional content sharing systems typically do not attribute the time at which the additional media content is played on the output device of the media streaming device to the presentation of the additional media content on the user device, and erroneously independently track the display of the additional media content on the user device and the play of the additional media content on the output device of the media streaming device.
Disclosure of Invention
The following presents a simplified summary of various aspects of the disclosure in order to provide a simplified understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
In an aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided. The method includes receiving a first media item from a server, the first media item being associated with a second media item, determining, by a processor of a user device, that a playback status of the user device indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device, sending a request to the server for the second media item, the request including the playback status of the user device, receiving the second media item from the server in a first format for playing the second media item on the user device and in a second format for playing the second media item on the alternate playback device, determining whether the playback status of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with the alternate playback device, in response to determining that the playback status of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with the alternate playback device, displaying on the user device a first graphical representation of the second media item in the first format, wherein user selection of the first graphical representation triggers playback of the second media item on the user device, and in response to determining that the playback status of the user device indicates pairing of the user device with an alternate playback device, displaying a second graphical representation of the second media item in a second format on the user device, wherein user selection of the second graphical representation triggers playback of the second media item on the alternate playback device.
In one embodiment, the playback state is stored locally on the user device. In one embodiment, the alternate playback device supports at least one of a casting technique or a mirroring technique. In one embodiment, the method further includes displaying a second graphical representation of a second media item in a second format on the user device, receiving a user selection of the second graphical representation, and sending a universal resource identifier of the second media item and a tracking identifier associated with the requested session identifier to the alternate playback device.
In one implementation, the second graphical representation of the second media item in the second format includes a thumbnail, a character string placeholder for an identifier of the alternate playback device, and a universal resource identifier for playing the selected candidate media item on the alternate playback device. In one embodiment, displaying on the user device a second graphical representation of a second media item in a second format comprises: an identifier of the alternate playback device is determined and the identifier of the alternate playback device is displayed in a second graphical representation of a second media item. In one embodiment, the second media item is at least one of a recommended video, a recommended audio, or an advertisement.
In an aspect of the disclosure, a processing device of a user device receives a first media item from a server. The first media item is associated with the second media item. The processing device determines that the playback status of the user device indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device, and sends a request for the second media item to the server. The request includes a playback status of the user device. The processing device receives, from the server, a second media item in the first format for playing the second media item on the user device, and receives a second media item in the second format for playing the second media item on the alternate playback device. The processing device determines whether the playback status of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device.
In response to determining that the playback status of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device, the processing device displays a first graphical representation of a second media item in the first format on the user device. User selection of the first graphical representation triggers playback of the second media item on the user device. In response to determining that the playback status of the user device indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device, the processing device displays a second graphical representation of a second media item in a second format on the user device. User selection of the second graphical representation triggers playback of the second media item on the alternative playback device.

In one embodiment, the processing device displays a second graphical representation of a second media item in a second format on the user device, receives a user selection of the second graphical representation, and sends a universal resource identifier of the second media item and a tracking identifier associated with the requested session identifier to the alternate playback device.
In one embodiment, the second graphical representation of the second media item in the second format includes a thumbnail, a string placeholder for an identifier of the alternate playback device, and a universal resource identifier for playing the selected candidate media item on the alternate playback device. In one embodiment, the processing device displays a second graphical representation of the second media item in a second format on the user device by determining an identifier of the alternate playback device, and displays the identifier of the alternate playback device in the second graphical representation of the second media item. In one embodiment, the second media item is at least one of a recommended video, a recommended audio, or an advertisement.
In one embodiment, a processing device of the server receives a request from the user device for an additional media item related to the first media item to be displayed on the user device, and determines whether the additional media item is to be played on an alternate playback device from a playback state of the user device in the request. In response to determining that the additional media item is to be played on the alternate playback device, the processing device of the server identifies a set of candidate media items designated for playback on the alternate playback device, selects a candidate media item with a highest ranking from the set of candidate media items as the additional media item, and sends a data packet to the user device to present the selected candidate media item on the user device as the additional media item.
In one embodiment, the processing device of the server determines that the playback status indicates that the additional media item will not be played on the alternative playback device, and excludes from the set of candidate media items a subset of the media items designated for playback on the alternative playback device. In one embodiment, the data package contains a first format for playing the selected candidate media item on the user device and a second format for playing the selected candidate media item on the alternate playback device. In one embodiment, the processing device of the server determines that the playback status indicates that the additional media item will not be played on the alternative playback device, creates a tracking identifier based on a session identifier associated with the request, adds the tracking identifier to a universal resource identifier used to play the selected candidate media item on the alternative playback device, and creates a data package containing the universal resource identifier with the tracking identifier.

The primary media item may be associated with one or more secondary media items. For example, the primary media item may be mobile application content and the secondary media item may be a recommended video or advertisement to be displayed with respect to the mobile application content.
As described above, conventional systems typically do not know whether the user device is paired with an alternate playback device (e.g., a second screen device in the user's living room), and do not provide content customized for playback on the alternate playback device when it is paired with the user device.
Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by providing a mechanism that ensures that if a user device is paired with an alternate playback device, additional media items are provided that are compatible for playback on the alternate playback device. A user device is considered paired with an alternate playback device if the user device can communicate with the alternate playback device and can initiate and/or control playback of content on the alternate playback device.
According to some aspects of the disclosure, prior to the user device sending a request to the server for an additional media item, the user device determines a playback status of the user device indicating whether the user device is paired with an alternate playback device. The user device sends its playback status to the server to inform the server of the user device's ability to have the additional media item played on the alternate playback device. The server receives the playback status and may customize the selection of the additional media items based on the playback status of the user device. The server may provide a content package containing the selected additional media item in a format for playing the additional media item on the user device and in another format for playing the additional media item on the alternate playback device. The user device receives the content package, determines whether the playback state has changed, and displays the additional media item on the user device in an appropriate format based on whether the playback state has changed.
Accordingly, aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure ensure that the server provides the user device with additional media items that are customized for playback on the alternative playback device and the user device if the user device is paired with the alternative playback device. Aspects of the present disclosure also provide for tracking identifiers to link the display of additional media items on the user device to the playback of the additional media items on the alternative playback device.
The techniques disclosed herein are advantageous because they avoid overloading the broadband network by transferring large media files from a server to a user device if the user device is not paired with an alternate playback device. Conversely, such media files are only transmitted if the user device is paired with an alternate playback device. The techniques disclosed herein may thus provide for adaptive data transmission, wherein the transmitted data is adapted to the playback device, e.g. to the properties of the playback device, such that bandwidth is efficiently used. Further, by customizing additional media items for customization on alternative playback devices, such as large television screens (e.g., in the user's living room), the techniques disclosed herein allow the user to have a more immersive and interactive viewing experience, and to share this experience with the user's friends and family.
For simplicity and brevity, embodiments of the present disclosure generally refer to video. However, the teachings of the present disclosure apply to media items in general, and may be applied to various types of content, including, for example, video, audio, text, images, program instructions, and so forth.
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a system architecture 100 according to one implementation of the present disclosure. System architecture 100 includes one or more user devices (e.g., user device 140), one or more servers (e.g., primary content provider server 160, secondary content provider server 160), one or more alternate playback devices 101A, 101B, one or more output devices 103A, 103B, a network (e.g., network 115, network 150), and one or more data stores (e.g., data stores 163, 123, 143).
The content provider servers 120, 160 may be coupled to one or more data stores 123, 163 that store media items. The primary content provider server 160 may be a network service provider, digital video provider, music provider, social media provider, or the like. The secondary content provider server 120 may be, for example, an advertisement server or a recommendation server. The media items may be primary media item 161 and secondary media items 129A, 129B (additional media items). For simplicity and brevity, one primary media item 162 and one secondary media item (e.g., secondary media item 129A, secondary media item 129B) (additional media items) may be used as examples throughout this document. The primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B may be digital content selected by a user, digital content provided by a user, digital content uploaded by a user, digital content selected by a content provider, digital content selected by a broadcaster, or the like. Examples of primary media item 161 and secondary media items 129A, 129B include, but are not limited to, web page content, mobile application content, digital video, digital movies, digital photos, digital music, website content, social media updates, electronic books (ebooks), electronic magazines, digital newspapers, digital audio books, electronic journals, web blogs, Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, electronic comics, software applications, and so forth.
The servers 120, 160 can be one or more computing devices (such as rack-mounted servers, router computers, server computers, personal computers, mainframe (mainframe) computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, desktop computers, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disks, memories, databases), networks, software components, and/or hardware components that can be used to provide users with access to the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B and/or to provide the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B. The servers 120, 160 may be part of a content sharing platform that may allow users to consume, upload, share, search, like ("like"), dislike, and/or comment on the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B. The content sharing platform may also contain website (e.g., web pages) or application (e.g., mobile applications) backend software that may be used to provide users with access to the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B.
For simplicity and brevity, online video (hereinafter also referred to as video) may be used throughout this document as an example of the secondary media items 129A, 129B. As used herein, "media," "media items," "online media items," "digital media items," "content," and "content items" may encompass electronic files that may be executed or loaded using software, firmware, or hardware configured to present digital media items to an entity.
In one example, the primary media item 161 may be identified by a user video of the user device 140, and the secondary media items 129A, 129B may be video advertisements or recommended videos selected by the secondary content provider server 120 to be presented before, during, or after presentation of the primary media item 161 on one or more of the user devices (e.g., the user device 140). User devices (e.g., user device 140) may each include a computing device such as a Personal Computer (PC), laptop, mobile phone, smart phone, tablet computer, netbook computer, network-connected television, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user device 140 may also be referred to as a "client device".
The user device 140 may contain one or more applications (e.g., application 148) to play the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B. The user device 140 may be a mobile device such as a smartphone, tablet, e-reader, etc. The applications may be web browsers, web applications, and local mobile applications (mobile apps). A web application or web app is a client-server software application that uses a web browser. The web browser renders a web page ("page") provided by the server to present a user interface on the user device 140. A native mobile application is an application for a mobile device that is used for a particular operating system (e.g.,
The system architecture 100 may include one or more alternate playback devices 101A, 101B coupled to one or more output devices 103A, 103B. The output devices 103A, 103B may be a display (e.g., television, monitor), an audio system (e.g., high-resolution television or home audio system), a computer system (e.g., desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet), and a Virtual Reality (VR) system (e.g., VR headset). Each alternate playback device may be connected to multiple output devices. For example, the alternative playback device 101A may be connected to a large-screen 3D television and a home surround sound system. The alternate playback devices 101A, 101B may be digital media players that play the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B (e.g., audio/video, images) on one or more output devices (e.g., high-resolution television or home audio system) by streaming the primary media item 161 and the secondary media items 129A, 129B directly from the internet or a local area network (e.g., network 115) via Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity).
A subset of the secondary media items (e.g., secondary media items 129A) in data store 123 may be compatible for playback using computing hardware (e.g., display, speakers) of user device 140. For example, the secondary media item 129A may be formatted for a small display on a smartphone, may have a lower video quality (e.g., 240p and 360p), and may be stereo.
Another subset of secondary media items (e.g., secondary media item 129B) in data store 123 may be designated for playback on alternate playback devices 101A, 101B based on user (e.g., content provider) input. The content provider may be a content owner (e.g., video provider, music provider, advertiser) and may specify which secondary media items (e.g., secondary media item 129B) to use for playback on the alternative playback devices 101A, 101B. Each of the designated secondary media items 129B may contain an indicator 122 (e.g., a bit, a flag) to indicate that the respective secondary media item 129B is for playback on the alternative playback device 101A, 101B, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 4.
The subset of secondary media items 129B may be specifically formatted for playback on the output devices 103A, 103B coupled to the alternate playback devices 101A, 101B. For example, a subset of the secondary media items 129B may be formatted for a larger display (e.g., television display, projector screen, computer display) than the display of the user device 140. In another example, the secondary media item 129B may be formatted for high-definition (HD) video quality, may be surround sound (e.g., alternate playback device 101A, 101B may not be supported by the user device 140. For example, the secondary media item 129B may be a 3D video, which may not be supported by the user device 140.
The user device 140 can be coupled to one or more alternative playback devices 101A, 101B via, for example, the network 115 to play the secondary media items 129A, 129B on the alternative playback devices 101A, 101B. The alternate playback devices 101A, 101B and the user device 140 may include wireless technology to establish a connection between the alternate playback devices 101A, 101B and the user device 140. Wireless communication technologies may include peer-to-peer (P2P),
The secondary media item 129B may be played on the alternative playback devices 101A, 101B using casting techniques and/or mirroring techniques. The user device 140 may include an alternate playback Application Programming Interface (API)147 for each alternate playback device 101A, 101B to which the user device 140 is capable of connecting. Casting techniques and mirroring techniques refer to content streaming and playback involving a first device identifying content to play (e.g., the secondary media item 129B) and a second device providing playback of the identified content. In the casting technique, video encoding of the secondary media item 129B is not performed by the user device 140. The user device 140 may send a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) (e.g., a Universal Resource Locator (URL)) of the secondary media item 129B to an alternate playback device (e.g., the alternate playback device 101A), and the alternate playback device 101 may use the URI to retrieve the secondary media item 129B from the secondary content provider server 120 via an internet connection over the network 150. The alternate playback device 101A receives the secondary media item 129B and streams the secondary media item 129B from the URI directly to one or more output devices 103A (e.g., television, home theater audio system).
In the mirroring technique, the user device 140 receives a stream of secondary media items 129B (e.g., videos) over the internet and network 150 and repackages the stream into a reformatted stream of secondary media items 129B (e.g., reformatted video streams) for use in place of the playback device 101A. User device 140 streams reformatted streams over network 115alternate playback device 101A. The alternate playback device 101A outputs the secondary media item 129B to an output device 101A (e.g., a television, home theater audio system).
An application 148 on the user device 140 may load a document 142 (e.g., a web page, a mobile application UI document), and the document 142 may contain a primary media item (e.g., web page content, mobile application content), and a portion (referred to as a media item placeholder 146) to be populated with a graphical representation of a secondary media item (e.g., the secondary media item 129A or the secondary media item 129B). Document 142 may contain a plurality of media item placeholders. The placeholder 146 may be associated with code (e.g., JavaScript ordocument 142. Secondary media items (e.g., secondary media items) for placeholders 146129A or the secondary media item 129B) may be selected by the secondary content provider server 120. The placeholders 146 can be for particular types of secondary media items (e.g., video advertisements, display advertisements, recommended videos, etc.) and can contain tags that indicate to a server (e.g., the secondary content provider server 120) what types of secondary media items should be used for the placeholders 146.
The user device 140 may include a customized playback component 145 to send a request 131 for a secondary media item (e.g., secondary media 129A or secondary media 129B) to the secondary content provider server 120 depending on whether the user device 140 is paired with an alternate playback device 101A, 101B. Prior to sending the request 131 to the secondary content provider server 125, the customized playback component 145 can determine a playback status 141 of the user device 140 that indicates whether the user device 140 is paired with an alternate playback device 101A, 101B (e.g., on which playback of secondary media items (e.g., advertisements, recommended videos, recommended audio) can be initiated/controlled). The playback state 141 may indicate whether the user device 140 includes an alternate playback Application Programming Interface (API)147, including appropriate operating system permissions to allow the application 148 to initiate playback of the secondary media item on an alternate playback device (e.g., the alternate playback device 101A), and whether the user device 140 may communicate with the alternate playback device 101A, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 4.
The playback state 141 may already be stored in the data storage 143 of the user device 140. Data store 143 may be a cache in which playback state 141 is stored when it was most recently determined by customized playback component 145, as described in more detail below in conjunction with fig. 4. For example, the cache may store the playback state 141, the playback state 141 being determined when the application 148 recently loaded the document 142. The playback state 141 may be stored as part of the application data of the mobile application or as a cookie (cookie) for a web browser. If no playback state 141 is already stored in data store 143, customized playback component 145 may determine playback state 141 of user device 140, as described in more detail below in conjunction with FIG. 4.
In one implementation, the customized playback component 145 sends a request 131 for the secondary media item to the primary content provider server 160, which contains the playback state 141, and the primary content provider server 160 requests the secondary media item from the secondary content provider server 120. In another embodiment, the customized playback component 145 sends the request 131 for the secondary media item directly to the secondary content provider server 120, which has a playback state 141.
The alternate media playback provider 125 on the secondary content provider server 120 may receive the request 131 for the secondary media item and may select the secondary media item (e.g., the secondary media item 129A or the secondary media item 129B) based on the playback state 141 of the user device 140 in the request 131. During selection, the alternative media playback provider 125 may use the playback state 141 to include or exclude a subset of the secondary media items 129B that are formatted for playback on the alternative playback devices 101A, 101B, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 5. The alternative media playback provider 125 may also use the playback state 141 to rank the secondary media items 129A, 129B based on the playback state 141, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 5.
If the playback status 141 in the request 131 indicates that the user device 140 is paired with an alternate playback device 101A, 101B, the alternate media playback provider 125 may select a secondary media item in the subset of secondary media items 129B that is formatted for the alternate playback device 101A, 101B, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 5. If the playback status 141 indicates that the user device 140 is not paired with an alternate playback device 101A, 101B, the alternate media playback provider 125 may select a secondary media item in the subset of secondary media items 129A that is not formatted for playback on the alternate playback device 101A, 101B.
Instead of media playback provider 125 creating data package 133, data package 133 may contain the selected secondary media item (e.g., secondary media item 129A or secondary media item 129B). In one embodiment, alternate media playback provider 125 sends data packet 133 to primary content provider server 160, and primary content provider server 160 sends data packet 133 to user device 140. In another implementation, the alternate media playback provider 125 sends the data packet 133 directly to the user device 140.
If the alternate media playback provider 125 selects one of a subset of the secondary media items 129B that is formatted for playback on the alternate playback devices 101A, 101B, the alternate media playback provider 125 may provide the selected secondary media item 129B in a plurality of formats. The data package 133 may contain the selected secondary media item 129B in the first format for playing the selected secondary media item 129B on the user device 140 and may contain the selected secondary media item 129B in the second format for playing the selected secondary media item 129B on the alternate playback device 101A.
When user device 140 receives data packet 133, user device 140 may no longer be connected to any alternative playback device and may no longer have the ability to control playback of selected secondary media item 129B on the alternative playback device. The customized playback component 145 on the user device 140 may select the first format or the second format in the data package 133 based on whether the user device 140 is still paired with an alternate playback device (e.g., has the ability to control playback of the selected secondary media item 129B). The customized playback component 145 on the user device 140 can determine a new playback state 149 to determine whether the user device 140 is still able to control playback of the selected secondary media item 129 on the alternate playback device, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 4.
The customized playback component 145 can select the first format if the user device 140 does not have the ability to initiate/control playback of the selected secondary media item 129 on an alternate playback device. The selected secondary media item 129B in the first format for playing the secondary media item 129B on the user device 140 may contain an image or thumbnail of the selected secondary media item 129B.
FIG. 2 is an exemplary graphical user interface 201(GUI) displaying a graphical representation of a media item in a format for playing the media item on a user device 200, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The format for playing the secondary media item 205 on the user device 200 may contain an image 203 (e.g., a thumbnail) of the secondary media item 205. The secondary media item 205 may be an advertisement, a recommended video, or a recommended audio. For example, the secondary media item 205 may be an advertisement for a new video game. The GUI 201 may display a graphical representation (e.g., a thumbnail) of the primary media item 207. The primary media item 207 and/or the secondary media item 205 may be a video.
Referring to fig. 1, the customized playback component 145 can select the second format if the user device 140 still has the ability to control playback of the selected secondary media item 129B on an alternative playback device. The selected secondary media item 129B in the second format for playing the selected secondary media item 129B on the alternative playback device 101 may contain an image from the frame of the selected secondary media item 129B, an indicator that informs the user that the selected secondary media item 129B may be played on the alternative playback device 101, a URI of the selected secondary media item 129B, and a tracking identifier. For example, if the selected secondary media item 129B is a video, the selected secondary media item 129B in the second format can be a thumbnail of the selected secondary media item 129B, and the indicator can be a message string, such as "click here to play on your alternate playback device" on the thumbnail. In one embodiment, the indicator (e.g., message string) in the second format may be customized for a particular alternate playback device 101A, 101B, as described in more detail below in conjunction with fig. 4.
Fig. 3 is an exemplary graphical user interface 301(GUI) displaying a graphical representation of a media item on a user device 300 to play the media item on an alternative playback device in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The GUI301 may display a graphical representation (e.g., a thumbnail) of the primary media item 307. GUI301 may display a graphical representation (e.g., a thumbnail) of secondary media item 305 with a view to playing secondary media item 305 on an alternative playback device. The secondary media item 305 may be an advertisement, a recommended video, or a recommended audio. For example, the secondary media item 305 may be an advertisement for a new video game. The primary media item 307 and/or the secondary media item 305 may be a video. The format for playing the secondary media item 305 on the alternative playback device may contain an image 303 (e.g., a thumbnail) from the frame of the secondary media item 305, and an indicator 309 that the secondary media item 305 may be played on the alternative playback device. Indicator 309 may be a string.
Referring to FIG. 1, the tracking identifier may be used to link a session in which the selected secondary media item 129B is presented on the user device 140 with a session in which the selected secondary media item 129B is played on an alternative playback device, as described in more detail below in connection with FIG. 5.
In general, the functions described in one embodiment, as performed by the content sharing platform, may also be performed in other embodiments on the user device 140, if appropriate. Further, functionality attributed to a particular component may be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The content sharing platform and media server 120 may also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through a suitable application programming interface and is therefore not limited to use in a website. Although embodiments of the present disclosure are discussed in terms of a media server and a content sharing platform, embodiments may also apply generally to any type of social network that provides connectivity between digital content and users.
In embodiments of the present disclosure, a "user" may be represented as a single individual. However, other embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate that a "user" is an entity controlled by a set of users and/or automated resources. For example, a collection of individual users that are joined as a community in a social network may be considered a "user".
Where the systems discussed herein collect or may utilize personal information about a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content sharing platform collects user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social behavior or activity, profession, the user's preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. Further, before particular data is stored or used, it may be processed in one or more ways to remove separately identifiable information. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that the user's individually identifiable information cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user in the case of location information may be summarized (such as at a city, zip code, or state level), such that the user's particular location cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content sharing platform.
Data storage 123, 143, 163 can be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a drive (e.g., hard drive, flash drive), a database system, or another type of component or device capable of storing data. The data store 123, 143, 163 can contain multiple storage components (e.g., multiple drives or multiple databases), which can span multiple computing devices (e.g., multiple server computers).
Fig. 4 depicts a flow diagram of a method 400 for providing a customized media item according to whether a user device is paired with an alternative playback device in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Method 400 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the method is performed by the customized playback component 145 in the user device 140 of fig. 1, while in some other embodiments, one or more blocks in fig. 4 may be performed by another machine. In one embodiment, a processing device of a user device (e.g., user device 140 in fig. 1) performs method 400.
At block 410, the processing device receives a first media item from a server. The first media item is associated with the second media item. The first media item may be, for example, web page content or mobile application content. The second media item may be, for example, video and/or audio, one or more images, and/or the like. The second media item may be an advertisement (e.g., displaying an advertisement, a video and/or audio advertisement), a recommended video, a recommended audio, or a recommended audio/video file. The server may be a secondary content provider server (e.g., secondary content provider server 120 in fig. 1). The secondary content provider server may be, for example, an advertisement server or a recommendation server. In one example, the first media item may be identified by a user video of the user device, and the second media item may be an advertisement selected by the server for presentation before, during, or after presentation of the first media item on the user device.
At block 420, the processing device determines that the playback status of the user device indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device. The alternative playback device may be a device that supports casting technology and/or mirroring technology. The processing device may determine whether there is a playback state of the user device that is already locally stored on the user device, and the processing device may access the locally stored playback state. For example, the playback state may be stored as part of the application data in the cache of the user device or in a cookie (cookie) within the browser. The playback state may be represented by a Boolean value. The Boolean value may be a binary variable, with two possible values, representing "true" and "false".
The locally stored playback state may represent the playback state of the user device when the previous, most recent web page was loaded by the browser, or when the previous, most recent mobile application data was loaded by the mobile application. The processing device may examine, for example, network tracker (cookie) data indicating the playback status to determine whether the user device was paired with an alternate playback device at the time of the previous loading of the web page or application data.
If the playback state of the user device is not already stored locally on the user device, the processing device may detect whether the user device has alternate playback pairing capabilities. The processing device may determine the user device capabilities by checking whether the user device contains any APIs for any of the alternative playback devices, determining whether the user device operating system has authorized an appropriate permission for an application (e.g., web browser, mobile app) to initiate/control playback of the second media item on the alternative playback device, and whether a connection exists between the user device and the alternative playback device. If the user device does not include the alternate playback API, the processing device may determine that the user device is not capable of being paired with an alternate playback device.
If the user device includes an alternate playback API, the processing device may determine whether the user device Operating System (OS) allows the application to initiate/control playback of the second media item on the alternate playback device. If the application does not have permission(s) from the OS, the processing device may determine that the user device cannot be paired with the alternate playback device.
If the application has permission(s) from the OS, the processing device may determine whether the user device has a connection with an alternate playback device. The processing device may request an API (e.g., API 147 in fig. 1) to determine whether the alternate playback device is near the user device and has an established connection with the user device (e.g., Wi-Fi)
The processing device may determine that the user device is not capable of being paired with the alternate playback device if the user device does not have a connection with the alternate playback device. The processing device may determine that the user device is capable of being paired with the alternate playback device if the user device has a connection with the alternate playback device. The processing device may store the playback state, for example, as a cookie (cookie) or as application data in a cache (e.g., mobile application data).
In one embodiment, the processing device determines the type of output device (e.g., output devices 103A, 103B in fig. 1) and/or characteristics of the output device coupled to the alternate playback device, and the processing device includes the playback status and output device data (e.g., type, characteristics) of the connected output device in the request to the server. Exemplary types of output devices may include televisions, audio systems, VR headsets, and computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, etc.). Exemplary features may include High Definition (HD) displays, surround sound, display size, three-dimensional (3D) displays, 3D VR, and the like.
At block 430, the processing device sends a request (e.g., advertisement, recommended video and/or audio) for a second media item to the server. The processing device may send the request upon determining the playback state of the user device. The request may contain a playback status of the user device. In one embodiment, the playback state is contained as cookie data in the request. In one embodiment, the request includes output device data describing the type and/or characteristics of the output device (e.g., television, sound system, VR device, HD display, surround sound, 3D display) in place of the playback device.
At block 440, the processing device receives, from the server, a second media item in the first format for playing the second media item on the user device, and receives a second media item in the second format for playing the second media item on the alternate playback device. The processing device may receive a data package from the server that contains a component of the second media item in two formats (e.g., an image, a string, a URI, a tracking identifier, etc.).
At block 450, the processing device determines whether the playback status of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device. The processing device may make the determination in response to receiving a second media item in the first format and the second format. The playback state of the user device may change since the user device sent the request to the server. For example, the user device may lose network connection with the alternate playback device.
In one embodiment, the processing device requests a local browser, mobile app, or alternative playback device API to make a new determination of whether the playback state of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with an alternative playback device. For example, when the processing device renders a second media item in a received webpage in a browser or page of the mobile app, the processing device may request the browser, the mobile app, or the API to refresh the playback state of the user device. The processing device may listen for updates to the playback state of the user device and may store the updated playback state in a cache. The processing device may receive the new playback state from an application (e.g., web browser, mobile app) or API. The processing device may replace the playback state in the data storage volume with the new playback state.
The processing device may also collect metadata about the alternate playback device when the processing device determines whether the playback status of the user device still indicates that the user device is paired with the alternate playback device. The metadata of the alternate playback device may contain an identifier (e.g., name, label) of the alternate playback device.
Each alternate playback device may be assigned a playback device identifier. The playback device identifier may be configurable and/or user defined. For example, the user device may be in the home of a smith family and may be coupled to an alternative playback device in the living room, and the user (e.g., a smith family member) may assign the name "smith living room device" to the alternative playback device.
In one implementation, the processing device receives an identifier of each alternate playback device coupled to the user device from an application (e.g., web browser, mobile app) or one or more alternate playback APIs. The processing device may use the identifier of the alternate playback device(s) in the graphical representation of the second media item or in the menu, as described in more detail below.
The processing device may decide which format to use to render the graphical representation of the second media item on the user device based on the updated playback state. If the updated playback status of the user device no longer indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device (block 450), at block 470, the processing device displays a first graphical representation of a second media item in the first format on the user device. The first graphical representation may contain an image and may not contain any components (e.g., images, strings, URIs, tracking identifiers, etc.), which may be contained in the second format. Selection of the first graphical representation may trigger playback of the second media item on the user device. If the first graphical representation is selected (e.g., clicked on), the second media item may be played in a media player in a new tab page in the browser, in a media player in a new window of the browser, or in a media player of a mobile application on the user device.
If the updated playback status of the user device still indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device (block 450), at block 460, the processing device displays a second graphical representation of a second media item in a second format on the user device. In one embodiment, the second format of the second media item includes an identifier of the alternate playback device selected for playback. For example, the second format of the second media item may be a thumbnail of the second media item and an indicator (e.g., a message string), such as "click here to play on a smith living room device," which may be displayed on the thumbnail.
The user device may be coupled to a plurality of alternative playback devices. For example, the user device may also be coupled to a second alternative playback device that is in a bedroom in the home of the smith family and has the identifier "smith bedroom device". In one embodiment, if the user device is connected to multiple alternative playback devices, the second format contains a gap User Interface (UI) menu (e.g., pop-up menu) to be rendered when the user selects the second graphical representation of the second media item. The UI menu may display identifiers of the alternate playback devices, and the user may select one of the alternate playback devices to play the second media item.
The second graphical representation may contain a thumbnail of the second media item, which when selected may trigger the second media item to play on the alternate playback device. When the second graphical representation is selected, the processing device sends the URI of the second media item, which is part of the data package received from the server, to the alternate playback device.
In one embodiment, when the processing device determines at block 450 whether the playback status of the user device still indicates that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device, the processing device may also collect metadata about the output devices (e.g., output devices 103A, 103B in fig. 1). The metadata of the output device may include the type of output device and/or characteristics of the output device. Exemplary types of output devices may include televisions, audio systems, VR headsets, and computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, etc.). Exemplary features may include High Definition (HD) displays, surround sound, display size, 3D displays, 3D VR, and the like.
The processing device may create and/or display a gap UI menu (e.g., a pop-up menu) that displays an identifier of the alternate playback devices and data for the one or more output devices, and the user may select one of the alternate playback devices and the one or more output devices to play the second media item. For example, the pop-up menu may display information that "smith bedroom device" is connected to the 3D television and "smith living room device" is connected to the VR headset. The data package may contain a plurality of URIs that specify a plurality of versions of the second media item for playback on the alternative playback device. The processing device may select the URI of one of the versions based on the type of output device and/or characteristics of the output device to be used for playing the selected secondary media item. For example, the data package may contain a first URI for a version of the second media item that supports playback to a 3D television set and a second URI for a version of the second media item that supports playback to a VR headset.
The processing device may receive a user-selected input, e.g., a "smith living room device" is connected to the VR headset, and the processing device may select and send a second URI for a version compatible with the VR headset to the alternate playback device. The alternative playback device may use the URI to stream the version of the selected second media item on one or more output devices (e.g., VR headphones).
In one embodiment, the data package contains a plurality of URIs that are designated as versions of the selected second media item for playback on the alternative playback device. The processing device may select the URI of one of the versions based on the type of output device and/or characteristics of the output device to be used for playing the selected secondary media item. For example, the processing device may determine a selected second media item to be played on the VR headset, and the processing device may select and send a URI for a version compatible with the VR headset to the alternate playback device. The alternate playback device may use the URI to stream the selected version of the second media item on one or more output devices (e.g., VR headphones).
The second format may also contain a tracking identifier, and the processing device may send the tracking identifier to an alternate playback device. The alternate playback device may contact the server using the URI to stream the second media item from the server and display the second media item on an output device (e.g., a television). For example, the alternative playback device may play the second media item on a large screen television. The alternate playback device may record a time at which the second media item was played by the alternate playback device on the display with the tracking identifier to associate the time with the second graphical representation displayed on the user device. When the user device sends a request to the server, the tracking identifier may be associated with a session identifier for the session, as described in more detail below in connection with fig. 5.
Fig. 5 depicts a flow diagram of a method 500 for selecting a media item based on whether a user device is paired with an alternative playback device in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Method 500 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the method is performed by an alternative media playback provider 125 in server 120 of fig. 1, while in some other embodiments, one or more blocks of fig. 5 may be performed by another machine. In one embodiment, the method 500 is performed by a processing device of a server computing machine (e.g., the secondary content provider server 120 in FIG. 1).
At block 510, the processing device receives a request from a user device for additional media items with respect to a first media item to be displayed to a user. The first media item may be, for example, web page content or mobile application content to be displayed on the user device. The additional media items may be advertisements, recommended videos, or recommended music. An advertisement may be a presentation of a video or a collection of images. The collection of videos and images may contain audio.
The request may include a playback status of the user device indicating whether the user device is paired with an alternate playback device. In one embodiment, the request includes a tag for a placeholder (e.g., placeholder 146 in FIG. 1) that indicates the type of additional media item being requested, as described in more detail below. In one implementation, the request includes output device data (e.g., type, characteristics) for output devices associated with the alternate playback device(s) connected to the user device, as described in more detail below.
At block 520, the processing device determines from the playback state of the user device in the request that the additional media item is playable on the alternate playback device. The playback state may be, for example, a status bit in the request or a cookie (cookie). Upon receiving the request, the processing device may search for and extract a status bit or cookie in the request to determine whether the user device is paired with an alternate playback device that indicates whether the additional media item is playable on the alternate playback device. The playback state may be represented by a brink value. The Boolean value may be a binary variable having two possible values, representing "true" (e.g., "1") and "false" (e.g., "0"). For example, a "true" value may indicate that the user device is paired with an alternate playback device that indicates that the additional media item is playable on the alternate playback device, and a "false" value may indicate that the additional media item is not playable on the alternate playback device.
At block 530, the processing device identifies a set of candidate media items for the first media item. The identification may be made in response to determining that the additional media item is playable on the alternative playback device. The processing device may be coupled to a data store (e.g., data store 123 in fig. 1) that stores media items. A subset of the media items may be designated for playback on an alternative playback device. The subset of media items may be specifically formatted for playback on an alternative playback device. For example, the subsets of media items may each be marked with an indicator (e.g., indicator 122 in fig. 1). The indicator may be a bit or a flag. A bit or flag may have a boolean value, which is a binary variable, with two possible values, representing "true" (e.g., "1") and "false" (e.g., "0"). For example, a "true" value may indicate that the respective media item is specifically formatted for playback on the alternative playback device, and a "false" value may indicate that the respective media item is not specifically formatted for playback on the alternative playback device.
If the playback status in the request indicates that the additional media item is not playable on the alternate playback device, the processing device may exclude from the set of candidate media items a subset of the candidate media items designated for playback on the alternate playback device. Excluding a subset of candidate media items from the set of candidate media items designated for playback on the alternate playback device reduces further processing associated with the excluded subset, resulting in more efficient selection of suitable candidate media items. If the playback status indicates that the additional media items are playable on the alternate playback device, the processing device may include, in the set of candidate media items, a subset of the candidate media items designated for playback on the alternate playback device.
At block 540, the processing device selects the candidate media item with the highest ranking from the subset of candidate media items as the additional media item. The processing device may identify a ranking of the set of candidate media items. The ranking may be based on a quality score of the candidate media item.
The processing device may identify a quality score for each candidate media item. The quality score is a metric that represents how relevant the respective candidate media item is to the document (e.g., the web page or mobile application UI document 142 in fig. 1) and/or to the user requesting the document. The components of the quality score may include, for example, CTR (click through rate), relevance, and landing page. In one example, the CTR of a candidate media item is the ratio of the number of users that click on a particular link to the total number of users that view the candidate media item. In another example, the candidate media item is a video, and the CTR of the candidate media item is counted when the video begins playing. The landing page is a separate web page or mobile application page that is different from the host website or host mobile application and has been designed for a single target of interest to persuade the user to click to another page.
The ranking of the candidate media items may be an overall score of the respective candidate media item. Ranking (e.g., overall score) may be a function of quality score and bid (bid). In one embodiment, the ranking of the candidate media item is the quality score of the candidate media item multiplied by the bid for the candidate media item. Each candidate media item may be assigned a bid that is the maximum amount or currency the content provider is willing to pay when the user selects (e.g., clicks on) the graphical representation of the candidate media item. Bids can be user (e.g., content provider, advertiser) defined. The quality score may be generated by a server (e.g., the secondary content provider server 120 in FIG. 1), such as an advertisement server or a recommendation server.
The processing device may improve the ranking of the subset of candidate media items designated for playback on the alternate playback device by modifying (e.g., increasing) the quality score of the subset of candidate media items designated for playback on the alternate playback device. In one embodiment, each quality score is increased by a multiplier or by adding a value to the corresponding quality score. The multiplier and value may be configurable and user (e.g., system administrator) defined. The increased quality score may result in a higher ranking (e.g., overall score) of the media item that is marked as each of the subset played back on the alternate playback device.
The processing device selects the candidate media item with the highest ranking (e.g., overall score) from the subset of candidate media items as the additional media item. At block 550, the processing device sends a data packet to the user device to present the selected candidate media item as an additional media item to the user. If the playback status in the request indicates that additional media items may be played on the alternate playback device, the processing device may create selected candidate media items in a plurality of formats. The data package may contain selected candidate media items in a first format for playing the additional media items on the user device and selected candidate media items in a second format for playing the additional media items on the alternative playback device.
In one embodiment, a tag is present in the request received at block 510. The tag may indicate the type of additional media item being requested. Exemplary types of media items may contain text, images, rich media, or video. The video type may comprise a video, an animated collection of images, a music file, or any type of media that may be played in a video player, a music player, or an alternative playback device.
In one implementation, there is a user device identifier in the request received at block 510 that specifies the type of user device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, e-reader, laptop, desktop). The processing device may use the tag and/or the user device identifier to select the composed first set of first formats for playing the additional media items on the user device. For example, if the tag specifies a video as a type and the user device identifier specifies a smartphone, the first set of components may contain media files (e.g., video files, music files, presentation files, etc.) for a particular version of the selected candidate media item formatted for the smartphone.
A data store (e.g., data store 123 in fig. 1) may store multiple versions of a media item. For example, the data store may store a version of the media item formatted for playback on a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone). A first format for a particular user device (e.g., a mobile device) may contain a particular video quality, sound quality, display size, length of the video, and content of the video. For example, the data store may store video files of media items that are formatted for small displays on smartphones, may have lower video quality (e.g., 240p and 360p), may be stereo, and may be short in length (e.g., less than 10 seconds). A first format in which additional media items are played on the user device may be configurable and defined for a user (e.g., content owner, advertiser).
The second format for playing the additional media items on the alternative playback device may contain a different composition than the first format. In one implementation, the request received at block 510 also includes output device data (e.g., type, characteristics) for output devices associated with the alternate playback device(s) connected to the user device. Exemplary types of output devices may include televisions, audio systems, VR headsets, and computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, etc.). Exemplary features may include High Definition (HD) displays, surround sound, display size, three-dimensional (3D) displays, 3D VR, and the like.
The processing device may use the tags and/or output device data to select a composed second set of second formats for playing the additional media items on the alternate playback device. The composed second set may contain a thumbnail image, one or more strings, one or more URIs of the selected candidate media items, and a tracking identifier. For example, if the tag specifies a video as a genre and the output device data specifies a 3D television, the composed second set may contain selected candidate media item URIs for a particular version of a media file (e.g., a video file, a music file, a presentation file, etc.) formatted for 3D display. The output device data may specify a plurality of output devices, and the composed second set may contain a plurality of URIs of the plurality of versions of the selected candidate media item. For example, the output device data may specify a 3D television and a VR headset, and the second set of components may include a first URI formatted as a media file for 3D display and a second URI formatted as a media file for the VR headset.
The second format for playback on the alternate playback device may contain a particular video quality, audio quality, display size, length of the media item, and content of the media item. For example, a content provider (e.g., content owner, advertiser) may provide a video file of a media item that is formatted for a large (as defined by the content provider) display, HD display, panoramic display, and/or 3D display. For example, video files may have high video quality (e.g., 720p and 1080 p). In another example, the video file may be surround sound, may be longer in length (e.g., 30 seconds), and may contain content designated for playback on an alternate playback device (e.g., an action movie trailer). The second format for playing the additional media items on the alternative playback device may be configurable and user (e.g., content owner, advertiser) defined.
If the playback status in the request indicates that the additional media item may be played on the alternate playback device, the processing device may create a tracking identifier for the additional media item. The tracking identifier may be derived from a session identifier of a session associated with the request. The processing device may add the tracking identifier to the one or more URIs of the selected candidate media items and may contain the one or more URIs having the tracking identifier in the data package.
When the alternate playback device plays the additional media item, the alternate playback device may record the elapsed (e.g., play) time with the tracking identifier. The tracking identifier may correlate elapsed (e.g., play) time for playing the additional media item on the alternative playback device to a graphical representation of the additional media item on the user device.
