- the present disclosure generally relates to assessing ratings of service providers, and more particularly to using tip patterns to assess ratings of service providers.
- the information on the goods or service providers that people search for may include reviews or ratings.
- a computer-implemented method for using tip patterns to assess ratings includes obtaining tip information from a bill for a service provided by a service provider, generating a rating score for the service provider based on the tip information and reference tip information, and generating an aggregate rating score for the service provider based at least in part on the rating score.
- a system for using tip patterns to assess ratings includes one or more memories storing executable instructions and one or more processors.
- the one or more processors are configured to execute the stored executable instructions to obtain tip information from a bill presented to a customer for a service provided by a service provider, generate a reference tip information based at least on historical tip information for the customer, generate a rating score for the service provider based on the tip information and the generated reference tip information, and generate an aggregate rating score for the service provider based at least in part on the rating score.
- a machine-readable storage medium including machine-readable instructions for causing a processor to execute a method for using tip patterns to assess ratings.
- the method includes obtaining tip information comprising information of a service provider and a ratio of a tip amount associated with a bill presented to a customer for a service provided by the service provider, and generating a reference tip information based at least on historical tip information associated with the customer.
- the method also includes generating a rating score for the service provider based on the tip information and the generated reference tip information, including generating a higher rating score when the tip information is higher than the value of the reference tip information, and generating a lower rating score when the tip information is lower than the value of the reference tip information.
- the method further includes generating an aggregate rating score for the service provider based at least in part on the rating score.

- Search engines may base their results, at least in part, on subjective information about places. For example, existing search engines may aggregate users' opinions into value numbers and generate search results based on these numbers. These opinions may take the form of user-submitted ratings and reviews such as star-scales and short textual write-ups. Aggregation of user check-ins may also be used. These methods require that the users actively submit this information or perform check-in operations. However, a majority of users do not perform these actions, and therefore the voice of these users may not be properly reflected in the search results.
- a system and method for assessing ratings using tip patterns may receive information regarding the users' patterns on tip payments and generate scores or ratings for service providers such as, for example, restaurants. For example, the system may assign scores to the restaurants based on the amount (e.g., monetary amount or a percentage of total bill) of a tip left by a customer as compared to a reference value.
- the reference value may be determined for each customer and may be determined based on a variety of types of information. For example, the reference value may be determined based on the customer's past tips left at a specific restaurant, at similar types of restaurants, and/or restaurants in general. The reference value may also be determined based on tipping behaviors of other customers.
- the scores may be provided in the form of valence scores where the scores indicate either a positive valence or a negative valence. For example, any tip percentage higher than reference value is given a +1, and any percentage lower than the reference value is given a ⁇ 1.
- the scores may also be selected from a range of possible scores. For example, scores may be based on a scale of 1 to 10, with 5 being assigned to a reference value.
- the system may assign higher or lower scores to a restaurant based on the notion that an amount of tip paid by a customer generally reflects how favorable the customer's experience at the restaurant has been. The system may also consider the customer's tipping trend over time, and also the restaurant's tip received over time.
- check-in or “checking in” as used herein encompass their plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, the act of indicating one's presence at or near a location.
- the location may be a predetermined location or an arbitrary location.
- a check-in may be performed, for example, using a social network.
- social network encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, an online service, platform or site that focuses on the building and reflecting of social associations and interactions among users. These associations may be stored within a social graph at each social networking service. Users of social networking services may create associations with one another (e.g., mutually identify as friends). Such user associations may be defined on a user-to-user basis, or as a group of users associated through membership within a group.

- the system 202 may be implemented, for example, in one of the servers 110 , across multiple servers, in one of the clients 120 , across multiple clients, or across the servers and the clients.
- the system 202 is in communication with the network 230 (e.g., network 130 ) via a communications module 208 .
- the communications module 208 is configured to interface with the network 230 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to the other devices or systems on the network.
- the communications module 208 may be, for example, modems, Ethernet cards or mobile broadband adaptors.
- the system 202 includes a processor 204 , the communications module 208 and a memory 206 that includes tip information 212 a - 212 n and reference tip information 214 .
- Each tip information 212 a - 212 n may include a monetary amount of a tip and a bill associated with a service provider, or a ratio of the tip to the bill.
- the service providers may be providers of any types of services for which tips are customarily given, such as, for example, services at restaurants, taxis, beauty salons, barbers, and valet services.
- the reference tip information 214 includes a reference value for the tip information 212 a - 212 n.
- the reference value may be, for example, an average of all tip information 212 a - 212 n, or an average of tip information associated with a single person. Other types of values may also be used for the reference tip information 214 .
- the memory 206 also includes rating scores 216 a - 216 n and an aggregate rating score 218 . Each rating score 216 a - 216 n includes a score generated based on each of the tip information 212 a - 212 n and the reference tip information 214 .
- the aggregate rating score 218 is generated by aggregating the rating scores 216 a - 216 n that are associated with the same service provider.
- the system 202 may also include a data store 210 .
- the data store 210 may be integrated with the memory 206 , or may be independent from the memory 206 and be in communication with the processor 204 and the memory 206 .
- the tip information 212 a - 212 n, the reference tip information 214 , rating scores 216 a - 216 n and aggregate rating score 218 may be stored in the data store 210 or may be spread across the data store and the memory 206 .
- the processor 204 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor, instructions received from memory 206 in the form of software, or a combination of both.
- the processor 204 is configured to execute instructions to obtain a piece of tip information (e.g., tip information 212 a - 212 n ) including a ratio of tip amount associated with a bill to an amount of the bill, where the bill is associated with a service provider.
- the processor is also configured to generate a rating score (e.g., rating scores 216 a - 216 n ) based on the piece of tip information and reference tip information (e.g., reference tip information 214 ).
- the bill may be associated with a customer and the reference tip information may be generated based on historical tip information associated with the customer.
- the processor is further configured to generate an aggregate score (e.g., aggregate score 218 ) associated with the service provider, based on the rating score.
- FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram 300 illustrating example operations for assessing ratings using tip information.
- the operations may be performed, for example, by the system 202 .
- a piece of tip information 302 a (e.g., tip information 212 a - 212 n ) may be received, provided that authorization from the customer associated with the tip information is obtained. The customer may also revoke the authorization, after which tip information associated with the customer is no longer received.
- the tip information 302 a may be a monetary amount of a tip paid by a customer to a service provider for services received, and the amount of bill associated with the tip.
- the tip information 302 a may also be a ratio of a tip paid by a customer to an amount of bill associated with the tip. For example, if the bill is $100 and the tip paid for the bill is $20, then the ratio would be 20%. In the latter case, the amount of tip and the bill is not included in the tip information 302 a.
- the tip information 302 a may also include information on the service provider associated with the tip information. Such information may be, for example, the restaurant's name, location, type of food served, price range, dress code, and operating hours.
- the tip information 302 a may be received from various sources. Such methods may include receiving information from financial institutions, such as, for example, credit card companies which process payments made using credit cards. The method may also include obtaining tipping and billing information from scanned or physical receipts. The customers and/or service providers may be given incentives to voluntarily scan in the receipts and provide the tipping and billing information. The tip information 302 a may also be received from an intermediate system which securely receives the bill and tip amounts directly from the customers or service providers, and generates only the ratios between the two. In the case of service providers, they may provide tip and billing information only upon authorization from customers associated with the tip and billing information.
- a rating logic 304 is executed to generate a rating score 312 a (e.g., rating scores 216 a - 216 n ) based on the received tip information and a reference tip information 306 (e.g., reference tip information 214 ).
- the rating logic 304 may be, for example, part of the instructions a processor, such as the processor 204 , may execute.
- the rating logic 304 may be executed to compare the tip information 302 a and the reference tip information 306 to generate a valence score.
- the valence score indicates either a positive value or a negative value. For example, if the tip information 302 a is greater than the reference tip information 306 , a positive valence score is generated.
- a negative valence score is generated.
- the positive valence score may be any positive value
- the negative valence score may be any negative value.
- a rating score of +1 is generated.
- a rating score of ⁇ 1 is generated.
- the rating score 312 a may also be generated using other methods.
- the rating score 312 a may be selected from a range of possible values.
- the rating score 312 a may be based on a scale of 1 to 10, with scores approaching the value 5 as the tip information 302 a approaches the reference tip information 306 , and approaches 1 or 10 as the tip information becomes less than or greater than the reference tip information.
- the rating score 312 a In generating the rating score 312 a, other factors, such as, for example, a customer's tipping trend over time, and the service provider's tips received over time, may also be considered. Specifically, if a customer has been recently tipping more in general regardless of the service provider, the customer's recent tip would have less significance in generating a rating score 312 a than a tip given before the customer had been generally tipping more. Tipping trends of other customers may also be considered in generating the rating score 312 a. For example, if the general customers in the geographic area around the restaurant are known to tip low, then the rating score 312 a may be adjusted to be higher than rating scores generated for restaurants in other areas for the same value of tip information. Other methods, schemes or logic may also be used for generating the rating score 312 a.
- the reference tip information 306 may be generated based on historical tip information of a customer for all service providers for which the customer has tipped and for which information is available.
- the historical tip information of the customer for generating reference tip information 306 may also be limited in scope, for example, previous tip information by a customer at a single restaurant, at a certain type of restaurant, within a certain geographic area, or within a certain time frame.
- the reference tip information 306 may also be generated based on historical tip information of a varying scope of different customers for which tipping information is available. For example, tip information of all customers may be considered in generating the reference tip information 306 , or only those satisfying a certain demographics may be used.
- Diagram 300 shows generating the reference tip information 306 based on historical tip information 310 a - 310 n of a single customer.
- the historical tip information 310 a - 310 n may be stored in a database 308 (e.g., data store 210 ), and the reference tip information 306 may be generated by averaging the historical tip information 310 a - 310 n. Other methods such as, for example, taking the median or mode of the historical tip information 310 a - 310 n, may also be used.
- the received tip information 302 a may also be stored in the database 308 as a new historical tip information entry, and the reference tip information 306 may be updated based on the new entry to be used in generating subsequent rating scores.
- Multiple rating scores may be similarly generated based on multiple pieces of tip information associated with the same service provider.
- Diagram 300 shows that rating scores 312 b and 312 c are also generated in addition to the rating score 312 a.
- An aggregating logic 314 may be executed to aggregate the rating scores 312 a - 312 c to generate an aggregate rating score 316 (e.g., aggregate rating score 218 ).
- the aggregate rating logic 314 may be executed, for example, by the processor 204 .
- the aggregate rating score 316 may be generated, for example, by adding all the rating scores 312 a - 312 c.
- the aggregate rating score 316 may be the sum of the scores 312 a - 31 c, which is +1.
- Other methods such as, for example, averaging, may also be used for generating the aggregate rating score 316 .
- the aggregate rating score 316 is the average of the three values, which is 8.
- the aggregating logic 314 may be executed to keep aggregating the rating scores to the aggregate rating score 316 .
- Different aggregate rating scores may also be generated for different service providers.
- the tipping information described above may be utilized in providing targeted advertisements to different customers and may also be used by the service providers to provide personalized services to the customers.
- a restaurant may be able to recognize a customer who is a big tipper as soon as he or she walks in, and provide a higher level of service to the customer.
- the presence of a customer at a restaurant may be determined when the customer voluntarily indicates his or her current location. For example, the customer may indicate that he or she is at or near a restaurant by “checking in” at the restaurant through a social networking service.
- the tipping information in conjunction with information on the associated service provider may also be used to infer the customer's different tastes. For example, if a customer consistently leaves a higher tip at Italian restaurants, such information may indicate that the customer enjoys Italian cuisine and may be used to provide targeted advertisements to the customer, provided that the customer has provided authorization for his or her tipping information to be used for providing advertisements.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram 400 of example processes for assessing ratings using tip patterns.
- the processes may be performed, for example, by the system 202 .
- tip information e.g., tip information 212 a - 212 n
- the tip information may include a ratio of an amount of tip paid by the customer for the bill to a total amount of the bill.
- the bill may be associated with a service provider (e.g., a restaurant).
- reference tip information e.g., reference tip information 214
- the historical tip information may encompass information on tips previously paid by the customer at the same restaurant.
- the historical tip information may also cover tips paid by the customer at similar types of restaurants (e.g., restaurants serving similar cuisine, restaurants at similar price ranges, restaurants within a certain geographic area), or restaurants in general.
- the historical tip information may also cover all tip information available for the customer.
- Steps 402 and 404 may be performed simultaneously, or may be performed in sequence, regardless of the order.
- a rating score is generated based on the tip information received in step 402 and the reference tip information generated in step 404 .
- an aggregate score (e.g., aggregate rating score 218 ) associated with the service provider associated with the tip information received in step 402 is generated. The aggregate score is generated based on the rating score.

Description
- The present disclosure generally relates to assessing ratings of service providers, and more particularly to using tip patterns to assess ratings of service providers.
- People use search engines to search for, and obtain information on, goods or service providers such as, for example, consumer products, restaurants, and tourist attractions. The information on the goods or service providers that people search for may include reviews or ratings.
- According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a computer-implemented method for using tip patterns to assess ratings is provided. The method includes obtaining tip information from a bill for a service provided by a service provider, generating a rating score for the service provider based on the tip information and reference tip information, and generating an aggregate rating score for the service provider based at least in part on the rating score.
- According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for using tip patterns to assess ratings is provided. The system includes one or more memories storing executable instructions and one or more processors. The one or more processors are configured to execute the stored executable instructions to obtain tip information from a bill presented to a customer for a service provided by a service provider, generate a reference tip information based at least on historical tip information for the customer, generate a rating score for the service provider based on the tip information and the generated reference tip information, and generate an aggregate rating score for the service provider based at least in part on the rating score.
- According to a further embodiment of the disclosure, a machine-readable storage medium including machine-readable instructions for causing a processor to execute a method for using tip patterns to assess ratings is provided. The method includes obtaining tip information comprising information of a service provider and a ratio of a tip amount associated with a bill presented to a customer for a service provided by the service provider, and generating a reference tip information based at least on historical tip information associated with the customer. The method also includes generating a rating score for the service provider based on the tip information and the generated reference tip information, including generating a higher rating score when the tip information is higher than the value of the reference tip information, and generating a lower rating score when the tip information is lower than the value of the reference tip information. The method further includes generating an aggregate rating score for the service provider based at least in part on the rating score.

FIG. 5 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology can be implemented. - The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.
- Search engines may base their results, at least in part, on subjective information about places. For example, existing search engines may aggregate users' opinions into value numbers and generate search results based on these numbers. These opinions may take the form of user-submitted ratings and reviews such as star-scales and short textual write-ups. Aggregation of user check-ins may also be used. These methods require that the users actively submit this information or perform check-in operations. However, a majority of users do not perform these actions, and therefore the voice of these users may not be properly reflected in the search results.
- According to the various aspects of the subject technology, a system and method for assessing ratings using tip patterns is provided. The system may receive information regarding the users' patterns on tip payments and generate scores or ratings for service providers such as, for example, restaurants. For example, the system may assign scores to the restaurants based on the amount (e.g., monetary amount or a percentage of total bill) of a tip left by a customer as compared to a reference value. The reference value may be determined for each customer and may be determined based on a variety of types of information. For example, the reference value may be determined based on the customer's past tips left at a specific restaurant, at similar types of restaurants, and/or restaurants in general. The reference value may also be determined based on tipping behaviors of other customers.
- The scores may be provided in the form of valence scores where the scores indicate either a positive valence or a negative valence. For example, any tip percentage higher than reference value is given a +1, and any percentage lower than the reference value is given a −1. The scores may also be selected from a range of possible scores. For example, scores may be based on a scale of 1 to 10, with 5 being assigned to a reference value. The system may assign higher or lower scores to a restaurant based on the notion that an amount of tip paid by a customer generally reflects how favorable the customer's experience at the restaurant has been. The system may also consider the customer's tipping trend over time, and also the restaurant's tip received over time.
- The phrases “check-in” or “checking in” as used herein encompass their plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, the act of indicating one's presence at or near a location. The location may be a predetermined location or an arbitrary location. A check-in may be performed, for example, using a social network.
- The phrase “social network” as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, an online service, platform or site that focuses on the building and reflecting of social associations and interactions among users. These associations may be stored within a social graph at each social networking service. Users of social networking services may create associations with one another (e.g., mutually identify as friends). Such user associations may be defined on a user-to-user basis, or as a group of users associated through membership within a group.
- Turning to the drawings,
FIG. 1 illustrates anexample architecture 100 for assessing ratings using tip patterns. Thearchitecture 100 includesservers 110 andclients 120 connected over anetwork 130. Each of theclients 120 may communicate with theservers 110 to assess ratings using tip patterns. Theservers 110 may be any device having a processor, memory, and communications capabilities for communicating with theclients 120 to assess ratings using tip patterns. Theclients 120 may be, for example, desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile devices (e.g., a smart phone, tablet computer, or PDA), set top boxes (e.g., for a television), televisions, video game consoles, home appliances (e.g., a refrigerator, microwave oven, washer, or dryer) or any other devices having a processor, memory, and communications capabilities for communicating with theservers 110 to assess ratings using tip patterns. Thenetwork 130 may include, for example, any one or more of a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, the network 150 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram 200 illustrating anexample system 202 for assessing ratings using tip patterns. Thesystem 202 may be implemented, for example, in one of theservers 110, across multiple servers, in one of theclients 120, across multiple clients, or across the servers and the clients. Thesystem 202 is in communication with the network 230 (e.g., network 130) via acommunications module 208. Thecommunications module 208 is configured to interface with thenetwork 230 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to the other devices or systems on the network. Thecommunications module 208 may be, for example, modems, Ethernet cards or mobile broadband adaptors. - The
system 202 includes aprocessor 204, thecommunications module 208 and amemory 206 that includes tip information 212 a-212 n andreference tip information 214. Each tip information 212 a-212 n may include a monetary amount of a tip and a bill associated with a service provider, or a ratio of the tip to the bill. The service providers may be providers of any types of services for which tips are customarily given, such as, for example, services at restaurants, taxis, beauty salons, barbers, and valet services. Thereference tip information 214 includes a reference value for the tip information 212 a-212 n. The reference value may be, for example, an average of all tip information 212 a-212 n, or an average of tip information associated with a single person. Other types of values may also be used for thereference tip information 214. Thememory 206 also includes rating scores 216 a-216 n and anaggregate rating score 218. Each rating score 216 a-216 n includes a score generated based on each of the tip information 212 a-212 n and thereference tip information 214. Theaggregate rating score 218 is generated by aggregating the rating scores 216 a-216 n that are associated with the same service provider. - The
system 202 may also include adata store 210. Thedata store 210 may be integrated with thememory 206, or may be independent from thememory 206 and be in communication with theprocessor 204 and thememory 206. In an aspect of the subject technology, the tip information 212 a-212 n, thereference tip information 214, rating scores 216 a-216 n andaggregate rating score 218 may be stored in thedata store 210 or may be spread across the data store and thememory 206. - The
processor 204 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor, instructions received frommemory 206 in the form of software, or a combination of both. For example, theprocessor 204 is configured to execute instructions to obtain a piece of tip information (e.g., tip information 212 a-212 n) including a ratio of tip amount associated with a bill to an amount of the bill, where the bill is associated with a service provider. The processor is also configured to generate a rating score (e.g., rating scores 216 a-216 n) based on the piece of tip information and reference tip information (e.g., reference tip information 214). The bill may be associated with a customer and the reference tip information may be generated based on historical tip information associated with the customer. The processor is further configured to generate an aggregate score (e.g., aggregate score 218) associated with the service provider, based on the rating score. -
FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram 300 illustrating example operations for assessing ratings using tip information. The operations may be performed, for example, by thesystem 202. A piece oftip information 302 a (e.g., tip information 212 a-212 n) may be received, provided that authorization from the customer associated with the tip information is obtained. The customer may also revoke the authorization, after which tip information associated with the customer is no longer received. Thetip information 302 a may be a monetary amount of a tip paid by a customer to a service provider for services received, and the amount of bill associated with the tip. Thetip information 302 a may also be a ratio of a tip paid by a customer to an amount of bill associated with the tip. For example, if the bill is $100 and the tip paid for the bill is $20, then the ratio would be 20%. In the latter case, the amount of tip and the bill is not included in thetip information 302 a. - In addition to the amount of tip and bill and/or the tip-to-bill ratio, the
tip information 302 a may also include information on the service provider associated with the tip information. Such information may be, for example, the restaurant's name, location, type of food served, price range, dress code, and operating hours. - The
tip information 302 a may be received from various sources. Such methods may include receiving information from financial institutions, such as, for example, credit card companies which process payments made using credit cards. The method may also include obtaining tipping and billing information from scanned or physical receipts. The customers and/or service providers may be given incentives to voluntarily scan in the receipts and provide the tipping and billing information. Thetip information 302 a may also be received from an intermediate system which securely receives the bill and tip amounts directly from the customers or service providers, and generates only the ratios between the two. In the case of service providers, they may provide tip and billing information only upon authorization from customers associated with the tip and billing information. - After the
tip information 302 a is received, arating logic 304 is executed to generate arating score 312 a (e.g., rating scores 216 a-216 n) based on the received tip information and a reference tip information 306 (e.g., reference tip information 214). Therating logic 304 may be, for example, part of the instructions a processor, such as theprocessor 204, may execute. Therating logic 304 may be executed to compare thetip information 302 a and thereference tip information 306 to generate a valence score. The valence score indicates either a positive value or a negative value. For example, if thetip information 302 a is greater than thereference tip information 306, a positive valence score is generated. If thetip information 302 a is less than thereference tip information 306, a negative valence score is generated. The positive valence score may be any positive value, and the negative valence score may be any negative value. As a specific example, for anytip information 302 a having a value greater than thereference tip information 306, a rating score of +1 is generated. For anytip information 302 a having a value less than thereference tip information 306, a rating score of −1 is generated. - The rating score 312 a may also be generated using other methods. For example, the rating score 312 a may be selected from a range of possible values. Specifically, the rating score 312 a may be based on a scale of 1 to 10, with scores approaching the value 5 as the
tip information 302 a approaches thereference tip information 306, and approaches 1 or 10 as the tip information becomes less than or greater than the reference tip information. - In generating the rating score 312 a, other factors, such as, for example, a customer's tipping trend over time, and the service provider's tips received over time, may also be considered. Specifically, if a customer has been recently tipping more in general regardless of the service provider, the customer's recent tip would have less significance in generating a
rating score 312 a than a tip given before the customer had been generally tipping more. Tipping trends of other customers may also be considered in generating the rating score 312 a. For example, if the general customers in the geographic area around the restaurant are known to tip low, then the rating score 312 a may be adjusted to be higher than rating scores generated for restaurants in other areas for the same value of tip information. Other methods, schemes or logic may also be used for generating the rating score 312 a. - The
reference tip information 306 may be generated based on historical tip information of a customer for all service providers for which the customer has tipped and for which information is available. The historical tip information of the customer for generatingreference tip information 306 may also be limited in scope, for example, previous tip information by a customer at a single restaurant, at a certain type of restaurant, within a certain geographic area, or within a certain time frame. Thereference tip information 306 may also be generated based on historical tip information of a varying scope of different customers for which tipping information is available. For example, tip information of all customers may be considered in generating thereference tip information 306, or only those satisfying a certain demographics may be used. - Diagram 300 shows generating the
reference tip information 306 based on historical tip information 310 a-310 n of a single customer. The historical tip information 310 a-310 n may be stored in a database 308 (e.g., data store 210), and thereference tip information 306 may be generated by averaging the historical tip information 310 a-310 n. Other methods such as, for example, taking the median or mode of the historical tip information 310 a-310 n, may also be used. The receivedtip information 302 a may also be stored in thedatabase 308 as a new historical tip information entry, and thereference tip information 306 may be updated based on the new entry to be used in generating subsequent rating scores. - Multiple rating scores may be similarly generated based on multiple pieces of tip information associated with the same service provider. Diagram 300 shows that rating scores 312 b and 312 c are also generated in addition to the rating score 312 a. An aggregating
logic 314 may be executed to aggregate the rating scores 312 a-312 c to generate an aggregate rating score 316 (e.g., aggregate rating score 218). Theaggregate rating logic 314 may be executed, for example, by theprocessor 204. Theaggregate rating score 316 may be generated, for example, by adding all the rating scores 312 a-312 c. Specifically, if the rating scores 312 a-312 c have valence scores of +1, +1 and −1, respectively, theaggregate rating score 316 may be the sum of the scores 312 a-31 c, which is +1. Other methods, such as, for example, averaging, may also be used for generating theaggregate rating score 316. Specifically, if the rating scores 312 a-312 c have values chosen out of a range of 1-10 and each of a value of 5, 9, and 10, respectively, theaggregate rating score 316 is the average of the three values, which is 8. - As more rating scores are generated for the same service provider, the aggregating
logic 314 may be executed to keep aggregating the rating scores to theaggregate rating score 316. Different aggregate rating scores may also be generated for different service providers. - The tipping information described above, such as the
tip information 302 a or the historical tip information 310 a-310 n, may be utilized in providing targeted advertisements to different customers and may also be used by the service providers to provide personalized services to the customers. For example, a restaurant may be able to recognize a customer who is a big tipper as soon as he or she walks in, and provide a higher level of service to the customer. The presence of a customer at a restaurant may be determined when the customer voluntarily indicates his or her current location. For example, the customer may indicate that he or she is at or near a restaurant by “checking in” at the restaurant through a social networking service. - The tipping information in conjunction with information on the associated service provider may also be used to infer the customer's different tastes. For example, if a customer consistently leaves a higher tip at Italian restaurants, such information may indicate that the customer enjoys Italian cuisine and may be used to provide targeted advertisements to the customer, provided that the customer has provided authorization for his or her tipping information to be used for providing advertisements.

FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram 400 of example processes for assessing ratings using tip patterns. The processes may be performed, for example, by thesystem 202. Instep 402, tip information (e.g., tip information 212 a-212 n) associated with a customer and a bill is received. The tip information may include a ratio of an amount of tip paid by the customer for the bill to a total amount of the bill. The bill may be associated with a service provider (e.g., a restaurant). Instep 404, reference tip information (e.g., reference tip information 214) is generated based on historical tip information (e.g., historical tip information 310 a-310 n) for the customer. The historical tip information may encompass information on tips previously paid by the customer at the same restaurant. The historical tip information may also cover tips paid by the customer at similar types of restaurants (e.g., restaurants serving similar cuisine, restaurants at similar price ranges, restaurants within a certain geographic area), or restaurants in general. The historical tip information may also cover all tip information available for the customer. -
Steps step 406, a rating score is generated based on the tip information received instep 402 and the reference tip information generated instep 404. Instep 408, an aggregate score (e.g., aggregate rating score 218) associated with the service provider associated with the tip information received instep 402 is generated. The aggregate score is generated based on the rating score. - Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer-readable storage medium (also referred to as computer-readable medium). When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer-readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
- In this specification, the term “software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, solid state disks or other computer-readable media, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software aspects of the subject technology can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject technology. In some implementations, multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject technology. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.Electronic system 500 can be a computer, phone, PDA, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an electronic system includes various types of computer-readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer-readable media.Electronic system 500 includes abus 508, processing unit(s) 512, asystem memory 504, a read-only memory (ROM) 510, apermanent storage device 502, aninput device interface 514, anoutput device interface 506, and anetwork interface 516. -
Bus 508 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices ofelectronic system 500. For instance,bus 508 communicatively connects processing unit(s) 512 withROM 510,system memory 504, andpermanent storage device 502. - From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 512 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject technology. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different implementations.
-
ROM 510 stores static data and instructions that are needed by processing unit(s) 512 and other modules of the electronic system.Permanent storage device 502, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even whenelectronic system 500 is off. Some implementations of the subject technology use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) aspermanent storage device 502. - Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as
permanent storage device 502. Likepermanent storage device 502,system memory 504 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlikestorage device 502,system memory 504 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such as random access memory.System memory 504 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject technology are stored insystem memory 504,permanent storage device 502, and/orROM 510. For example, the various memory units include instructions for assessing the sharing of items in accordance with some implementations. From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 512 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations. -
Bus 508 also connects to input and output device interfaces 514 and 506.Input device interface 514 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used withinput device interface 514 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called “cursor control devices”). Output device interfaces 506 enable, for example, the display of images generated by theelectronic system 500. Output devices used withoutput device interface 506 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal displays (LCD). Some implementations include devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices. - Finally, as shown in
FIG. 5 ,bus 508 also coupleselectronic system 500 to a network (not shown) through anetwork interface 516. In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components ofelectronic system 500 can be used in conjunction with the subject technology. - These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
- Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
- While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessors or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself
- As used in this specification of this application, the terms “computer”, “server”, “processor”, and “memory” all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification, the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification of this application, the terms “computer-readable medium” and “computer-readable media” are entirely restricted to tangible, physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude any wireless signals, wired download signals, and any other ephemeral signals.
- To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a backend component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such backend, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
- It is understood that any specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes disclosed is an illustration of example approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes may be rearranged, or that not all illustrated steps be performed. Some of the steps may be performed simultaneously. For example, in certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- The previous description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the various aspects described herein. Various modifications to these aspects will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other aspects. Reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean “one and only one” unless specifically so stated, but rather “one or more.” Unless specifically stated otherwise, the term “some” refers to one or more. Pronouns in the masculine (e.g., his) include the feminine and neuter gender (e.g., her and its) and vice versa. Headings and subheadings, if any, are used for convenience only and do not limit the subject technology.
- A phrase such as an “aspect” does not imply that such aspect is essential to the subject technology or that such aspect applies to all configurations of the subject technology.
