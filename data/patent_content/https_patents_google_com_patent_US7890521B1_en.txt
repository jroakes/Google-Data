Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to the field of information retrieval, and more specifically to the task of identifying synonyms for words to facilitate retrieving documents in response to queries which contain the words.
- the World Wide Web contains a vast amount of freely available information. However, locating a relevant item of information on the web can be a challenging task. Note that this problem continues to increase as the amount of information available on the web continues to grow.
- Search engines can often help users to locate and retrieve a document of interest on the web.
- users often fail to select effective query terms during the searching process.
- a user may enter the query [web hosting+fort wayne] when the city of Fort Wayne is usually referred to as Ft. Wayne.
- a user may enter [free loops for flash movie] when most relevant pages use the term “music,” rather than “loops” and the term “animation” rather than “movie.”
- documents that satisfy a user's informational needs may use different terms than the specific query terms chosen by the user to express a concept of interest. Note that this problem becomes more of an issue as the number of terms in a query increases. For queries longer than three or four words, there is a strong likelihood that at least one of the terms is not the best term to describe the user's informational need.
- stemming is not always accurate. For example, the words “university” and “universal” share the same stem, but have very different meanings. Furthermore, many good synonyms are not covered by stemming, such as “wolfs” and “wolves,” or “wales” and “welsh.”
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that automatically generates synonyms for words from documents. During operation, this system determines co-occurrence frequencies for pairs of words in the documents. The system also determines closeness scores for pairs of words in the documents, wherein a closeness score indicates whether a pair of words are located so close to each other (for example, in sequential distance or logical distance) that the words are likely to occur in the same sentence or phrase. Finally, the system determines whether pairs of words are synonyms based on the determined co-occurrence frequencies and the determined closeness scores.
- determining a closeness score for a pair of words includes dividing the probability that the words are very close to each other by the probability that the words are near each other.
- words are determined to be “very close” to each other if they are less than a small number of words apart, such as 4 words, and words are determined to be “near” each other if they are within a pre-specified number words of each other, such as 100 words.
- the system while determining whether words are synonyms, the system considers a high closeness score between two words to indicate that the two words are unlikely to be synonyms because synonyms rarely occur in the same sentence or phrase.
- the system additionally generates correlations between words in a title or an anchor of a document and words in the document.
- determining whether pairs of words are synonyms additionally involves considering the generated correlations.
- the system additionally determines word-form scores for pairs of words in the documents, wherein a high word-form score indicates that words share common portions, but have differing portions that are consistent with word form rules.
- word-form rules specify a set of edits that that are allowed to a base word to produce gender-specific, plurality-related or other variations of the base word.
- a high word-form score can indicate that: a pair of words share a common prefix but have different suffixes, wherein the different suffixes are consistent with word-form rules; a pair of words share a common suffix but have different prefixes, wherein the different prefixes are consistent with word-form rules; or a pair of words share a common prefix and a common suffix, but have different middle sections, wherein the different middle sections are consistent with word-form rules.
- determining whether pairs of words are synonyms additionally involves considering the word-form scores.
- the system automatically generates the word-form rules from synonymous words that share common prefixes and/or suffixes.
- the system while determining whether a candidate word is a synonym for a target word, the system considers whether the candidate word is much more common than the target word. If so, the candidate word is not a synonym because search results produced by the candidate word will overwhelm search results produced by the target word. The system also considers whether the candidate word is much less common than the target word. If so, the candidate word is not a synonym because using the candidate word will produce very few additional search results.
- the system additionally processes a query. This involves first receiving the query which contains a set of words. Next, the system uses the synonyms which were automatically generated from the documents to identify one or more synonyms for the one or more words in the query. The system then generates an altered query using the one or more synonyms, and uses the altered query to produce search results.
- alternative synonyms are presented to a user through a user interface to enable the user to select the synonyms that are used to produce the altered query. Also note that when search results are returned the system can highlight or bold synonymous terms in search results.
- Another embodiment of the present invention provides another system that automatically generates synonyms for words from documents.
- this system determines co-occurrence frequencies for pairs of words in the documents.
- the system also determines word-form scores for pairs of words in the documents, wherein a high word-form score indicates that a pair of words share a common prefix but have different endings, wherein the different endings are consistent with word-form rules.
- the system determines whether pairs of words are synonyms based on the determined co-occurrence frequencies and the determined word-form scores.
- FIG. 1 illustrates the crawling, ranking and searching processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 presents a flowchart illustrating a method for generating altered queries according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of automatically generating synonyms from words in a document in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of automatically generating word-form rules in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a computer-readable storage medium which may be any device or medium that can store code and/or data for use by a computer system.
- FIG. 1 illustrates the crawling, ranking and searching processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a web crawler 104 crawls or otherwise searches through websites on web 102 to select web pages to be stored in indexed form in data center 108 .
- the selected web pages are then compressed, indexed and ranked in module 105 (using the ranking process described above) before being stored in data center 108 .
- a search engine 112 receives a query 113 from a user 111 through a web browser 114 .
- This query 113 specifies a number of terms to be searched for in the set of documents.
- search engine 112 uses search terms specified in the query as well as synonyms for search terms to identify highly-ranked documents that satisfy the query.
- Search engine 112 then returns a response 115 through web browser 114 , wherein the response 115 contains matching pages along with ranking information and references to the identified documents.
- FIG. 2 presents a flowchart illustrating a method for generating altered queries according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- a search query is received from a client 110 .
- a front-end server is responsible for receiving the search query from the client (step 210 ).
- This front-end server provides the query to the search engine, which evaluates the query.
- the front-end server and/or search engine maintains various log files or lookup tables that storing each received query, as well as other information.
- each query can be stored with a user identifier that identifies the particular browser and/or computer from which the query was received, a timestamp for the query, and a list of some number of the search results (e.g., a list of the top ten document IDs from the search). Other information related to user context or the search itself may also be stored.
- a list of search results for the search query is identified (step 220 ).
- the search engine evaluates the query to retrieve a set of search results in accordance with the search query and returns the results to the front-end server.
- the search engine communicates with one or more content servers to select documents that are relevant to the user's search query.
- a content server stores a large number of indexed documents, indexed (and/or retrieved) from different websites.
- the content server can store an index of documents stored on various websites. “Documents” are understood here to be any form of indexable content, including textual documents, images, video, audio, multimedia, presentations, and so forth.
- each indexed document is assigned a page rank according to the document's link structure. This page rank serves as a query-independent measure of the document's importance.
- the search engine assigns a score to each document based on the document's page rank (and/or other query-independent measure of the document's importance), as well as one or more query-dependent signals of the document's importance (e.g., the location and frequency of search terms in the document).
- FIG. 3 presents a flowchart illustrating a process for determining automatically identifying synonyms from documents according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- one or more altered queries are derived using the synonymous terms (step 240 ).
- Alternative queries are suggested that include the synonym, either as a substitution in or an addition to the query.
- the synonym is treated as equivalent to the original phrase automatically for purposes of document retrieval.
- the original query can be modified by replacing the phrase with a synonym or a disjunction of the original phrase and a synonym when producing search results for the query.
- a list of altered search results for the altered query is identified (step 250 ).
- this list may include a maximum number of results.
- FIG. 3 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of automatically generating synonyms from words in a document in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system determines co-occurrence frequencies for pairs of words in the documents (step 302 ). This can be easily accomplished using well-known statistical techniques.
- the system also determines closeness scores for pairs of words in the documents (step 304 ), wherein a closeness score indicates whether a pair of words are located so close to each other that the words are likely to occur in the same sentence or phrase. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, determining the closeness score for a pair of words involves dividing the probability that the words are very close to each other (e.g., within 4 words) by the probability that the words are near each other (e.g., within 100 words). Note that the system considers a high closeness score between two words to indicate that the two words are unlikely to be synonyms because synonyms rarely occur in the same sentence or phrase.
- the system additionally generates correlations between words in a titles or URL anchors for documents and words in the documents (step 306 ). This helps to identify synonyms because a document tends to contain synonyms for words in the title or the anchor of the document.
- the system also determines word-form scores for pairs of words in the documents (step 308 ).
- a high word-form score between a pair of words generally indicates that the words share a common portion and have differing portions, wherein the differing portions are consistent with word-form rules.
- a word for rule indicates how words with a common stem can vary. For example a high word form score can indicate that the pair of words: (1) share a common prefix but have different suffixes, wherein the different suffixes are consistent with word-form rules; (2) share a common suffix but have different prefixes, wherein the different prefixes are consistent with word-form rules; or (3) share a common prefix and a common suffix, but have different middle sections, wherein the different middle sections are consistent with word-form rules.
- the process of determining word-form rules is discussed in more detail below with reference to the flow chart which appears in FIG. 4 .
- the system determines whether pairs of words are synonyms based on the determined co-occurrence frequencies, closeness scores, title/anchor correlations, and word-form scores (step 310 ). Note that the closeness score is a negative indicator of a synonym, whereas the other factors are positive indicators.
- FIG. 4 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of automatically generating word-form rules in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system first obtains pairs of words that are likely to be synonyms (step 402 ). This can involve considering a number of factors, such as the co-occurrence frequencies, closeness scores and title/anchor correlations described above. It can also involve obtaining pair of synonymous words using other techniques, such as examining word substitutions during query sessions.
- the system can generate word-form rules which indicate how related words which share a common stem can vary.
- the system can generate word-form rules for pairs of words that share common parts, which can include prefixes, suffixes and/or middle sections, and wherein remaining parts of the pair of words are consistent with word-form rules (step 404 ).
