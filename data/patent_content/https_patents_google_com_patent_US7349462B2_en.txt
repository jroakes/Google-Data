Definitions
- the present invention is related to a method and apparatus for acquiring and adjusting gain, receiver clock frequency, and symbol timing in an OFDM radio receiver.
- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing will be the modulation technique of choice for future broadband wireless communication systems.
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
- a user data stream is split into parallel streams of reduced rate.
- Each substream then modulates a separate subcarrier.
- OFDM is especially attractive for high-speed wireless communication systems because it is robust against multi-path fading, intersymbol interference, and against narrowband interference.
- This promising modulation technique has already been accepted as physical layer for the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standards IEEE 802.11a and ETSI Hiperlan-2. Both WLANs are operated in a 20 MHz wide radio channel in the 5 GHz frequency band, and provide user-selectable data rates between 6 and 54 Mb/s.
- WLAN Wireless Local Area Network
- an OFDM receiver Before a user data packet consisting of several fixed length OFDM symbols can be exchanged over a radio channel, an OFDM receiver has to be adjusted so that it can successfully reconstruct the transmitted packet from the noisy, distorted signal received at an antenna. For this purpose, a preamble with known training symbols is transmitted prior to the user data packet over the radio channel. The preamble should allow the receiver to estimate a correct gain setting of a Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA) in the radio frontend, the frequency offset between the transmit and receive clock, and the OFDM symbol timing.
- VGA Variable Gain Amplifier
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,732,113 is related to timing and frequency synchronization of OFDM signals.
- a method and apparatus for rapid timing synchronization, carrier frequency synchronization, and sampling rate synchronization of a receiver to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signal is disclosed.
- the method uses two OFDM training symbols to obtain synchronization.
- a first OFDM training symbol has only even-numbered sub-carriers, and substantially no odd-numbered sub-carriers, an arrangement that results in half-symbol symmetry.
- a second OFDM training symbol has even-numbered sub-carriers differentially modulated relative to those of the first OFDM training symbol by a predetermined sequence. Synchronization is achieved by computing metrics which utilize the unique properties of these two OFDM training symbols.
- Timing synchronization is determined by computing a timing metric which recognizes the half-symbol symmetry of the first OFDM training symbol.
- Carrier frequency offset estimation is performed in using the timing metric as well as a carrier frequency offset metric which peaks at the correct value of carrier frequency offset.
- Sampling rate offset estimation is performed by evaluating the slope of the locus of points of phase rotation due to sampling rate offset as a function of sub-carrier frequency number.
- the patent specification does not define a suitable gain control scheme and thorough receiver start-up for an IEEE 802.11a or ETSI Hiperlan-2 standard.
- the mechanism is based on the reception of a preamble with known periodic training sequences transmitted prior to user data over a radio channel.
- an inner OFDM receiver detects the presence of periodic signals in the received data sequence, provides means to set the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA) gain in a radio frontend, and estimates frequency offsets between the transmit and receive clock. Matched filters are used to determine the symbol timing.
- VGA Variable Gain Amplifier
- Matched filters are used to determine the symbol timing.
- the inner receiver finite-state-machine (FSM) schedules various tasks during receiver startup. Even though the disclosure relates to 802.11a WLAN physical layer standard, it can also be applied to other OFDM based radio transceivers. The method can also be applied to physical layer implementations of the ETSI Hiperlan-2 WLAN standard.
- a method for adjusting gain setting, receiver clock frequency, and symbol timing in an OFDM radio receiver comprises the steps of receiving a symbol sequence ⁇ x n ⁇ of data samples x n , the symbol sequence ⁇ x n ⁇ comprising a preamble and user data, and the preamble comprising a first signal with a first periodicity P 1 based on a repetitive transmission of a first training symbol and a second signal with a second periodicity P 2 based on a repetitive transmission of a second training symbol; storing the data samples x n in a register; deriving a signal energy estimate E n from the stored data samples x n for correcting the gain setting; deriving a first periodicity metric m n P 1 and a second periodicity metric m n P 2 from the stored data samples x n for detecting the presence of the first signal with the first periodicity P 1 and the presence of the second signal with the second periodicity P 2 ; deriv
- an apparatus for adjusting gain setting, receiver clock frequency, and symbol timing comprises receiving means for receiving a symbol sequence ⁇ x n ⁇ of data samples x n ; a register for storing the data samples x n , the register having a size to store at least data samples x n of a first signal with a first periodicity P 1 and a second signal with a second periodicity P 2 ; a computational unit for computing periodicity metrics m n P 1 , m n P 2 and matched filter output signals mf n P 1 , mf n P 2 from the stored data samples x n ; and a finite-state-machine which in response to the output of the computational unit controls the adjustment of the gain setting, the receiver clock frequency, and the symbol timing.

- FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of an OFDM radio receiver.
- FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of an inner receiver.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a gain correction characteristic showing the gain corrections as a function of the signal energy error.
- FIG. 5 shows the control flow of the inner receiver finite-state-machine which controls the start-up of the inner receiver.
- FIG. 1 Before embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to the FIGS. 2 to 5 , some basic issues are addressed with reference to FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 1 shows a sequence of transmitted training and OFDM data symbols as defined in the 802.11a WLAN standard and below appropriate actions to be taken.
- the preamble consists of two 8 ⁇ s long frames.
- a short training symbol also referred to as first training symbol, of duration 0.8 ⁇ s is repeatedly transmitted 10 times. It is generated by using only 12 out of the 52 subcarriers used for an OFDM data symbol.
- This training sequence can be used for signal detection, VGA gain adjustment, and for acquiring an initial, coarse estimate of the frequency offset value as indicated below the shown frame.
- Fine-tuning of the frequency offset estimate and symbol timing adjustment can be performed while receiving a second frame of the preamble that consists of a 1.6 ⁇ s long Guard Interval (GI2) and two 3.2 ⁇ s long training symbols T 1 , T 2 , each herein also referred to as second training symbol, which are generated by using all 52 subcarriers.
- GI2 Guard Interval
- T 1 , T 2 each herein also referred to as second training symbol, which are generated by using all 52 subcarriers.
- 4 ⁇ s long OFDM data symbols are transmitted which carry first a SIGNAL field and then user data.
- the SIGNAL field indicates to the receiver the packet length of the user data packet and the data rate to be used for the transfer of the data packet over the radio link as indicated below the shown frame.
- Each of the OFDM data symbols always comprises a short Guard Interval (GI) of 0.8 ⁇ s in which a cyclic extension of the data symbol is transmitted to eliminate intersymbol interference caused by multi-path propagation with a delay spread less than 0.8 ⁇ s.
- GI Guard Interval
- FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an OFDM radio receiver. It comprises a radio frontend 1 , an inner receiver 2 , a demodulation and equalization unit 3 , and an outer receiver 4 .
- the radio frontend 1 comprises an antenna, a low-noise amplifier, labeled with LNA, a down-converter, a variable gain amplifier 5 , also labeled with and referred to VGA, an IQ demodulator, an analog-to-digital converter, also labeled with ADC, and a downconversion unit.
- the inner receiver 2 is described in more detail with reference to FIG. 3 below.
- the demodulation and equalization unit 3 comprises an FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) unit, an equalization unit, and a demap/LLRcomp unit, whereby the FFT unit and the Equalization unit are further coupled to a channel-estimation & tracking unit.
- the outer receiver 4 comprises in the order from right to left a de-interleaver unit, a de-puncturing unit, a Viterbi decoder unit, a de-scambler unit, and a packet decomposer unit. The mentioned units are connected in the order as named.
- a radio signal received at the antenna is amplified with the low-noise amplifier (LNA), typically down-converted to an intermediate frequency band, filtered, and scaled in amplitude by an VGA circuit. Since the dynamic range of the VGA should be at least 52 dB to satisfy the receiver sensitivity of an 802.11a radio frontend, a VGA with an exponential gain characteristic is used.
- a carrier signal with tunable demodulator frequency f a demodulates the VGA output signal to a baseband signal with in-phase and quadrature-phase components.
- the two signals are sampled with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In case of oversampling the analog signals, the digital samples are down sampled in the downconversion unit to a data rate 1/T and fed to the inner receiver 2 .
- ADCs analog-to-digital converters
- the inner receiver 2 estimates the correct gain setting of the VGA 5 , the frequency offset between the transmit and receive clock, and the OFDM symbol timing by processing the distorted, but known short and long training symbols of the preamble received prior to user data. Each short training symbol is herein also referred to as first training symbol whilst each long training symbol is also referred to as second training symbol. Based on the estimates, the inner receiver 2 controls in a closed loop the gain setting with a gain signal g dB to the VGA 5 and corrects the frequency offset between transmit and receive clock by feeding a corrected demodulator frequency f a to the radio frontend 1 . Moreover, the inner receiver 2 extracts from the received serial stream the second frame of the preamble and all OFDM data symbols, removes the guard intervals, and forwards the resulting shortened OFDM symbols to the demodulation and equalization unit 3 .
- Demodulation of the subcarries of the OFDM signal is performed by using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the FFT unit.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- the channel-estimation & tracking unit acquires and tracks the correct phases and amplitudes of the subcarriers using, firstly, the long training symbols and, afterwards, the pilot signals embedded in each OFDM data symbol.
- the corresponding corrections in the received symbols are performed with a single-tap equalizer.
- the demodulation and equalization unit 3 and the outer receiver 4 perform all tasks to reconstruct from the equalized OFDM data symbols the most-likely transmitted binary user data packet. They comprise functions such as log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) computation, de-mapping, de-interleaving, de-puncturing, Viterbi decoding, de-scrambling, and packet de-composition.
- LLR log-likelihood-ratio
- FIG. 3 illustrates the inner receiver 2 in more detail.
- the inner receiver 2 comprises an input data shift register 12 , also referred to as register, which implements a tapped delay line.
- the input data shift register 12 receives and temporarily stores data samples x n of a received symbol sequence ⁇ x n ⁇ obtained from the radio frontend 1 .
- the inner receiver 2 further comprises a computational unit 10 , a comparator 40 , and a finite-state-machine 50 , also abbreviated as FSM, whereby the computational unit 10 is connected via the comparator 40 to the FSM 50 .
- the inner receiver 2 can also comprise a frequency correction unit 75 , which allows compensation of clock frequency offsets with digital means.
- the input data shift register 12 is connected to the computational unit 10 and to the frequency correction unit 75 via line 16 .
- the computational unit 10 comprises a gain control unit 60 , a frequency control unit 70 , and a symbol timing control unit 80 .
- the computational unit 10 further comprises a metric computation unit 20 for providing control information to the gain control unit 60 , the frequency control unit 70 , and the FSM 50 , and comprises a matched filter unit 30 mainly used for the symbol timing control unit 80 .
- the FSM 50 is responsible for scheduling the various inner receiver tasks. For that the FSM 50 outputs a gain control signal CTRL_g to the gain control unit 60 , a frequency control signal CTRL_f to the frequency control unit 70 , and a symbol timing control signal CTRL_t to the symbol timing control unit 80 .
- the gain control unit 60 outputs on line 62 the gain g dB .
- the frequency control unit 70 outputs a demodulator frequency f a on line 72 and further outputs a frequency offset ⁇ f.
- the symbol timing control unit 80 outputs a time shift ⁇ t, also referred to as symbol timing correction ⁇ t.
- the metric computation unit 20 is connected via line 21 to the gain control unit 60 having an input for the gain control signal CTRL_g that is provided by the FSM 50 . Further, the metric computation unit 20 is connected to the frequency control unit 70 via lines 22 and 24 . The frequency control unit 70 has an input for the frequency control signal CTRL_f that is provided by the FSM 50 . A first metric information line 26 and a second metric information line 28 are connected to the comparator 40 which is further connected to the FSM 50 . Thresholds or counts can be fed to the comparator 40 via a threshold line 42 .
- the matched filter unit 30 is connected to the symbol timing control unit 80 and the comparator 40 via a first correlation line 32 and a second correlation line 34 .
- the symbol timing control unit 80 has an input for the symbol timing control signal CTRL_t provided by FSM 50 .
- the tapped delay line should be long enough to store one frame of the preamble and provide sufficient time for executing the algorithms. Since the frame of the preamble is 8 ⁇ s long, the tapped delay line thus comprises at least 160 registers.
- the tapped delay line outputs here in parallel 64 samples via the data line 16 at a symbol clock rate of 250 kHz. The samples are selected by properly tapping 64 successive registers of the tapped delay line, and represent either received training symbols of the second frame of the preamble or received OFDM data symbols, both without guard interval.
- the proper tapping delay that is the time shift ⁇ t, is controlled by the symbol timing control unit 80 .
- the output samples of the tapped delay line can be processed with the digital frequency correction unit 75 before being forwarded to the FFT for demodulation.
- the preamble used in 802.11a WLANs consists of ten repeatedly transmitted short training symbols of length 0.8 ⁇ s followed by two identical long training symbols of length 3.2 ⁇ s extended with a cyclic prefix as shown in FIG. 1 .
- a periodicity metric also referred to as metric
- the inner receiver 2 can detect the presence of a periodic sequence or periodic training sequence, unaffected by transmission impairments such as amplitude and phase distortion.
- P represents the periodicity period in sample intervals.
- the denominator of the periodicity metric represents the signal energy estimate E n within a sliding window of 2P consecutively received samples. It normalizes the metric so that in the absence of noise, the metric takes on the value 1 if a periodic signal with periodicity P has been detected. If the periodic signal is longer than 2P sampling intervals, the metric stays at this plateau value until its reception ends. In a noisy environment, the plateau value is less than 1 and the metric fluctuates randomly.
- the metric m n P is compared to a metric threshold met_thr P in the comparator 40 . The presence of a periodic signal with periodicity P is then determined from the running sum
- the metric computation unit 20 can provide an efficient estimate of the frequency offset ⁇ f between the transmit and receive clock.
- an estimate of the phase rotation is obtained by computing
- the frequency control unit 70 derives from ⁇ n P a frequency offset estimate ⁇ f. It further reduces the error variance of the frequency offset estimate by averaging P successive phases ⁇ n P .
- the offset is corrected in the frequency correction unit 75 with digital means or by detuning the demodulator frequency f a in the radio frontend 1 .
- E err,n dB represents the signal energy error measured in dB and f NL ( ⁇ ) a nonlinear function referred to as gain correction characteristic.
- E n represents an estimate of the received signal energy and E tar the target signal energy.
- the estimate for the received signal energy E n measured with P or 2P consecutively received input samples, is provided by the metric computation unit 20 .
- the corresponding reference value E tar for the gain adjustment during preamble reception is obtained by pre-calculating the nominal signal energy of the first frame of the preamble transmitted within a time interval PT.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a gain correction characteristic, showing the gain corrections ⁇ g n dB as a function of the signal energy error E err,n dB .
- the gain corrections ⁇ g n dB should be selected proportional to the signal energy error.
- E err,n dB is weighted with a high gain ⁇ 1 or low gain ⁇ 2 in order to obtain a fast convergence from an initially falsely adjusted gain to its correct setting, or to fine adjust the gain for more closely approximating the target power E tar , respectively.
- An efficient implementation of the gain control algorithm is possible by quantizing the gain correction characteristic as indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 4 .
- Different quantization step sizes defined by a set of thresholds ⁇ thr 1 , ⁇ thr 2 , . . . , ⁇ thr i , . . . ⁇ and a small number of gain correction values have been selected for supporting fast gain acquisition in the fast convergence zone as well as fine adjustment if the signal energy deviates only a few dB from the target value.
- proper gain corrections ⁇ g n dB can be selected by comparing the signal energy estimate E n to a set of pre-calculated values E tar ⁇ 10 thr i /10 ,i ⁇ 1, ⁇ 2, (8)
- the gain adjustment stops if the measured signal energy is close to the target energy and the FSM 50 requests “Freeze Gain Loop”.
- the successful convergence to the target value can be recognized by monitoring the frequency of the occurrence of zero or very small gain corrections.
- Each filter correlates the received complex symbol sequence ⁇ x n ⁇ with a reference sequence ⁇ s n ⁇ or ⁇ l n ⁇ according to
- the filter defined by eq. 9 outputs a single, sharp correlation peak if 16 consecutive received input data samples match to the reference sequence derived from the short training symbol. Since the first frame of the preamble consists of 10 short training symbols, up to 10 correlation peaks can be detected while receiving the first frame. Similarly, the second matched filter outputs a correlation peak if a long training symbol has been received. Since the second frame of the preamble contains two training symbols, two correlation peaks occur.
- Correlation peaks are detected by comparing the matched filter output signals mf n 16 and mf n 64 to matched-filter thresholds mf_thr 16 and mf_thr 64 in the comparator 40 . Each peak detection is indicated to the FSM 50 .
- the events mf n 16 ⁇ mf_thr 16 confirm to the FSM 50 the reception of short training symbols.
- the second event of mf n 64 ⁇ mf_thr 64 may signal to the FSM 50 that the “End of Preamble” has been detected at time n.
- ⁇ n compensates for signal processing delays used for executing the inner receiver algorithms.
- FIG. 5 shows the inner receiver FSM 50 , which controls the start-up of the inner receiver 2 by monitoring the output signals of the metric computation unit 20 and the matched filters of the matched filter unit 30 .
- the FSM 50 is initialized immediately after activating the inner receiver 2 .
- the inner receiver 2 is thus ready for searching short training symbols in the received symbol sequence ⁇ x n ⁇
- ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ f 2 ⁇ ⁇ 16 ⁇ T ⁇ ⁇ 16 by averaging 16 successive phase rotations ⁇ n 16 (eq. 3). If the running sum S n 16 still indicates “Short Symbol Reception” after 16 cycles, the FSM 50 commands the frequency control to download the corrected demodulator frequency value f a to the radio frontend 1 and enters the state “Confirm Short Symbol (SS) Reception”.
- the reception of short training symbols is confirmed by the matched filter mf n 16 (eq. 9). If the matched filter 30 recognizes a symbol within 160 cycles after its first detection with the metric computation unit 20 , the FSM 50 freezes the gain control and starts searching for “End of First Preamble Frame”.
- the end of the first preamble frame is detected if the running sum reduces from S max 16 to a lower value because of m n 16 ⁇ met_thr 16 .
- the presence of long training symbols is detected if the running sum S n 64 (eq. 2) driven by m n 64 >met_thr 64 has reached its maximum value. The maximum should be reached within 320 cycles after the first detection of a short training symbol.
- the FSM 50 commands the frequency control unit 70 either to download the corrected demodulator frequency value f a to the radio frontend 1 , or to feed the frequency offset to the digital frequency correction unit 75 . Afterwards, the FSM 50 enters the state “Estimate Symbol Timing”.
- the symbol timing is estimated by locating in time the end of the OFDM preamble, which is equivalent to determining the time index of the last input sample of the second long training symbol.
- the last sample is detected if the matched filter m n 64 (eq. 10) of the matched filter unit 30 outputs a correlation peak and, at the same time, the running sum S n 64 still indicates “Long Symbol Reception”.
- the FSM 50 saves the time index n as reference value for symbol timing, instructs the symbol timing control unit 80 to set the time shift ⁇ t in the tapped delay line in accordance with the estimated symbol timing, and triggers the timing control to output the two long training symbols from the tapped delay line to the demodulation and equalization unit 3 via the data line 16 .
- the FSM 50 is then ready for receiving OFDM data symbols.
- the FSM 50 In the state “Receive OFDM Symbols”, the FSM 50 periodically triggers the timing control unit 80 to output data symbols after every 80 cycles. The FSM 50 is reset after completing the reception of the user data packet.
