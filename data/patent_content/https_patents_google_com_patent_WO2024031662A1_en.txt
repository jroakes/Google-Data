Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication, and more particularly, to channel state information (CSI) reports based on machine learning (ML) techniques.
- CSI channel state information
- ML machine learning
- the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifies a radio interface referred to as fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) (5G NR) .
- An architecture for a 5G NR wireless communication system can include a 5G core (5GC) network, a 5G radio access network (5G-RAN) , a user equipment (UE) , etc.
- the 5G NR architecture might provide increased data rates, decreased latency, and/or increased capacity compared to other types of wireless communication systems.
- Wireless communication systems may be configured to provide various telecommunication services (e.g., telephony, video, data, messaging, broadcasts, etc. ) based on multiple-access technologies, such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technologies, that support communication with multiple UEs.
- OFDMA orthogonal frequency division multiple access
- UEs user equpments
- base stations can support more antenna configurations and multi-connectivity.
- CSI channel state information
- a user equipment may receive one or more channel state information-reference signals (CSI-RSs) from a network entity, such as a base station, for generating one or more channel state information (CSI) reports.
- CSI-RSs channel state information-reference signals
- the UE may generate at least one CSI report based on a machine learning (ML) model.
- ML machine learning
- the UE may include a UE capability for parallel processing of a plurality of CSI reports based on ML model (s) and/or parallel processing of a first CSI report based on the ML model and a second CSI report that is not based on the ML model.
- the UE may use an ML model to reduce a complexity of the at least one CSI report by compressing the at least one CSI report using one or more subband eigenvectors. Additionally or alternatively, the UE may leverage the ML model to omit at least a portion of the at least one CSI report when a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold.
- a UE receives a CSI-RS from a network entity and selects a wideband precoder for compression of a CSI report based on a measurement of the CSI-RS. Selection of the wideband precoder is based on a whole bandwidth for receiving the CSI-RS.
- the UE compresses, with the selected wideband precoder, the CSI report using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded estimated subband channels.
- the UE transmits/sends, to the network entity, a first precoding matrix indicator (PMI) that indicates the wideband precoder and a second PMI that indicates the one or more subband eigenvectors.
- PMI precoding matrix indicator
- a network entity transmits a CSI-RS to a UE for selection of a wideband precoder that compresses a CSI report based on a measurement of the CSI-RS.
- the selection of the wideband precoder is based on a whole bandwidth for transmitting the CSI-RS.
- the network entity receives, from the UE, the CSI report compressed with the selected wideband precoder using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded subband channels, a first PMI that indicates the wideband precoder, and a second PMI that indicates the one or more subband eigenvectors.
- the network entity decompresses the CSI report using the first PMI and the second PMI as inputs to an ML model that outputs the decompressed CSI report.
- the UE receives one or more CSI-RSs from a network entity for transmission of one or more CSI reports to the network entity. At least one CSI report of the one or more CSI reports is based on an ML model. When a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold, the UE omits at least a portion of the at least one CSI report based on the ML model output. The UE transmits, to the network entity, the one or more CSI reports with the at least the portion of the at least one CSI report omitted from the transmission.
- the UE receives, from a network entity, a configuration for a CSI report processing procedure.
- the configuration is for at least one of: (a) processing a plurality of CSI reports using an ML model or (b) processing a first set of CSI reports, and not a second set of CSI reports, using the ML model.
- the UE receives, from the network entity, a plurality of CSI-RSs. Measurements of the plurality of CSI-RSs are based on a UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure.
- the UE communicates CSI reports to the network entity based on the UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure.
- a network entity transmits, to a UE, a configuration for a CSI report processing procedure.
- the configuration is for at least one of: (a) processing a plurality of CSI reports using an ML model or (b) processing a first set of CSI reports, and not a second set of CSI reports, using the ML model.
- the network entity transmits, to the UE, a plurality of CSI-RSs.
- the UE processes measurements of the plurality of CSI-RSs based on a UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure. Based on the received CSI report, the network entity communicates with the UE.
- the one or more aspects correspond to the features hereinafter described and particularly pointed out in the claims.
- the one or more aspects may be implemented through any of an apparatus, a method, a means for performing the method, and/or a non-transitory computer-readable medium.
- the following description and the drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed.

- the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.
- the gNB and UE may consider Type2 CPU (s) as a subset of Type1 CPU (s) . Thus, if a Type2 CPU is occupied, a Type1 CPU is occupied. Then the maximum number of Type2 CPU (s) reported in UE capability should be less than or equal to the maximum number of Type1 CPU (s) reported in UE capability.
- FIG. 18 illustrates a timing diagram 1800 for a Type2 CPU occupancy rule. Since the NPU would only be used after UE gets the channel, the Type2 CPU may be assumed to be occupied after X symbols after the first/last symbol of the earliest/latest channel measurement resource (CMR) or interference measurement resource (IMR) , until Y symbols before the first/last symbol of PUSCH/PUCCH used for CSI report. The value of X and Y may be predefined or reported by UE capability.

- the minimal processing delay for AI based CSI should depend on whether a dedicated hardware can be used. With a dedicated hardware, e.g. NPU, the neural network processing should be faster than traditional hardware based approach. In addition, the minimal processing delay also depends on the neural network architecture. If the gNB scheduling leads to a smaller scheduling offset than the minimal processing delay, UE may decide to report an outdated CSI or ignore the DCI if no HARQ-ACK or data is to be transmitted on the PUSCH triggered by the DCI.

- the minimal processing delay Z and Z’ may be determined by gNB and UE based on the whether UE would take Type2 CPU or not for AI based CSI report.
- two sets of Z and Z’ may be predefined, where the first one may be used for UE that does not take Type2 CPU and the second one may be used for UE that takes Type2 CPU for a AI based CSI report.
- the UE may report the supported Z and Z’ for each ML model it supports. UE may report more than 1 ML models that it supports.

Abstract
This disclosure describes CSI reports based on ML techniques. A UE receives one or more CSI-RSs from a network entity for generating one or more CSI reports. When at least one CSI report is based on an ML model, the UE may compress the at least one CSI report with a selected wideband precoder using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded estimated subband channels. The UE may also omit at least a portion of the at least one CSI report when a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold. The UE may be configured for parallel processing of a plurality of CSI reports that are based on the ML model and/or parallel processing of a first CSI report based on the ML model and a second CSI report that is not based on the ML model.
Description
The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication, and more particularly, to channel state information (CSI) reports based on machine learning (ML) techniques.
The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifies a radio interface referred to as fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) (5G NR) . An architecture for a 5G NR wireless communication system can include a 5G core (5GC) network, a 5G radio access network (5G-RAN) , a user equipment (UE) , etc. The 5G NR architecture might provide increased data rates, decreased latency, and/or increased capacity compared to other types of wireless communication systems.
Wireless communication systems, in general, may be configured to provide various telecommunication services (e.g., telephony, video, data, messaging, broadcasts, etc. ) based on multiple-access technologies, such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technologies, that support communication with multiple UEs. As mobile broadband technologies evolve, improvements in mobile broadband have been useful to continue the progression of such technologies. For example, user equpments (UEs) and base stations can support more antenna configurations and multi-connectivity. One consequence, however, is that channel state information (CSI) reports have become larger and more complex.
BRIEF SUMMARY
The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects. This summary neither identifies key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineates the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
A user equipment (UE) may receive one or more channel state information-reference signals (CSI-RSs) from a network entity, such as a base station, for generating one or more channel state information (CSI) reports. In some cases, the UE may generate at least one CSI report based on a machine learning (ML) model. Hence, the UE may include a UE capability for parallel processing of a plurality of CSI reports based on ML model (s) and/or parallel processing of a first CSI report based on the ML model and a second CSI report that is not based on the ML model.
The UE may use an ML model to reduce a complexity of the at least one CSI report by compressing the at least one CSI report using one or more subband eigenvectors. Additionally or alternatively, the UE may leverage the ML model to omit at least a portion of the at least one CSI report when a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold.
According to some aspects, a UE receives a CSI-RS from a network entity and selects a wideband precoder for compression of a CSI report based on a measurement of the CSI-RS. Selection of the wideband precoder is based on a whole bandwidth for receiving the CSI-RS. The UE compresses, with the selected wideband precoder, the CSI report using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded estimated subband channels. The UE transmits/sends, to the network entity, a first precoding matrix indicator (PMI) that indicates the wideband precoder and a second PMI that indicates the one or more subband eigenvectors.
A network entity transmits a CSI-RS to a UE for selection of a wideband precoder that compresses a CSI report based on a measurement of the CSI-RS. The selection of the wideband precoder is based on a whole bandwidth for transmitting the CSI-RS. The network entity receives, from the UE, the CSI report compressed with the selected wideband precoder using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded subband channels, a first PMI that indicates the wideband precoder, and a second PMI that indicates the one or more subband eigenvectors. The network entity decompresses the CSI report using the first PMI and the second PMI as inputs to an ML model that outputs the decompressed CSI report.
According to some aspects, the UE receives one or more CSI-RSs from a network entity for transmission of one or more CSI reports to the network entity. At least one CSI report of the one or more CSI reports is based on an ML model. When a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold, the UE omits at least a portion of the at least one CSI report based on the ML model output. The UE transmits, to the network entity, the one or more CSI reports with the at least the portion of the at least one CSI report omitted from the transmission.
According to some aspects, the UE receives, from a network entity, a configuration for a CSI report processing procedure. The configuration is for at least one of: (a) processing a plurality of CSI reports using an ML model or (b) processing a first set of CSI reports, and not a second set of CSI reports, using the ML model. The UE receives, from the network entity, a plurality of CSI-RSs. Measurements of the plurality of CSI-RSs are based on a UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure. The UE communicates CSI reports to the network entity based on the UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure.
A network entity transmits, to a UE, a configuration for a CSI report processing procedure. The configuration is for at least one of: (a) processing a plurality of CSI reports using an ML model or (b) processing a first set of CSI reports, and not a second set of CSI reports, using the ML model. The network entity transmits, to the UE, a plurality of CSI-RSs. The UE processes measurements of the plurality of CSI-RSs based on a UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure. Based on the received CSI report, the network entity communicates with the UE.
To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects correspond to the features hereinafter described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The one or more aspects may be implemented through any of an apparatus, a method, a means for performing the method, and/or a non-transitory computer-readable medium.

FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram 100 of a wireless communications system associated with a plurality of cells 190. The wireless communications system includes user equipments (UEs) 102 and base stations 104, where some base stations 104a include an aggregated base station architecture and other base stations 104b include a disaggregated base station architecture. The aggregated base station architecture includes a radio unit (RU) 106, a distributed unit (DU) 108, and a centralized unit (CU) 110 that are configured to utilize a radio protocol stack that is physically or logically integrated within a single radio access network (RAN) node. A disaggregated base station architecture utilizes a protocol stack that is physically or logically distributed among two or more units (e.g., RUs 106, DUs 108, CUs 110) . For example, a CU 110 is implemented within a RAN node, and one or more DUs 108 may be co-located with the CU 110, or alternatively, may be geographically or virtually distributed throughout one or multiple other RAN nodes. The DUs 108 may be implemented to communicate with one or more RUs 106. Each of the RU 106, the DU 108 and the CU 110 can be implemented as virtual units, such as a virtual radio unit (VRU) , a virtual distributed unit (VDU) , or a virtual central unit (VCU) .
Operations of the base stations 104 and/or network designs may be based on aggregation characteristics of base station functionality. For example, disaggregated base station architectures are utilized in an integrated access backhaul (IAB) network, an open-radio access network (O-RAN) network, or a virtualized radio access network (vRAN) which may also be referred to a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) . Disaggregation may include distributing functionality across the two or more units at various physical locations, as well as distributing functionality for at least one unit virtually, which can enable flexibility in network designs. The various units of the disaggregated base station architecture, or the disaggregated RAN architecture, can be configured for wired or wireless communication with at least one other unit. For example, the CU 110a communicates with the DUs 108a-108b via respective midhaul links based on F1 interfaces. The DUs 108a-108b may respectively communicate with the RU 106a and the RUs 106b-106c via respective fronthaul links. The RUs 106a-106c may communicate with respective UEs 102a-102c and 102s via one or more radio frequency (RF) access links based on a Uu interface. In examples, multiple RUs 106 and/or base stations 104 may simultaneously serve the UEs 102, such as the UE 102a of the cell 190a that the access links for the RU 106a of the cell 190a and the base station 104a of the cell 190e simultaneously serve.
One or more CUs 110, such as the CU 110a or the CU 110d, may communicate directly with a core network 120 via a backhaul link. For example, the CU 110d communicates with the core network 120 over a backhaul link based on a next generation (NG) interface. The one or more CUs 110 may also communicate indirectly with the core network 120 through one or more disaggregated base station units, such as a near-real time RAN intelligent controller (RIC) 128 via an E2 link and a service management and orchestration (SMO) framework 116, which may be associated with a non-real time RIC 118. The near-real time RIC 128 might communicate with the SMO framework 116 and/or the non-real time RIC 118 via an A1 link. The SMO framework 116 and/or the non-real time RIC 118 might also communicate with an open cloud (O-cloud) 130 via an O2 link. The one or more CUs 110 may further communicate with each other over a backhaul link based on an Xn interface. For example, the CU 110d of the base station 104a communicates with the CU 110a of the base station 104b over the backhaul link based on the Xn interface. Similarly, the base station 104a of the cell 190e may communicate with the CU 110a of the base station 104b over a backhaul link based on the Xn interface.
The RUs 106, the DUs 108, and the CUs 110, as well as the near-real time RIC 128, the non-real time RIC 118, and/or the SMO framework 116, may include (or may be coupled to) one or more interfaces configured to transmit or receive information/signals via a wired or wireless transmission medium. A base station 104 or any of the one or more disaggregated base station units can be configured to communicate with one or more other base stations 104 or one or more other disaggregated base station units via the wired or wireless transmission medium. In examples, a processor, a memory, and/or a controller associated with executable instructions for the interfaces can be configured to provide communication between the base stations 104 and/or the one or more disaggregated base station units via the wired or wireless transmission medium. For example, a wired interface can be configured to transmit or receive the information/signals over a wired transmission medium, such as for the fronthaul link between the RU 106d and the baseband unit (BBU) 112 of the cell 190d or, more specifically, the fronthaul link between the RU 106d and DU 108d. The BBU 112 includes the DU 108d and a CU 110d, which may also have a wired interface configured between the DU 108d and the CU 110d to transmit or receive the information/signals between the DU 108d and the CU 110d based on a midhaul link. In further examples, a wireless interface, which may include a receiver, a transmitter, or a transceiver (such as an RF transceiver) , can be configured to transmit or receive the information/signals via the wireless transmission medium, such as for information communicated between the RU 106a of the cell 190a and the base station 104a of the cell 190e via cross-cell communication beams of the RU 106a and the base station 104a.
One or more higher layer control functions, such as function related to radio resource control (RRC) , packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) , service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) , and the like, may be hosted at the CU 110. Each control function may be associated with an interface for communicating signals based on one or more other control functions hosted at the CU 110. User plane functionality such as central unit-user plane (CU-UP) functionality, control plane functionality such as central unit-control plane (CU-CP) functionality, or a combination thereof may be implemented based on the CU 110. For example, the CU 110 can include a logical split between one or more CU-UP procedures and/or one or more CU-CP procedures. The CU-UP functionality may be based on bidirectional communication with the CU-CP functionality via an interface, such as an E1 interface (not shown) , when implemented in an O-RAN configuration.
The CU 110 may communicate with the DU 108 for network control and signaling. The DU 108 is a logical unit of the base station 104 configured to perform one or more base station functionalities. For example, the DU 108 can control the operations of one or more RUs 106. One or more of a radio link control (RLC) layer, a medium access control (MAC) layer, or one or more higher physical (PHY) layers, such as forward error correction (FEC) modules for encoding/decoding, scrambling, modulation/demodulation, or the like can be hosted at the DU 108. The DU 108 may host such functionalities based on a functional split of the DU 108. The DU 108 may similarly host one or more lower PHY layers, where each lower layer or module may be implemented based on an interface for communications with other layers and modules hosted at the DU 108, or based on control functions hosted at the CU 110.
The RUs 106 may be configured to implement lower layer functionality. For example, the RU 106 is controlled by the DU 108 and may correspond to a logical node that hosts RF processing functions, or lower layer PHY functionality, such as execution of fast Fourier transform (FFT) , inverse FFT (iFFT) , digital beamforming, physical random access channel (PRACH) extraction and filtering, etc. The functionality of the RUs 106 may be based on the functional split, such as a functional split of lower layers.
The RUs 106 may transmit or receive over-the-air (OTA) communication with one or more UEs 102. For example, the RU 106b of the cell 190b communicates with the UE 102b of the cell 190b via a first set of communication beams 132 of the RU 106b and a second set of communication beams 134 of the UE 102b, which may correspond to inter-cell communication beams or cross-cell communication beams. Both real-time and non-real-time features of control plane and user plane communications of the RUs 106 can be controlled by associated DUs 108. Accordingly, the DUs 108 and the CUs 110 can be utilized in a cloud-based RAN architecture, such as a vRAN architecture, whereas the SMO framework 116 can be utilized to support non-virtualized and virtualized RAN network elements. For non-virtualized network elements, the SMO framework 116 may support deployment of dedicated physical resources for RAN coverage, where the dedicated physical resources may be managed through an operations and maintenance interface, such as an O1 interface. For virtualized network elements, the SMO Framework 116 may interact with a cloud computing platform, such as the O-cloud 130 via the O2 link (e.g., cloud computing platform interface) , to manage the network elements. Virtualized network elements can include, but are not limited to, RUs 106, DUs 108, CUs 110, near-real time RICs 128, etc.
The SMO framework 116 may be configured to utilize an O1 link to communicate directly with one or more RUs 106. The non-real time RIC 118 of the SMO framework 116 may also be configured to support functionalities of the SMO framework 116. For example, the non-real time RIC 118 implements logical functionality that enables control of non-real time RAN features and resources, features/applications of the near-real time RIC 128, and/or artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) procedures. The non-real time RIC 118 may communicate with (or be coupled to) the near-real time RIC 128, such as through the A1 interface. The near-real time RIC 128 may implement logical functionality that enables control of near-real time RAN features and resources based on data collection and interactions over an E2 interface, such as the E2 interfaces between the near-real time RIC 128 and the CU 110a and the DU 108b.
The non-real time RIC 118 may receive parameters or other information from external servers to generate AI/ML models for deployment in the near-real time RIC 128. For example, the non-real time RIC 118 receives the parameters or other information from the O-cloud 130 via the O2 link for deployment of the AI/ML models to the real-time RIC 128 via the A1 link. The near-real time RIC 128 may utilize the parameters and/or other information received from the non-real time RIC 118 or the SMO framework 116 via the A1 link to perform near-real time functionalities. The near-real time RIC 128 and the non-real time RIC 115 may be configured to adjust a performance of the RAN. For example, the non-real time RIC 116 monitors patterns and long-term trends to increase the performance of the RAN. The non-real time RIC 116 may also deploy AI/ML models for implementing corrective actions through the SMO framework 116, such as initiating a reconfiguration of the O1 link or indicating management procedures for the A1 link.
Any combination of the RU 106, the DU 108, and the CU 110, or reference thereto individually, may correspond to a base station 104. Hence, the base station 104 may include at least one of the RU 106, the DU 108, or the CU 110. The base stations 104 provide the UEs 102 with access to the core network 120. That is, the base stations 104 might relay communications between the UEs 102 and the core network 120. The base stations 104 may be associated with macrocells for high-power cellular base stations and/or small cells for low-power cellular base stations. For example, the cell 190e corresponds to a macrocell, whereas the cells 190a-190d may correspond to small cells. Small cells include femtocells, picocells, microcells, etc. A cell structure that includes at least one macrocell and at least one small cell may be referred to as a “heterogeneous network. ”
Transmissions from a UE 102 to a base station 104/RU 106 are referred to uplink (UL) transmissions, whereas transmissions from the base station 104/RU 106 to the UE 102 are referred to as downlink (DL) transmissions. Uplink transmissions may also be referred to as reverse link transmissions and downlink transmissions may also be referred to as forward link transmissions. For example, the RU 106d utilizes antennas of the base station 104a of cell 190d to transmit a downlink/forward link communication to the UE 102d or receive an uplink/reverse link communication from the UE 102d based on the Uu interface associated with the access link between the UE 102d and the base station 104a/RU 106d.
Communication links between the UEs 102 and the base stations 104/RUs 106 may be based on multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, including spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and/or transmit diversity. The communication links may be associated with one or more carriers. The UEs 102 and the base stations 104/RUs 106 may utilize a spectrum bandwidth of Y MHz (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 100, 400, etc. MHz) per carrier allocated in a carrier aggregation of up to a total of Yx MHz, where x component carriers (CCs) are used for communication in each of the uplink and downlink directions. The carriers may or may not be adjacent to each other along a frequency spectrum. In examples, uplink and downlink carriers may be allocated in an asymmetric manner, more or fewer carriers may be allocated to either the uplink or the downlink. A primary component carrier and one or more secondary component carriers may be included in the component carriers. The primary component carrier may be associated with a primary cell (PCell) and a secondary component carrier may be associated with as a secondary cell (SCell) .
Some UEs 102, such as the UEs 102a and 102s, may perform device-to-device (D2D) communications over sidelink. For example, a sidelink communication/D2D link utilizes a spectrum for a wireless wide area network (WWAN) associated with uplink and downlink communications. The sidelink communication/D2D link may also use one or more sidelink channels, such as a physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) , a physical sidelink discovery channel (PSDCH) , a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) , and/or a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) , to communicate information between UEs 102a and 102s. Such sidelink/D2D communication may be performed through various wireless communications systems, such as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) systems, Bluetooth systems, Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, New Radio (NR) systems, etc.
The electromagnetic spectrum is often subdivided into different classes, bands, channels, etc., based on different frequencies/wavelengths associated with the electromagnetic spectrum. Fifth-generation (5G) NR is generally associated with two operating bands referred to as frequency range 1 (FR1) and frequency range 2 (FR2) . FR1 ranges from 410 MHz –7.125 GHz and FR2 ranges from 24.25 GHz –52.6 GHz. Although a portion of FR1 is actually greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to as the “sub-6 GHz” band. In contrast, FR2 is often referred to as the “millimeter wave” (mmW) band. FR2 is different from, but a near subset of, the “extremely high frequency” (EHF) band, which ranges from 30 GHz –300 GHz and is sometimes also referred to as a “millimeter wave” band. Frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as “mid-band” frequencies. The operating band for the mid-band frequencies may be referred to as frequency range 3 (FR3) , which ranges 7.125 GHz –24.25 GHz. Frequency bands within FR3 may include characteristics of FR1 and/or FR2. Hence, features of FR1 and/or FR2 may be extended into the mid-band frequencies. Higher operating bands have been identified to extend 5G NR communications above 52.6 GHz associated with the upper limit of FR2. Three of these higher operating bands include FR2-2, which ranges from 52.6 GHz –71 GHz, FR4, which ranges from 71 GHz –114.25 GHz, and FR5, which ranges from 114.25 GHz –300 GHz. The upper limit of FR5 corresponds to the upper limit of the EHF band. Thus, unless otherwise specifically stated herein, the term “sub-6 GHz” may refer to frequencies that are less than 6 GHz, within FR1, or may include the mid-band frequencies. Further, unless otherwise specifically stated herein, the term “millimeter wave” , or mmW, refers to frequencies that may include the mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, FR4, FR2-2, and/or FR5, or may be within the EHF band.
The UEs 102 and the base stations 104/RUs 106 may each include a plurality of antennas. The plurality of antennas may correspond to antenna elements, antenna panels, and/or antenna arrays that may facilitate beamforming operations. For example, the RU 106b transmits a downlink beamformed signal based on a first set of beams 132 to the UE 102b in one or more transmit directions of the RU 106b. The UE 102b may receive the downlink beamformed signal based on a second set of beams 134 from the RU 106b in one or more receive directions of the UE 102b. In a further example, the UE 102b may also transmit an uplink beamformed signal to the RU 106b based on the second set of beams 134 in one or more transmit directions of the UE 102b. The RU 106b may receive the uplink beamformed signal from the UE 102b in one or more receive directions of the RU 106b. The UE 102b may perform beam training to determine the best receive and transmit directions for the beam formed signals. The transmit and receive directions for the UEs 102 and the base stations 104/RUs 106 might or might not be the same. In further examples, beamformed signals may be communicated between a first base station 104a and a second base station 104b. For instance, the RU 106a of cell 190a may transmit a beamformed signal based on an RU beam set 136 to the base station 104a of cell 190e in one or more transmit directions of the RU 106a. The base station 104a of the cell 190e may receive the beamformed signal from the RU 106a based on a base station beam set 138 in one or more receive directions of the base station 104a. Similarly, the base station 104a of the cell 190e may transmit a beamformed signal to the RU 106a based on the base station beam set 138 in one or more transmit directions of the base station 104a. The RU 106a may receive the beamformed signal from the base station 104a of the cell 190e based on the RU beam set 136 in one or more receive directions of the RU 106a.
The base station 104 may include and/or be referred to as a next generation evolved Node B (ng-eNB) , a generation NB (gNB) , an evolved NB (eNB) , an access point, a base transceiver station, a radio base station, a radio transceiver, a transceiver function, a basic service set (BSS) , an extended service set (ESS) , a transmit reception point (TRP) , a network node, a network entity, network equipment, or other related terminology. The base station 104 or an entity at the base station 104 can be implemented as an IAB node, a relay node, a sidelink node, an aggregated (monolithic) base station with an RU 106 and a BBU that includes a DU 108 and a CU 110, or as a disaggregated base station 104b including one or more of the RU 106, the DU 108, and/or the CU 110. A set of aggregated or disaggregated base stations 104a-104b may be referred to as a next generation-radio access network (NG-RAN) .
The core network 120 may include an Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) 121, a Session Management Function (SMF) 122, a User Plane Function (UPF) 123, a Unified Data Management (UDM) 124, a Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC) 125, and/or a Location Management Function (LMF) 126. The core network 120 may also include one or more location servers, which may include the GMLC 125 and the LMF 126, as well as other functional entities. For example, the one or more location servers include one or more location/positioning servers, which may include the GMLC 125 and the LMF 126 in addition to one or more of a position determination entity (PDE) , a serving mobile location center (SMLC) , a mobile positioning center (MPC) , or the like.
The AMF 121 is the control node that processes the signaling between the UEs 102 and the core network 120. The AMF 121 supports registration management, connection management, mobility management, and other functions. The SMF 122 supports session management and other functions. The UPF 123 supports packet routing, packet forwarding, and other functions. The UDM 124 supports the generation of authentication and key agreement (AKA) credentials, user identification handling, access authorization, and subscription management. The GMLC 125 provides an interface for clients/applications (e.g., emergency services) for accessing UE positioning information. The LMF 126 receives measurements and assistance information from the NG-RAN and the UEs 102 via the AMF 121 to compute the position of the UEs 102. The NG-RAN may utilize one or more positioning methods in order to determine the position of the UEs 102. Positioning the UEs 102 may involve signal measurements, a position estimate, and an optional velocity computation based on the measurements. The signal measurements may be made by the UEs 102 and/or the serving base stations 104/RUs 106.
Communicated signals may also be based on one or more of a satellite positioning system (SPS) 114, such as signals measured for positioning. In an example, the SPS 114 of the cell 190c may be in communication with one or more UEs 102, such as the UE 102c, and one or more base stations 104/RUs 106, such as the RU 106c. The SPS 114 may correspond to one or more of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) , a global position system (GPS) , a non-terrestrial network (NTN) , or other satellite position/location system. The SPS 114 may be associated with LTE signals, NR signals (e.g., based on round trip time (RTT) and/or multi-RTT) , wireless local area network (WLAN) signals, a terrestrial beacon system (TBS) , sensor-based information, NR enhanced cell ID (NR E-CID) techniques, downlink angle-of-departure (DL-AoD) , downlink time difference of arrival (DL-TDOA) , uplink time difference of arrival (UL-TDOA) , uplink angle-of-arrival (UL-AoA) , and/or other systems, signals, or sensors.
The UEs 102 may be configured as a cellular phone, a smart phone, a session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, a laptop, a personal digital assistant (PDA) , a satellite radio, a GPS, a multimedia device, a video device, a digital audio player (e.g., moving picture experts group (MPEG) audio layer-3 (MP3) player) , a camera, a game console, a tablet, a smart device, a wearable device, a vehicle, an utility meter, a gas pump, appliances, a healthcare device, a sensor/actuator, a display, or any other device of similar functionality. Some of the UEs 102 may be referred to as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as parking meters, gas pumps, appliances, vehicles, healthcare equipment, etc. The UE 102 may also be referred to as a station (STA) , a mobile station, a subscriber station, a mobile unit, a subscriber unit, a wireless unit, a remote unit, a mobile device, a wireless device, a wireless communications device, a remote device, a mobile subscriber station, an access terminal, a mobile terminal, a wireless terminal, a remote terminal, a handset, a mobile client, a client, or other similar terminology. The term UE may also apply to a roadside unit (RSU) , which may communicate with other RSU UEs, non-RSU UEs, a base station 104, and/or an entity at a base station 104, such as an RU 106.
Still referring to FIG. 1, in certain aspects, the UE 102 may include a UE-based channel state information (CSI) processing component 140 configured to receive a CSI-RS from a network entity and select a wideband precoder for compression of a CSI report based on a measurement of the CSI-RS. Selection of the wideband precoder is based on a whole bandwidth for receiving the CSI-RS. The UE-based CSI processing component 140 is further configured to compress, with the selected wideband precoder, the CSI report using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded subband channels. The UE-based CSI processing component 140 is further configured to transmit/send, to the network entity for decompression of the CSI report, a first precoding matrix indicator (PMI) that indicates the wideband precoder and a second PMI that indicates the one or more subband eigenvectors.
In further examples, the UE-based CSI processing component 140 is configured to receive one or more CSI-RSs from a network entity and transmit one or more CSI reports to the network entity. The UE generates at least one CSI report of the one or more CSI reports using an ML model. When a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold the UE-based CSI processing component 140 is further configured to omit at least a portion of the at least one CSI report. The UE-based CSI processing component 140 is further configured to transmit, to the network entity, the one or more CSI reports with the at least the portion of the at least one CSI report omitted from the transmission.
In still further examples, the UE-based CSI processing component 140 is configured to receive, from a network entity, a configuration for a CSI report processing procedure. The configuration is for at least one of: (a) processing a plurality of CSI reports using an ML model or (b) processing a first set of CSI reports, and not a second set of CSI reports, using the ML model. The UE-based CSI processing component 140 is further configured to receive, from the network entity, a plurality of CSI-RSs. Measurements of the plurality of CSI-RSs are based on a UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure. The UE-based CSI processing component 140 is further configured to communicate CSI reports to the network entity based on the UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure.
In certain aspects, the base station 104 or a network entity of the base station 104 may include a network-based CSI processing component 150 configured to transmit a CSI-RS to a UE for selection of a wideband precoder that compresses a CSI report based on a measurement of the CSI-RS. The selection of the wideband precoder is based on a whole bandwidth for transmitting the CSI-RS. The network-based CSI processing component 150 is further configured to receive, from the UE, the CSI report compressed with the selected wideband precoder using one or more subband eigenvectors for one or more precoded subband channels, a first PMI that indicates the wideband precoder, and a second PMI that indicates the one or more subband eigenvectors. The network-based CSI processing component 150 is further configured to decompress the CSI report using the first PMI and the second PMI as inputs to an ML model that outputs the decompressed CSI report.
In further examples, the network-based CSI processing component 150 is configured to transmit one or more CSI-RSs to a UE for one or more CSI reports. At least one CSI report of the one or more CSI reports is based on an ML model. The network-based CSI processing component 150 is further configured to receive, from the UE, the one or more CSI reports with at least a portion of the at least one CSI report being omitted when a total payload size of the one or more CSI reports exceeds a threshold.
In still further examples, the network-based CSI processing component 150 is configured to transmit, to a UE, a configuration for a CSI report processing procedure. The configuration is for at least one of: (a) processing a plurality of CSI reports using an ML model or (b) processing a first set of CSI reports, and not a second CSI report, using the ML model. The network-based CSI processing component 150 is further configured to transmit, to the UE, a plurality of CSI-RSs. Measurements of the plurality of CSI-RSs are based on a UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure. The network-based CSI processing component 150 is further configured to communicate CSI reports to the UE based on the UE capability for the CSI report processing procedure. Although the following description may be focused on 5G NR, the concepts described herein may be applicable to other similar areas, such as 5G- Advanced and future versions, LTE, LTE-advanced (LTE-A) , and other wireless technologies.
FIG. 2 illustrates a diagram 200 for example machine learning (ML) -based channel state information (CSI) compression. For a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system, the CSI is a key information for a gNB to select the digital precoder for a UE. Usually a gNB can configure a CSI report by RRC signaling CSI-reportConfig, where a channel measurement resource (CMR) is used by a UE to measure a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) to estimate the downlink channel. Meanwhile, the gNB may configure, in a CSI-reportConfig, some interference measurement resource (IMR) for UE to measure interference. With the help of CMR and IMR, UE is able to identify the CSI, which may include rank indicator (RI) , precoding matrix indicator (PMI) , channel quality indicator (CQI) and layer indicator (LI) . RI and PMI are used to determine a digital precoder (also called a precoding matrix) , CQI is used to reflect the signal-to-interference plus noise (SINR) status so as to determine the transmitter’s selection of modulation and coding scheme (MCS) , and LI is used to identify the strongest layer, which can be helpful for MU-MIMO pairing with low rank transmission and the precoder selection for phase-tracking reference signal (PT-RS) . A UE may report the CSI in two parts by physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) /physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) , where CSI part 1 may include RI and CQI for the first transport block (TB) , and CSI part 2 may include PMI, LI and CQI for the second TB. The payload size for CSI part 2 is determined based on CSI part 1, and both parts are transmitted with separate channel coding operations.
The gNB can configure the time domain behavior, i.e. periodic/semi-persistent/aperiodic report, for a CSI report in a CSI-reportConfig. The gNB can activate or deactivate a semi-persistent CSI report by MAC control element (CE) . The gNB can trigger an aperiodic CSI report by Downlink Control Information (DCI) . The UE may report the periodic CSI by a PUCCH resource configured in CSI-reportConfig. UE may report the semi-persistent CSI by a PUCCH resource configured in CSI-reportConfig or PUSCH resource triggered by DCI by gNB. The UE may report the aperiodic CSI by a PUSCH resource triggered by a DCI from the gNB.
In resource element k for a CSI-RS, the receiving signal in frequency domain could be obtained as follows:
Y
k=H
kX
k+N
k
where H
k indicates the effective channel including analog beamforming weight with the dimension of N
Rx by N
Tx, X
k is the CSI-RS at resource element k, N
k denotes the interference plus noise, N
Rx is the number of receiving ports and N
Tx is the number of transmission ports.
In resource element k for physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) , the receiving signal in frequency domain could be as follows:
Y
k=H
kW
kX
k+N
k
where W
k indicates the precoder and usually for subcarriers within a subband (bundled physical resource block) , the precoder should be the same.
Since Rel-15, the Type 2 CSI codebook is introduced for UE to measure and report the CSI, where a precoder is quantized as follows:
W=W
1W
2
where W
1 is a wideband precoder with the dimension of N
Tx by 2L; W
2 is a subband precoder with the dimension of 2L by v; L indicates the number of beams, and v indicates the number of layers, which is RI+1.
W
1 can be quantized based on a codebook, while W
2 could be quantized based on power and angle for each element, which could lead to a large overhead since W
2 is subband based, and there could be multiple subbands for a CSI report, which is determined by the bandwidth for the CSI-RS. In one example, the codebook for W1 selection can be defined as follows:
B=[b
1 b
2 … b
L]
where,
Machine learning is one way to perform the CSI compression, where the first v columns of Eigen vector for the average channel for each subband can be used as the input. As used herein, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the terms “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence” may be used interchangeably with each other. FIG. 2 shows an example for machine learning based CSI compression after a UE receives the CSI-RS. The UE can estimate the channel based CSI-RS, and then calculate the Eigen vector for the channel in each subband. The Eigen vectors can be the input for the neural network for CSI compression. Then UE can report the compressed CSI to its gNB. Upon receipt, the gNB can decode the compressed CSI and then de-compress the CSI using a neural network to recover the Eigen vector.
For each subband, the Eigen vector V can be derived based on singular vector decomposition (SVD) of the average channel in the subband as follows.
Where N indicates the number of CSI-RS resource elements for subband S;
For Machine Learning (ML) based CSI compression, the corresponding terminology is defined as follows.

One potential issue for current procedure in FIG. 2 is that the UE complexity for Eigen vector calculation puts considerable demands on processors within the UE. For each subband, the calculation of the first Eigen vector V
1 requires singular vector decomposition (SVD) of the average channel as follows.
where N indicates the number of CSI-RS resource elements for subband S;
Hence, a method is proposed to reduce the UE complexity for ML based CSI compression, including: Eigen vector calculation complexity reduction.
A UE may be configured with multiple CSI-reportConfig, and some may be configured based on ML, i.e. AI based CSI report, while some may be configured based on traditional codebook, i.e. non-AI based CSI report. UE may be triggered to report CSI from multiple CSI-reportConfig by PUSCH or PUCCH. Then the total payload size for the CSI may exceed the maximum payload size for CSI part 2 in the PUSCH/PUCCH. Some parts need to be omitted. For multiple AI based CSI reports or mixed AI and non-AI based CSI report, how to define the CSI omission rule could be a second problem.
Hence, a method is proposed for an AI based CSI report, including: CSI omission rule for multiple AI and non-AI based CSI reports; and CSI omission rule for a single AI based CSI report.
FIG. 3A illustrates a first timing diagram 300 for a first CSI processing unit duration 311 associated with periodic/semi-persistent CSI reporting. FIG. 3B illustrates a second timing diagram 350 for a second CSI processing unit duration 313 associated with aperiodic CSI reporting. The UE 102 can be configured with multiple CSI-reportConfig information elements (IEs) for multiple CSI measurements and reports. Thus, a plurality of CSI processing units may be used for parallel processing of received CSI-RS to create a plurality of CSI measurements and reports. The UE 102 might transmit UE capability information to the base station 104 indicating a number of CSI processing units that the UE 102 supports. If the base station 104 requests CSI reports that require more parallel CSI processing at the UE 102 than the number of CSI processing units available at the UE (i.e., indicated in the UE capability report) , the UE 102 can report non-current information for low priority CSI reports. In some examples, the UE 102 may determine a priority of a particular CSI report based on predefined protocols. For example, a CSI processing unit occupancy rule for the periodic/semi-persistent CSI report 307 and the aperiodic CSI report 309 may be based on the predefined protocols.
The first CSI processing unit duration 311 for the periodic/semi-persistent CSI report 307 corresponds to a CSI processing unit that’s occupancy begins at a first symbol of earliest resources for the CMR 303 or the IMR 305 used for measurements by the UE 102. For example, the UE 102 may perform one or more measurements of a CSI-RS, CSI-interference measurement (CSI-IM) , a synchronization signal block (SSB) , etc. The first CSI processing unit duration 311 for the periodic/semi-persistent CSI report 307 continues through last resources for the CMR 303 and the IMR 305 used for the measurement of the UE 102 and ends at a last symbol of a PUSCH/PUCCH used by the UE 102 for transmitting the periodic/semi-persistent CSI report 307 to the base station 104.
The second CSI processing unit duration 313 for the aperiodic CSI report 309 corresponds to a CSI processing unit that’s occupancy begins at a first symbol after receiving a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) 301 that triggers the aperiodic CSI report 309. The second CSI processing unit duration 313 for the aperiodic CSI report 309 continues through last resources for the CMR 303 and the IMR 305 used for the measurement of the UE 102 and ends at a last symbol of a PUSCH used by the UE 102 for transmitting the aperiodic CSI report 309 to the base station 104. If the PDCCH 301 that triggers the aperiodic CSI report 309 corresponds to two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used for determining the second CSI processing unit duration 313 for the aperiodic CSI report 309.
If the PDCCH 301 triggers an initial semi-persistent CSI report on the PUSCH, the CSI processing unit duration for the initial semi-persistent CSI report may not be the same as the first CSI processing unit duration 311 for the periodic/semi-persistent CSI report 307. Instead, the CSI processing unit duration for the initial semi-persistent CSI report may correspond to the second CSI processing unit duration 313 for the aperiodic CSI report 309. That is, the CSI processing unit duration for the initial semi-persistent CSI report transmitted on the PUSCH, after the PDCCH 301, begins at the first symbol after the PDCCH 301 and ends at the last symbol of the PUSCH that carries the initial semi-persistent CSI report. If the PDCCH 301 that triggers the initial semi-persistent CSI report corresponds to two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used for determining the CSI processing unit duration for the initial semi-persistent CSI report.
CSI reporting by the UE 102 might be based on a minimum processing delay time. For example, scheduling for the periodic/semi-persistent CSI report 307 or the aperiodic CSI report 309 might include minimum processing delays of Z and Z’ . Values of Z and Z’ for different types of CSI reports might be based on one or more predefined protocols. If a scheduling offset does not indicate the minimum processing delays of Z and Z’ , the UE 102 can report the minimum processing delay associated with the non-current CSI or disregard a triggering DCI, if no other signals (e.g. data or hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) -acknowledgment (ACK) (HARQ-ACK) ) are to be transmitted on the PUSCH triggered by the DCI (e.g., PDCCH 301) . If a CSI request field of the DCI is used to trigger one or more CSI reports from the UE 102 on the PUSCH, the UE 102 may transmit the one or more CSI reports to the base station 104, if the first uplink symbol associated with the one or more CSI reports serves as a timing advance that starts no earlier than symbol Z
ref. For instance, the UE 102 may transmit an n-th triggered CSI report to the base station 104, if the first uplink symbol associated with the n-th CSI report starts no earlier than symbol Z'
ref (n) .
The AI based CSI report may be implemented by UE based on a different hardware, e.g. neural processing unit (NPU) , compared to non-AI based CSI. Then a CPU may not be shared for AI based and non-AI based CSI. Thus, how to manage the parallel processing for multiple AI based CSI reports and mixed AI and non-AI based CSI reports could be one issue. Moreover, the complexity for AI based CSI report would also be determined by the ML model. Then how to define the minimal processing delay for AI based CSI report could be another issue.
Hence, a method is proposed for methods of parallel processing for AI based CSI measurement and report, including: CSI processing unit (CPU) management framework; and minimal processing delay requirement.
Low Complexity ML-based CSI Compression
FIG. 4 illustrates a diagram 400 of a general procedure for the low complexity machine learning based CSI compression. Compared to traditional approach in FIG. 2, the input for the neural network is calculated as follows:
The first v columns of the second Eigen vector V
2 could be the input of neural network, where v indicates the number of layers. W1 is the wideband precoder which can be quantized based on a predefined codebook or a codebook configured by the network entity, e.g. Type1 codebook as defined in section 5.2.2.2.1 in 3GPP TS 38.214 v17.2.0, or Type2 codebook as defined in section 5.2.2.2.3 in 3GPP TS 38.214 v17.2.0. In one example, the codebook for W1 selection can be defined as follows:
B= [b
1 b
2 … b
L]
where,
The dimension of
FIG. 5 is a signaling diagram 500 that illustrates a procedure for the low complexity based ML based CSI report. The gNB may provide a configuration for a ML based CSI report by RRC signaling, e.g. CSI-reportConfig. The gNB may trigger a CSI report by MAC CE or DCI. For periodic CSI report, this message can be skipped. In one example, gNB may trigger semi-persistent CSI report by MAC CE, and gNB may trigger aperiodic CSI report by DCI. UE may perform the CSI measurement based on reception of the CSI-RS. The UE may compress the CSI based on the low complexity based ML based compression operation as shown in FIG. 6, where compared to legacy approach (the first Eigen vector is used as input) , a second Eigen vector is used as the input for a ML model. After CSI compression, UE may report the compressed CSI to gNB. The gNB may receive the CSI and decompress the CSI based on ML. FIG. 6 illustrates a method diagram 600 of the UE behavior for CSI compression and report. FIG. 7 illustrates a method diagram 700 of the gNB behavior for CSI decompression.
In an embodiment, the input for the neural network for CSI encoder in the UE side should be based on the selected wideband precoder and estimated channel from the CSI-RS. In one example, the input could be the first v columns of the second Eigen vector V2 calculated based on SVD of matrix
B= [b
1 b
2 … b
L]
where,
The ML model (s) , for CSI encoder may be configured by higher layer signaling by gNB, e.g. RRC signaling, or be predefined or preconfigured. In one implementation, different ML models may be used for different codebook structures. In one example, one ML model should be used for the codebook with a certain number of beams configured. In another example, one ML model should be used for the codebook with a certain number of beams, N
1, N
2, O
1, and O
2 configured. In another example, one ML model should be used for the codebook with a certain number of subbands, number of beams, N
1, N
2, O
1, and O
2 configured.
In some implementation, before the RRC configuration for codebook for ML based CSI report, UE may report its capability of supported codebook structure for ML based CSI report.
In an embodiment, for a AI based CSI report, the first precoder matrix index (PMI) for W1 can be reported as well as the output of the ML for CSI compression, which can be denoted as a compressed Eigen vector or a second PMI for each subband, can be reported by UE to gNB.
In one example, the first PMI may be reported as two indexes: one is used to indicate the horizontal beam index m and the other is used to indicate the vertical beam index n. The second PMI is the output for the ML model used for CSI compression.
FIGs. 8A-8D illustrate tables 800-830 of examples ML CSI reports. In one implementation, for short PUCCH based CSI report, both PMIs and other CSI may be reported in a single part. Table 800 of FIG. 8A illustrates one example for ML CSI report format in short PUCCH.
In one implementation, for PUSCH or long PUCCH based CSI, both PMIs may be reported in CSI part 2, where the bit-width for CSI part 2 is determined by the information reported in CSI part 1, e.g. CRI/RI and CQI for the first transport block (TB) . Table 810 of FIG. 8B illustrates another example for ML CSI report format as part 2 CSI in long PUCCH and PUSCH.
In another implementation, for PUSCH or long PUCCH based CSI, both PMIs may be reported in CSI part 2, the first PMI is reported in CSI part 1 and the second PMI is reported in CSI part 2. Table 820 of FIG. 8C and Table 830 of FIG. 8D illustrate another example for ML CSI report format as part 1 and part 2 CSI in long PUCCH and PUSCH.
In an embodiment, the low complexity based CSI compression can be enabled by RRC signaling by gNB, e.g. RRC parameter in CSI-reportConfig, which should be based on UE capability report. In one implementation, a codebook with a codebookType configured as ‘ML’ or ‘Type3’ . The RRC signaling for a codebook ML may include at least one of: a number of beams (L) , a number of ports in horizontal and vertical domain (N1, N2) , a number of oversampling factors in horizontal and vertical domain (O1, O2) , a number of subbands for CSI compressions, a number of subbands per CQI calculation, which indicates the number of subbands for CSI compression used for CQI calculation, an RI restriction, which is used to indicate the candidate ranks for precoder selection, or an ML model, which indicates the ML model used for CSI compression.
In addition, with regard to the low complexity based ML CSI compression and traditional ML, a subtype may be indicated in the codebook configuration for ML to indicate whether this is low complexity based ML, e.g. typeIII-hybrid or traditional ML, e.g. typeIII.
Unless otherwise specified herein, a RRC signaling may indicate a RRC reconfiguration message from gNB to UE, or a system information block (SIB) , where the SIB can be an existing SIB (e.g., SIB1) or a new SIB transmitted by gNB. In addition, the gNB may obtain the UE capability via UE capability report signaling or from a core network (e.g., Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) ) .
Further in this invention, solutions described are based on 5G NR technologies. It should be understood that the solutions can be applied to other wireless technologies such as 6G. The “gNB” can be generalized as a base station or a radio access network (RAN) node.
CSI Omission for AI-based CSI Report
FIG. 9A illustrates a diagram 900 of a general procedure for the CSI report with regard to CSI omission rule for some embodiments. When the overhead for CSI for multiple CSI reports exceed the maximum payload size for PUSCH/PUCCH for the CSI report, some CSI in part 2 needs to be omitted based on a priority rule, so that the overall payload size for CSI report fit the maximum payload size that can be supported for the PUSCH/PUCCH used for CSI report. In this invention, the CSI with a higher priority value should be omitted, e.g. CSI with priority value = 1 needs to be omitted compared to CSI with priority value = 0.
First, a gNB may send RRC signaling to a UE to configure at least 1 ML based CSI-reportConfig. A CSI report can be considered as an AI based CSI if the codebookType in the CSI-reportConfig is set as a particular value, e.g. ‘ai-Ml’ or ‘type3’ , or the reportQuantity in the CSI-reportConfig is set as a particular value, e.g. ‘ri-compressedPmi-cqi’ . In addition, the gNB may also configure some non-AI based CSI reports, which may be based on a particular codebook, e.g. Type1 or Type2 codebook.
Second, the gNB may trigger at least one AI based CSI report by MAC CE or DCI. In one example, the gNB may send a MAC CE to activate semi-persistent CSI report (s) . In another example, the gNB may send a DCI to trigger aperiodic CSI report (s) . In another example, UE should report periodic CSI report at the uplink resource configured by RRC signaling by gNB periodically.
Third, the UE may measure the CSI-RS (s) corresponding to the triggered or configured CSI reports to derive the CSI. If the gNB configures or triggers multiple CSI reports with the total payload size exceeds the maximum payload size for the PUCCH/PUSCH used for the CSI report, UE may determine to apply a CSI omission rule to omit some CSI reports and/or some part in some CSI reports. The UE needs to determine the priority for the AI based and non-AI based CSI reports first and then if some CSI omission for AI based CSI report should be applied, UE may decide to omit some portion of the AI based CSI report. For the CSI omission for the AI based report, the following 3 embodiments for the AI based CSI report content are considered: scenario 1 corresponds to AI based CSI report may include a PMI to indicate the compressed eigen vectors for the channel in all subbands; scenario 2 corresponds to AI based CSI report may include a first PMI to indicate a selected wideband precoder and a second PMI to indicate the compressed eigen vectors for the precoded channel with the selected wideband precoder in all subbands; and scenario 3 corresponds to AI based CSI report may include a first PMI to indicate a selected wideband precoder, a second PMI to indicate the compressed eigen vectors for the precoded channel with the selected wideband precoder in even subbands, a third PMI to indicate the compressed eigen vectors for the precoded channel with the selected wideband precoder in odd subbands.
Forth, UE sends the CSI report with the remaining content for the AI based and non-AI based CSI report (s) that have been triggered or configured to report by gNB. The CSI report may be transmitted by PUCCH or PUSCH. For PUCCH, the CSI reports may be reported by long PUCCH format. The gNB may determine the remaining CSI for the CSI report based on the CSI omission rule, and then decode the CSI report accordingly.
FIG. 9B illustrates a diagram 950 of an alternative procedure for CSI reporting with regard to a CSI omission rule in accordance with other embodiments. Compared to the procedure in FIG. 9A, the difference is that for an ML-based CSI report, if CSI omission is required, UE can replace the AI based CSI with a non-AI based CSI. Then the UE can perform the CSI omission for some portion (s) of the new non-AI based CSI report. Compared to FIG. 9A, the procedure in FIG. 9B could be more flexible for UE to report more efficient CSI. However, the procedure in FIG. 9B may require higher UE complexity as UE may need to potentially measure the non-AI based CSI in addition to AI based CSI for an AI based CSI report.
FIG. 10 is a method diagram 1000 of the UE behavior to report AI/non-AI based CSI with the CSI omission rule based on procedure in FIG. 9A. FIG. 11 is a method diagram 1100 of the gNB behavior to report AI/non-AI based CSI with the CSI omission rule based on procedure in FIG. 9A. FIG. 12 is a method diagram 1200 of the UE behavior to report AI/non-AI based CSI with the CSI omission rule based on procedure in FIG. 9B. FIG. 13 is a method diagram 1300 of the gNB behavior to report AI/non-AI based CSI with the CSI omission rule based on procedure in FIG. 9B.
Unless otherwise specified, a RRC signaling may indicate a RRC reconfiguration message from gNB to UE, or a system information block (SIB) , where the SIB can be an existing SIB (e.g., SIB1) or a new SIB transmitted by gNB. In addition, the gNB may obtain the UE capability via UE capability report signaling or from a core network (e.g., Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) ) .
Further in this invention, solutions described are based on 5G NR technologies. It should be understood that the solutions can be applied to other wireless technologies such as 6G. The “gNB” can be generalized as a base station or a radio access network (RAN) node.
In an embodiment, whether the AI based CSI report, i.e. CSI measured with a ML model based CSI encoder, and non-AI based CSI report, e.g. CSI measured based on a Type1/Type2 codebook, can be multiplexed and reported by a PUSCH/PUCCH may be reported by UE capability by UE, predefined or configured by higher layer signaling by gNB, e.g. RRC signaling.
In an embodiment, the priority for AI based CSI report or non-AI based report may be different. The gNB and UE may determine the priority for a CSI report by the time domain behavior for the CSI report, i.e. periodic/semi-persistent/aperiodic report, CSI-reportConfigId, serving cell ID, report quantity and whether it is measured based on AI or non-AI approach.
In examples, the priority can be calculated based on Pri
iCSI (y, k, c, s) =2·N
cells·M
s·y+N
cells·M
s·k+M
s·c+s, where an actual priority is higher if the priority value is lower (e.g., priority 0 corresponds to a higher priority than priority 1) . A value of k=0 may indicate CSI reports that include L1-RSRP or L1-SINR information, a value of k=1 may indicate non-AI-based CSI reports that do not include the L1-RSRP or L1-SINR information, and a value of k=2 may indicate AI-based CSI reports that do not include the L1-RSRP or L1-SINR information. Further, y=0 indicates aperiodic CSI reports transmitted on PUSCH, y=1 indicates semi-persistent CSI reports transmitted on the PUSCH, y=2 indicates semi-persistent CSI reports transmitted on PUCCH, and y=3 indicates periodic CSI reports transmitted on PUCCH. c corresponds to the serving cell index and N
cells corresponds to a value of the higher layer parameter maxNrofServingCells. s corresponds to the reportConfigID and M
scorresponds to a value of the higher layer parameter maxNrofCSI-ReportConfigurations.
Alternatively, k=0 for CSI reports carrying L1-RSRP or L1-SINR and k=1 for AI based CSI reports not carrying L1-RSRP or L1-SINR, k=2 for non-AI based CSI reports not carrying L1-RSRP or L1-SINR. In another implementation, an AI based CSI report may be always assumed by gNB and UE to be with a higher or lower priority compared to a non-AI based CSI report.
FIGs. 14A-14C illustrate tables 1400-1420 for AI-based CSI reports. In an embodiment, within an AI based CSI report, the wideband PMI and subband PMI can be assumed with different priority. This may be applicable for scenario 2 and 3 only. The priority value of wideband PMI is smaller than subband PMI, i.e. when omission is needed, subband PMI could be omitted. For scenario 2 and 3, the priority for the first PMI and the second/third PMI should be different. In one example, gNB and UE may determine the priority for N
Rep AI based CSI reports according to the table 1400 of FIG. 14A, where CSI report n corresponds to the CSI report with the n
th smallest Pri
i, CSI (y, k, c, s) value as the previous embodiment.
In another embodiment, gNB and UE assumes a single priority value is assigned to an AI based CSI report. This may be applicable for scenario 1, 2 and 3. Then the CSI omission priority should only be determined based on Pri
i, CSI (y, k, c, s) according to the table 1410 of FIG. 14B.
In another embodiment, gNB and UE assumes the AI based CSI may be divided into 3 priority groups. In one implementation, for scenario 3, the groups could be: Group 0 for wideband PMI (the first PMI) , Group 1 for subband PMI for even subbands (the second PMI) , and Group 2 for subband PMI for odd subbands (the third PMI) . For an AI based CSI report, the ML based CSI compression may be performed twice, where the first one is for even subbands and the second one is for odd subbands.
In another implementation, for scenario 2, the groups could be: Group 0 for wideband PMI (the first PMI) , Group 1 for high priority bits for subband PMI (part of the second PMI) , and Group 2 for low priority bits for subband PMI (other part of the second PMI) . With the high priority bits, gNB is able to recover the first Eigen vectors at a certain loss. Which bits should be high priority bits should depend on the ML models and can be predefined or configured by higher layer signaling by gNB, e.g. RRC signaling in a CSI-reportConfig. The bits in group 1 and group 2 may be generated based on a single AL/ML model or separate ML models.
In another implementation, for scenario 1, the groups could be: Group 0: high priority bits for the PMI in CSI part 2, Group 1: medium priority bits for the PMI in CSI part 2, and Group 2: low priority bits for the PMI in CSI part 2. Based on the bits with different priority, gNB may be able to recover the first Eigen vectors at a certain loss. Which bits should be high/medium/low priority bits should depend on the neural network architecture and can be predefined or configured by higher layer signaling by gNB, e.g. RRC signaling in a CSI-reportConfig. The bits in group 1/2/3 may be generated based on a single AL/ML model or separate ML models. Accordingly, the CSI omission priority could be defined according to the table 1420 of FIG. 14C.
In an embodiment, if part of the AI based CSI needs to be omitted, UE may fallback to report non-AI based CSI based on a fallback codebook, e.g. Type2 CSI codebook or eType2 CSI codebook. The fallback codebook may be configured by RRC signaling, e.g. RRC parameter in CSI-reportConfig, or predefined or reported by UE capability signaling. UE can perform CSI omission based on the rule for non-AI based CSI defined in 5.2.3 in 38.214.
In some implementation, the gNB may apply the same CSI omission rule to determine whether UE reports the AI based CSI or non-AI based CSI for an AI based CSI report. In some other implementation, for a CSI report, UE may report an additional indicator to report whether the CSI is measured based on AI or non-AI. In one implementation, such indicator may be explicitly transmitted in a CSI report, e.g. an indicator to report the codebook type used for the CSI report. In another implementation, the gNB may configure or trigger 2 PUCCH/PUSCH resources for the CSI report, where one is used for AI based report and the other is used for non-AI based report. By selecting corresponding PUCCH/PUSCH resource, UE can implicitly report whether the CSI is based on AI or non-AI. In another implementation, such indicator can be implicitly reported based on scrambling sequence for the DMRS or PUCCH/PUSCH, where one scrambling sequence is used to indicate AI based CSI report and the other is used to indicate non-AI based CSI report. By receiving such indicator, gNB can determine whether to decode the CSI as AI based CSI or non-AI based CSI.
In an embodiment, UE may use multiple ML models with different compression ratio for CSI compression, where the ML models may be configured by RRC signaling or predefined. Similarly, gNB may use multiple ML models with different compression ratio for CSI decompression. With regard to CSI omission, UE may select the ML models with highest compression ratio that can fit the overhead restriction for the PUCCH/PUSCH used for the CSI report. In some implementation, the gNB may apply the same CSI omission rule to determine the ML model for CSI decompression, where the one with highest compression ratio that can fit the overhead restriction for the PUCCH/PUSCH used for the CSI report should be selected.
In some other implementation, for a CSI report, UE may report an additional indicator to report the ML model index. The gNB and UE could maintain a list of ML models with different compression ratio. In one example, such ML models may be configured by RRC signaling from gNB to UE, or reported by UE capability, or predefined. In one implementation, such indicator may be explicitly transmitted in a CSI report, e.g. an indicator to report ML model index explicitly. In another implementation, the gNB may configure or trigger X (X is an integer above 1. ) PUCCH/PUSCH resources for the CSI report, where each one is used for one ML model. By selecting corresponding PUCCH/PUSCH resource, UE can implicitly report ML model index. In another implementation, such indicator can be implicitly reported based on scrambling sequence for the DMRS or PUCCH/PUSCH, where each scrambling sequence correspond to an ML model. By receiving such indicator, gNB can determine the ML model for CSI decompression.
In an embodiment, for CSI omission for N
Rep, 1 AI based CSI report and N
Rep, 2 non-AI based CSI report, AI based CSI report may be assumed by gNB and UE with a higher or lower priority value compared to non-AI based CSI report. UE should determine to omit AI or non-AI based CSI report first in different implementations, and if further omission is still needed, UE can apply CSI omission for the remaining non-AI or AI based CSI. For AI based CSI omission, the embodiments above can be applied. For non-AI based CSI omission, the CSI omission rule defined in section 5.2.3 in 38.214 can be applied.
In another embodiment, for CSI omission for N
Rep, 1 AI based CSI report and N
Rep, 2 non-AI based CSI report, gNB and UE should determine the priority for a CSI report based on the priority for the CSI-reportConfig first, and then the priority within a CSI-reportConfig can be determined based on the priority group.
Parallel Processing for ML-based CSI
FIG. 15 is a signaling diagram 1500 illustrating a procedure for a CPU framework for AI-based CSI processing. In some embodiments, the AI based CSI may be implemented based on a different hardware compared to non-AI based CSI, e.g. neural processing unit (NPU) . The NPU may be dedicated or shared with other application, e.g. non-wireless communication based application. In some other embodiments, the AI based CSI may be implemented based on the same hardware as that used for non-AI based CSI. Thus, it is necessary to introduce a second CPU framework for AI based CSI processing. In this IDF, a Type2 CPU is defined as CPU used for AI based CSI processing that cannot be shared with non-AI based CSI. Legacy CPU for non-AI based CSI processing is denoted as Type1 CPU.
The UE can report at least one UE capabilities on whether it supports AI based CSI compression and maximum number of Type2 CPUs it supports. The gNB can provide the configuration of CSI framework for multiple CSI reports, where gNB can provide the configuration for a CSI report by RRC signaling, e.g. CSI-reportConfig. For semi-persistent and aperiodic CSI report, gNB may send a MAC CE or DCI to trigger the corresponding report, where the gNB uses MAC CE to activate the semi-persistent CSI report and DCI to trigger the aperiodic CSI report. After receiving the control signaling to trigger at least one AI based CSI report (s) , UE may determine the CPU status and determine which CSI report (s) should be valid CSI report (s) , e.g. CSI report (s) with latest measurement results. Then UE may send the updated CSI for high priority CSI reports and outdated CSI for low priority CSI reports if the number of Type1 or Type2 CPUs exceed the maximum number of Type1 or Type2 CPUs. FIG. 16 is a method diagram 1600 of the UE behavior for the CPU framework for AI based CSI processing. FIG. 17 is a method diagram 1700 of the gNB behavior for the CPU framework for the AI based CSI processing.
In an embodiment, during UE capability report, UE may report at least one UE capabilities on whether it supports AI based CSI processing, whether the AI based CSI processing can share the CPU for non-AI based processing and maximum number of Type2 CPUs per component carrier (CC) or per band or per band combination or per UE. The UE may report the UE capability for Type2 CPU in addition to the UE capability on maximum number of Type1 CPUs, e.g. simultaneousCSI-ReportsPerCC for number of Type1 CPUs per CC, and simultaneousCSI-ReportsAllCC for number of Type1 CPUs across all CCs. In one example, if UE reports it supports AI based CSI processing with 0 Type2 CPU, it can be assumed that the AI based CSI processing can share the CPU used for non-AI based processing. In addition, if the NPU used for AI based CSI processing can be shared with other application, UE may report an on/off duration for the Type2 CPU. When a Type2 CPU is off, it cannot be counted for AI based CSI processing. The on/off duration may be reported based on the maximum periodicity and on duration for a Type2 CPU.
In an embodiment, the gNB may configure whether an AI based CSI report should occupy Type2 CPU (s) or not. For an AI based CSI report that does not occupy Type2 CPU(s) , it should occupy Type1 CPU (s) . In some implementations, the gNB may provide such CPU type indication for a CSI report by RRC signaling, e.g. an RRC parameter in CSI-reportConfig. In some further implementations, the gNB may provide such CPU type indication for a CSI report by MAC CE. In one example, the gNB may provide the CPU type indication by MAC CE for semi-persistent CSI report. In another example, the gNB may provide the CPU type indication based on a separate MAC CE, where the MAC CE may provide at least one element of serving cell index, bandwidth part index, CSI-reportConfig ID (s) , CPU type indication for the indicated CSI-reportConfig. In some further implementations, the gNB may provide such CPU type indication for a CSI report by DCI. In one example, for aperiodic CSI report, the gNB may indicate the CPU type by the DCI used to trigger the CSI report. A new field may be added in the DCI to indicate the CPU type. Alternatively, the gNB can configure the CPU type corresponding to a CSI trigger state, and by indicating different value of CSI request field in DCI, gNB can indicate the corresponding CPU type.
In an embodiment, if UE reports AI based CSI processing with Type2 CPU, in one implementation, a Type2 CPU is occupied based on similar rule as Type1 CPU. For example, a periodic or semi-persistent CSI report (excluding an initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH triggering the report) occupies Type2 CPU (s) from the first symbol of the earliest one of each CSI-RS/CSI-IM/SSB resource for channel or interference measurement, respective latest CSI-RS/CSI-IM/SSB occasion no later than the corresponding CSI reference resource, until the last symbol of the configured PUSCH/PUCCH carrying the report. An aperiodic CSI report occupies Type2 CPU (s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH triggering the CSI report until the last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of 3GPP TS 38.213, for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. An initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH trigger occupies Type2 CPU (s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH until the last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of 3GPP TS 38.213, for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. In this implementation, the gNB and UE may consider Type2 CPU (s) as a subset of Type1 CPU (s) . Thus, if a Type2 CPU is occupied, a Type1 CPU is occupied. Then the maximum number of Type2 CPU (s) reported in UE capability should be less than or equal to the maximum number of Type1 CPU (s) reported in UE capability.
FIG. 18 illustrates a timing diagram 1800 for a Type2 CPU occupancy rule. Since the NPU would only be used after UE gets the channel, the Type2 CPU may be assumed to be occupied after X symbols after the first/last symbol of the earliest/latest channel measurement resource (CMR) or interference measurement resource (IMR) , until Y symbols before the first/last symbol of PUSCH/PUCCH used for CSI report. The value of X and Y may be predefined or reported by UE capability. FIG. 18 illustrates one example for the Type2 CPU occupancy rule.
FIGs. 19A-19B illustrate example timing diagrams 1900-1950 for the CPU occupancy rule for an AI-based periodic/semi-persistent CSI report. FIGs. 20A-20B illustrate example timing diagrams 2000-2050 for the CPU occupancy rule for an AI-based aperiodic CSI report. If UE reports AI based CSI processing requires Type2 CPU, the AI based CSI processing may require Type1 CPU as well, since some other CSI processing procedure, e.g. decode of CSI-RS, RI and CQI calculation may not require neural network processing.
In one implementation, both Type1 and Type2 CPUs are occupied based on the same rule as Type1 CPU occupancy. In another implementation, gNB and UE may determine Type1 CPU is occupied based on the legacy rule and Type2 CPU is occupied after X symbols after the first/last symbol of the earliest/latest channel measurement resource (CMR) or interference measurement resource (IMR) , until Y symbols before the first/last symbol of PUSCH/PUCCH used for CSI report. The value of X and Y may be predefined or reported by UE capability.
The gNB and UE may determine Type1 CPU is occupied based on the legacy rule excluding the duration when a Type2 CPU is occupied. Type2 CPU is occupied after X symbols after the first/last symbol of the earliest/latest channel measurement resource (CMR) or interference measurement resource (IMR) , until Y symbols before the first/last symbol of PUSCH/PUCCH used for CSI report. The value of X and Y may be predefined or reported by UE capability.
If AI based CSI processing only requires Type2 CPU, after checking the Type2 CPU occupancy status, UE can process the N
CPU, 2 AI based CSI report with higher priority according to section 5.2.5 in 38.214, where N
CPU, 2 is the maximum number of Type2 CPUs UE reports during UE capability report. For other low priority CSI report, UE can report outdated CSI.
If AI based CSI processing only requires both Type1 and Type2 CPUs, after checking the Type1 and Type2 CPU occupancy status, UE can process the min{N
CPU, 1-n
CPU, 1, N
CPU, 2} AI based CSI report with higher priority, where N
CPU, 1 is the maximum number of Type1 CPUs UE reports during UE capability report and n
CPU, 1 is the number of CPUs used by other higher priority non-AI based CSI report. For other low priority CSI report (s) , UE can report outdated CSI. In another embodiment, the gNB may refrain from configuring or triggering CSI reports that require more Type1 and Type2 CPUs than the maximum number of Type1 and Type2 CPUs reported by the UE from UE capability reporting.
FIG. 21 illustrates a signaling diagram 2100 for a CSI report based on a minimum processing delay. The minimal processing delay for AI based CSI should depend on whether a dedicated hardware can be used. With a dedicated hardware, e.g. NPU, the neural network processing should be faster than traditional hardware based approach. In addition, the minimal processing delay also depends on the neural network architecture. If the gNB scheduling leads to a smaller scheduling offset than the minimal processing delay, UE may decide to report an outdated CSI or ignore the DCI if no HARQ-ACK or data is to be transmitted on the PUSCH triggered by the DCI.
The UE may report the capability on minimal processing delay for AI based CSI report. The gNB can provide the configuration of CSI framework for multiple CSI reports, where gNB can provide the configuration for a CSI report by RRC signaling, e.g. CSI-reportConfig. For semi-persistent and aperiodic CSI report, gNB may send a MAC CE or DCI to trigger the corresponding report, where MAC CE is used to activate the semi-persistent CSI report and DCI is used to trigger the aperiodic CSI report. UE can determine the scheduling offset for the CSI report so that it can determine whether to perform the AI based CSI report or not. If the scheduling offset meets the minimal processing delay for AI based CSI report, UE may report the AI based CSI.
The UE may report the minimal processing delay Z and Z’ for AI based CSI report, where Z and Z’ may indicate when the CSI request field on a DCI triggers an AI based CSI report (s) on PUSCH, such that the UE shall provide a valid AI based CSI report for the n-th triggered report, if the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding AI based CSI report (s) including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol Z, and if the first uplink symbol to carry the n-th AI based CSI report including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol Z'.
The minimal processing delay Z and Z’ may be determined by gNB and UE based on the whether UE would take Type2 CPU or not for AI based CSI report. In one example, two sets of Z and Z’ may be predefined, where the first one may be used for UE that does not take Type2 CPU and the second one may be used for UE that takes Type2 CPU for a AI based CSI report.
As the minimal processing delay depends on the ML models, the UE may report the supported Z and Z’ for each ML model it supports. UE may report more than 1 ML models that it supports. The gNB may indicate the ML model to be used for AI based CSI by higher layer signaling, e.g. RRC signaling in CSI-reportConfig. Then the corresponding minimal processing delay should apply for the AI based CSI report.
The UE may not be able to perform parallel processing for AI based CSI report due to limitation of dedicated hardware. Then the minimal processing delay may be determined based on the number of AI based CSI reports for CSI report at the same time. The minimal processing delay Z and Z’ for one AI based CSI report may be predefined or reported by UE capability by UE. For N AI based CSI report, the minimal processing delay could be uNZ and uNZ’ , where u may be predefined, configured by higher layer signaling by gNB, e.g. RRC signaling in CSI-reportConfig, or reported by UE capability with the range within (0, 1] . UE may also report whether it supports parallel processing or not as a second UE capability.
For triggered AI based CSI report (s) , if the scheduling offset does not meet the minimal Z or Z’ requirement, UE may ignore the DCI if no HARQ-ACK or data is transmitted on the PUSCH scheduled by the DCI. For triggered AI based CSI report (s) , if the scheduling offset does not meet the minimal Z or Z’ requirement, UE may report outdated CSI for all the triggered CSI report (s) . For triggered AI based CSI report (s) , if the scheduling offset does not meet the minimal Z or Z’ requirement, UE may report outdated CSI for the triggered CSI report that does not meet the minimal Z or Z’ requirement. The gNB may refrain from configuring or triggering AI based CSI reports with smaller scheduling offset than the minimal processing delay for the AI based CSI report.
