Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and systems for searching.
- embodiments of the present invention relate generally to methods and systems for using social networks to personalize search queries and results and improve a user's search experience with a search engine.
- a conventional search engine such as the GoogleTM search engine, returns a result set in response to an input query submitted by a user.
- the search engine performs the search based on a conventional search method. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the web page.
- the search engine ranks or sorts the individual articles or documents in the result set based on a variety of measures. For example, the search engine may rank the results based on a popularity score.
- the search engine generally places the most popular results near the beginning of the result set.
- search engines cannot take into account a particular user's personality, preferences, interests, etc., such search engines will often provide irrelevant results. For example, a search for the query term “apple” may provide results pertaining to Apple brand computers, the fruit apple, or a particular musical group called apple, while a particular user may only be interested in one of these topics for the term “apple.” Thus, it would be useful to provide methods and systems that take into account information indicative of a particular entity's preferences, interests, etc., when an electronic search is performed for/on behalf of such entity.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for using information provided by social networks to personalize search queries submitted to a search engine or search results provided by the search engine.
- a method comprising: receiving a search query from a user; determining personalization information associated with the user from a network of associated users; and providing a search result set relevant to the search query based on at least some of the personalization information.
- Such personalization information can comprise information gathered from a profile of the user as maintained by the network, information gathered from at least a profile of one of the associated users as maintained by the network (e.g., based on the user's contact information indicating other users that are associated with the user), and/or information about the user as gathered from cookies installed at the user's side (e.g., in the user's computer or machine used for submitting search queries to the search engine).
- the cookies are installed at the user's side to record the user's consumer information, including, for example, the user's behavior.

- FIG. 7 depicts a process flow for search personalization in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 8 depicts a process flow for search personalization in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention.
- a search result set comprises one or more identifiers of articles that are relevant to a search query.
- Articles include, for example: word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, e-mail, instant messenger, database, and other client application program content files or groups of files; web pages of various formats (e.g., HTML, XML, XHTML); portable document format (PDF) files; audio files; video files; or any other documents or groups of documents or information of any type whatsoever.
- An article identifier may be, for example, a uniform resource locator (URL), a uniform resource identifier (URI), a file name, a link, an icon, a path for a local file, or anything else that identifies an article.
- URL uniform resource locator
- URI uniform resource identifier
- Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for members of a social network to personalize search queries and/or search results based on members' information gathered from the social network.
- the method begins with a user joining a social network and creating a member profile in the social network. Once the user becomes a member, the user can access the social network and initiate a search from within the network to a search engine.
- the search engine receives a search query from the user, the search engine can access the social network to gather personalization information associated with the user, including information contained in the user's member profile. Based on the gathered information, the search engine can personalize the search and tailor the search results for the user.
- the user can initiate a search from within the search engine; however, the search engine is linked with the social network, and the user is given an option to personalize the search. If the user exercises such option, the search engine can again access the social network to gather personalization information associated with the user for a personalized search.

- An article identifier may be, for example, a uniform resource locator (URL), a uniform resource identifier (URI), a file name, a link, an icon, a path for a local file, or anything else that identifies an article.
- URL uniform resource locator
- URI uniform resource identifier
- the social network site 160 shown includes a social network database 170 and a server device 162 executing a social network engine application program. Similar to the client devices 102 a - n , the server device 162 shown includes a processor 164 coupled to a CRM 166 . The server device 162 is in communication with a social network database 170 . Server device 162 , depicted as a single computer system, may be implemented as a network of computer processors. Examples of the server device 162 are servers, mainframe computers, networked computers, a processor-based device, and similar types of systems and devices. The server processor 164 can be any of a number of suitable computer processors, such as processors from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. and Motorola Corporation of Schaumburg, Ill.
- Memory 166 in the server device 162 contains a social network engine application program, also known as a social network engine 168 .
- the social network engine 168 allows users, such as user 112 a , to interact with and participate in a social network.
- a social network can refer to a network connecting people or organization by a set of relationships, such as social relationships like friendship, co-working, or information exchange.
- a social network can include profiles that can be associated with other profiles. Each profile may represent a member and a member can be, for example, a person, an organization, a business, a corporation, a community, a fictitious person, or other entity. Each profile can contain entries, and each entry can include information associated with a profile.
- Examples of entries for a person profile can include information regarding relationship status, birth date, age, children, ethnicity, religion, political view, sense of humor, sexual orientation, fashion preferences, smoking habits, drinking habits, pets, hometown location, passions, sports, activities, favorite books, music, television, or movie preferences, favorite cuisines, email addresses, location information, IM name, phone number, address, skills, career, or any other information describing, identifying, or otherwise associated with a profile.
- Entries for a business profile can include market sector, customer base, location, supplier information, net profits, net worth, number of employees, stock performance, or other types of information associated with the business profile.
- entries within a profile can include associations with other profiles.
- Associations between profiles within a social network can include, for example, friendships, business relationships, acquaintances, community or group associations, activity partner associations, common interest associations, common characteristic associations, or any other suitable type of relationship connection (e.g., social relationship connection).
- Members can set up new associations or join existing associations in the social network as desired. For example, a member can set up a “Computer Science community” for those members who are interested or work in the computer science field. Likewise, a member can join an existing “Baseball community” if the member is interested in baseball and/or sport in general.
- Associations between profiles can also have various levels. For example, friendship levels can include, for example, a “haven't met” level, an “acquaintance” level, a “friend” level, a “good friend” level, a “best friend” level, and other suitable levels.
- entries within a profile can include member classifications or labels based on their profile associations within the social network. For example, a member that belongs to the Computer Science community in the social network can be classified or labeled a “techie”, whereas a member that belongs to the Baseball community in the social network can be labeled a “sports fan”. A single member can have multiple labels. For example, a member that belongs to both the Computer Science and Baseball communities in the social network can be labeled a “techie” and a “sports fan”.
- a degree of separation based on associations between profiles can also be determined. For example, a degree of separation can be determined based on the fewest number of associations between two profiles. Thus, if profile A is a friend of profile B, and profile B is a friend of profile C, there can be a degree of separation of two between profiles A and C.
- a degree of separation can be type specific or type neutral. Type specific degrees of separation only count relationships of a certain type. Thus, for example, in the case above where A is a friend of B, and B is a friend of C, there is a friendship degree separation of two, even if A is directly associated with C by a business association, which would otherwise produce a degree of separation of 1.
- the social network engine 168 can be linked to the search engine 158 , whereby a member within the social network engine 168 can access the search engine 158 via a search tool to conduct a search.
- the search tool can be accessible from within each member's profile or within a created association in the social network, such as a community like the Computer Science community.
- Server device 162 of the social network site 160 also provides access to storage elements, such as a social network storage element, in the example shown in FIG. 1 , a social network database 170 .
- the social network database 170 can be used to store profiles of members in a social network and to store communities within the social network as created by the member-network engine 168 .
- Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs. Other similar types of data storage devices can be accessed by the server device 162 .
- the social network engine 168 can receive data comprising the profiles and created associations from the member-network database 170 and can also send data comprising created associations and profiles to the social network database 170 for storage.
- the member-network database 170 may be physically attached or otherwise in communication with the member-network engine 168 by way of a network or other connection.
- a member of a social network can submit an input query to a search engine, such as the search engine 158 , through a search tool in the member profile or an association created within the social network, as described earlier.
- FIG. 3 shows a sample screenshot of a search tool 300 in a member profile in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 shows a sample screenshot of a created association, e.g., The Simpsons community (i.e., a community with members that are interested in the television show “The Simpsons”), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the Simpsons community i.e., a community with members that are interested in the television show “The Simpsons”
- search engine 158 Because the search engine 158 is linked to the social network engine 168 , it can access the social network database 170 through the social network engine 168 and look up the member's profile to personalize the search query and search results. Such search personalization can affect the searching methodology and/or ranking of search results that are returned to the member. The methods for accomplishing these tasks are described below in the process section.
- server device 162 may include a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to help explain the social networks and methods illustrated in subsequent figures.
- FIG. 2 shows a diagram of a social network 200 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the social network 200 is illustrated with a graph comprising vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 and edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 .
- the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 comprise profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, respectively. Each profile can represent a member profile of a member of the social network 200 .
- the exemplary network 200 shown in FIG. 2 has seven members.
- a member can be an entity such as, for example, a person, an organization, a business, a corporation, a community, a fictitious person, or other suitable entity.
- Each member profile can contain entries, and each entry can comprise information associated with a profile.
- a person's member profile can contain: personal information, such as relationship status, birth date, age, children, ethnicity, religion, political view, sense of humor, sexual orientation, fashion preferences, smoking habits, drinking habits, pets, hometown location, passions, sports, activities, favorite books or music, television, or movie preferences, and favorite cuisines; contact information, such as email addresses, location information, instant messenger name, telephone numbers, and address; professional information, such as job title, employer, and skills; educational information, such as schools attended and degrees obtained, and any other suitable information describing, identifying, or otherwise associated with a person.
- a business' member profile can, for example, contain a description of the business, and information about its market sector, customer base, location, suppliers, net profits, net worth, number of employees, stock performance, contact information, and other types of suitable information associated with the business.
- a member profile can also contain rating information associated with the member.
- the member can be rated or scored by other members of the social network 200 in specific categories, such as humor, intelligence, fashion, trustworthiness, sexiness, and coolness.
- a member's category ratings can be contained in the member's profile.
- a member can have fans. Fans can be other members who have indicated that they are “fans” of the member. Rating information can also include the number of fans of a member and identifiers of the fans. Rating information can also include the rate at which a member accumulated ratings or fans and how recently the member has been rated or acquired fans.
- a member profile can also contain membership information associated with the member.
- Membership information can include information about a member's login patterns to the social network, such as the frequency that the member logs in to the social network and the member's most recent login to the social network.
- Membership information can also include information about the rate and frequency that a member profile gains associations to other member profiles.
- a member profile may contain consumer information. Consumer information may include: the frequency, patterns, types, or number of purchases the member makes; information about which advertisers or sponsors the member has accessed, patronized, or used; and/or information about a member's behavior, e.g., areas of the social network and/or other articles that the member previously accessed and viewed.
- a member profile may comprise data stored in memory.
- the profile in addition to comprising data about the member, can also comprise data relating to others.
- a member profile can contain an identification of associations or virtual links with other member profiles.
- a member profile includes an identification of association(s) to which the member belongs.
- a member profile can indicate that the member belongs to the Computer Science community.
- membership information can include a classification of the member based on the member's various associations. For example, the member can be classified as a “sports fan” because the member belongs to the Baseball community.
- a member profile may comprise a hyperlink associated with another member's profile. In one such association, the other member's profile may contain a reciprocal hyperlink associated with the first member's profile.
- a member's profile may also contain information excerpted from another associated member's profile, such as a thumbnail image of the associated member, his or her age, marital status, and location, as well as an indication of the number of members with which the associated member is associated.
- a member's profile may comprise a list of other members' profiles with which the member wishes to be associated.
- An association may be designated manually or automatically.
- a member may designate associated members manually by selecting other profiles and indicating an association that can be recorded in the member's profile.
- an association between two profiles may comprise an association automatically generated in response to a predetermined number of common entries, aspects, or elements in the two members' profiles.
- a member profile may be associated with all of the other member profiles comprising a predetermined number or percentage of common entries, such as interests, hobbies, likes, dislikes, employers and/or habits.
- Associations between profiles within a social network can be of a single type or can be multiple types and can include, for example, friendship associations, business associations, family associations, community associations, school associations, or any other suitable type of link between profiles. Associations can further be weighted to represent the strength of the association. For example, a friendship association can be weighted more than a school association. Each type of association can have various levels with different weights associated with each level. For example, a friendship association can be classified according to which of a plurality of friendship association levels it belongs to. In one embodiment, a friendship association may be assigned a level by the member from a list of levels comprising: a best friend, a good friend, a regular friend, an acquaintance, and a friend the member has not met.
- the edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 shown comprise associations between profiles.
- the social network 200 comprises a plurality of differing types of associations represented by edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 .
- the types of associations shown in FIG. 2 for illustration purposes are business associations, activity partner associations, friendship associations, community associations, and common characteristic associations.
- Common characteristic associations may include, for example, associations based on some characteristic, such as attending the same high school or being from the same hometown, and can indicate a lower level of significance than another type of association, such as a friendship association.
- edge 220 and edge 222 each comprise an association between profile A at vertex 202 and profile D at vertex 208 .
- the edge 220 represents a business association
- the edge 222 represents a friendship association.
- Profile A is also associated with profile E by a common characteristic association comprising edge 218 .
- the association between profile A and profile E may be more attenuated than the association between profile A and D, but the association can still be represented by the social network depicted in FIG. 2 .
- Each member represented by the profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G comprising the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 , respectively, for purposes of illustration, comprises a person.
- Other types of members can be in social network 200 .
- communities, special interest groups, organizations, political parties, universities, and legal persons, such as corporations and business partnerships may be members of the social network 200 .
- the associations 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 illustrated in FIG. 2 comprise bi-directional associations.
- An association between two profiles may comprise a bi-directional association when both parties to the association are associated with each other.
- profile A is associated with profile D
- profile D is also associated with profile A.
- profiles A and D will not be bi-directionally associated with each other until both profiles consent to such an association.
- profile A may invite profile D to be associated therewith, and the bi-directional association occurs upon profile D's acceptance of such invitation.
- the invitation may include sending an email or other message to profile D indicating that profile A has requested an association with profile D.
- Directed associations can associate a first profile with a second profile while not requiring the second profile to be associated with the first profile.
- profile A can be associated by a friendship association with profile B, and profile B can be unassociated with profile A, or profile B can be associated with profile A through a different type of association, such as a business association.
- a display of profile A's friends would include profile B, but a display of profile B's friends would not include profile A.
- a degree of separation can be determined for associated profiles.
- a degree of separation between two profiles can be determined by the fewest number of edges of a certain type separating the associated profiles.
- a type-specific degree of separation may be determined.
- a type-specific degree of separation comprises a degree of separation determined based on one particular type of association. For example, a profile A has a friend association degree of separation of two from profile E. The fewest number of friendship associations between profile A and profile E is two—the friendship association comprising edge 222 between profiles A and D and the friendship association comprising edge 234 between profiles D and E.
- the degree of friendship separation determined according to one aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, is two.
- a common characteristic degree of separation can be determined by determining the fewest number of common characteristic associations separating profile A and profile E.
- the common characteristic association degree of separation is one.
- the common characteristic in this example can be that profile A attended the same high school as profile E.
- a common characteristic association may be selected by profiles A and E to represent that they are associated in some fashion, but to not create a close association such as with a friendship association.
- the degree of separation may be determined by use of a weighting factor assigned to each association. For example, close friendships can be weighted higher than more distant friendships. According to certain aspects of embodiments using a weighting factor, a higher weighting factor for an association can reduce the degree of separation between profiles and lower weighting factors can increase the degree of separation. This can be accomplished, for example, by establishing an inverse relationship between each associations and a corresponding weighting factor prior to summing the associations. Thus, highly weighted associations would contribute less to the resulting sum than lower weighted associations.
- the method begins with receiving a search query from a user.
- Next personalization information associated with the user is determined from a network of associated users. At least some of the personalization information is then used to provide a search result set relevant to the search query.
- the personalization information can comprise information gathered from the user's member profile in the network, one or more profiles of other associated users in the network (e.g., based on the user's contact information indicating other users that are associated with the user), and/or information about the user as gathered from cookies installed at the user's side (e.g., in the user's computer or machine used for submitting search queries to the search engine).
- the cookies are installed at the user's side to record the user's consumer information, including, for example, the user's behavior as described earlier.
- Such personalization information can further include information about an association in the network to which the user belongs.
- the personalization information can be provided by the user explicitly or implicitly for use in providing the search result set, and such personalization information can be provided by the user from within the user's member profile in the social network or from within an association in the social network to which the user may or may not belong.
- the amount of personalization information on which the search result set is based can be determined from the level of search personalization as input by the user via a scale or selection of one or more associations in the network.
- the personalization information can be added to the search query in order to provide the search result set or it can be used to rank articles identified in the search result set.
- FIGS. 6-8 illustrate exemplary methods that provide search personalization at a search engine whereby search queries and search results can be personalized based on a member's personalization information as gathered from a social network.
- a member's personalization information includes any information that is associated with the member, including any information contained in the member profile or maintained by the social network and is in any way associated with the member.
- the exemplary methods are provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method shown in FIGS. 6-8 can be executed or otherwise performed by one or a combination of various systems.
- the methods in FIGS. 6-8 are described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example methods of FIGS. 6-8 .
- a search can be personalized based on a desired personalization level.
- the method begins at 610 with a user, such as user 112 a , joining a social network, such as the social network 200 (e.g., OrkutTM), by creating a user or member profile, as described earlier.
- a social network such as the social network 200 (e.g., OrkutTM)
- the created member profile is linked to a search engine, such as the search engine 158 at the search site 152 .
- the social network engine 168 provides the created member profile with a search tool 300 , as shown in FIG. 3 , for linkage to the search engine 158 .
- the user 112 a can access his or her member profile and the search tool 300 therein to gain access to the search engine 158 for a personalized search.
- the user 112 a can choose the desired level of personalization for a search.
- the user 112 a belongs to multiple communities, e.g., a San Francisco community, a Feminists community, a Geeks community, and a Mills College community, whereby the user 112 a wishes to personalize a search based on his or her association with one or more of such communities.
- the search tool 300 provides the user 112 a with a list of personalization information, such as a list of communities 320 to which the user 112 a belongs and an option to use one or more of such communities on which to base a search of a query at 310 .
- the San Francisco, Geeks, and Mills College communities are selected to personalize the search.
- the community listings 320 can include associations other than those communities to which the user 112 a belongs.
- a list of the user's 112 a classifications based on those communities or associations to which the user 112 a belongs or with which the user 112 a is affiliated can be provided.
- the San Francisco community can be classified as “Bay Area”
- the Feminists community can be classified as “Women Empowerment”
- the Geeks community can be classified also as “techie”
- “Mills College” can be classified as “local colleges”.
- a personalization search can be based on such classifications.
- a scale slider can be provided in lieu of the classification or community listings 320 to provide the user 112 a with the option to personalize a search.
- the scale slider can be from levels 1 to 5, with level 1 being the most generic search and level 5 being the most personalized search. If the user 112 a moves the slider to level 1, the search engine 158 will conduct a normal search of the input query entered at 310 without basing the search on any other criteria. In other words, the search engine 158 locates articles from websites, systems, and/or devices that are accessible by the network 106 and returns article identifiers associated with articles relevant to the input query at 310 in a search result set.
- level 2 can indicate a search based on one of the four communities (or classifications) listed at 320 ; level 3, search based on two of the four communities (or classifications); level 4, a search based on three of the four communities (or classifications); and level 4, a search based on all four communities (or classifications).
- the community, communities, classification, or classifications to be selected for each level merely depend on the programming of the search engine 158 and/or social network engine 168 .
- the degree of use of the community, communities, classification, or classifications may vary; for example, the degree of use of communities for personalized search may vary depending on how often or how much the user participates or has participated in each community.
- the user 112 a submits an input query to the field 310 , along with a corresponding personalization choice entered at 320 , to the search engine 158 (e.g., by clicking on button 330 ).
- the search engine 158 searches the social network database 170 by communicating with the server device 162 and its social network engine 168 to identify and obtain additional information relating to the personalization choice.
- Each community in the social network can be edited by the social network administrator, a member that created the community, or any other entity with association editing capability, to include added query phrase(s) and/or term(s) to be used in a personalized search based on such community.
- FIG. 5 shows a sample screenshot of an association editing tool 500 for, e.g., The Simpsons community, wherein added query phrase(s) and/or term(s) can be entered in the fields 510 and 520 .
- the editing tool 500 also includes a field 530 for the user's entries of specially-chosen or preferred sites on which a personalized search additionally can be focused if the personalization is based on such community.
- a field 530 for the user's entries of specially-chosen or preferred sites on which a personalized search additionally can be focused if the personalization is based on such community.
- similar association editing tools are also available for the San Francisco, Feminists, Geeks, and Mills College communities.
- each community or group can specify the entries in fields 510 , 520 , and 530 to provide added query phrase(s), terms, and/or preferred sites for search customization.
- Each community/group may also allow members belonging to the community/group to suggest query phrase(s), terms, and/or preferred sites in lieu of or in addition to those specified by the owner/creator.
- the members can also suggest phrase, term, or site restriction (not shown).
- such members can vote for or against others' suggestions directly or by rating search results that are based on the search customization of the community/group, wherein the rating is applied back to the suggested phrases, terms, and/or preferred sites to increase or decrease their weights accordingly (e.g., moving a phrase or term from the required term field 510 to the optional term field 520 ).
- Members belong to a community/group can be motivated to provide such feedback because they can see improvement in the search results and help other community/group members.
- CTRs click-through rates
- terms, phrases, and preferred sites may be automatically extracted from communities. For example, analysis of the text in messages posted to a community can identify common terms or phrases. Analysis of how often participants or community members mention web sites in the community can be used to identify preferred sites. In still another embodiment, analysis of the web sites visited by members of a community can be used to identify preferred sites, for example sites that are often visited by at least a certain percentage of community members.
- the search engine 158 conducts a search of the input query entered at 310 based on the personalization choice, i.e., in view of the obtained additional information relating to such personalization choice.
- the search engine 158 first conducts a normal search of the input query entered at 310 , using the article index stored in memory 156 or another data storage device as mentioned earlier, and returns a first search result set of article identifiers.
- the added query phrase(s), term(s), and/or preferred site(s) can be used to re-search the underlying articles represented by the article identifiers to determine the relevancy of each article to the community included in the personalization choice.
- the article identifiers in the first search result set are ranked, ordered, and/or filtered and returned to the user 112 a .
- the user 112 a submits an input query “animation” at 310 chosen to be personalized based on The Simpsons community.

- the added phrase(s) and/or term(s) obtained from The Simpsons community in the social network is used, namely, the required and optional entries from fields 510 , 520 , and 530 are used to re-search the articles identified in the first search result set.
- the article identifiers in the first search result set are ranked or ordered wherein those article identifiers for articles about the Simpsons television series may be placed at the beginning of the first search result set, which is now personalized.
- the re-search provides a filter whereby only those article identifiers for articles about the Simpsons television series are returned in a personalized search result set.
- the search engine 158 can use the added query phrase(s) and/or term(s) to affect the searching methodology by expanding the input query at 310 and narrow the search to only articles that include the added query phrase(s) and/or term(s) in accordance with any query expansion technique known in the field of information retrieval.
- the user 112 a again submits an input query “animation” at 310 chosen to be personalized based on The Simpsons community.

- the search engine 158 returns the search result set to the user 112 a , wherein the search result set can be provided in The Simpsons community 400 or in a display provided by the search engine 158 .
- FIGS. 6 and 7 have been described wherein a member of a social network can personalize a search at a search engine through explicit personalization choices.
- the method depicted in FIG. 6 allows a member to personalize a search by explicitly choosing the association(s) in the social network on which the search is to be based; whereas, the method depicted in FIG. 7 allows a member to personalize a search by explicitly initiating the search within an association in the social network on which the member wishes the search to be based.
- a member can personalize a search implicitly, wherein personalization choices can be inferred from the member's gathered personalization information.
- a search can be implicitly personalized based on a member's personalization information, as obtained from the member's profile, profiles of other associated members, and/or cookies embedded with the member.
- This method begins at 810 with a user, such as user 112 a , joining a social network, such as the social network 200 (e.g., OrkutTM), by creating a user or member profile, as described earlier.
- a social network such as the social network 200 (e.g., OrkutTM)

- association information in the member profile can be used to implicitly personalize the search. For example, the user 112 a submits the input query, “animation,” and the association information in the member profile of the user 112 a indicates that he or she belongs to The Simpsons community; therefore, a search for “animation” can be conducted based on The Simpsons community.
- the association information in the member profile indicates that the user 112 a belongs to both The Simpsons community and the Computer Science community; therefore, a search for “animation” can be based on both communities to search for not only articles that discuss about The Simpsons television series but also, e.g., software relating to “The Simpsons.”
- the search engine 158 can use added query phrase(s) and/or term(s) from the based community or communities to affect the searching methodology or ranking of the search results that are returned to the user 112 a.
- membership information in the member profile or member's cookies can be used to implicitly personalize the search. For example, with the same input query, “animation,” the membership information in the member profile of the user 112 a indicates that he or she has purchased items from Amazon.com in the past; therefore, a search for “animation” can be conducted with a focus on animation-related items that can be purchased from Amazon.com.
- the membership information of the user 112 a indicates that he or she has frequently accessed The Simpsons community to read postings therein, or that other members in the social network with whom the user 112 a is associated in one way or another are members of the Simpsons community, even though the user 112 a may or may not a member of such community; nevertheless, a search for “animation” can be conducted based on The Simpsons community.
- the search engine 158 conducts a personalized search of the input query received from the search tool, using the article index stored in memory 156 or another data storage device as mentioned earlier, based on the implicit personalization choices.
- the search engine 158 first conducts a normal search of the input query and returns a first search result set of article identifiers.
- added query phrase(s), term(s), and/or preferred site(s) as obtained from the implicit personalization choices can be used to re-search the underlying articles represented by the article identifiers in the first search result set to determine the relevancy of each article to the community included in the personalization choice.
- the article identifiers in the first search result set are ranked, ordered, or filtered and returned to the user 112 a in a similar manner as described in FIG. 6 at 670 or FIG. 7 at 750 .
- the search engine 158 returns the personalized search result set to the user 112 a , wherein the search result set can be provided in the search tool within the member profile or a display provided by the search engine 158 .
- search personalization can be performed directly from the search engine 158 , i.e., outside the social network environment provided by the social network engine 168 , so long as the search engine 158 is linked with the social network engine 168 .
- the search engine 158 can provide users with a search tool that includes an option to link the search to a social network engine, such as the social network engine 168 , for search personalization. Should the user wishes to exercise such linking option, the user can be provided with the same embodiments of search personalization as described earlier.
- members of a social network can add a layer of personalization on top of the regular searches performed by a search engine.
- Search personalization can be implicit or explicit, and it can improve the searching experience a user has with a search engine.
- a first member of the Apple Computer community in a social network and a second member of the CarTalk community in the same social network may submit the same search query, “Jaguar,” to a search engine; however, through search personalization, the search engine understands that the first member may be looking for a Jaguar operating system and the second member may be looking for a Jaguar car, and it can tailor the searches for the two members accordingly.
- each personalized article index is the general article index with index scores reflecting the personalization biasing as based on personalization choices (implicit or explicit).
- search queries and/or search results can be personalized to provide users with not just recommended articles but also other members, or their member profiles, in the social network that the users can meet or with whom they want to be associated.
