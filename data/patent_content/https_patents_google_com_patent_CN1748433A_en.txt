Background technology
GPRS (GPRS) and superset thereof, the enhanced data rates global evolution (EDGE) that is used for GSM all allow to carry out exchanges data between the mobile radio subscriber equipment user.GPRS/EDGE allow Data Transmission Feature be based on grouping, intermittently with aperiodic, may be low volume data transmission and frequent and may be mass data transmission and infrequent the time, effectively utilize radio and Internet resources, it for example is less than 500 eight hytes that described low volume data passes, and the transmission of described mass data for example is that transmission is above hundreds of K byte.
Public Land Mobile Nerwork (PLMN) operator be at first with GPRS/EDGE be used for based on surplus ability, for example produce additional income between the operating period at non-peak value.Be that imagination is used the user to comprise internet browsing ability, Email, file transfer and is suitable for other application of best effort transfer of data at first.Yet, increase significantly based on the market of the business of GPRS/EDGE, and be formed in the considerable part of the Internet traffic of peak value between the operating period now.
Network control cell selecting (NCCS) and network assisted cell select (NACS) to be introduced in the GSM standard, increase the efficient of GPRS (GPRS) third generation enhanced scheme, the negative effect for the user data throughput is reselected in the solution sub-district.
In order to keep system's simplicity, do not stipulate real-time changeover program for the best effort packet data transmission on the GPRS/EDGE.In R5 and previous GPRS/EDGE standard, be by allowing mobile subscriber equipment (UE) to select simply with its mode the same in idle pulley, realize cell change.This program makes mobile UE abandon its transmitted in packets on a sub-district, and rebuilds ongoing transmission on another sub-district up hill and dale.
If the GPRS/EDGE data, services is supported and has enough capacity to support extra packet data communication services amount that then this simple cell change mechanism is very effective in the new sub-district that mobile UE reselects.Yet, frequent generation is in system operation: after mobile UE abandons the operation on the old sub-district and attempts to reselect a new sub-district, often, new sub-district do not support extra packet data communication services amount owing to not having enough capacity, so that this packet data transmission failure.Mobile UE must wait for and manage to rebuild this transfer of data subsequently.Simultaneously, mobile UE may reselect another sub-district, and this sub-district may be adapted to its requirement for packet data transmission.
In the stand-by and ready state of GPRS, travelling carriage is spontaneously carried out cell selecting by the signal strength signal intensity that monitors the neighbor cell of regulation in broadcast allocation (BA) tabulation, and this broadcast allocation (BA) tabulation is on the PBCCH or do not having to broadcast on BCCH under the situation of PBCCH.In packet transfer mode operating period, UE monitors that BA tabulation goes up the cell carrier that service is provided and all neighbor cell carrier waves of indicating.One after the other make received signal strength measurement designator (RSSI) in each TMDA frame on bcch carrier.
Reselecting decision process, to use received signal level mean value (RLA_P), this received signal level mean value be as the Continuous Observation mean value calculation of the sampling of gathering in during 5 seconds, and safeguard this mean value for each bcch carrier.Distribute as far as possible equably in the computing interval and to be assigned to the sampling of each carrier wave.For an effective RLA_P, need 5 received signal levels to measure sampling at least.
Several standards are used to the GPRS sub-district and reselect.Path loss criterion parameter C1 represents to be used for the minimum-signal level that the sub-district of GPRS is reselected.C1 is based on the RLA_P value of correspondence, and the link budget calculating carried out based on the supposition of the path loss and the RSSI of the relevant sub-district that service is being provided of expression.When C1 is 0dBM and when satisfying other requirements, portable terminal is reselected.Cell ranking criteria parameters C 32 is used for selecting the sub-district among having the sub-district of equal priority.For the sub-district that service is provided, C32 equals C1.For each neighbor cell, C32 equals to use the revised C1 of Cell Broadcast CB parameter.The signal level thresholds canonical parameter C31 that is used for classification cell structure (HCS) is used to the classification GPRS of assess prioritized.
Travelling carriage upgrades RLA_P, and for sampling to determine C1, C31 and C32 with each or every the new collection of a non-service cell (neighbor cell) in the sub-district that service is provided, whichsoever bigger.If, then carry out the sub-district and reselect if this is providing the path loss criterion parameter C1 of the sub-district of service to be lower than zero and a suitable non-service cell (referring to 3GPP TS03.22) is confirmed as being better than the sub-district that this is providing service.In general, best cell is the peaked sub-district with C32.In the time of the assessment best cell, from the C32 value of neighbor cell, deduct hysteresis parameter values.Hysteresis parameter values is to broadcast on the PBCCH of the sub-district that service is provided.Reselect for the sub-district that takes place in 15 seconds that formerly reselect, the lagged value of RSSI equals 5dB.And if do not navigate to suitable sub-district in 10 seconds, the cell selecting algorithm would then be carried out.
During packet data exchanged, the suburb and/or the urban environment in mobile UE static state or semi-static basically usually can be every 15 to 45 seconds, among 3 to 5 sub-districts, reselect continuously, whenever reselecting, all cause to rebulid packet data transmission.Yet the frequent high-frequency sub-district that occurs is reselected and may be influenced the user data throughput unfriendly.
In case thought over following embodiment part and accompanying drawing as described below, the each side of disclosure, feature and advantage will become more fully clear directly perceived for those skilled in the art.
Embodiment
In Fig. 1, reselect according to the spontaneous sub-district of for example during packet data exchanged, carrying out, be arranged in sub-district A120 at first and attempt based on the known spontaneous agreement of reselecting to the travelling carriage 110 that sub-district B130 moves, for example when the path loss criterion C1 of sub-district A is lower than 0dBm, reselect to sub-district B.If sub-district B can not support this packet data exchanged, if then another sub-district can with or this travelling carriage attempt reselecting to sub-district B after a while, this travelling carriage must be reselected to another sub-district, for example reselects to sub-district C.
In the processing chart 200 in Fig. 2, according to a kind of operator scheme, at piece 210 places, travelling carriage sent one to network and reselects communication information before reselecting.This is reselected communication information and indicates this to reselect probably to take place in the near future, and perhaps indication is reselected and is about to take place.
In one embodiment, this travelling carriage structure comprises reselects fallout predictor, and this is reselected predictor predicts and when reselects probably.In the exemplary implementation in Fig. 3, this reselects fallout predictor 302 at input 304 places, receives the C1 parameter value from measurement module 310 there, and this C1 parameter value is based on that the rssi measurement result calculates.The C1 parameter value is illustrative herein, also can alternatively use other standards.
Reselecting fallout predictor comprises and is used to indicate the output of when reselecting probably 306.For example in one embodiment, travelling carriage carries out set based on the output of reselecting fallout predictor to " reselecting " in the uplink measurement report that sends to network position, so that notify imminent reselecting to network.The exemplary fallout predictor of reselecting also comprises second output 308, is used for to virtual bearer (VB), for example other module indication on virtual streaming bearer circuit (VSB) or the travelling carriage is reselected and is about to take place.Output 306 and 308 can alternately be provided, and this two outputs perhaps are provided simultaneously.
In Fig. 3, reselecting is when needs are reselected, and order carries out in response to reselecting by the Executive Module 320 of reselecting on the travelling carriage.Reselect order and may cause that this is with more detailed discussion hereinafter by judgement at network or travelling carriage place.
In one embodiment, in general, reselect and be based on the standard RC of reselecting and predict, this is reselected standard RC and calculates according to the set of many curves of the approximate corresponding C1 set of parameter values of match and based on the coefficient of this curve.In the exemplary embodiment, this parabola approximation is in the set of a plurality of yi=C1 parameter values, these a plurality of y

Reselecting fallout predictor can operation continuously during connecting.When the condition of reselecting whenever prediction is satisfied, then upgrade T
rWhen no longer satisfying when reselecting condition, will predict no longer that the sub-district reselects.That submit on November 18th, 2002, the name be called " MethodAnd Apparatus for Predicting a Cell Change " the 60/427th, discussed these and other aspect of reselecting prediction in No. 190 U.S. Provisional Patent Application more fully, its disclosure is all introduced for your guidance at this.
In other embodiment of the present invention or implementation, can otherwise or scheme be predicted, determine or the assessment sub-district is reselected.In addition, in some applications, when imminent the reselecting that needn't calculate to a nicety takes place, and as long as by travelling carriage to be enough to should being that the spontaneous work of reselecting processing that travelling carriage is carried out produces and interferes or the grace time of influence is informed to network.
In case network receives from travelling carriage and is about to take place the indication that the sub-district is reselected, then this network can be taked several different actions.Portable terminal does not have benefit to a specific cell if this network is found order, if all sub-districts for example in the BA of the portable terminal tabulation all have equal capability for if portable terminal provides service or it sub-district that will be reselected not to be had sufficient understanding, then this network may select to allow portable terminal to realize that spontaneously the sub-district reselects.
In some implementation, in response to reselecting of receiving from travelling carriage, this network does not send communication information to this travelling carriage.In fact, in certain specific time interval that sends to network after reselecting communication information, do not receive answer, then spontaneously reselect if this travelling carriage may be programmed to it.This scheme has reduced the network signal load.Yet alternatively, this network also can be ratified spontaneous reselecting by send an affirmative communication to travelling carriage.
In Fig. 2, at piece 220 places, in certain embodiments, mobile radio communication apparatus is in response to the communication information of reselecting that is sent by travelling carriage, and receives the communication information with the instruction reselected from network.If this network is recognized as the capacity situation in one or more sub-districts of reselecting the candidate, then this network can be by wishing this network the cell index of the sub-district that portable terminal is reselected sends to this travelling carriage, is directed to this specific cell with this travelling carriage.If this network recognizes that travelling carriage is positioned at or near edge, route district (RA), and the one or more sub-districts that may be reselected are arranged in the route district different with the route district that serves this portable terminal, and then this network can be directed to this travelling carriage the specific cell among current or other expectations RA.
Allow network control or auxiliaryly reselect the signaling traffic load amount that has reduced network internal in general, and reduced interruption times in the transfer of data during the packet data exchanged, comprise and reduce the number of times that SGSN redistributes.
If network is recognized portable terminal and may be moved away the coverage of this data, services, for example GPRS is not supported in the one or more sub-districts that may be reselected, then this network can provide the communication information that this data, services must be terminated, thereby provide certain to prenotice, so that travelling carriage can stop this exchanges data at leisure.The premature termination notice also comes in handy for the application that sends or receive data in packet data exchanged.In other embodiments, when network can't order portable terminal to reselect the sub-district of the data, services that continuation can be provided, network did not provide any communication information to travelling carriage.
Fig. 6 is the example message 600 that is used for the information of reselecting is sent to from travelling carriage network.In the above-mentioned exemplary embodiment that discusses, this message is measurement message, but in other embodiments, this information can be embedded in any other the wireless communications uplink message.In one embodiment, this exemplary message comprises reselects generation position 610 soon, and this position can be set or not be set, and is about to generation so that indication is reselected.In other embodiments, except reselecting the position or replace reselecting the position, this message also comprises the information that when takes place about reselecting, and for example the periods that obtain by one group of a plurality of positions 620 coding, its existence can be indicated and soon be reselected.In other embodiments, travelling carriage shows to network which sub-district is this portable terminal intention reselect to.This message can also comprise the position that is used to transmit this information.
In some implementation, desirable is the specific spontaneous pattern of reselecting on the travelling carriage of stopping using, and for example, desirable may be to make the sub-district class parameter on the mobile radio communication apparatus invalid.If the exemplary fallout predictor of reselecting realizes in the GSM travelling carriage, then desirable may be that to make C32 reselect standard invalid.
In the exemplary process chart of Fig. 7, at piece 710 places, travelling carriage shows to network whether it supports control/auxiliary (NCARM) pattern of reselecting to operate, and for example whether this travelling carriage can be carried out and reselect prediction.When for example joining for the first time on the PLMN, perhaps during each RAU, perhaps when each data session at the beginning, promptly when setting up the PDP environment, this information is sent to network from travelling carriage.If provide when the RAU from the indication of travelling carriage, all provide it when then portable terminal is carried out RAU at every turn.If the indication from portable terminal is to provide when data session at the beginning, then portable terminal provides this indication whenever setting up when PDP environment and reconstruction have the PDP environment now.This network will all keep this information during this portable terminal is connected to this network whole.
In Fig. 7, at piece 720 places, travelling carriage is supported communication information, is received from network and reselect the control communication information in response to send network control/auxiliary pattern of reselecting to network.In general, travelling carriage is reselected based on the control communication information execution of reselecting that comes automatic network.
In one embodiment, this network sends communication information, reselecting in the travelling carriage of stopping using based on neighbor cell signal intensity to travelling carriage.For example in gsm communication system, network sends lag parameter to travelling carriage, so that stop using the C32 canonical parameter that is used to reselect.The purpose of the C32 canonical parameter of stopping using is the RF state that is restricted on the sub-district that service is provided of strictly sub-district being reselected, this can be by above-mentioned reselecting predictor module or predicting and reselect by the fallout predictor of reselecting that some substitutes of discussing, and these substitute reselects fallout predictor and depend on the current area state and predict and reselect.
In Fig. 7, at piece 730 places, if having PBCCH in the sub-district that service is provided, then this portable terminal is reselected fallout predictor with use and is determined when cell change takes place in expection, shown in piece 740.Do not have in the sub-district that service is provided under the situation of PBCCH, then network provides the C1 that is different from 0dB level threshold value for travelling carriage, and it is the C1 value of acquiescence.If provide alternative threshold value at piece 750 place's networks, then portable terminal uses and to reselect fallout predictor and determine when and will reselect, shown in piece 760.Otherwise at piece 770 places, if PBCCH does not exist, and network do not send a new C1 threshold value, and then travelling carriage uses warnings in 5 seconds of acquiescence to determine to satisfy 0dBm when reselecting after reselecting threshold condition.
Although set up its ownership and make those skilled in the art can make and use mode of the present invention with the inventor, present disclosure and the current scheme that is considered to its best mode have been described, yet it is intelligible and it should be apparent that, there are many schemes that are equal to mutually with disclosed exemplary embodiment herein, and can under situation about not departing from the scope of the present invention with spirit, make countless improvement and change to it, it should not limited by exemplary embodiment, and should be limited by appended claims.
