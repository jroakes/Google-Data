- FIGS. 3A and 3B are flowcharts of exemplary processing for presenting information regarding a document related to a search query according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- Processing may begin with a user providing a search term (or a group of search terms) as a search query for searching a document repository.
- the document repository includes documents available from the Internet and/or a database and the vehicle for searching this repository is a search engine, such as search engine 125 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the user may provide the search query via web browser software on a client, such as client 110 ( FIG. 1 ).

- documents e.g., books, magazines, newspapers, articles, catalogs, etc.
- One such technique might include identifying documents that contain the search term or synonyms of the search term.
- a technique might include identifying documents that contain the search terms as a phrase, that contain the search terms but not necessarily together, or that contain less than all of the search terms. Yet other techniques are known to those skilled in the art.
- the documents may be scored in some manner (act 315 ).
- the score for a document may be based on an information retrieval (IR) score.
- IR information retrieval
- Several techniques exist for generating an IR score For example, an IR score for a document may be generated based on the number of occurrences of the search terms in the document text, where the search terms occur within the document (e.g., title, content, footer, header, etc.), or characteristics of occurrences of the search terms (e.g., font, size, color, etc.).
- Yet other techniques are known to those skilled in the art.
- Search results may be formed based on the documents and their optional scores and presented to the user (act 320 ).
- the search results may include information associated with the documents, such as links to the documents, that may optionally be sorted based on the document scores.
- the search results may be provided as a HTML document, similar to search results provided by conventional search engines.
- the search results may be provided according to another format agreed upon by the search engine and the client (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML)).
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary diagram of a user interface for presenting search results according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. Assume that a user provided a search query that included the search term “memory” and a search was performed based on the search query to identify a set of documents related to the search query.
- a search result 410 may include a document title 412 , author information 414 , an excerpt 416 from the document, an address 418 associated with the document, links 420 to other relevant excerpts in the document, and an image 422 associated with the document.

- Author information 414 may include the name(s) of the author(s) of the document.
- Excerpt 416 may include a portion of the document that includes a search term of the search query. Optionally, occurrences of the search term may be visually distinguished (e.g., highlighted) in the portion of the document.
- Excerpt 416 may also include a page number associated with the excerpt. In one implementation, selection of the page number (or excerpt 416 ) may result in presentation of detailed information, possibly in the form of an excerpt page (described below), associated with the document.

- the previous page and next page elements may indicate in some manner (e.g., by shading, color, or otherwise) whether a user is permitted to select a previous or next page. For example, the user may not be permitted to select a previous page when excerpt 530 corresponds to the first page of the index or select a next page when excerpt 530 corresponds to the last page of the index.
- a next or previous page element associated with link 569 may indicate a user's desire to be presented with a next or previous page in the document.
- a next or previous page in the document may be presented to the user (act 330 ).
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may provide information regarding documents in a manner that is useful to the users.
