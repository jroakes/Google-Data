Definitions
- Embodiments of the present invention relate to estimating vehicle trajectories, specifically optimizing the pose of a vehicle to reduce drift.
- Laser range-finders have become standard equipment in mobile robotics, where they are used for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) tasks, both for computing a local robot trajectory (i.e., the incremental movement of the robot and the environment geometry) and for estimating loop-closing constraints.
- SLAM simultaneous localization and mapping
- Scan matching is typically performed between pairs of scans, using variants of the original iterative closest point (ICP) method, which aligns scan points to scan points or scan points to line segments.
- ICP iterative closest point
- Scan point to scan point alignment is further described in, for example, F. Lu and E. Milios, “Robot pose estimation in unknown environments by matching 2d range scans,” Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems, 18:249-275, 1997, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- Scan point to line segment alignment is further described in, for example, I. Cox, “Blanche: an experiment in guidance and navigation of an autonomous robot vehicle,” IEEE Trans. on Robotics and Automation, 7(2): 193-204, 1991, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- Standard lasers can often have poor resolution (on the order of 1 degree per laser reading), which causes distant surfaces to be sparsely sampled.
- the laser scans also contain outliers and noise, due to surface reflectance and to moving objects in the environment. Because it is difficult to handle these issues robustly using pairs of scans at a time, standard scan matching algorithms can produce errors that cause the estimated pose to deviate significantly from the true trajectory. In the absence of absolute pose information in the form of GPS or building maps, these errors can grow arbitrarily large.
- SLAM based on occupancy grid maps have used an occupancy grid map representation to align scans.
- SLAM based on occupancy grid maps is further described in, for example, S. Thrun, D. Fox, and W. Burgard, “A probabilistic approach to concurrent mapping and localization for mobile robots,” Machine Learning, 31, 1998, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- Occupancy grid maps represent environments by fine-grained, metric grids of binary variables that encode whether the corresponding cells are free or occupied. Occupancy grids make the definition of Monte Carlo sampling algorithms fairly straightforward and many such algorithms have been developed.
- Monte Carlo algorithms maintain multiple discrete alignment hypotheses using particles to increase the robustness of the SLAM algorithms with regards to matching errors (Monte Carlo methods have also been successfully used in conjunction with scan matching, but at the cost of increased implementation complexity).
- the occupancy grid map representation is inherently discrete and does not support the estimation of local gradients, which prevents the robot pose from being determined locally with high precision.
- a large number of particles and diverse sampling schemes need to be employed to ensure that the correct trajectory has been sampled.
- the locally imprecise poses can accumulate to cause large drift over time.
- Additional alternative approaches to reduce drift errors include utilizing a known map of the environment and manual pose corrections by an operator. Each of these requires additional data, which may not be available.
- the capability to calculate the pose of a vehicle and generate a map while minimizing drift is provided.
- the scan matching problems described above may be addressed by efficiently aligning multiple scans at the same time.
- the scan area is split into grid cells, and the grid resolution is adjusted during alignment.
- a coarse grid is used at the start of the optimization, when the scans are not very well aligned, to ensure that the neighborhood of each cell is big enough to contain data points from different scans.
- the grid resolution is iteratively increased such that the latent map captures the details of the underlying scene.
- such alignment is performed as follows.
- An area covered by a plurality of laser scans is split into a first set of grid cells.
- a first template surface representation also referred to herein as a latent map, for each grid cell in the first set of grid cells is estimated using original poses determined for the plurality of laser scans.
- the original poses may be computed from roughly-aligned scans or from, for example, wheel encoder information.
- the first template surface representation comprises a set of piecewise linear functions referred to herein as surfels over a spatial grid at a predefined resolution.
- each laser scan in the plurality of laser scans is aligned to the first template surface representation to provide an updated pose for each scan in the plurality of laser scans.
- the area covered by the plurality of laser scans is then split into a second set of grid cells.
- Each cell in the second set of grid cells may be smaller than the cells in the first set of grid cells, such that the surfels of the spatial grid have a higher resolution than in the first template surface representation.
- a second template surface representation for each grid cell in the second set of grid cells is estimated using the updated pose for each scan in the plurality of laser scans. This process of aligning the plurality of laser scans to the template surface can be repeated multiple times until convergence, and the resolution of the template surface is gradually increased to match the improved scan registration.

- FIG. 1 is an illustration showing how multiple scans of an unknown surface may be obtained according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- a robot 102 is equipped with a horizontal laser scanner which explores the scene, whose geometry is denoted as M. M will be referred to as the latent map of the scene, as it is not provided beforehand to robot 102 .
- M will be referred to as the latent map of the scene, as it is not provided beforehand to robot 102 .
- two-dimensional scanning will be referred to herein, one of skill in the art will recognize that the invention is also applicable to three-dimensional scanning and surface map generation.
- robot 102 may be equipped with three-dimensional sensors, and the scene explored may be the entire three-dimensional volume of space surrounding robot 102 .
- the robot observations comprise a set of range scans at n poses T i where 1 ⁇ i ⁇ n.
- scan S 1 is obtained when robot 102 is at pose T 1 .
- scan Si is obtained when robot 102 is at pose Ti.
- Each pose T i is a rigid 2D transform relating a robot coordinate system ⁇ i to a latent map coordinate system ⁇ .
- Each scan S i contains n i data points s ij where 1 ⁇ j ⁇ n i .
- the Cartesian coordinates of each data point s ij in the local coordinate system ⁇ i is denoted as s ij .
- Available rough information about the surface normal for each data point s ij is denoted as n u .
- the goal is to estimate the poses ⁇ T i ⁇ from the input range scans ⁇ S i ⁇ .
- the unknown map M is treated as a hidden variable and optimized together with the poses ⁇ T i ⁇ .
- incorporating M into the optimization process enables the multiple scan alignment problem to be handled in a more robust and efficient way.
- the multiple scan alignment problem is formulated as finding the most likely global scan poses ⁇ T i ⁇ * and the most likely latent map M* which maximize the posterior probability:
- a standard way to define the data likelihood term is to consider the squared distance from a point to the surfel corresponding to its cell location. A slightly different formulation is chosen here, which forces the surfels associated with neighboring cells to be consistent with each other.
- the set N(c k ) of each cell c k is defined as the 3 ⁇ 3 subgrid centered at c k . Then, the data likelihood term for each point is the sum of squared distances from this point to its neighboring surfels:
- ⁇ k is the standard deviation for the surfel at cell c k . Note that different standard deviations are allowed for different cells, in order to be able to distinguish between objects such as walls, bushes, and moving objects.
- the optimal values of ⁇ k are determined through optimization of the objective function.
- the standard deviation ⁇ k of each cell should be close to the standard deviation value ⁇ 0 , which is the expected accuracy of the laser scanner.
- ⁇ 0 may be set to 0.02 meters.
- map prior term may be defined as:
- ⁇ stands for the Frobenius matrix norm.
- ⁇ T controls the strength of the pose prior term
- the optimization strategy according to an embodiment of the invention is to alternate between optimizing the latent map M and optimizing the scan poses ⁇ T i ⁇ .
- FIGS. 2 a - 2 d illustrate this concept.
- FIGS. 2 a - 2 d illustrate the alignment of 20 exemplary scans simultaneously according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 a represents an initial status
- FIG. 2 b represents a first iteration
- FIG. 2 c represents a third iteration
- FIG. 2 d represents a tenth iteration.
- 200 a , 200 b , 200 c , and 200 d show the poses of the scans for each selected iteration, while 210 a , 210 b , 210 c , and 210 d show the respective latent maps generated from the scan poses for each selected iteration.
- the data points are first fixed to optimize the latent map M. This can be formulated as computing:
- each cell can be optimized independently.
- the optimal values of p and n are independent of ⁇ k and can be optimized first.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a pose estimation setup for each of a simple cell (containing one surfel) and an advanced cell (containing two or more surfels with different normals).
- the optimization problem described in Eq. 11 is a line fitting problem which can be solved by principal component analysis (PCA) (see FIG. 3( a )).
- PCA principal component analysis
- the optimal value of p is given as the barycenter of the data points:
- n The optimal value of n is found by computing the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix:
- ⁇ k ⁇ s ij ⁇ ⁇ N ⁇ ( c k ) ⁇ ( ( s ij ⁇ - p k * ) T ⁇ n k * ) 2 .
- ⁇ * k arg ⁇ ⁇ min ⁇ k ⁇ ( ⁇ k ⁇ k 2 + ⁇ M ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ k - ⁇ 0 ⁇ ) ( 15 )
- ⁇ * k can be computed in the closed form as:
- ⁇ k * max ⁇ ( ⁇ 0 , ( 2 ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ M ) 1 3 ) . ( 16 )
- each cell only contains one surfel has been considered.
- the extension to handle advanced cells is also an aspect of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 3( b ), it is tested whether the data points contained within a given cell can be divided into two groups of points with consistent normal directions. If so, a surfel is generated from each group of data points by applying the procedure described above.
- Dividing a set of normal vectors into two groups of consistent normal vectors is a standard classification problem.
- a greedy algorithm is used which works well in practice.
- the grid resolution is adjusted during alignment.
- a coarse grid is used when the optimization starts to ensure that the neighborhood of each cell is big enough to contain data points from different scans.
- the grid resolution is iteratively increased such that the latent map captures the details of the underlying scene.
- f pose is of the form of non-linear least squares which can be optimized very efficiently using the Gauss-Newton method.
- each rotation R i is parameterized as:
- R i ⁇ ( ⁇ i ) ( cos ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ i - sin ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ i sin ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ i cos ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ i )
- the first order approximation of R i at current angle ⁇ i c is given by:
- Eq. 18 is substituted into Eq. 17 and f pose is optimized to find the optimal values of ⁇ i , t i at the next step.
- f pose is quadratic in the unknowns and can be optimized by solving a linear system.
- the multiple scan alignment method can be applied to estimate the trajectory of a moving robot within an environment.
- the present embodiment will be described for an off-line pose estimation where all the laser scans are previously known.
- the multiple scan alignment method described herein can be easily adapted for on-line pose estimation.
- the scan alignment method may be performed in real-time or faster to allow accurate pose estimation while the robot is in motion.
- the simplest strategy is to take all the available scans as input to the multiple scan alignment algorithm. However, this strategy would fail if the size of the trajectory is big, because a good initial position is not known. Instead, the poses are estimated in a multi-grid fashion, improving scan poses gradually by performing scan alignment at different levels. The poses computed at a current level can then be input to the pose estimation at the next level.
- FIGS. 4 a and 4 b illustrate a multi-resolution pose estimation framework according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 a illustrates local alignment and a latent map generated from varying numbers of laser scans.
- FIG. 4 b illustrates global alignment and the latent map generated from the varying number of laser scans.
- FIG. 4 a shows a scan level 410 that represents a scan level of 14182 scans and a scan level 412 that represents a scan level of 29 scans.
- FIG. 4 b shows a scan level 414 that represents a scan level of 29 scans and a scan level 416 that represents a scan level of 14182 scans.
- FIGS. 4 a and 4 b show the result of a local alignment method according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- Scan levels 414 and 416 show the result of a global alignment method according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- the pose estimation algorithm proceeds in two phases: a local alignment phase and a global alignment phase.
- each level of the hierarchy includes a set of scans.
- the scans at the first level are the input scans.
- the scans at the current level are subdivided into overlapping groups, and the multiple scan alignment method is applied to the scans contained in each group.
- the scans at the next level are taken as the latent maps of each group.
- the group size is set to be 10
- the overlap size between adjacent groups is set to be 4. This process is iterated until the number of scans at the current level is less than 10.
- the relative poses between T k+1 and T k is defined as the average of k T i ⁇ k+1 T i ⁇ 1 over all the shared scans. This averaged pose is also normalized such that it is a rigid transform.
- the method starts from the highest level and simultaneously optimizes all the scans contained within each level.
- FIGS. 4 a and 4 b Another example of the pose estimation is shown in FIGS. 4 a and 4 b .
- 439 groups were created at the second level and 29 groups were created at the third level.
- FIG. 4 a the relative poses between neighboring scans are improved proceeding from the first level (14182 scans) to the third level (29 scans).
- FIG. 4 b shows that the poses of all scans are made consistent in the global alignment phase.
- FIGS. 5 a - 5 d are illustrations of the results of a multiple scan alignment-based pose estimation method according to an embodiment of the present invention on real-world indoor data sets.
- Each of FIGS. 5 a - 5 d shows the alignment of the results with the floor plans (ground truths) of various buildings.
- the aligned scans are superposed over the floor plans of the buildings, which were not available to the pose estimation algorithm at runtime.
- 5 a - 5 d show the latent maps returned by the method.
- the local accuracy measure a 1 was defined as the averaged distance from the data points to the latent map. From the inventors' experiments, the inventors found that a l ranged from 2 cm to 4 cm, which is very close to the accuracy of the laser scanner used.
- the global accuracy a g was defined in terms of the floor plan associated with each data set. All the scans in the optimized poses were regarded as a single scan and aligned with the map. The global accuracy was defined as the averaged distance between the synthesized scan and the map in their overlapping regions. For the examples tested by the inventors, the global drift was less than 20 cm.
- the first data set is shown in FIG. 5 a .
- this data set contains mostly flat walls and the loops in the trajectory are relatively small, the accuracy of the result is fairly high. Note that this data set contained a large number of moving people, which is accounted for by the method used.
- the second data set is a first floor of a museum. (See FIG. 5 b .)
- the challenge of this data set was that a portion of the environment contained many small panels which were surrounded by moving people. As can be seen, the latent map is not well defined in these areas. However, the results still returned decent pose.
- the third data set is the second floor of the museum. (See FIG. 5 c .) In this data set, there was a large loop in the trajectory. The method used successfully closed this loop.
- FIG. 5 d illustrates similar results received for a fourth dataset, where the shape of the building is mostly curved.
- FIGS. 6 a - 6 c show an application of the algorithm to an outdoor example.
- the pose induced from the wheel sensor has salient global drift.
- the poses improved after performing one step of local alignment according to an embodiment of the present invention Regardless of whether the wheel prior term was used as the initial pose, or whether the initial pose relied upon the static pose prior term, they each led to a very similar result, shown in FIG. 6 c —both the wheel prior pose and the static pose prior term converge to the same final pose after completing the pose estimation procedure according to an embodiment of the present invention. Even in this case, both the local accuracy and global accuracy of the poses estimated by a method of the present invention is fairly high.
- the method was also tested by the inventors on an outdoor data set where a wheel sensor of the robot generated a poor result.
- the inventors also tested the method on the data set from the prior with which the robot is fixed.
- the pose estimation algorithm significantly improved the poses only after the first level.
- the final poses in both cases were the same and were matched with a snapshot of the underlying scene.
- the global underlying maps generated by methods according to embodiments of the present invention are quite accurate.
- the inventors found that in many cases, the walls can be identified in the maps generated. This observation also shows that the methodology disclosed herein is quite accurate from another perspective. Since the underlying maps include a set of points with oriented normals, they can be used in many applications, such as floor plan reconstruction.
- the pose estimation according to the present invention is very efficient.
- a single run of the multiple alignment method on 10-20 scans took about 0.03 s on a computer with a 2.4 GHz CPU.
- the total processing time only took about 1 ⁇ 3 of the time that was spent on acquiring these data sets.
- the pose estimation method according to an embodiment of the present invention was compared with a method based on aligning adjacent scans using pair-wise registration.
- the standard ICP algorithm was employed with point-to-plane distance metrics.
- FIGS. 7 a and 7 b illustrate the comparison between the two methods.
- FIG. 7 a illustrates an alignment 700 a that represents the pair-wise alignment 702 a compared with ground truth 704 a
- FIG. 7 b illustrates an alignment 700 b that represents pose estimation 702 b according to an embodiment of the present invention compared with ground truth 704 b .
- the pose estimation method according to an embodiment of the present invention produced less drift than registering adjacent scans.
- the pose estimation according to an embodiment of the present invention was found to be 2-3 times taster than the ICP algorithm. In this comparison, local alignment only at the first level was run.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an exemplary client device 800 in which embodiments can be implemented.

- the methods described by FIGS. 1-7 may be implemented using grid generator 810 , template surface estimator 820 , and laser scan aligner 830 , according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- Device 800 can be any type of client device.
- a client device can include, but is not limited to, a personal computer, mobile device such as a mobile phone, workstation, embedded system, game console, television, set-top box, or any other computing device that can support image viewing or image retrieval.
- a client device includes, but is not limited to, a device having a processor and memory for executing and storing instructions.
- Such a client device may include software, firmware, and hardware or some combination thereof.
- the software may include one or more applications and an operating system.
- the hardware can include, but is not limited to, a processor, memory (e.g., memory 840 ) and user interface display (e.g., display 850 ).
- An optional input device such as a mouse or other pointing device, may be used.
- the scans used in the alignment may be obtained from any suitable measurement device, for example and without limitation, a horizontal two-dimensional laser, a three-dimensional laser, or even sonar.
- grid generator 810 , template surface estimator 820 , laser scan aligner 830 , memory 840 , and display 850 may be communicatively coupled to one another via, for example, an internal bus of device 800 .
- an internal bus of device 800 Although only grid generator 810 , template surface estimator 820 , laser scan aligner 830 , memory 840 , and display 850 are shown, it would be apparent to a person skilled in the art that device 800 may include additional components, modules, and/or sub-components as necessary.
- memory 840 is used to store information accessible by grid generator 810 , template surface estimator 820 , laser scan aligner 830 .
- Information stored in memory 840 may include, but is not limited to, laser scan information such as, for example, wheel encoder information.
- Memory 840 may be any type of recording medium coupled to an integrated circuit that controls access to the recording medium.
- the recording medium can be, for example and without limitation, a semiconductor memory, a hard disk, or other similar type of memory or storage device.
- grid generator 810 , template surface estimator 820 , and laser scan aligner 830 may be configured to estimate laser scan poses in a multi-grid fashion, as described above.
- the scan poses are received at grid generator 810 initially and improved gradually by performing scan alignment at different levels using template surface estimator 820 and laser scan aligner 830 . For example, the poses computed at a current level can then be input to the pose estimation at the next level.
- grid generator 810 may be configured to split an area covered by a plurality of laser scans into a first set of grid cells.
- the first set of grid cells generated by grid generator 810 has an initial resolution that will gradually increase to match the improved scan registration using the pose estimation algorithm, as discussed above.
- grid generator 810 may be configured to continue splitting the area covered by the plurality of laser scans into further sets of grid cells as necessary.
- a first template surface representation, also referred to herein as a latent map, for each grid cell generated by grid generator 810 is estimated by template surface estimator 820 according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- Template surface estimate 820 is configured to use original poses determined for the plurality of laser scans according to an embodiment of the present invention. The original poses may be computed from roughly-aligned scans or from, for example, wheel encoder information.
- the first template surface representation is represented as a set of piecewise linear functions referred to herein as surfels over a spatial grid at a predefined resolution.
- laser scan aligner 830 is configured to align each laser scan to the first template surface representation estimated by template surface estimator 820 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Further, laser scan aligner is configured to provide an updated pose for each scan in the plurality of laser scans according to an embodiment of the present invention. The area covered by the plurality of laser scans is then split into a second set of grid cells. Each cell in the second set of grid cells may be smaller than the cells in the first set of grid cells, such that the surfels of the spatial grid have a higher resolution than in the first template surface representation.
- Template surface estimator 820 is further configured to estimate a second template surface representation for each grid cell in the second set of grid cells using the scan poses updated by laser scan aligner 830 according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- grid generator 810 , template surface estimator 820 , and laser scan aligner 830 are configured to repeat the process of aligning the plurality of laser scans to the template surface multiple times until convergence. The resolution of the template surface is thereby gradually increased to match the improved scan registration.
- the estimated template surface representation may then be displayed by template surface estimator 820 to display 850 as a map of the area covered by the plurality of laser scans according to an embodiment of the present invention. Such a map may be superimposed over a floor plan of the area according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- the methodology disclosed herein explicitly reconstructs a latent map, and in the process can utilize data from a much larger number of scans.
- the latent map combines the strengths of implicit and explicit surface representations, such as fast point correspondence queries and high approximation power.
- the method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes an implicit bias towards straight-line surfaces, which are ubiquitous in man-made environments.
- the latent map is also able to deal implicitly with outliers such as moving objects, because each surfel in the latent map grid maintains an estimate of how well it approximates the readings in its corresponding grid cell, and is weighted accordingly when computing the scan alignment.
- the methods according to the present invention are very efficient. The reason for this is that they capture what is essentially a quadratic number of alignment constraints between all scan pairs using a linear number of constraints between each scan and the template surface. This allows the latent map to maintain implicit long-range relationships (e.g., between scan 1 and scan 100), which minimizes pose drift without incurring quadratic cost.
- methods according to embodiments of the present invention are at least as fast as a pairwise scan-matching method, applied on successive pairs of scans.
- the latent map can be very efficiently encoded in memory using an octree, which makes it applicable to both 2D and 3D scan alignment problems.
- the scan alignment method according to an embodiment of the present invention is superior to standard scan alignment methods in several ways.
- Two key issues in aligning partially overlapped scans are how to define accurate distance fields from sparse samples and how to determine the overlapping region. These two issues are resolved automatically since the scans are only aligned with the latent map, which always contains the scans and has a well defined distance field.
- the complexity of standard methods is quadratic since they minimize the distances between all pairs of scans. In contrast, the complexity of the method is linear since all the scans are aligned with the latent map.
- the method performs loop closing implicitly. More precisely, by introducing a latent map, scans that are far from each other in time but are close to each other in space are aligned in terms of this latent map. Moreover, it is not necessary to determine when and where to close the loop, because it is determined automatically by the algorithm.
- the laser scans should contain enough geometry from static objects so that poses can be estimated by aligning laser scans. This may be difficult when the robot is surrounded by moving people or the robot is moving in open fields.
Abstract
Description
Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probability is expanded as follows:
Assuming the priors on the latent map M and the scan poses {Ti} are independent, and taking the logarithm of the objective produces:
The right hand side of the objective function contains three terms: the data likelihood term, the map prior term, and the pose prior term. Their detailed expressions are presented as follows.
A. Data Term
d(x,c k)=(x p k)T n k.
where σk is the standard deviation for the surfel at cell ck. Note that different standard deviations are allowed for different cells, in order to be able to distinguish between objects such as walls, bushes, and moving objects. The optimal values of σk are determined through optimization of the objective function.
Here the weight λM controls the importance of the map prior term. In the exemplary embodiment described herein, λM=1000.
B. Pose Prior Term
R i+1 =R i ·
where R and t represent the rotation and translation components, respectively, of the corresponding rigid 2D transformations.
Then the latent map is fixed and the scan poses are optimized such that the data points are optimally aligned with the latent map:
The convergence rate of alternating optimization is linear. In an experimental setting, 10-30 iterations were found sufficient for convergence.
A. Latent Map Optimization
Switching the indices, fmap can be rewritten as:
Multiplying both sides of Eq. 13 by n*T provides:
Thus, the optimal value of σk is found at:
σ*k can be computed in the closed form as:
fpose is of the form of non-linear least squares which can be optimized very efficiently using the Gauss-Newton method.
Under this parameterization, the first order approximation of Ri at current angle θi c is given by:
T i =T k ·T k,i ,T i =T k+1 ·T k+1,i (19)
where Tk,i and Tk+1,i are the optimal relative poses obtained from multiple scan alignments.
T k+1 =T k·k T i·k+1 T i −1 (20)
T i =T k·k T i. (21)
Once again, the average operation is applied if a child scan is shared by two parent scans.
