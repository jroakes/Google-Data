Description
Technical field
The present invention relates to advertisement, especially relate to content-targeted advertisement is improved.
Background technology
Use traditional media well-known such as the advertisement of TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine.Regrettably, even when having used demographic achievement in research and various media typical audience have been carried out fully reasonably hypothesis, advertiser will appreciate that also its advertising budget has many wasting.In addition, it is also very difficult to discern and reduce this waste.
Recently, on interactive more media, advertise and catch on.For example, owing to use the number of the Internet rapidly to increase, the potential strong mode that advertiser media that provides by the Internet and service has been provided advertise.
Advertiser has formulated several strategies, attempts to make the value maximization of this advertisement.In a kind of strategy, advertiser uses popular presentation mode or device, the channel that provides interactive media or service (being called " website " in instructions) conduct and numerous audients to link up with being without loss of generality.For example, advertiser can use this first mode, advertisement is placed on the homepage of New York Times website or USA Today website.In another kind of strategy, advertiser can attempt its advertisement is oriented in audient in the narrower and small field, thereby improves the possibility of these audient's active responses.For example, advance the travel agency of Costa Rica's rainforest tourism advertisement can be placed on the eco-tour sub-directory of Yahoo website.Under the normal condition, advertiser will determine this orientation by hand.
No matter adopt which kind of strategy, often present to its commercial audience, promptly comprise the rectangular box of figure composition with the form of " banner " based on the advertisement (being also referred to as " web advertisement ") of website.If certain member of commercial audience (being called " spectators " or " user " in this manual) selects it by clicking one of these banners with being without loss of generality, the hypertext link of Qian Ruing guides to gray website with spectators in typical case.Spectators select this process of advertisement to be commonly referred to " point advances " (" point advances " is intended to cover any selection of user).The ratio of putting the impression number (being the number of times that advertisement shows or otherwise presents) of number of times and advertisement is commonly referred to " click-through rate " or " CTR " of described advertisement.
When the user finishes the transaction that the advertisement of previous appearance relates to, just say so " conversion " taken place.Constituting the things that transforms may change with situation, and can determine in diversified mode.For example, situation may be to finish before the user clicks advertisement, is directed into gray webpage and leaving this webpage when buying, and conversion has taken place.Situation as an alternative, conversion can be defined as user's display ads and buy on gray webpage within preset time (as seven days).As another alternative case, conversion can be defined as by advertiser anyly to be estimated/observable user action, such as download white paper, browse to the website given depth at least, observe at least one fixed number purpose webpage, on website or webpage, spend time of scheduled volume at least or the like.Such situation is often arranged, if user's action does not show the purchase of finishing, they may show sells guiding, is not limited thereto although constitute the user action that transforms.Really, also have many other definition to constituting the things that transforms.The ratio that transforms the impression number (being the number of times that advertisement shows or otherwise presents) of number of times and advertisement is commonly referred to conversion ratio.If transformation definition is for can taking place within the schedule time that occurs beginning from advertisement, a kind of possible definition of conversion ratio only considers that perhaps presentative time has in the past surpassed the advertisement of the described schedule time so.
The organizer's (being called " web site sponsor " or " ad consumer ") who presents the website of advertisement is in the face of following challenge: make the ad revenue maximization and do not damage its user's impression.Some web site sponsor has been selected ad revenue is placed on the user interest.This type of website is " Overture.com ", and it has sponsored so-called " search engine " service, and the response user inquiring returns the advertisement of pretending to be for " Search Results ".The Overture.com website allows advertiser to pay for the advertisement with its website (or targeted website) places the more anterior of the search result list of claiming.If implemented this type of scheme, have only the user to click that advertiser just pays after the advertisement (promptly each price of clicking), advertiser will lack the passion of effective its advertisement of orientation, because directed not good advertisement will can not clicked, so will not need to pay.Therefore, click at every turn that the high advertisement of price appears at or near the top, differing is converted into advertising distributors' true earning surely, because spectators do not click.Moreover, the advertisement that spectators will click is in the more below of tabulation, perhaps not in tabulation, so must give way to the relevance of advertisement.
Search engine---such as Google---has made the advertiser can directed its advertisement, thus will present them together with search result web page, to respond the general relevant inquiry of advertisement therewith.The Google system keeps track is advanced statistics (it is an effect parameter) to the point of advertisement and keyword.Given searching key word, the keyword targeted ads number that can show is limited, makes problem space can tackle relatively.Though search result web page provides huge chance for advertiser to directed its advertisement of audient more accurately, search result web page only is a part of page view of WWW.
Some online advertising system can be used ad related information and document content relevant information (as notion or theme, proper vector or the like), make advertisement " coupling " comprise the document (and/or giving a mark to advertisement) of content, such as webpage about the document that comprises content.The example of this type of online advertising system is described in following document:
-U.S. Provisional Application sequence number 60/413,536 (being incorporated herein by reference), title is " METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SERVING RELEVANTADVERTISEMENTS ", on September 24th, 2002 submitted to, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit classify as the inventor;

-U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 10/375,900 (being incorporated herein by reference), title is " SERVING ADVERTISEMENTS BASED ON CONTENT ", on February 26th, 2003 submitted to, Darrell Anderson, Paul Bucheit, Alex Carobus, Claire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar classify as the inventor;
-U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 10/452,830 (being incorporated herein by reference), title is " SERVING ADVERTISEMENTS USING INFORMATIONASSOCIATED WITH E-MAIL ", on June 2nd, 2003 submitted to, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit classify as the inventor.
In general, this type of online advertising system can be used the two relationship information of some candidate's advertisements and certain document, determines the mark of each advertisement with respect to the document.This mark can be used to judge whether that therewith document presents advertisement (being also referred to as qualification judges) explicitly, and/or determine the relevant attribute (as screen position, size or the like) of one or more advertisements that document therewith presents explicitly.The judgement of this mark for example also is used for one or more effect parameter (as click-through rate, conversion ratio, user gradation or the like) of (1) this advertisement, (2) the associated gray relevant quality information of this advertisement, one or more in the associated pricing information of (3) this advertisement (as the ceiling price of each result (as each click, each conversion, each impression or the like)).
Many content owners (as the publisher of webpage) are selling advertisement storage (perhaps allowing to present advertisement on its website) on its website, but do not wish to show the advertisement of competing with its product supply of material.Some content owner and advertiser have set up existing exclusive relation.These contents owner or do not wish shows the advertisement of partner's exclusive with it product supply of material competition, is perhaps forbidden showing by contract.For example, the website of selling automobiles insurance may not wish that the advertisement that demonstrates has the link of selling the website to other car insurances.Equally, the website that has the flowers related content may have exclusive relation with the flowers delivery companies, so only show its flowers delivering advertisements.
Some advertisement providing system provides based on URL's or based on (as based on the website) advertisement of domain name and blocks.In these systems, block tabulation and comprise URL and/or site home page.Advertisement can comprise visual URL or to the link of URL.If advertisement comprise in the associated blockade of the concrete webpage tabulation visible URL or to the link of URL, just it is not provided with this webpage.Regrettably, producing the blockade tabulation often needs the intensive process of manpower, produces relevant keyword and also searches for these keywords so that the advertisement that identification should be blocked.In addition, along with the adding of new advertisement, manage these and block tabulation and become and be not easy for new web page or website.Otherwise, block tabulation and will can not be locked in the new advertisement that enters after its initial creation.At last, blocking tabulation comprises too much often.For example, when only needing to block certain product category, all advertisements of big supermarket such as Amazon may have been blocked.Therefore lost potential advertising income.
Some advertisement service system, especially used to the advertisement that is directed to search query term system, make the content owner can use lists of keywords, be commonly referred to " blacklist ", block advertisement in other words so that content owner or its exclusive partner's competitive search terms is covered advertisement.For example, America Online may wish to block the advertisement that is directed to keyword " ISP ".Regrettably, blacklist is not so good to content-based advertisement directional effect, because webpage may be associated with a plurality of classifications.Best mode be not get rid of be directed to keyword on the blacklist (as flowers, rose, tulip, carnation, bouquet, awl flower Gypsophila acutifolia ... or 1800access, USWest, Juno Online ...) all advertisements, this needs very big lists of keywords, but only get rid of detest the advertisement of classification (as flowers, Internet service provider) and show other relevant advertisement.Therefore, blacklist has following problem: need the manual one group of affiliated keyword of certain classification that produces.The content shortcoming often because these are tabulated, especially when they did not have regular update, unwelcome advertisement may appear on content owner's the document, caused losing goodwill.Really, this problem is more obvious based on the directional pattern of searching key word to content-based advertisement directional pattern advertisement ratio, because with the advertisement on the result of page searching of profundity slide (advertisement that should be blocked promptly having occurred) opposite, the advertisement slip on the high flow capacity page of content site is visible.In addition, if not careful consideration, blacklist may comprise too much blocked have objectionable keyword but in the advertisement of adjacent classification.For example, may expect to block the advertisement of Sony's consumption electronic product, if but " Sony " added blacklist, the advertisement that then may block the DVD of Sony.
Consider above situation, need better advertisement blocking technology.These technology should satisfy the one or more of following target: (i) be easy to set up; (ii) be easy to management; (iii) avoid the content shortcoming; (iv) avoid comprising too much; (v) work with content-targeted advertisement service system.
Summary of the invention
The present invention makes content owner's partner (as website/webpage publisher) can be easy to block the whole wide or narrow classification of advertisement, and can specify unwelcome ad content or orientation.The present invention can be by with some concept related to certain publication position (property) and advertisement that these conceptual dependencies are blocked in given publication position, and/or some terms are associated with certain publication position and given publication position blocked and comprise that the advertisement of any described term does like this.
