In some implementations, such information may be directly provided by users. For example, theuser 104 a can employ one or more computer applications executed by theclient device 102 a and/or the computing server(s) 108 to specify information related his or her activities and activity preferences. In some implementations, such activity-related information may be inferred from user interaction with applications such as web browsers, search engines, and e-mail. For example, search queries provided by theuser 104 a to a search engine (not shown) can be provided to theinformation providing system 120 for inferring user activities and/or activity preferences. As another example, web browsing behavior information (e.g., website visits, map searches, link clicks) can be provided to theinformation providing system 120 and can be used to infer such user information. - In some implementations, activity and activity preference information may be identified from historical user data. For example, information directly provided by users 104 and information inferred from interactions of users 104 with various applications can be stored by the user
activities data store 130 and/or the userpreferences data store 132 for use in further processing. In some implementations, historical user data may be filtered to identify information relevant to a particular activity and/or activity preference. For example, as user data is received by the computing server(s) 108 and theinformation providing system 120, theactivity relevance identifier 110 can filter the data to identify information relevant to the particular activity and/or activity preferences, and the filtered data can be stored and/or provided to additional software components for further processing. As another example, historical user data can be directly received and stored by the useractivities data store 130 and/or the userpreferences data store 132 and can be filtered during subsequent processing. - During state (B), user profiles can be generated. For example, the
information providing system 120 can receive historical user activity data associated with theuser 104 a from the useractivities data store 130 and user preference data associated with theuser 104 a from the userpreferences data store 132, and can provide the data to theprofile generator 112 to generate a user profile for theuser 104 a, based at least in part on such data. As another example, theinformation providing system 120 can receive activity and/or activity preference data associated with theuser 104 a in real-time (e.g., during web browsing sessions), and can generate and/or update a profile associated with theuser 104 a as data is received. User profiles, for example, can include information related to user preferences and tastes in regard to a particular activity, and can provide a basis for defining users. Upon generating and/or updating user profiles by theprofile generator 112, for example, the profiles can be stored by the userprofiles data store 134 for further processing and use. - During state (C), entities (e.g., organizations, businesses, advertisers) can target aspects of user profiles. For example, the
entity 140 a can provide information (e.g., text, video, audio, web links, recommendations, advertisements, etc.) related to a particular activity, and can specify profile features of users 104 that are to receive such information. Upon receiving the information, for example, the information can be stored by the activity-relatedinformation data store 136 for later providing to users 104. In some implementations, targeting can be auction-based. For example, multiple entities 140 can participate in an auction for providing information to users 104, and the information can be provided in accordance with one or more completed auctions. - During state (D), a trigger event can be recognized indicative of a user being in a mode related to a particular activity. For example, the
user 104 a can employ theclient device 102 a to enter a search query or map search, and thetrigger event detector 114 can identify the search as being relevant to the activity. As another example, theuser 104 a can move between locations, and thetrigger event detector 114 can identify the change in location as being relevant to the activity (e.g., the start of a trip, a shopping session, a dining experience, etc.). - During state (E), information relevant to an activity, user profile, and trigger event can be identified/selected. For example, upon determining that the
user 104 a is in a mode related to a particular activity, theinformation providing system 120 can provide user profile information associated with theuser 104 a to the activity-relatedinformation selector 116. Based at least in part on the user profile information, the activity-relatedinformation selector 116 can select from information associated with one or more entities 140. For example, theentity 140 a may have indicated intent to provide information to users having particular profile features, at a time when the users are in an activity mode. In the present example, the activity-relatedinformation selector 116 can determine that theuser 104 a has one or more of the particular profile features, and can select information associated with theentity 140 a for providing to the user. - During state (F), selected information can be provided users. For example, information related to an activity (e.g., travel, shopping, dining, etc.) mentally or physically engaged in by the
user 104 a can be provided to the user, based at least in part on the profile of theuser 104 a. Thus, historical and current user patterns of engagement and user preferences can be considered when providing information to users. In addition, relevant information can be provided to users at appropriate times. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 that can detect an occurrence of a trigger event and can provide information to system users. In some implementations, a trigger event may be indicative of a start of a trip or an arrival at a location. Based at least in part on the trigger event, for example, information can be selected and provided to users. In some implementations, no user input is specifically required to signal a trigger event (i.e., the user can move to a location, but is not required to provide, for example, a search request once they arrive at the location to trigger the event). - In the present example, a
user 202 employs aclient device 204 at a first location 210. As shown by arrow 212, for example, theuser 202 can move to asecond location 220. For example, theuser 202 may have started a vacation or business trip, or may have started a regular sort of travel such as commuting. Based on location information provided by theclient device 204, a system for providing information to system users in response to trigger events (e.g.,system 100, shown inFIG. 1 ) can select and provide information (e.g., content, recommendations, and advertisements) to theuser 202. Location information can be provided by, for example, GPS (Global Positioning System) capabilities of theclient device 204, by location reporting of theuser 202, or by any other appropriate technique. - In some implementations, information can be provided to the client device 204 (e.g., by the system 100) and presented to the
user 202 by aninterface 230. For example, theinterface 230 can include visual, audio, and motion (e.g., vibration) aspects. In the present example, theinterface 230 includes amap interface 240, an activity-relatedinformation interface 250, and advertisement interface(s) 260. In some implementations, additional information may be provided via theinterface 230. For example, addition information may be provided by associating web page links to any of theinterfaces - To illustrate selecting and providing of information to users, the trigger event may be an arrival at an airport by the
user 202. Based on a travel-related profile of theuser 202, for example, thesystem 100 may determine that theuser 202 generally books a hotel room shortly after arrival, and that the user generally prefers medium-priced hotels that have swimming pools. Thus, thesystem 100 may select and provide information associated with such hotels to theuser 202 via theinterface 230. As another example, upon arriving at the airport, theuser 202 may enter a map search. Upon recognizing that theuser 202 is in a travel-related mode based on receiving the map search, for example, thesystem 100 can provide map information via themap interface 240, including locations of hotels that may be preferred by theuser 202. As another example, hotel information can be provided to theuser 202 via the activity-relatedinformation interface 250 and/or via the advertisements interface(s) 260. - In some implementations, time factors may be considered when selecting and providing information to users. For example, the
user 202 may arrive at the airport at 6:30 p.m. Based on a travel and/or dining-related profile of the user, for example, thesystem 100 may determine that theuser 202 generally visits restaurants around 6:30 p.m. while traveling, and that theuser 202 generally prefers airport establishments that serve beer. Thus, information and/or advertisements related to such establishments can be selected and provided to theclient device 204 for presentation to theuser 202 via theinterface 230. - By detecting trigger events indicative of users being in an activity mode, for example, information can be selected and provided to users when the users are planning, engaged in, or otherwise occupied with the activity. Although location and time-based examples have been described, other sorts of trigger events are possible, such as triggers associated with user interaction with search engines and websites. In some implementations, particular query terms can be tagged as related to particular activities. For example, the terms “hotel” or “flight” may be tagged as being related to travel. As another example, a series of queries can be considered for determining when a user is in an activity mode.
-
FIGS. 3A and 3B showexample user interfaces interfaces FIG. 1 ), and can include visual, audio, and motion (e.g., vibration) aspects. - In the present example, the
interface 300 includes asearch query interface 310, an activity-related information interface 312, amessage interface 314, and a previously-provided information interface 316. For example, users can interact with thesearch query interface 310 to provide search queries to a search engine by typing, speaking, submitting photos, or any other appropriate technique. The search engine, for example, can provide information related to the search queries to a system for providing information to users in response to trigger events (e.g.,system 100, shown inFIG. 1 ). If a trigger event indicative of a user being in a mode related to an activity is detected, for example, information relevant to the activity, a profile of the user, and the trigger event can be presented to the user via theinterface 300. Activity-related information (e.g., content, recommendations, advertisements, etc.) can be presented via the activity-related information interface 312, for example. - In some implementations, a reason for providing information to the user can be provided. For example, information related to the reason can be presented to the user via the
message interface 314. The reason, for example, can include information related to how the profile of the user was used in selecting activity-related information. For example, if the user had indicated a preference for hotels with swimming pools, preference information may be presented in association with hotel information. As another example, if the user is associated with a history of searching for or booking rooms in medium-priced hotels, the history information may be presented in association with hotel information. By providing the reason for selecting and providing information, for example, a degree of transparency can be provided in regard to how user activity profile information is used. - In some implementations, an option for accessing previously provided information can be provided. For example, the option can be provided via the previously-provided information interface 316 (e.g., a series of thumbnails, a command button or link for navigating to another screen, etc.). By interacting with the previously-provided information interface 316, for example, users can access information previously provided in recognition of a trigger event. In the present example, previously provided information can be presented to users through the
interface 350, which includes a previously-presentedmap interface 360, previously-presented activity-related information interface(s) 362, and previously-presented advertisement interface(s) 364. In some implementations, users may be provided with variable or rotating information. By accessing the option for accessing previously provided information, for example, users can revisit such information if desired. -
FIG. 4 is a diagram of anexample system 400 that can provide profile information to content providers. In some implementations, multiple entities (e.g., organizations, businesses, advertisers) can be provided with information associated with multiple user profiles including selectable profile features. By selecting profile features available for targeting, for example, the entities can publish information (e.g., content, recommendations, advertisements) to users matching their criteria. In some implementations, multiple entities can bid against the features, and selecting and providing information to users may be based at least in part on an auction process. - In the present example, computing server(s) 402 can provide feature information 404 to entities 406. In some implementations, the feature information 404 can include counts of individuals associated with the selectable profile features. For example, the computing server(s) 402 can identify a profile feature such as “swimmer” and can determine that a certain number of users have indicated a preference for swimming-related activities, or have demonstrated a history of booking reservations for facilities with swimming pools, or have performed web searches for such facilities. The entities 406, for example, can select from and/or bid against the provided features, and can provide selection and/or bid information 408 to the computing server(s) 402. In some implementations, the computing server(s) may be included as part of or may be in communication with the computing server(s) 108 and the information providing system 120 (shown in
FIG. 1 ). - Feature selection and/or bid information 408 received from each of the entities 406 can be used by the computing server(s) 402 for selecting information relevant to activities, user profiles, and trigger events. For example, upon determining that a particular user associated with a “swimmer” profile feature is in a travel mode (e.g., researching hotels), the computing server(s) 402 may provide the user with information associated with one or more entities 406 (e.g., hotels) that have selected the feature. In implementations including auctions, for example, information associated with one or more auction-winning entities 406 may be provided to the user. Thus, in the present example, hotels with swimming pools may provide content (e.g., advertisements) to individuals who are likely to have an interest in such amenities.
-
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for selecting and providing information to users. In some implementations, the process 500 may be performed by thesystems - In more detail, historical data associated with individuals can be identified (502) from network presences of individuals, including determining data that is relevant to an activity. For example, the computing server(s) 108 and the
information providing system 120 can receive data associated with user(s) 104, and can use theactivity relevance identifier 110 to identify data related to activities. By interacting with one or more client device applications, for example, the user(s) 104 can provide explicit and implicit activity-related data. - In some implementations, activity types may be defined by administrators of the
system 100, including defining the types of data associated with the activity. For example, the activity may be associated with travel and the historical data may include data associated with one or more previous trips by an individual. As another example, the activity may be associated with shopping and the historical data may include data associated with one or more previous purchases by the individual. As another example, the activity may be associated with dining and the historical data may include data associated with one or more previous dining experiences of the individual. - Data associated with preferences of individuals can be identified (504) from network presences of individuals, including determining data that is relevant to the activity. For example, the computing server(s) 108 and the
information providing system 120 can receive preference data associated with user(s) 104, and can use theactivity relevance identifier 110 to identify preference data related to activities. Preference data, for example, can include preferred types, locations, budgets, etc., in regard to various activities. For example, in regard to travel activities, a particular individual may have a preference for beach or warm weather vacations. As another example, in regard to shopping activities, a particular individual may have a preference for upscale shops featuring suits. As another example, in regard to dining activities, a particular individual may have a preference for non-chain burger joints serving beer. - In some implementations, the identified history and preference data may be provided by individuals. For example, the
user 104 a can use theclient device 102 a to create and manage trip itineraries, and the itinerary data can be provided to theprofile generator 112 for generating a travel-related profile for theuser 104 a. As another example, theuser 104 a can employ one or more computer applications executed by theclient device 102 a and/or the computing server(s) 108 to explicitly indicate his or her activities and activity preferences. - In some implementations, data provided by individuals may include search queries. For example, the
user 104 a can use theclient device 102 a to access a search engine and to search for information and websites related to a particular activity. The search engine can provide data associated with the search session to theinformation providing system 120, for example, where relevance to the activity may be determined by theactivity relevance identifier 110. In some implementations, relevance may be determined by tagging particular query terms and associating the terms with activity categories. In some implementations, a classifier may be created for queries and groups of queries for determining relevance to particular activities. - In some implementations, data provided by individuals may include posted messages, reviews, and/or photos. For example, the
user 104 a can use theclient device 102 a to access websites for posting such data, and theactivity relevance identifier 110 can identify and process the data and can determine whether the data is relevant to a particular activity. If theuser 104 a posts a message or a review about a particular restaurant or style of cuisine, for example, theactivity relevance identifier 110 can parse the message or review, can determine whether the message or review is related to dining activity, and can associate the message or review sentiment with theuser 104 a. As another example, if theuser 104 a posts a geo-tagged photo of a particular location, theactivity relevance identifier 110 can identify the photo location, can determine whether the photo is related to travel activity, and can identify the location as a location of interest to theuser 104 a. - In some implementations, data provided by individuals may include data associated with web pages accessed by individuals. For example, the
user 104 a can use theclient device 102 a to visit websites during a web browsing session. Upon receiving information associated with the visited websites, for example, theactivity relevance identifier 110 can crawl the websites and can extract data from the websites relevant to various activities. For example, if theuser 104 a visits a website related to purchasing a particular product or service, theactivity relevance identifier 110 can determine whether the website is related to shopping activity, and can associate the product or service with theuser 104 a. - In some implementations, identifying preference data may include detecting one or more patterns associated with the historical data. For example, if the
information providing system 120 determines that theuser 104 a has a search history including search queries related to American sports cars, and/or has visited web sites related to American sports cars, and/or has posted messages, reviews or photos related to American sports cars, it may be determined that theuser 104 a has a preference for American sports cars. As another example, an individual's travel preferences (e.g., types of transportation, lodging, etc.) over a period of months or years can be compiled to identify seasonal travel preferences of the individual. For example, it may be determined that theuser 104 a tends to be interested in or to engage in warm weather vacations during January. - Profiles for individuals can be generated (506) based at least in part on the historical data and the preference data. For example, the
information providing system 120 can use theprofile generator 112 to generate a profile for theuser 104 a based on historical data and preference data associated with the user. The generated profile can be used by subsequent processes as an indicator of an individual's tastes and preferences in regard to a particular activity. - In some implementations, generating profiles can include identifying one or more locations, products, or services associated with the historical data or the preference data. For example, the
profile generator 112 can cluster location, product, or service information included in the historical or preference data to extract profile information. As another example, frequent patterns in the data (e.g., common airlines used, common flight times, rankings of selected hotels, price ranges for hotels and flights, etc.) can be identified for generating the profile. - Optionally, information associated with multiple profiles, including selectable profile features, can be provided (508) to content providers, and selected profile features can be received from content providers. Referring to
FIG. 4 , for example, the computing server(s) 402 can provide feature information 404 including selectable profile features to various entities 406. In some implementations, selectable profile features may pertain to various activity-related profiles associated with system users. For example, travel-related profiles of multiple users may include information indicating whether the users have visited Hawaii in the past. Thus, in the present example, the selectable profile features can include an option enabling the entities 406 to select users having visited Hawaii. For example, an interface including selection boxes associated with the selectable profile features can be presented to the entities 406. As another example, the interface can include search capabilities enabling the entities 406 to identify profile features of interest. - In some implementations, the information associated with multiple profiles may include a count of individuals associated with the selectable profile features. For example, the computing server(s) 402 can count users associated with particular profile features, and can provide count information in association with descriptions of the features. Thus, in the present example, a count of users having visited Hawaii can be presented to the entities 406.
- In some implementations, content providers may provide auction bids for having information provided to individuals associated with particular profile features. For example, entities 406 may select one or more profile features included in the feature information 404, and may indicate the prices (e.g., based on cost per click, cost per view, or some other appropriate pricing model) they are willing to pay for having information provided to users associated with one or more of the selected profile features. In the present example, the
entity 406 a may be an airline or a travel agency. Theentity 406 a can select a profile feature associated with users having visited Hawaii, for example, and may bid against other entities 406 for the opportunity to provide information (e.g., advertisements) to such users. - Selected profile features and/or auction bids can be received from content providers. For example, the computing server(s) 402 can receive feature selection and/or bid information 408 from the entities 406. In some implementations, the entities 406 may also provide information associated with content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided to users. For example, the
entity 406 a may provide an advertisement (e.g., “Save 20% on a flight to Hawaii.”) including parameters or embedded promotion codes enabling theentity 406 a to identify users that interact with the advertisement. Thus, theentity 406 a in the present example can manage a targeted advertising campaign based on providing information to users associated with desired profile features. - A trigger event indicative of an individual being in a mode related to an activity can be detected (510). Referring to
FIG. 1 , for example, theinformation providing system 120 can use thetrigger event detector 114 to detect the trigger event. In general, trigger events may include events associated with user planning of or engagement in particular activities. Considering travel activity, for example, trigger events may include such events as starting a trip, arriving at a particular destination, performing a travel-related search, and performing a map search. Considering shopping activity, for example, trigger events may include such events as arrival at a shopping center, browsing shopping websites, and performing searches for particular products or services. Considering dining activity, for example, trigger events may include such events as occurrences of meal times, arrival at a restaurant district, and performing dining-related searches. In the present example, theuser 104 a can employ theclient device 102 a to perform travel-related searches for beach vacations, and thetrigger event detector 114 can recognize the search session as a trigger event associated with travel activity. - Information relevant to the activity, the individual profile, and the trigger event can be identified or selected (512). For example, the
information providing system 120 can use the activity-relatedinformation selector 116 to select information associated with entities 140 for providing to users 104 associated with particular profile features. In the present example, the activity-relatedinformation selector 116 can access a travel-related profile associated with theuser 104 a to determine that the user has visited Hawaii in the past. The activity-relatedinformation selector 116 can identify one or more entities 140 that have indicated intent for providing information to users having visited Hawaii, and can select information associated with information associated with such entities. - In some implementations, the type of trigger event may be used as a factor in selecting information for providing to users. For example, upon detecting a search query related trigger event, the
information selector 116 can determine that theuser 104 a is engaging in travel-related research. Thus, in the present example, information that may be relevant to theuser 104 a while performing research for a trip to Hawaii, such as flight and hotel information, may be selected. As another example, upon detecting a trigger event indicative of a start of a trip or arrival at a location, theinformation selector 116 can determine that theuser 104 a is currently traveling. Thus, information that may be relevant to theuser 104 a while vacationing in Hawaii, such as local travel activity options (e.g., helicopter rides, snorkeling, luaus, etc.), for example, may be selected. - In some implementations, selecting information relevant to the activity may be based at least in part on an auction process. The auction process may include various techniques for evaluating bids and determining auction winners. In some implementations, the auction process can include a comparison of bids, augmented in part by quality scores (e.g., based on click rates, user feedback, or some other appropriate technique) associated with content providers. For example, the
entity 140 a may be identified as having placed a competitive auction bid, and as being associated with a competitive quality score. In the present example, theinformation providing system 120 can run an auction participated in by multiple entities 140, and can select theentity 140 a as an auction winner. In accordance with the auction process, for example, information associated with theentity 140 a can be selected for providing to theuser 104 a. - In some implementations, selecting information relevant to the activity may be based at least in part on a prediction of interest of the individual in regard to the information. For example, based on interaction (e.g., views, clicks, etc.) of users 104 with previously provided information, the activity-related
information selector 116 can select information likely to be of interest. To predict user interest, for example, one or more prediction models using activity profile and trigger event information can be referenced by the activity-relatedinformation selector 116. - Selected information can be provided (514) to the individual in response to detecting the trigger event. For example, the
information providing system 120 can provide information associated with theentity 140 a to theclient device 102 a for presentation to theuser 104 a. In some implementations, the information may be related to advertising. For example, the information associated with theentity 140 a can be an advertisement for flights to Hawaii, including text, audio, image, and/or video elements. - Optionally, a reason for providing the information and/or an option for accessing previously provided information can be provided (516) to the individual. Referring to
FIG. 3A , for example, theinterface 300 can include amessage interface 314 for providing information related to how the profile of the individual was used in selecting activity-related information. Referring toFIG. 3B , for example, theinterface 350 can includeinterfaces -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of anexample process 600 for selecting and providing information to users. In some implementations, theprocess 600 may be performed by thesystems process 600 includes identifying historical information associated with users including filtering information to determine information relevant to travel, identifying user travel preferences based on historical information, detecting occurrences of trigger events, selecting information relevant to travel history, travel preferences, and trigger events, providing selected information to users at a time that is close in proximity to the detection of a trigger event, and optionally re-providing selected information to users upon receiving user requests. - In more detail, historical information associated with a user can be identified (602) from a network presence of the user. Referring to
FIG. 1 , for example, theactivity relevance identifier 110 can receive historical information associated with theuser 104 a from the useractivities data store 130, filtering the historical information to determine information that is relevant to travel. For example, the historical information can include information associated with itineraries, geo-tagged photos, web page visits, message posts, reviews, search queries, and map searches. - Travel preferences of the user can be identified (604) from the network presence of the user. For example, based at least in part on the filtered historical information associated with the
user 104 a, theactivity relevance identifier 110 and/or theprofile generator 112 can identify travel preferences of theuser 104 a. The travel preferences can include preferences such as preferred destination types, travel times, airlines and hotels, and budgets, to describe a few possibilities. - An occurrence of a trigger event can be detected (606). For example, the
trigger event detector 114 can receive information from theclient device 102 a operated by theuser 104 a indicative of trigger events such as a start of a trip by the user, arrival at a location by the user, entering of a search query associated with travel by the user, and entering of a map search by the user, to describe a few possibilities. - Information relevant to the user's travel history, travel preferences, and the trigger event can be selected (608). For example, the activity-related
information selector 116 can select such information. In some implementations, the selected information may be advertising content. For example, the advertising content can be associated with one or more entities 140. - The selected information can be provided (610) to the user at a time that is close in proximity to the detection of the trigger event. For example, upon detecting a trigger event indicative of the start of a trip by the
user 104 a, travel-related advertising content can be selected and provided to theuser 104 a by theinformation providing system 120 at a time that is close (e.g., within 10 seconds, within a minute, within 10 minutes, etc.) to the start of the trip. - Optionally, the selected information can be re-provided (612) to the user. For example, after providing the selected information to the
user 104 a at a time that is close in proximity to the detection of the trigger event, the information can be re-provided upon receiving a request by theuser 104 a. For example, theuser 104 a can use theclient device 102 a to request and receive previously presented information. -
