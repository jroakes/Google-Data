determine theme 540 whether be stored in server memory 160 in a plurality of topic screen claim in 520 at least one to be associated.For example, within the server 110 of Fig. 1, processor-server 150 can be programmed to claim 520 to compare with a plurality of topic screen that are stored in the server memory 160 theme.Similarly, within the content server 710 of Fig. 9 and 10, content handler 750 can be programmed to claim 520 to compare with a plurality of topic screen that are stored in the server memory 160 theme.In step 930, when theme claimed 530 to be associated with the topic screen of at least one storage, the use topic screen of setting up within the instant message communication system 100 claimed 530 communication.For example, server 110 can use topic screen to claim 530 to sign in to instant message communication system 100.Similarly, content server 710 can be set up with the server of instant message 720 in the instant message communication system 100 and communicate by letter.Operation advances to node A thereafter, and also turns back to step 780, to continue to check the detection that exists of the incident within the instant message communication system 100.In step 920, when theme 540 not be stored in storer in a plurality of topic screen when claiming in 520 at least one to be associated, process determines whether to add theme 540 and claims together with the topic screen that is associated.For example, incident exists notice can comprise the indication of adding theme 540.As alternative another kind of replacement scheme, algorithm can be programmed into the processor-server 150 of server 110 or the content handler 750 of content server 710, to determine whether to add theme.Further, can manually inquire the equipment user within the instant message communication system 100, whether this user response is being that new theme distributes and stores one or more topic screen and claims.When not adding theme, process finishes.When adding theme, process turns back to step 880.
Figure 14 explaination is according to an embodiment of the operation of the instant messaging device 320 in the instant message communication system 100 of the present invention.As shown in the figure, process starts from step 940, and counter is set to N=1 here.Then, in step 950, process determines whether to receive event notice.For example, the equipment receiver 330 of instant messaging device 320 can receive instant message 470, and this message comprises the notice of the existence of at least one incident in a plurality of incidents 180.When there was notice in the incident that do not receive, process turned back to step 950, and periodically checked reception.In step 960, when there was notice in the incident that receives, instant messaging device 320 determined whether the screen title that receives is associated with at least one theme.For example, the device handler 340 of instant messaging device 320 can be programmed to the screen title that will receive and compares with the topics of interest screen name list 405 that is stored in the device memory 350.In step 980, when theme was associated with at least one screen title, subject name was presented on the instant messaging device 320.For example, the topic screen of theme 540 claims 530 can be presented on the instant message user interface 360 of instant messaging device 320.In step 970, when theme was not associated with at least one screen title, instant messaging device 320 determined whether the screen title that receives is associated with at least one incident.For example, the device handler 340 of instant messaging device 320 can be programmed to the screen title that will receive and compares with the interested event screen title tabulation 415 that is stored in the device memory 350.When the screen title was not associated with at least one incident, process was returned step 950.When in step 970, when the screen title is associated with at least one incident, and after step 980 screen name, in step 982, whether the equipment user of process query instant messaging device 320 has the communication capacity of participation incident.Then, in step 984, when the equipment user had the communication capacity of participation incident, whether process query instant messaging device 320 had the ability of participation incident.Then, in step 990, when instant messaging device 320 had the ability of participation incident, N incident was presented on the instant message user interface 360 of instant messaging device 320.N incident can exist any combination of designator, incident availability designator or equivalent to show by change event ID, event status indicator, incident.Then, and do not have the communication capacity of participation incident or instant messaging device 320 when not having the ability of participation incident as the equipment user, in step 1000, counter is increased to N=N+1.Process is returned step 950 thereafter.
Invention described herein provides uses the instant messaging technology to send ability about the notice of the existence of interested incident and availability to spectators.Although the present invention uses preferred embodiment to be described, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that and to carry out various changes and modification, and do not depart from the present invention.Correspondingly, all such changes should be regarded as being in as within defined essence of the present invention of appended claims and the scope with modification.
