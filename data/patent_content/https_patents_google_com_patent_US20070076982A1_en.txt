- two projection pixel arrays are generated from the background area portions, particularly sub-images of the image data (see FIG. 3 ).
- Projection pixel arrays are created by projecting onto one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional pixel values, by summing the pixels which have in the sub-image a particular horizontal index, thus resulting in a projection onto the horizontal axis of the original two-dimensional sub-image. A corresponding process is performed for the vertical index.
- one projection pixel array is composed of the sums of values along each column and the other projection pixel array is composed of the sums of values along each row as represented in the following mathematical formulae:

- the set of shift correspondences between sub-images of select frames constitutes candidate motion vectors. For each candidate motion vector, the value of an error criterion can be determined as described below.
- An error criterion can be defined and calculated between two consecutive corresponding sub-images for various motion vector candidates.
- the candidates can correspond to a (2M+1) pixel ⁇ (2N+1) pixel search window.
- the search window can be larger than the sub-image by the amount of the buffer region.
- the search window can be square although it may take any shape.
- the candidate providing the lowest value for the error criterion can be used as the motion vector of the sub-image. The accuracy of the determination of motion may depend on the number of candidates investigated and the size of the sub-image.
- the two projection arrays (for rows and columns) can be used separately and the error criterion which is the sum of absolute differences is calculated for 2N+1 shift values for the horizontal candidates, and calculated for 2M+1 shift values for the vertical candidates.

- the horizontal shift minimizing the criterion for the array of column sums (C k X ) can be chosen as the horizontal component of the sub-image motion vector.
- the vertical shift minimizing the criterion for the array of row sums (C k y ) can be chosen as the vertical component of the sub-image motion vector.
- the median value for the horizontal component and the median value for the vertical component may be chosen. Choosing the median value may eliminate impulses and unreliable motion vectors from areas with local motion different from the global motion that behave like impulses.
- the sub-image motion vectors and the global motion vector of the previous frame may furthermore be used to produce the output.
- the previous frame global motion vector can be used as a basis for subsequent frame global motion vecors, because it can be expected that two consecutive frames will have similar motion.

- alternating frames or other choices for a subsequence of frames may be used, and are within the scope of this disclosure.
- a procedure can be used to evaluate camera motion from the beginning of the capture and make the compensation adaptive to intentional camera motion, such as panning.
- This method includes calculating an integrated motion vector that is a linear combination of the current motion vector and previous motion vectors with a damping coefficient. The integral motion vector converges to zero when there is no camera motion.
- V i ( t ) k*V i ( t ⁇ 1)+ V g ( t ) (2)
- V i denotes the integrated motion vector for estimating camera motion
- V g denotes the global motion vector for the consecutive pictures at moments (t ⁇ 1) and t.
- the damping coefficient k can be selected to have a value between 0.9 and 0.999 to achieve smooth camera motion compensation for hand shaking caused jitter while adapting to intentional camera motion (panning).
- Another aspect of video stabilization is the ability to reduce bit rate for encoding the stabilized sequence.
- the global motion vector calculated during stabilization may improve motion compensation and reduce the amount of residual data which needs to be discrete cosine transform (DCT) coded.
- DCT discrete cosine transform
- Two different scenarios are considered when combining the stabilization with video encoding. First, stabilization can be performed prior to the video encoding, as a separate preprocessing step, and stabilized images are used by the video encoder. Second, stabilization becomes an additional stage within the video encoder, where global motion information is extracted from the already previously calculated motion vectors and then the global motion is used in further encoding stages.
- global motion vectors can be defined as two dimensional (horizontal and vertical) displacements from one frame to another, evaluated from the background pixel domain by considering sub-images. Furthermore, an error criterion is defined and the value of this criterion is determined for different motion vector candidates. The candidate having the lowest value of the criterion can be selected as the result for a sub-image. The most common criterion is the sum of absolute differences. A choice for motion vectors for horizontal and vertical directions can be calculated separately, and the global two dimensional motion vector can be defined using these components. For example, the median horizontal value, among the candidates chosen for each sub-image, and the median vertical value, among the candidates chosen for each sub-image, can be chosen as the two components of the global motion vector.
- the global motion can thus be calculated by dividing the image into sub-images, calculating motion vectors for the sub-images and using an evaluation or decision process to determine the whole image global motion from the sub-images.
- the images of the sequences of images can be accordingly shifted, a portion or all of the outer boundary being eliminated, to reduce or eliminate unintentional motion of the image sequence.
Abstract
Description
- The present invention relates to video image processing, and more particularly to video processing to stabilize unintentional image motion.
- Image capturing devices, such as digital video cameras, are being increasingly incorporated into handheld devices such as wireless communication devices. Users may capture video on their wireless communication devices and transmit a file to a recipient via a base transceiver station. It is common that the image sequences contain unwanted motion between successive frames in the sequence. In particular, hand-shaking introduces undesired global motion in video captured with a camera incorporated into a handheld device such as a cellular telephone. Other causes of unwanted motion can include vibrations, fluctuations or micro-oscillations of the image capturing device during the acquisition of the sequence.
- As wireless mobile device technology has continued to improve, the devices have become increasingly smaller. Accordingly, image capturing devices such as those included in wireless communication devices can have more restricted processing capabilities and functions due to tighter size constraints. While there are prior compensation techniques, which attempt to correct for any “jitter,” the processing instructions often require the analysis of relatively larger amounts of data and higher amounts of processing power. In particular, users of wireless communication devices, which have image capturing devices, oftentimes multi-task their devices so processing of video with processor intensive compensation techniques may slow other applications, or may be impeded by other applications.

FIG. 3 shows two sequence frames in time, both having corner sectors; -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of the method as described herein; and -
FIG. 5 shows steps of the evaluation and stabilization processes. - Disclosed is a method and circuit for stabilizing motion within an image sequence generated by an image capturing device. The image sequence is formed from a temporal sequence of frames, each frame having an area. The images are commonly two dimensional arrays, of pixels. The area of the frames generally can be divided into a foreground area portion and background area portion. From the background area portion of the frames, a background pixel domain is selected for evaluation. The background pixel domain is used to generate an evaluation, for subsequent stabilization processing, calculated between corresponding pairs of a sub-sequence of select frames. In one embodiment, the corner sectors of the frames of the sequence of frames are determined and the background pixel domain is formed to correspond to the corner sectors.

The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and appreciation for the invention principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.

FIG. 1 , as described herein, automatic image stabilization can remove the effects of undesired motion (in particular, jitter associated with the movement of one's hand) when taking pictures or videos. There are two major effects produced by the inability to hold a hand-held camera in a steady position without mechanical stabilization from, for example, a tripod. First, when taking a picture of high resolution the image capture takes up to a few seconds and handshaking results in a blurred picture. Second, when shooting a video, handshaking produces undesired global picture movement. - The undesired image motion may be represented as rotation and/or translation with respect to the camera lens principal axis. The frequency of the involuntary hand movement is usually around 2 Hz. As described below in detail, stabilization can be performed for the video background, when a moving subject is in front of a steady background. By evaluation of the background instead of the whole images of the image sequence, unintentional motion is targeted for stabilization and intentional (i.e. desired) motion may be substantially unaffected. In another embodiment, stabilization can be performed for the video foreground, when it is performed for the central part of the image where the close to perfect in-focus is achieved.
- Still referring to
FIG. 1 , an unprocessed image 118 a of a person is shown displayed ondisplay screen 104. Below a processed image 118 b of an extracted sub-image is shown ondisplay screen 104. Processed image 118 b shows that theouter boundary 120 of the image 118 a has been eliminated. As will be discussion in greater detail below, the evaluation determines an amount of shift to be applied, by calculating displacement of portions of the image which are not expected to move, and the stabilization shifts the images of sequential frames, thus eliminating at least a portion of the outer boundary. - In particular, when the image composition includes a center subject as shown by images 118 a and 118 b, the frames can include an outer boundary from which a buffer region is formed. The buffer may include portions or all of the outer boundary. The buffer may be referred to as a background pixel domain below. The buffer region is used during the stabilization processing to supply image information including spare row data and column data which are needed for any corrective translations, when the image is shifted to correct for unintentional jitter between frames.
- In stabilization, data originally forming part of the buffer outside the
outer boundary 120 is reintroduced as part of the stabilized image in varying degrees across a sequence of frames. The position of the adjusted outer boundary is determined, when a global motion vector (described below) for the image is calculated. In at least some embodiments, the motion compensation (i.e. the shift) can be performed by changing the location in memory from which image data is read, and changing the amount of memory read out to display image data. In other words, stabilization takes place when compensation is performed by changing the starting address and extent of the displayed image within the larger captured image. After scaling the image to fill the display, the result as shown is an enlarged image 118 b. Alternatively, the cut-out stabilized image can be zoomed back to the original size for display so that it appears as that shown as image 118 a. -
FIG. 2 shows a single frame having anarea 202 equal to the horizontal axis multiplied by the vertical axis. As discussed above, the image sequence is formed from a temporal sequence of frames, each frame having an area. The area of the frames is divided into one or moreforeground area portions 204 and one or morebackground area portions 206 in an image that corresponds to the one shown inFIG. 1 in composition. In the illustrated embodiment, the foreground pixel domain substantially corresponds to the inner area portion, and the background pixel domain substantially corresponds to the outer boundary. However, the foreground and background may be reversed, or side-by-side, or in any configuration depending upon the composition of the image. In other words, the foreground portion generally includes the portion of the image, which is the principal subject of the captured image, and is more likely to have intended movement between temporally sequential frames. The background portion generally includes portions of the image, which are stable or pan across at a deliberate rate. - For evaluation and stabilization processing, the background may be distinguished from the foreground in different manners, a number of which are described herein. In at least some embodiments, the background may be determined by isolating corner sectors of the frames of the sequence of frames and then forming the background pixel domain to correspond to the corner sectors. A predetermined number of background pixel domains, such as corner sectors may be included.
- Briefly turning to
FIG. 3 , there are four corner sectors shown. It may be preferred to manually divide the area of the frames into sub-areas including a foreground area portion and background area portion. In any case, the foreground and the background may include different types and/or amounts of motion. The background which is otherwise substantially static (or moving substantially uniformly), can be used to more readily identify and/or isolate motion consistent with hand motion. The foreground may include additional motion, for example, the motion of a person in conversation. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the background area portion can be located by locating a sub-area having a motion amplitude value that is below a predetermined threshold value, such as that corresponding to hand motion. In another embodiment, selecting the background pixel domain includes locating one or more sub-areas that are substantially static or moving substantially uniformly between evaluated frames. Alternatively, dividing the area of frames may be provided by locating a sub-area having motion which corresponds to the foreground area. -
FIG. 2 represents a single frame in a sequence of frames. In a standard configuration as shown inFIG. 2 , a background pixel domain is selected for evaluation from the background area portion of the frames. The background pixel domain is used to generate an evaluation. Subsequent stabilization processing can be calculated between corresponding pairs of a sub-sequence of select frames. -
FIG. 3 shows two frames in time, both having corner sectors. Sub-images in this example are corner sectors S1, S2, S3 and S4, and correspond to potential background area portions of the image.FIG. 3 further illustrates thatframe 1 andframe 2 are a temporal sequence of frames. It is understood that a sequence of frames can include more than two frames. A subsequence of select frames can include consecutive select frames. A subsequence of select frames may also include alternating or frames selected using any desired criteria, where the resulting selected frames have a known time displacement. It is further understood that any selection of frames is within the scope of this discussion. Generally, frames in the subsequence may retain their sequential order. InFIG. 3 ,frame 1 is generated at time t1, andframe 2 is generated at time t2, with t2>t1. The evaluation of the sub-images for the stabilization of a sequence of frames will be discussed in more detail below. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of the method as described herein. As discussed above, the image is divided into foreground andbackground area portions 402. From the background area the background pixel domain is selected forevaluation 404. Four corners can be selected as shown inFIG. 3 . As will be discussed in more detail below, the background pixel domain, here, four corners, is evaluated for application ofstabilization 406. That is, evaluation includes summation and displacement determination. Then stabilization which includes calculating a global motion vector and applying a shift of the corresponding image in theimage sequence 408.Evaluation 406 andstabilization 408 are grouped together 410, to be discussed further in connection withFIG. 5 below. It is understood, that the order of the steps described herein may be ordered differently to arrive at the same result. - Similarly, modules are shown in
FIG. 1 that can carry out the method. Hardware (such as circuit components) orsoftware modules 116, or a combination of both, can include a determiningmodule 122 for determining the background portion of the frames. The modules further include a formingmodule 124 for forming a background pixel domain from the background portion, anevaluation module 126 for evaluating the background pixel domain to generate an evaluation for subsequent stabilization processing and anapplication module 128 for applying stabilization processing based on the evaluation to the area of the frames of the sequence of frames. Additionally,FIG. 1 shows adetermination module 130 to carry out the steps of determining horizontal displacement components of the vertical pixel columns and the vertical displacement components of the horizontal pixel rows of the frames of the sequence of frames to generate the evaluation. Also shown is acalculation module 132 for calculating a global motion vector by determining an average of middle range values for the horizontal displacement components and an average of middle range values for the vertical displacement components. -
FIG. 5 shows more details of steps of theevaluation 406 andstabilization 408 processes ofFIG. 4 . The step of evaluation of thebackground pixel domain 406 includes calculating displacement components of elements within the pixel groupings. The frames include pixels, typically arranged in two dimensional (for example, horizontal and vertical) pixel arrays. In this embodiment, displacement components include a pair of substantially orthogonal displacement vectors. Pixels may also be disposed in other regular or irregular arrangements. It will be understood that the steps of the method disclosed herein may readily be adapted to any pixel arrangement. In the embodiment discussed herein, corner sectors include orthogonal pixel arrays. To calculate displacement components, the pixel values in a vertical direction are summed 502 to determine ahorizontal displacement vector 504, and the pixel values in a horizontal direction are summed 506 to determine avertical displacement vector 508. - Apparent displacement between pixel arrays in the background pixel domain of a temporal sequence of frames is an indication of motion. Such apparent displacement is determined by the above-described calculation of horizontal and vertical displacement vectors. By considering displacement of the background pixel domain instead of the entire area, low computational complexity can be provided. In
stabilization 408, the result of the background pixel domain displacement calculations 510 can then be translated into global motion vectors to be applied to the image as a whole 512 for the sequence of frames. Applying stabilization processing based on the background evaluation includes calculating a global motion vector for application to the frames 510. Calculating the global motion vector includes determining an average of middle range values for the vertical displacements components and an average of middle range values for the horizontal displacement components. In stabilization, compensating for displacement includes shifting the image and reusing some or all of the outer boundary as part of the stabilized image by changing the address in memory from which the pixel array is read 514. - Below is a more detailed description of certain aspects of the methods and circuits described above. Prior to the
evaluation 406, picture pre-processing can be performed on the captured image frame to enhance or extract the information which will be used in the motion vector estimation. The pixel values may be formatted according to industry standards. For example, when the picture is in Bayer format the green values are generally used for the whole global motion estimation process. Alternatively, if the picture is in YCbCr format, the luminance (Y) data can be used. Pre-processing may include a step of applying a band-pass filter on the image to remove high frequencies produced by noise and the low frequencies produced by flicker and shading. - In the
evaluation 406, two projection pixel arrays are generated from the background area portions, particularly sub-images of the image data (seeFIG. 3 ). Projection pixel arrays are created by projecting onto one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional pixel values, by summing the pixels which have in the sub-image a particular horizontal index, thus resulting in a projection onto the horizontal axis of the original two-dimensional sub-image. A corresponding process is performed for the vertical index. Accordingly, one projection pixel array is composed of the sums of values along each column and the other projection pixel array is composed of the sums of values along each row as represented in the following mathematical formulae: - A sub-image can be shifted relative to the corresponding sub-image in a preceding select frame by ±N pixels in the horizontal direction and by ±M pixels in the vertical direction, or by any number of pixels between these limits. The set of shift correspondences between sub-images of select frames constitutes candidate motion vectors. For each candidate motion vector, the value of an error criterion can be determined as described below.
- An error criterion can be defined and calculated between two consecutive corresponding sub-images for various motion vector candidates. The candidates can correspond to a (2M+1) pixel×(2N+1) pixel search window. There is a search window for each sub-image. The search window can be larger than the sub-image by the amount of the buffer region. The search window can be square although it may take any shape. The candidate providing the lowest value for the error criterion can be used as the motion vector of the sub-image. The accuracy of the determination of motion may depend on the number of candidates investigated and the size of the sub-image. The two projection arrays (for rows and columns) can be used separately and the error criterion which is the sum of absolute differences is calculated for 2N+1 shift values for the horizontal candidates, and calculated for 2M+1 shift values for the vertical candidates.
- The horizontal shift minimizing the criterion for the array of column sums (Ck X) can be chosen as the horizontal component of the sub-image motion vector. The vertical shift minimizing the criterion for the array of row sums (Ck y) can be chosen as the vertical component of the sub-image motion vector.
- From the sub-image motion vectors, the median value for the horizontal component and the median value for the vertical component may be chosen. Choosing the median value may eliminate impulses and unreliable motion vectors from areas with local motion different from the global motion that behave like impulses. The sub-image motion vectors and the global motion vector of the previous frame may furthermore be used to produce the output. The previous frame global motion vector can be used as a basis for subsequent frame global motion vecors, because it can be expected that two consecutive frames will have similar motion. For the case of four sub-images the global image motion vector (Vg) is calculated as:
V g t=median{V 1 t ,V 2 t ,V 3 t ,V 4 t ,V 8 t−1}
where V1 t, V2 t, V3 t, and V4 t are the motion vectors chosen for the four sub-images. It is understood that “t” and “t−1” are used herein for notational convenience and not to connote that immediately consecutive frames be used necessarily. As mentioned previously, alternating frames or other choices for a subsequence of frames may be used, and are within the scope of this disclosure. - Also, a procedure can be used to evaluate camera motion from the beginning of the capture and make the compensation adaptive to intentional camera motion, such as panning. This method includes calculating an integrated motion vector that is a linear combination of the current motion vector and previous motion vectors with a damping coefficient. The integral motion vector converges to zero when there is no camera motion.
V i(t)=k*V i(t−1)+V g(t) (2) - In the above equation Vi denotes the integrated motion vector for estimating camera motion and Vg denotes the global motion vector for the consecutive pictures at moments (t−1) and t. The damping coefficient k can be selected to have a value between 0.9 and 0.999 to achieve smooth camera motion compensation for hand shaking caused jitter while adapting to intentional camera motion (panning).
- In addition to the subjective improvement of the observed sequence, another aspect of video stabilization is the ability to reduce bit rate for encoding the stabilized sequence. The global motion vector calculated during stabilization may improve motion compensation and reduce the amount of residual data which needs to be discrete cosine transform (DCT) coded. Two different scenarios are considered when combining the stabilization with video encoding. First, stabilization can be performed prior to the video encoding, as a separate preprocessing step, and stabilized images are used by the video encoder. Second, stabilization becomes an additional stage within the video encoder, where global motion information is extracted from the already previously calculated motion vectors and then the global motion is used in further encoding stages.
- As described in detail above, global motion vectors can be defined as two dimensional (horizontal and vertical) displacements from one frame to another, evaluated from the background pixel domain by considering sub-images. Furthermore, an error criterion is defined and the value of this criterion is determined for different motion vector candidates. The candidate having the lowest value of the criterion can be selected as the result for a sub-image. The most common criterion is the sum of absolute differences. A choice for motion vectors for horizontal and vertical directions can be calculated separately, and the global two dimensional motion vector can be defined using these components. For example, the median horizontal value, among the candidates chosen for each sub-image, and the median vertical value, among the candidates chosen for each sub-image, can be chosen as the two components of the global motion vector. The global motion can thus be calculated by dividing the image into sub-images, calculating motion vectors for the sub-images and using an evaluation or decision process to determine the whole image global motion from the sub-images. The images of the sequences of images can be accordingly shifted, a portion or all of the outer boundary being eliminated, to reduce or eliminate unintentional motion of the image sequence.
