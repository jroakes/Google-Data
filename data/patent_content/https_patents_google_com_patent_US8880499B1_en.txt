Definitions
- Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention relate generally to information aggregation systems and, more particularly, to personalization of news content aggregated by a news aggregation service.
- Existing content aggregation services search out, and aggregate, news, blogs, RSS (real simple syndication) feeds and other content published on web pages throughout the Internet.
- the news aggregation service in response to a search query from a user, or when a user browses a newspaper section of the news aggregation service, the news aggregation service presents a list of stories, from the aggregated news content, relevant to the query or to the newspaper section requested, with each story involving a group of articles from different publications dealing with the same topic.
- users must periodically access the news aggregation service, re-enter a search query and view relevant news stories.
- a method may include fetching news content from a plurality of news source servers; aggregating the news content; presenting the aggregated news content to a user; receiving a request to remove a news item from the aggregated news content; and presenting updated aggregated news content, where the requested news item has been removed.
- a system may include a news aggregation server to: create a news aggregation service document based on a request received from a user, identify news content from a plurality of news source servers based on the received request, present the identified news content in the news aggregation service document, receive a request from the user to remove a news item from the news aggregation service document, remove the requested news item from the news aggregation service document based on the received request, to form an updated news aggregation service document, and present the updated news aggregation service document.
- a news aggregation server may include a memory configured to store instructions and news content and a processing unit to execute the instructions in memory to index news content from a number of news source servers, receive a request for a news aggregation service document from a user, aggregate news content from the memory based on the received request, where the news content includes a plurality of news items, present the aggregated news content to the user in the news aggregation service document, receive a request to remove a selected news item from the news aggregation service document, remove the selected news item from the news aggregation service document, retrieve a replacement news item from the memory, and present an updated news aggregation service document to the user, the updated news aggregation service document including the replacement news item.
- a method may include aggregating news content from a news source server; ranking the aggregated news content; presenting the ranked, aggregated news content to a user; receiving a request to archive a news item from the aggregated news content; removing the requested news item from the aggregated news content to form updated aggregated news content; re-ranking the updated, aggregated news content based on the received archive request; and presenting the re-ranked, updated aggregated news content to the user.
- a system may include a news aggregation server to index news content from a plurality of news source servers, receive a request for a news aggregation service document from a user, aggregate the indexed news content based on the received request, determine when a news item in the news content has been previously accessed by the user, remove the previously accessed news item from the aggregated news content, and presenting the aggregated, indexed news content to the user in the news aggregation service document.

- the client/server entity may perform these operations in response to processor 320 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 330 .
- a computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave.
- the software instructions may be read into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 350 , or from another device via communication interface 380 .
- the software instructions contained in memory 330 may cause processor 320 to perform operations or processes that will be described later.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are flowcharts of exemplary processing for creating and updating a news aggregation service document according to one implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- the processing exemplified by FIGS. 4A and 4B may be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 330 , ROM 340 or storage device 350 of server 220 .
- the processing exemplified by FIGS. 4A and 4B may be implemented in hardwired circuitry, such as combinational logic, within server 220 .
- processing may begin with server 220 accessing external news content (e.g., from server(s) 230 ), fetching the news content and aggregating the fetched news content (act 400 ).
- server 220 may use a news crawler (e.g., a web robot) that may access news content documents hosted by news source server(s) 230 .
- News source server(s) 230 may host, for example, news content from the Washington Post, the New York Times, or other news content sites.
- the fetched news content may then be indexed and grouped, using conventional indexing and grouping algorithms (act 402 ).
- Server 220 may then receive a user request for a news aggregation service document meeting one or more criteria (act 404 ).
- the received criteria may indicate that the user wishes to access a generalized news content page.
- the user request may include a query indicating certain keywords to be contained within the retrieved content to indicate the types of content desired by the user.
- Server 220 may then search the indexed news content based on the received request to identify news content meeting the submitted criteria (act 406 ).
- any identified news content matches news content previously accessed by the user or matches news content “removed” by the user from a previous version of the news aggregation service document (act 408 ). If so, the previously accessed or removed content, and possibly related news content, may be disregarded (act 410 ), and new content matching the user request may be retrieved from the identified news content (act 412 ).
- the process proceeds directly to act 414 , where the identified content is ranked based on various criteria, such as freshness, user preference, etc.
- indications regarding whether content was previously accessed or removed may be used to rank the identified content. For example, “removed” content may result in similar or related news content receiving a reduced ranking.
- headlines, snippets, images and/or links to the highest ranking matching content may be retrieved (act 416 ) and presented to the user in a news aggregation service document (act 418 ).
- FIG. 5 is a diagram of an exemplary news aggregation service document 500 according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- initial news aggregation service document 500 may include a set 502 of news content listings 504 matching the received criteria.
- news aggregation service document 500 may be a web page that includes a series of hypertext links 506 associated with the identified news content listings 504 as well as headlines 508 , snippets 510 and/or images 512 relating to listings 504 .
- news aggregation service document 500 may also include a number of categories 514 , and groupings 516 for displaying related news content listings together.
- each news content listing 504 , category 514 , or grouping 516 provided on news aggregation service document 500 may also include a “remove” option 518 for enabling users to delete or otherwise remove the associated news content from news aggregation service document 500 .
- remove option 518 Upon selection of remove option 518 , as will be described in additional detail below, a subsequent news aggregation service document 500 may be provided that does not include the “removed” content.
- the user's responsive actions may then be identified (act 420 ).
- the user may click on or otherwise select one of the news content links 506 provided on news aggregation service document 500 and thereby navigate away from news aggregation service document 500 .
- server 220 may receive an indication from client 210 indicating the link 506 selected by the user as well as any relevant additional information, such as the time the selection was made, etc. (act 422 ).
- Server 220 may then store this indication in association with the user or with client 210 (act 424 ), so as to facilitate use of this information in accordance with the user's news viewing preferences, such as in act 408 described above. In this manner, previously accessed content may be removed from news aggregation service document 500 thereby increasing the “freshness” of the content.
- previously accessed news content indications may be stored at server 220 , at server 230 , or at client 210 associated with the user, or at some combination of server 220 , server 230 , or client 210 .
- a “cookie,” or an identifier contained in a “cookie” that is, in turn, mapped to the stored information may be used in some implementations consistent with the principles of the invention.
- the process may then return to act 404 for subsequent requests for the news aggregation service document.
- removal of previously accessed content may be performed following a predetermined period of time from the initial news content access. In this manner, users desiring to access related news content included within the same grouping as the previously accessed news content may still be provided with the grouping. Following expiration of the predetermined time period (e.g., 1 hour), the content may be removed from subsequent presentations of news aggregation service document 500 .
- a predetermined period of time e.g. 1 hour
- server 220 may receive a user selection of “remove” option 518 relating to a news content listing 504 , category 514 , or grouping 516 (act 426 ). In response, server 220 may store an indication of the user selection of the remove option 518 (act 428 ). The process may then return to act 414 where the remaining news content documents may be ranked in view of the received removal request. As described above, in one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, removal of a news content document may result in reduced importance or relevance being placed on related or similar news content documents.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of another exemplary news aggregation service document 600 according to another implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- news aggregation service document 600 may include a set 602 of news content listings 604 matching the received criteria.
- Set 602 may include a series of hypertext links 606 associated with the identified news content listings 604 as well as headlines 608 , snippets 610 and/or images 612 relating to listings 604 .
- news aggregation service document 600 may also include a number of categories 614 , and groupings 616 for presenting related news content listings together.
- each news content listing 604 , category 614 , or grouping 616 provided on news aggregation service document 600 may also include a “remove” option 618 and/or an “archive” option 620 .
- options 618 and 620 may be used to facilitate user-initiated refreshing of content listing 604 .
- the system Upon receipt of a user selection of remove option 618 , the system performs in a manner similar to that set forth above in FIG. 4 . That is, the associated news content listing 604 is removed from news aggregation service document 600 , and its removal is reflected in the ranking of available news content documents.
- the associated news content listing 604 is removed from news aggregation service document 600 .
- the removal of the document is not considered in subsequent ranking of available news content documents.
- previously “archived” news content listings may be presented to the user upon receipt of a user selection of a “view archived content” option 622 . In this manner, news content listings 604 previously removed from news aggregation service document 600 may be re-presented to the user for subsequent selection.
- news items may be removed or archived for a predetermined period of time.
- a suitable option e.g., a “Remove for this session” option
- a selected news item or grouping of news items may be removed from the news aggregation service document.
- the removed stories may be re-inserted into the news aggregation service document.
- news content may be customized in time, while enabling users to re-visit removed documents at a later time.
- the predetermined period of time may be a session time (where “session” may be defined as a sequence of queries or interactions by the same user).
- Other suitable time periods may include an hour, a day, etc.
- an “undo” option may be included for enabling users to undo or reverse recently performed removal or archiving operations.
- such an undo option would reverse the most recent listing removal selection.
- the undo option would reverse all removal operations during the current session.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram of an exemplary news aggregation service document 700 according to another implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- news aggregation service document 700 may include a set 702 of news content listings 704 matching any received criteria.
- Set 702 may include a series of hypertext links 706 associated with the identified news content listings 704 as well as headlines 708 , snippets 710 and/or images 712 relating to listings 704 .
- Each news content listing 704 provided on news aggregation service document 700 may also include a “demote” option 718 .
- “demote” option 718 may be used to facilitate user-initiated re-sorting or re-ranking of set 702 .
- the system may demote or otherwise reduce the ranking of the associated listing 704 . This may result in the listing 704 being removed from the set 702 presented to the user on news aggregation service document 700 . However, rather than eliminate the associated listing 704 from potential presentation, the listing is demoted in ranking. In this manner, subsequent requests for news content listings related to the associated listing would result in the re-presentation of listing 704 .
- demotion of the listing 704 may be considered during subsequent user requests for the news aggregation service document.
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may facilitate user interaction with a news aggregation service, to thereby improve the freshness and quality of the presented content. Based on user selections, presented news content listings or groups of listings may be removed from the presented content. Furthermore, user actions may be used to facilitate subsequent ranking and presentation of additional news content listings.
