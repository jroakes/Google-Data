Description
The application relates to the copending United States application of the docket No.CS40041 meanwhile submitted to, and its content is incorporated in this by reference.
Technical field
It relates to radio communication, and more specifically it relates to the radio link in wireless communication terminal monitors.
Background technology
Third generation partner program (3GPP) can be applied evolved universal terrestrial radio based on the whole world and access (E-UTRA), is currently in use physical layer exploitation Long Term Evolution (LTE) system.The mobile terminal or the platform (MS) that are also known as subscriber equipment (UE) can use the measurement based on cell specific reference signal as tolerance, to be determined by link whether can supporting to have the transmitting of physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) code word of particular downlink message format, it is determined that be Tong Bu or asynchronous with the radio link of base station.
In the Release-8/9/10 of 3GPP, such as or the UE layer 1 of physical layer such as from the downlink radio link quality of base station monitoring Serving cell, for indicating the purpose of radio problem detection state or radio link quality to higher level.Radio problem monitors can based on cell specific reference signal.Under non-discontinuous reception (non-DRX) pattern operates, such as when UE is not at sleep pattern, UE in each radio frame relies on and detects the threshold value (being also known as Qout and Qin) that the related request of asynchronous (OOS) and synchronization (IS) condition implicitly limits by being used for, the quality that detection is measured in time period, wherein term " sync " is to synchronize.For each radio frame, when quality is more worse than threshold value Qout, UE indicates radio problem detection to higher level, and continue to monitor, until (a) quality is than threshold value Qin is better or (b) radio bearer setup complete (RLF) is announced (after specific timer expiration) and radio link recovery process is activated.Generally, stand to be switched to another Serving cell (measuring based on the measurement or network assistance that are supplied to eNB by UE) with the UE of the radio link quality problem of a Serving cell (or strengthen node B (eNB) or strengthen base station).But, such as UE is in the state being connected to Serving cell, but UE is suddenly subjected to severe persistent quality to be reduced and can not take office situation about what is the need ceasing from cell receiver, and radio bearer setup complete occurs, and thinks that radio link recovery process is useful.
Whether it is implemented to particular downlink generally, based on reference PDCCH block error rate (BLER) and controls channel configuration, limit requirement.Such as; for Rel-8/9/10LTE; assume such as corresponding to there is the protection of the highest code (owing to using eight CCE; wherein; eight maximums being to be allocated for DCI) little payload size downlink (DL) authorize (being used for dispatching data or broadcast control transmission) eight CCE polymerization grade communicating downlinks control information (DCI) form 1A; if it is assumed that or become greater than 10% with reference to PDCCHBLER, report OOS from lower level to higher level.Assume to transmit DCI format 1C (there is specific different payload size) at 4CCE polymerization grade, such as, downlink control messages with transmission beep-page message or system information (it can be generally broadcast message) be associated (being used for dispatching), if it is assumed that or drop to less than 2% with reference to PDCCHBLER, then report IS condition.Strengthening in Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) at Rel-10, base station (or eNB) can configure UE further, with only at the sub-centralized watch radio link quality of subframe.Based on OOS and IS event, if it is determined that radio link quality is poor, then can announce radio bearer setup complete (RLF).
In Rel-11, such as strengthen PDCCH (ePDCCH) strengthen control channel can be destined for supporting increase controls channel capacity ability, support the ability of frequency domain ICIC, realize controlling the ability of the room for improvement multiplexing of channel resource, support the ability of beam shaping and/or diversity and/or to new carrier type and the ability that operates in multicast/broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) subframe.
If specifying to strengthen and controlling channel, the then problem that there is adaptive radio link monitoring (RLM).Particularly, when eNB uses ePDCCH to communicate with UE as control channel, it is necessary to perform RLM on Uu (eNB-UE) link at UE place.
