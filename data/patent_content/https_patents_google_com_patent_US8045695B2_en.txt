- a system and method relate to determining the active copresence of users during interactions, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to providing degrees of active copresence to social and communication applications.
- the degree of active copresence may represent a level of engagement of a user during an interaction.
- a user may be interacting with one or more individuals, such as in a meeting.
- the user's degree of active copresence during the meeting may represent the degree to which the user was actively engaged in the meeting, as opposed to being passively engaged in the meeting.
- the user may be considered to be passively engaged in the meeting when the user is engaging in communications with non-present individuals, such as emails, voice mails, text messages, or generally any communications with non-present individuals.
- a user's degree of active copresence during an interaction may represent the level of which the user was actively engaged with copresent individuals during the interaction.
- the system may provide a user with their degree of active copresence during an interaction with one or more copresent individuals.
- the interaction may be a meeting, a conference call, or generally any primary interaction requiring the active copresence of the user.
- the degree of active copresence may be based on the number of secondary interactions the user may have with non-present individuals during the interaction.
- Providing a user with their degree of active copresence may allow the user to prioritize future interactions. For example, if a user has a low degree of active copresence for a particular interaction, the user may wish to avoid similar interactions in the future. Conversely, if a user has a high degree of active copresence during a particular interaction the user may wish to prevent interruptions during similar interactions in the future.
- the system may provide a user with their degree of active copresence relative to a particular individual.
- the degree of active copresence relative to a particular individual may incorporate only the user's interactions with the particular individual.
- the user may use the degree of active copresence relative to the individual to prioritize future interactions with the individual. For example, if the user has demonstrated a low degree of active copresence relative to a particular individual, the user may wish to avoid future interactions with the individual. Alternatively or in addition, if the user has demonstrated a high degree of active copresence with an individual the user may wish to prevent interruptions during interactions with the individual. Alternatively or in addition the degree of active copresence relative to an individual may be used to rank the relative importance of the individuals to the user, such as in a social network.
- the system may allow the user to automate interaction prioritization using the relative degrees of active copresence. For example, if the user's degree of active copresence relative to an individual is high, the system may automatically prevent the user from being interrupted during interactions with the individual, such as by routing all phone calls directly to voicemail. Conversely, if the user's degree of active copresence relative to an individual is low, the system may allow secondary interactions to interrupt the interaction with the individual, such as phone calls, emails, or text messages.
- the system may provide an employer with a degree of copresence of an employee while at work.
- the system may determine how much time during the day the user spends on non-work related activities and may calculate a degree of work active copresence.
- the system may provide the degree of work active copresence to the user or to the employer of the user.
- the system may provide a user with a degree of work/life balance.
- the degree of work/life balance may be based on the amount of time the user spends on work interactions while at home and the amount of time the user spends on home interactions while at work.
- the system may provide an organization with the degree of work/life balance of their employees. The organization may use the degrees of work/life balance to manage the workloads of the employees.

For example, the system 100 may determine that the user 130 types three characters per second. Thus, if an email is thirty characters long, the system 100 may estimate the amount of time spent on the email as ten seconds. Alternatively or in addition the system 100 may monitor the activities of the user 130 on the device 135 in real-time, such as through a process running on the device 135 of the user 130 .

- the primary interactions of the user 130 with the copresent individual A 110 A may be retrieved from a calendar application or scheduling application utilized by the user 130 .
- the system 100 may determine the quality score of the primary interactions with the copresent individual A 110 A.
- the quality score may be based on one or more characteristics of the primary interactions 105 , such as the length of the primary interactions 105 , the subject matter of the primary interactions 105 , the intimacy, or relationship, of the user 130 with the copresent individuals 110 A-N, the business or nature of the primary interactions 130 , the interaction history between the user 130 and the copresent individuals 110 A-N, or generally any characteristic capable of describing the primary interactions 105 .

- the system 100 may identify secondary interactions the user 130 engaged in while engaged in a primary interaction 105 with the copresent individual A 110 A.
- the system 100 may determine the total quality score of the secondary interactions.
- the total quality score of the secondary interactions may be based on one or more characteristics of each secondary interaction, such as the length of each secondary interaction, the subject matter of each secondary interaction, the intimacy, or relationship, of the user 130 with the non-present individual A 120 A engaged in each secondary interaction, the business or nature of each secondary interaction, the interaction history between the user 130 and the non-present individual A 120 A, or generally any characteristic capable of describing the secondary interaction.
- each quality score may be the length of each secondary interaction and the total quality score may be the total length of the secondary interactions.
- the system 100 may determine the degree of active copresence of the user 130 relative to the copresent individual A 110 A.
- the degree of active copresence relative to the copresent individual A 110 A may be calculated by subtracting the total length of the simultaneous secondary interactions from the total length of the primary interactions, and dividing the result by the total length of the primary interactions.

- An address book application providing the degree of active copresence relative to a copresent individual A 110 A may be discussed in more detail in FIG. 9 below.
- the degree of active copresence relative to the copresent individual A 110 A may also be used to determine whether the user 130 should be interrupted by secondary interactions while engaged in a primary interaction 105 with the copresent individual A 110 A. For example, if device 135 receives a request for a secondary interaction, such a phone call, while the user 130 is engaged in a primary interaction 105 with the copresent individual A 110 A, the system 100 may determine whether the degree of active copresence relative to the copresent individual A 110 A satisfies an interrupt threshold. If the degree of active copresent relative to the copresent individual A 110 A does not satisfy the interrupt threshold the device 135 may automatically prevent the secondary interaction request from interrupting the primary interaction 105 , such as by forwarding a phone call directly to voicemail. Thus, the interrupt threshold allows the user 130 to avoid interruptions while engaged in primary interactions with a copresent individual A 110 A with a high relative degree of active copresence. The interrupt threshold may be discussed in more detail in FIG. 7 below.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating operations of determining a user's degree of work/life balance in the system of FIG. 1 , or other systems for determining the active copresence of users during interactions.

In order to determine the degree of active copresence at work relative to the home group the system 100 may determine the total length of the work timeframe. The system 100 may then determine the amount of time the user 130 was engaged in secondary interactions with non-present individuals 120 A-N in the home group during the work timeframe. The system 100 may then subtract the total time spent on the secondary interactions from the total length of the work timeframe and divide the result by the total length of the work timeframe. Alternatively or in addition the system 100 may multiply the result by 100, such as to generate a whole number.

- the system 100 may provide the degree of work/life balance to the user 130 .
- the degree of work/life balance may be presented to the user 130 as a number or may be presented to the user 130 through a chart or graphic. For example, if the degree of work/life balance is calculated by dividing the degree of active copresence at work relative to the home group by the degree of active copresence at home relative to the work group, a degree of work/life balance greater than one may indicate that the work life balance favors work, while a degree of work/life balance less than one may indicate that the work/life balance favors home.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating operations of determining an interaction acceptance value for an individual in the system of FIG. 1 , or other systems for determining the active copresence of users during interactions.
- the system 100 may identify an individual the user 130 receives secondary interaction requests from, such as phone calls, text messages, instant messages, or generally any mode of initiating communications with the user 130 . The individual may be identified in an address book application of the user 130 .
- the system 100 may determine the number of secondary interaction requests the user 130 received from the identified individual while engaged in a primary interaction.
- the system 100 may determine the number of the secondary interaction requests which were accepted by the user 130 .
- An interaction request may be deemed accepted if the user 130 engages in a secondary interaction with the individual in response to the interaction request. For example, in the case of a phone call, the request may be deemed accepted if the user 130 answers the phone call. In the case of a text message, email, or instant message, the request may be deemed accepted if the user 130 responds to the text message, email or instant message during the primary interaction.
- the system 100 may calculate an interaction acceptance value for the individual.

Alternatively or in addition the interaction acceptance value may be displayed to the user 130 with incoming secondary interaction requests from the individual. Alternatively or in addition the interaction acceptance value may be used to determine whether to automatically block incoming secondary interaction requests from the individual during primary interactions, such as by sending phone calls directly to voicemail.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating operations of interaction request handling in the system of FIG. 1 , or other systems for determining the active copresence of users during interactions.
- the system 100 may receive a request for a secondary interaction during a primary interaction, such as an incoming phone call, email, text message, instant message, or generally any mode of initiating communications with the user 130 .
- the system 100 may calculate the interaction acceptance value for the individual initiating the secondary interaction request. Calculating the interaction acceptance value for an individual may be described in more detail in FIG. 6 above.
- the system 100 may determine whether the interaction acceptance value for the individual requesting the secondary interaction meets an interaction interrupt threshold.
- the interaction interrupt threshold may represent a criteria for determining whether the user 130 should be interrupted during a primary interaction. For example, the user 130 may set the interrupt threshold to a high number, such as 90, if the user 130 does not want to frequently be interrupted during primary interactions. In this case, the interaction interrupt threshold would only be satisfied by an individual with an interaction acceptance value greater than 90, which would presumably be individuals whose communications are most important to the user 130 . Alternatively if the user 130 doesn't mind being interrupted during a primary interaction, the user 130 may set the interaction interrupt threshold to a lower number, such as 50. In this case any individuals with an interaction acceptance value greater than 50 will satisfy the interaction interrupt threshold.
- the system 100 may calculate the degree of active copresence for the primary interaction the user 130 is engaged in.
- the interaction interrupt threshold may also incorporate a degree of active copresence component in order to account for the importance of the primary interaction. For example, the interaction interrupt threshold may only be met if the degree of active copresence of the primary interaction is below a certain number, such as 80. In this case the user 130 will only be interrupted with secondary interactions if the degree of active copresence is less than 80.
- the incorporation of the degree of active copresence of the primary interaction allows the user 130 to specify when primary interactions should not be interrupted, such as by setting the degree of active copresence component of the interrupt threshold to 100.
- the system 100 may move to block 740 .
- the system 100 may allow the secondary interaction request and notify the user 130 of the secondary interaction request. For example, if the secondary interaction request is a phone call, the system 100 may allow the device 135 of the user 130 to receive the call. If the request is a text message, email or instant message, the system 100 may provide the message to the device 135 of the user 130 . The system 100 may run processes on the device 135 of the user 130 which control whether the device 135 receives a phone call.
- the system 100 may move to block 750 .
- the system 100 may ignore the request, and withhold notification of the request from the user 130 .
- the system 100 may cause the call to route directly to the voicemail of the user 130 .
- the system 100 may allow the call to proceed to the device 135 of the user 130 , but may prevent the device 135 from notifying the user 130 .
- the system 100 may cause the device 135 of the user 130 to enter a silent mode for the incoming call.
- the system 100 may withhold the message from being forwarded to the user 130 until the primary interaction 105 has completed.
- the system 100 may allow the message to be communicated to the user 130 , but the system 100 may prevent the device 135 from notifying the user 130 .
- the system 100 may cause the device 135 to enter a silent mode before receiving the message.
- the system 100 may be able to control the device 135 through an application installed on the device 135 .

- the user 130 may use estimated degrees of active copresence, such as the estimated degree of active copresence 835 , to evaluate conflicting appointments. For example, if the user 130 has two conflicting appointments scheduled, the user 130 may choose to attend the appointment with the higher estimated degree of active copresence. Alternatively or in addition, if the user 130 schedules two conflicting appointments the system 100 may automatically cancel the appointment with the lower estimated degree of active copresence 835 and notify the user 130 of the cancellation.
