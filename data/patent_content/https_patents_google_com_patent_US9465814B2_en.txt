Definitions
- This invention relates to digital data processing and, in particular, to annotating search results with images.
- search engines present users with search results that include selectable links that can take users to particular Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for more detailed information. Search results are typically ranked according to their relevance to the search query as determined by the search engine.
- URLs Uniform Resource Locators
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: obtaining an image associated with each of a plurality of different websites and associating each obtained image with a domain of the respective website; receiving a plurality of search results responsive to a query, each search result referring to a corresponding web page; for one or more of the search results, annotating the search result with an obtained image associated with a domain of the search result's corresponding web page; and providing the search results including the annotated search results wherein user selection of an annotated search result's image will cause a local search of the website associated with the image based on the query.
- Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Obtaining an image associated with each of a plurality of different websites can further comprise determining that a website in the plurality of different websites is on a list of predetermined websites; and obtaining the image in response to the determination.
- the list of predetermined websites can consist of those websites under the control of an entity that provides the plurality of search results responsive to a query.
- Obtaining an image can further comprise checking a specific location in a directory tree of a website for a file with a designated name; and sending a copy of the file to a server for storage.
- the specific location can be a root directory of the website.
- Obtaining an image associated with each of the plurality of websites can further comprise altering the image.
- Altering the image can include removing a border from the image. Altering the image can include resizing the image.
- the provided annotated search results can be presented with their respective images. User selection of the annotated search result's image can cause a page that presents the provided search results to expand by including an area within the page for presenting results from the local search.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic overview of an example system for annotating search results with images.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example technique for annotating search results.
- FIG. 3 illustrates example annotated search results.
- FIG. 4 illustrates example search results from the domain of a website.
- the present disclosure relates to annotating search results with images indicating the source of each search result.
- the image is a 16 ⁇ 16 or 32 ⁇ 32 pixel square icon associated with a particular website or webpage. Other image sizes are possible.
- the image can be stored in a file located in the root directory of a website, for example. However, it can also reside in other places and be referenced in the header section of an HTML page, for instance, so that a web browser will know where to look for it.
- the image is in a file named “favicon.ico”.
- the image could be a reduced in size rendering of the website's home page for the particular website that is referred to by the search result.
- the image could be a company logo or trademark associated with a company that owns the website. Such an image could be extracted from one of the website's web pages or retrieved from a database of such images using the website URL or company name as a key, for instance.
- the images are user-selectable. That is, user selection of an image (e.g., by “clicking” a mouse button or by touching a display device) initiates an action.
- the action is performed by a search within the domain of the website associated with the selected image. Other actions are possible.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic overview of an example system for annotating search results with images of related websites.
- Websites 1 -N are connected to a network 110 (e.g., the Internet). Each website is associated with a respective domain name.
- a search engine 110 is connected to the network 100 and crawls the web for information in the web pages of the various websites 1 -N. The crawled data is indexed and stored in an indexed cache 124 for later usage in extracting relevant search results in response to a search query from a user.
- An image store 126 for storing images of various websites and the association between each image and the website is also connected with the search engine 110 .
- the image store 126 can be a data table within the indexed cache for easy access.
- the search engine 110 also contains a front end 112 and a back end 116 , which are configured to serve search requests from clients, such as a browser 134 at a client 132 .
- clients such as a browser 134 at a client 132 .
- both the indexed cache 124 and the image store 126 can be accessed to retrieve search results and the associated images, and return annotated search results.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example technique for annotating search results.
- a web crawler 114 or another process crawls the web and indexes each web page crawled and stored in the index cache 124 .
- the web crawler 114 has an additional function of checking each website it visited for an image. It may check the root directory of that website for a file containing the image. If the file exists, the web crawler 114 makes a copy of the image file and sends it back to the search engine for storage in the image store 126 in association with the URL of the website to which this image is from (step 220 ). In another implementation, the web crawler 114 can also check the home page of the website for a particular location where an image file could reside.
- the web crawler follows the link in the attribute “href” to extract a copy of the file located at path/file name and then sends it back to the search engine 110 (or to another process) for storage in the image store 126 , together with the URL of the website it is associated with. If a website does not have an image file, the web crawler 114 can simply skip this website. In some implementations, the web crawler 114 will only store those images associated with a predetermined list (e.g., a list of those websites operated by the same entity that operates the search engine). An image processing module (not shown) may also be installed at the search engine 110 to process the obtained images of the websites.
- the image processing module can resize this image to 16*16 pixels and save this scaled image in image store 126 .
- the obtained image may have a border frame of some dark color.
- the image processing module can be configured to automatically detect such border frames and remove them before they are saved into the image store 126 .
- a user at a client 132 submits a search request to the search engine 110 through a browser 134 executing on the client 132 .
- a query “mobile” is submitted to the search engine webpage located at URL “http://www.google.com”.
- the front end 112 of the search engine 110 parses the query and forwards it to the back end 116 of the search engine 110 to retrieve search results responsive to the query.
- a search result can refer to a web page that contain the query term “mobile” as indicated by an entry in the indexed cache 124 .
- a search result can include a snippet of text extracted from the webpage referred to by the search result.
- a search result does not include a snippet of text.
- the back end 116 performs, at step 240 , a lookup in the image store 126 for the image associated with each of the web pages in the search results. This is achieved by checking the URL of each of the resulting web pages and using just the domain name in the URL as a key to look up in the image store 126 for its corresponding image file. For example, the URL of one of the search results is “http://www.google.com/mobile/”; the back end 116 will parse this URL to obtain the domain name “www.google.com” and use this domain name as the key to find a corresponding image for this website in the image store 126 . The obtained search results and the corresponding image files will be sent to the front end 112 for providing to the requesting client. It is possible that some search results do not have associated images in the image store 126 . In this case, the front end 112 can use a default image to present to the user together with the search result.
- FIG. 3 is an example search result page showing a search result for the query “mobile” 300 together with its associated image.
- the icon 302 is the image that is obtained from the websites from which the search results is obtained.
- the icon 302 can be further implemented with a selectable link that, when selected, performs a local search within the domain of the particular website of a search result and returns to the user search results only from that website (step 250 ). This is particularly useful when the user further wants to know search results only from a particular website. It eliminates the need of having to type in the search field the query of “mobile site:www.google.com”, for example.
- this visual representation of a website in a search result not only helps them quickly identify the important websites they may have already been familiar with in the bookmark section or the address bar of a browser, but also helps them easily find any additional search results of their submitted search query from a particular website that may be of most interest to them.
- FIG. 4 is one example of the search results after performing a local search within the domain www.google.com for the same query “mobile”. It can be seen that the input field contains a query string “mobile site:google.com” 400 , which is actually filled in by clicking on the icon 302 in FIG. 3 . This query of local search is sent to the search engine to obtain the set of search results only within the domain “www.google.com”. In some implementations, the page of the local search results in FIG. 4 is displayed by overwriting the previous page of search results as shown in FIG. 3 in the same pane of a browser.
- the page of local search results within the particular website the user is interested in can also be a popup window, another pane under a separate tab, or just a sub-pane within the page of search results as shown in FIG. 3 , which can be realized by employing the asynchronous techniques provided by asynchronous JavaScript and XML, for example.
