- the method can include selecting an item of content.
- the item of content may include a content reference tag that corresponds to the identified at least one document reference tag of the document.
- the method may select the item of content from a plurality of content items stored in a content repository. For example, if the identified document reference tag and corresponding tagged data includes the parameter name “title”, the method may select a content that includes a tag for parameter “title”. Further to this example, if the document reference tag includes the parameter name “DisplayUrl”, the method may include selecting a content that includes a content reference tag with a parameter name “DisplayUrl”. In some implementations, the method may include identifying a content that includes at least one content reference tag that corresponds to at least one document reference tag.

- one or more content reference tag or corresponding parameter may be optional. For example, if the parameter name “row2” is optional, then the content may be transmitted in response to a request even if the document does not include a document reference tag with a parameter name corresponding to “row2”. In this example, the “row2” of the content may be left blank, or it may be replaced with default content predetermined by the content provider or content management server.
- the method can include retrieving from the memory element the corresponding tagged data associated with the document reference tag. Upon retrieving the corresponding tagged data, the method may include replacing the content reference tag with the corresponding tagged data, at step 514 . In some implementations, the method may include assembling an item of content responsive to the request for content. For example, upon receiving a request for content to display on a web page, the method may select a content item with content reference tags corresponding to at least one document reference tags and replace the content reference tags with content data corresponding to the document reference tags. In some implementations, the method may include storing the assembled content in a content repository. In some implementations, the method may include storing the assembled content with the replaced content data along with the content reference tags.
