- multiple creatives may allow an advertiser to tailor targeted offers to a user who has already seen one creative associated with the advertiser.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example environment 300 in which an advertisement system 302 manages advertising services.
- the example environment 300 includes one or more networks 304 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 304 connects user devices 306 , websites 308 , advertisers 310 , and the advertisement system 302 .
- the environment 300 may include many thousands of user devices 306 , websites 308 , and advertisers 310 .
- a website 308 is one or more resources 312 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 308 is maintained by a publisher 322 , which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 308 .
- a resource 312 is any data that can be provided over the network 304 .
- a resource 312 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 312 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 306 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 304 .
- Example user devices 306 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 304 .
- a user device 306 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 304 .
- a user device 306 can request resources 312 from a website 308 .
- data representing the resource 312 can be provided to the user device 306 for presentation by the user device 306 .
- the data representing the resource 312 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
- the environment can include a search system 314 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 308 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in an indexed cache 316 .
- User devices 306 can submit search queries 320 to the search system 314 over the network 304 .
- the search system 314 accesses the indexed cache 316 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 320 .
- the search system 314 identifies the resources in the form of search results 318 and returns the search results 318 to the user devices 306 in search results pages.
- a search result 318 is data generated by the search system 314 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result 318 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- the advertisement system 302 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with the resource 312 or search results 318 .
- the request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the advertisement system 302 .
- the request for a resource need not be limited to requests from a webpage to be displayed on a user device. Requests for resources may also originate within applications on the user device, for example, mobile user applications executing on a mobile communication device.
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the advertisement slot e.g., a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 320 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the advertisement system 302 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the resource or search query 320 .
- the advertisement system 302 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”).
- eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 320 .
- advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 300 are selected as eligible advertisements by the advertisement system 302 .
- the advertisement system 302 can also select advertisements to be provided based on the actions of the user controlling user device 306 . For example, advertisements to be provided may be selected on the basis of whether the user has previously visited an advertiser's web site. Advertisements to be provided may further be selected on the basis of whether the user possess desired characteristics. For example, advertisements to be provided may be selected on the basis of whether the user fits a specific gender or age range. Advertisements to be provided may also be selected based on interest categories of a user. For example, if a user frequently visits web sites for auto enthusiasts, advertisements may be selected that are relevant to his interests.
- a targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a search query 320 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword or search query 320 .
- an advertisement associated with the targeting keyword “daisy” can be an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the resource keyword “daisy.”
- the advertisement can be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the search query “daisy.”
- a targeting keyword can also match a resource keyword or a search query 320 by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword or search query 320 despite having different text than the targeting keyword.
- an advertisement having the targeting keyword “daisy” may also be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including a resource keyword or search query for “flowers” because daisy is a type of flower, and therefore, is likely to be relevant to the term “flowers.”
- the advertisement system 302 can select the eligible advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a resource or search results page based on results of an auction. For example, the advertisement system 302 can receive bids from advertisers and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the advertisers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a “conversion” following selection of the advertisement.
- a selection i.e., a click-through
- the highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from advertisement performance, landing page scores, and the like.
- Quality scores may be measured in different ways, depending on the source of a request. For example, for queries, a quality score may be measured by advertisement relevance and landing page quality. For web pages provided by publishers, a quality score may be measured by a predicted performance on resources similar to those displaying the advertisement, and a performance of an advertisement group.
- Advertisers can also specify budgets for their advertisement campaigns.
- a budget is a specified amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for distribution of content over a specified budget period.
- the specified period can be, for example, a specified time (e.g., one day, one week, or one year), a specified number of events (e.g., a number of impressions or clicks), or some other delineation of time or events.
- a conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, or registering on a website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.

- the keywords of responsive advertisements may be related to the content of the web page provided by the publisher.
- advertisements responsive to the request may be identified based on the actions of the user or based on the particular advertisement locations, as explained above,
- Each advertisement may also be associated with a display order for each creative. The display order may be selected by the advertiser associated with the advertisement. Advertisements may be text-only, image-only, or a combination of both image and text.
- the bid amount for the advertisement may be dependent on the current creative to be provided, based on the display order for the creative. For example, a given advertisement may have three creatives. The first creative may have a bid amount of $1.00, the second creative may have a bid amount of $0.90, and the third creative may have a bid amount of $0.75. Thus, the first time the advertisement is identified at step 504 , the bid amount may be $1.00.
- a particular advertisement from the advertisements identified at step 504 is identified, based on the bid amount of the advertisement. For example, a given web page may have four display slots for advertisements. For an advertisement to be selected, it may have a bid amount associated with it that is in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query. For example, the bid amount of $1.00 may be in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query.
- a creative associated with the advertisement is provided to the publisher at step 508 .
- the creative provided at step 508 may be dependent on the display order for the creative. For example, if the advertisement identified at step 506 has three creatives associated with it, the creative which has been specified to be displayed first may be provided at step 508 .
- the creative may be provided to be presented on the web page or resource requested by the user. In one embodiment, the creative may be provided to a publisher, who then presents it along with the web page. In one embodiment, the creative may be provided to the user, or the user's web browser, which then presents the creative along with the web page.
- a second request for advertisements is received from a second publisher.
- the second publisher may be the same as the first publisher. In one embodiment, the second publisher may not be the same as the first publisher.
- the second request for advertisements may be transmitted by the publisher in response to a request from a user on a client device requesting a resource, such as a web page, provided by the second publisher.
- the second request for advertisements may be received from a mobile application executing on a mobile communications device.
- the request from the user may include a unique identifier for the client device or for a user of the client device, which may be transmitted along with the second request for advertisements.
- the client device may be identified by a unique identifier, such as an IP address or cookie, included in the query.
- the user of the client device may also be identified by a unique identifier, such as a cookie, included in the query.
- advertisements responsive to the second query may be identified.
- each advertisement may have multiple creatives, a bid amount, and a display order for each of the multiple creatives, as described with reference to step 504 .
- the bid amount for an advertisement may be dependent on the current creative to be provided, as described above.
- the bid amount may be that of the second creative of the advertisement. In the example given above, the bid amount may be $0.90.
- one of the advertisements identified at step 512 is identified, based on the bid amount, as described with reference to step 506 .
- the bid amount of $0.90 may be in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query identified at step 512 .
- a creative associated with the advertisement is provided.
- the creative may be provided to a publisher, who then presents it along with the web page or resource.
- the creative may be provided to the user, or the user's web browser, which then presents the creative along with the web page.
- the creative provided at step 516 may be dependent on the display order for the creative. For example, if the advertisement identified at step 514 and step 508 has three creatives associated with it, the creative which has been specified to be displayed second may be provided at step 516 , since the creative to be displayed first was provided at step 508 .
- a creative provider 108 may identify that the same client device submitted two queries using a unique identifier included with each query submitted by the client device.
- the unique identifier may be an IP address associated with the client device.
- a client device may be identified by a cookie or other unique identifier for the client device.
- Each query submitted by a user using a client device may include a unique identifier for the client device.
- a creative provider 108 may identify that the same user submitted two queries using a unique identifier included with each query submitted by the user. For example, a user may log in to a web site through multiple client devices, but in each case, the web site will be able to identify the user through the log-in information. Therefore, each query submitted by a user through the site may include a unique identifier for the user. The unique identifier may be presented as a cookie.
- a user may limit the scope of information collected by cookies through, for example, browser options, browser plug-ins, or through user preferences with a content provider, cookie provider, a related federated user identity system, and the like. For example, users may opt out of the collection of information by cookies for a particular cookie provider or all cookie providers through browser settings. A user may also delete cookies periodically to limit the scope of information collected. Further, privacy of user information can be protected via anonymization of user data, pseudoanonymization, separation of identity data from other data, time limitations on data storage, and the like.
- steps 402 , 404 , 406 , 408 , 410 , 412 , 414 , and 416 may be performed by the creative provider 108 . Further, steps 502 , 504 , 506 , 508 , 510 , 512 , 514 , and 516 may be performed by the creative provider 108 .
- the bid amount for each creative decreased based on the display order for the creative.
- the bid amount for each creative may increase instead.
- the advertiser may set the bid amount for a first creative to be $1.00, while the second creative may have a bid amount of $1.15.
- Such a bidding strategy may be considered by an advertiser, since after a first creative has been provided, providing a second creative related to the first may result in a greater likelihood of a conversion.
- each creative may be associated with a desired maximum number of display occurrences.
- the maximum number of display occurrences may be selected by the advertiser associated with the advertisement.
- the advertiser associated with advertisement 110 may specify that Creative_ 1 110 a should be displayed 3 times, and that Creative_ 2 110 b should be displayed 2 times.

- Creative_ 2 110 b may then be provided.
- the number of times each creative is provided may also be selected by the advertiser by specifying a budget for each creative, as described further below.
- a user who already has viewed a particular creative associated with an advertisement may no longer be presented that creative.
- the advertiser associated with advertisement 110 may specify that Creative_ 1 110 a should be displayed only once to a user. If advertisement 110 is selected for a user's query after Creative_ 1 110 a has been displayed to the user, Creative_ 1 110 a will not be shown on a subsequent selection of advertisement 110 . In this way, multiple creatives can tell a story, and advertisers may be able to effectively storyboard an advertisement campaign.
- an advertiser may specify a budget for each creative associated with an advertisement. As an example, an advertiser may have a budget of $3000 for a particular campaign. The advertiser may further select how much of that budget may be allocated to each creative associated with the particular advertisement. For example, Creative_ 1 110 a of advertisement 110 may have a budget of $1000. Creative_ 2 110 b of advertisement 110 may have a budget of $2000. In such a situation, Creative_ 1 110 a may be displayed to users until the budget of $1000 is exhausted. The remaining $2000 may be used to display Creative_ 2 110 b to users until the entire budget is exhausted.

- An advertisement or an “ad” may refer to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, messages, people, organizations, or other items are identified and promoted or otherwise communicated. Ads are not limited to commercial promotions or other communications. An ad may be a public service announcement or any other type of notice, such as a broadcast or a public notice published in printed or electronic press. In some implementations, an ad may be referred to or included in sponsored content.
- Ads (or promotional or digital content items generally) may be communicated via various mediums and in a number of forms. In some examples, ads may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical ads (e.g., banner ads), textual ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of the foregoing formats, or any form of electronically delivered advertisement. Ads may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Ads also may be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media.
- The term “ad” can refer to both a single “creative” and an “ad group.” A creative can refer to any entity that represents one ad impression. An ad impression can refer to any form of presentation of an ad, such that the ad is viewable or receivable by a user. In some examples, an ad impression may occur when an ad is displayed on a display device of a user access device. An ad group can refer, for example, to an entity that represents a group of creatives that share a common characteristic, such as having the same ad targeting criteria. Ad groups can be used to create an ad campaign. For convenience, advertisements and creatives are collectively referred to as “advertisements” herein.
- Advertisements can be identified to be presented to a user in a number of ways. In one embodiment, a user can perform a first query and an advertisement system can use the first query to identify an advertisement responsive to the first query. The advertisement system can then, for example, provide a creative of the advertisement with search results responsive to the first query.
- The user may then perform a second query. The advertisement system can use the second query to identify the same advertisement responsive to the query, and may further identify that the same user submitted both the first query and the second query. The advertisement system can then provide a second creative of the advertisement with search results responsive to the second query. The second creative provided to the user may be based on a specified display order of creatives associated with the advertisement responsive to the query.
- In one embodiment, a user may visit a web page. The web page may have one or more locations on the web page where advertising is displayed. An advertisement system may use the content of the web page to identify an advertisement responsive to the content of the web page. The advertisement system can then, for example, provide a creative of the advertisement in the location on the web page.
- The user may then visit a second web page. An advertisement system may use the content of the second web page to identify the same advertisement that was responsive to the first web page, and may further identify that the same user viewed the first and second web page. The advertisement system can then provide a second creative of the advertisement in a location on the second web page. The second creative provided to the user may be based on a specified display order of creatives associated with the advertisement responsive to the content of the web pages.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example 100 of providing multiple creatives for an advertisement. - An advertiser may provide an
advertisement 110 which includes two creatives. The advertiser may choose to showCreative_1 110 a first, andCreative_2 110 b second, when theadvertisement 110 is identified as responsive to a search query.Advertisement 110 is an advertisement that is associated with keywords “sleep” and “trouble”.Creative_1 110 a ofadvertisement 110 is “Having issues getting to bed at night?”Creative_2 110 b ofadvertisement 110 is “Still not able to sleep? Click here for help.” These keywords and the text of the creative are referred to as advertisement keywords.Advertisement 110 may further be associated with a bid amount. - A
first query 102 a is received from a browser on a client device at a time T1. Thefirst query 102 a can be received from a search engine website 104 a, and may include a unique identifier for the client device or a unique identifier for the user of the client device. Thecreative provider 108 can identifyAdvertisement 110 responsive to thefirst query 102 a.Advertisement 110 may be identified as responsive to the search query based on its associated keywords and the terms in thefirst query 102 a. Additionally,Advertisement 110 may be identified in response to the query based on the associated bid amount. As explained above,Advertisement 110 is associated with two creatives, labeledCreative_1 110 a andCreative_2 110 b, provided by an advertiser. At time T2, the user is presented with search results pertinent to her query. Additionally,Creative_1 110 a ofadvertisement 110 is provided to the user inweb page 132 atposition 134 a, based on the display order of the creatives. For example, because the advertiser chose to showCreative_1 110 a first,Creative_1 110 a may be provided to the user at time T2. - The user can, at a later time, submit a second query. Thus, at time T3, a
second query 102 b is received from a browser on the client device. Thesecond query 102 b can be received from asearch engine website 104 b, and may include the unique identifier for the client device or the user of the client device. In response to thesecond query 102 b, thecreative provider 108 can identifyadvertisement 110 responsive to thesecond query 102 b as well.Creative provider 108 may also identify that thesecond query 102 b was received from the same client device or same user as thefirst query 102 a, based on the unique identifier. - At time T4 then, the user is presented with search results pertinent to
second query 102 b. Additionally,Creative_2 110 b ofadvertisement 110 is provided to the user inweb page 132 atposition 134 b, based on the display order provided by the advertiser and the identification that thefirst query 102 a andsecond query 102 b were received from the same client device or the same user. - In this example, the user's
first query 102 a is “why am I having trouble sleeping?” at T1, and the user'ssecond query 102 b is “can't get to sleep” at time T2. -
Advertisement 110 is further associated with a bid amount (not shown). Creatives ofadvertisement 110 are provided whenadvertisement 110 corresponds to keywords entered in a search query, and when the bid amount foradvertisement 110 is greater than a bid amount for other advertisements. - The advertiser may select the display order of creatives. The advertisement system and
creative provider 108 may track the creatives that have been displayed, and the creatives to be displayed, for a particular user or client device. That is,Creative_1 110 a ofadvertisement 110 may be displayed thefirst instance advertisement 110 is selected for display to a particular user or client device.Creative_2 110 b ofadvertisement 110 may be displayed thesecond instance advertisement 110 is selected for display to that particular user or client device. Each creative may also be farther associated with a bid amount. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a further example 200 of providing multiple creatives for an advertisement. - As in
FIG. 1 , an advertiser may provide an advertisement which includes two creatives. The advertiser may choose to show Creative_1 210 a first, andCreative_2 210 b second, when theadvertisement 210 is identified as responsive to content or other criteria specified by the advertiser.Advertisement 210 is an advertisement that is associated with the keywords “flowers” and “mother's day”. Creative_1 210 a ofadvertisement 210 is an image with a picture of a flower accompanied by text stating “10% off flowers for Mother's Day”.Creative_2 210 b ofadvertisement 210 is an image with a picture of flowers accompanied by text reading “15% off flowers for Mother's Day”. These keywords and the text of each creative are referred to as advertisement keywords.Advertisement 210 may further be associated with a bid amount. - At a time T1, a browser on a client device may request a
first web page 202, for example, by typing in a web address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) forweb page 202 in a web browser.Web page 202, provided by a publisher, may contain content relevant toadvertisement 210, and may further containadvertisement position 234. For example,web page 202 may be part of a web site providing information about common types of flowers. In response to the browser on the client device requestingweb page 202, the publisher ofweb page 202 may transmit a request for advertisements foradvertisement position 234. The request for advertisements may include a unique identifier for the client device or for the user of the client device. Thecreative provider 108 can identifyadvertisement 210 as responsive to the content ofweb page 202 based on its associated keywords and the content ofweb page 202. Additionally,advertisement 210 may be identified in response to the request based on its associated bid amount. As explained above,advertisement 210 is associated with two creatives, labeled Creative_1 210 a andCreative_2 210 b, provided by an advertiser. At time T2, the user is presented with the desiredweb page 202. Additionally, Creative_1 210 a ofadvertisement 210 is provided for display onweb page 202 atposition 234, based on the display order of the creatives. For example, because the advertiser chose to show Creative_1 210 a first, Creative_1 210 a may be provided to the user at time T2. - The user can, at a later time, visit a
second web page 204. Thus, at time T3, a browser on a client device may request asecond web page 204, for example, by typing in a web address or URL forweb page 204.Web page 204, provided by a publisher, may also contain content relevant toadvertisement 210, and may further contain anadvertisement position 236. For example,web page 204 may be part of a web site providing information related to Mother's Day. In response to the browser on the client device requestingweb page 204, the publisher ofweb page 204 may transmit a request for advertisements foradvertisement position 236. Thecreative provider 108 can identifyadvertisement 210 as responsive to the content ofweb page 204 based on its associated keywords and the content ofweb page 204. Additionally,advertisement 210 may be identified in response to the request based on its associated bid amount,Creative provider 108 may also identify that the second request for advertisements was received as a result of the same client device or same user visiting a web page as the first request for advertisements, using a unique identifier for the client device or user included in the request for advertisements. - At time T4 then, the user is presented with the desired
web page 204. Additionally,Creative_2 210 b ofadvertisement 210 is provided for display on web page 206 atposition 236, based on the display order provided by the advertiser and the identification that the same client device or same user caused the first and second request for advertisements to be transmitted. In the example ofFIG. 2 , multiple creatives may allow an advertiser to tailor targeted offers to a user who has already seen one creative associated with the advertiser. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of anexample environment 300 in which anadvertisement system 302 manages advertising services. Theexample environment 300 includes one ormore networks 304, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 304 connectsuser devices 306,websites 308,advertisers 310, and theadvertisement system 302. Theenvironment 300 may include many thousands ofuser devices 306,websites 308, andadvertisers 310. - A
website 308 is one ormore resources 312 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 308 is maintained by apublisher 322, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 308. - A
resource 312 is any data that can be provided over thenetwork 304. Aresource 312 is identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 312. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 306 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 304.Example user devices 306 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 304. Auser device 306 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 304. - A
user device 306 can requestresources 312 from awebsite 308. In turn, data representing theresource 312 can be provided to theuser device 306 for presentation by theuser device 306. The data representing theresource 312 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as advertisement slots. - To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment can include a
search system 314 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on thewebsites 308. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in anindexed cache 316. -
User devices 306 can submitsearch queries 320 to thesearch system 314 over thenetwork 304. In response, thesearch system 314 accesses the indexedcache 316 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 320. Thesearch system 314 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 318 and returns the search results 318 to theuser devices 306 in search results pages. Asearch result 318 is data generated by thesearch system 314 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. Anexample search result 318 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented. - When a
resource 312 orsearch results 318 are requested by auser device 306, theadvertisement system 302 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with theresource 312 or search results 318. The request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to theadvertisement system 302. The request for a resource need not be limited to requests from a webpage to be displayed on a user device. Requests for resources may also originate within applications on the user device, for example, mobile user applications executing on a mobile communication device. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the advertisement slot is defined, a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot can be provided to the
advertisement system 302. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 320 for which search results are requested can also be provided to theadvertisement system 302 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the resource orsearch query 320. - Based on data included in the request for advertisements, the
advertisement system 302 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”). For example, eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 320. In some implementations, advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 300 are selected as eligible advertisements by theadvertisement system 302. - The
advertisement system 302 can also select advertisements to be provided based on the actions of the user controllinguser device 306. For example, advertisements to be provided may be selected on the basis of whether the user has previously visited an advertiser's web site. Advertisements to be provided may further be selected on the basis of whether the user possess desired characteristics. For example, advertisements to be provided may be selected on the basis of whether the user fits a specific gender or age range. Advertisements to be provided may also be selected based on interest categories of a user. For example, if a user frequently visits web sites for auto enthusiasts, advertisements may be selected that are relevant to his interests. - A targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a
search query 320 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword orsearch query 320. For example, an advertisement associated with the targeting keyword “daisy” can be an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the resource keyword “daisy.” Similarly, the advertisement can be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the search query “daisy.” - A targeting keyword can also match a resource keyword or a
search query 320 by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword orsearch query 320 despite having different text than the targeting keyword. For example, an advertisement having the targeting keyword “daisy” may also be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including a resource keyword or search query for “flowers” because daisy is a type of flower, and therefore, is likely to be relevant to the term “flowers.” - The
advertisement system 302 can select the eligible advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a resource or search results page based on results of an auction. For example, theadvertisement system 302 can receive bids from advertisers and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the advertisers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a “conversion” following selection of the advertisement. The highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from advertisement performance, landing page scores, and the like. Quality scores may be measured in different ways, depending on the source of a request. For example, for queries, a quality score may be measured by advertisement relevance and landing page quality. For web pages provided by publishers, a quality score may be measured by a predicted performance on resources similar to those displaying the advertisement, and a performance of an advertisement group. - Advertisers can also specify budgets for their advertisement campaigns. A budget is a specified amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for distribution of content over a specified budget period. The specified period can be, for example, a specified time (e.g., one day, one week, or one year), a specified number of events (e.g., a number of impressions or clicks), or some other delineation of time or events. Once the amount the advertiser is charged for distribution of content during the budget period matches or exceeds the budget amount, the campaign can be prevented from providing content for the remainder of the budget period unless the advertiser increases or overrides its specified budget.
- A conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, or registering on a website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- A user can submit a
first search query 320. An advertisement may be found responsive to thefirst search query 320. The advertisement may have multiple creatives associated with it. The multiple creatives are associated with a display order. Theadvertisement system 302 andcreative provider 108 can provide a first creative of the advertisement to the user. - At a later time, the user can submit a
second search query 320. An advertisement may be found responsive to thesecond search query 320. The identified advertisement may be the same as the advertisement identified for the user's first search query.Creative provider 108 andadvertisement system 302 may identify that the same advertisement has been identified for the same user. Thus, theadvertisement system 302 can use the multiple creatives and display order to serve a second creative of the identified advertisement in an order specified by the advertiser. - Similarly, a user can request a
first resource 312. An advertisement may be found responsive to the content or keywords ofresource 312. The advertisement may have multiple creatives associated with it, each associated with a display order. Theadvertisement system 302 andcreative provider 108 can provide a first creative of the advertisement to the user. - At a later time, the user can request a
second resource 312. An advertisement may be found responsive to the content or keywords of thesecond resource 312. The identified advertisement may be the same as the advertisement identified for the user's request of the first resource.Creative provider 108 andadvertisement system 302 may identify that the same advertisement has been identified for the same user. Thus, theadvertisement system 302 can use the multiple creatives and display order to serve a second creative of the identified advertisement in an order specified by the advertiser. - In these ways, advertisements with multiple creatives may be able to effectively tell a story. Further, advertisements with multiple creatives may allow an advertiser to prioritize one creative over another depending on the content of the creative. For example, an advertiser may be able to prioritize a creative that provides a larger profit margin, but also provide a second creative that may drive more traffic but is less profitable.
- In embodiments, advertisement system 302 (and its creative provider 108) may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof on one or more computing devices. For example,
advertisement system 302 and itscreative provider 108, may be part of or may be implemented with a computing device, such as, a processor-based computing device. A computing device can be any type of device having one or more processors. For example, a computing device can be a workstation, mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, tablet or laptop), computer, server, compute cluster, server farm, game console, set-top box, kiosk, embedded system or other device having at least one processor and memory. Embodiments may be software executed by a processor, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof in a computing device. - Examples of providing multiple creatives of an advertisement to a user that has submitted multiple queries or requested multiple resources are shown in
FIGS. 4-7 . A system that can be used to implement these examples is then described with reference toFIG. 8 . -
FIG. 4 illustrates anexemplary method 400 for providing multiple creatives according to display order, according to an embodiment. Theprocess 400 can be implemented, for example, by thecreative provider 108 and/or the advertisement management system ofFIG. 3 . In some implementations, thecreative provider 108 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of theprocess 400. In other implementations, a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of theprocess 400. - In
step 402, a query is received from a web page presented on a client device. The web page may be a publisher web page, or a search engine web page. Further, the query can be a search query received from a search engine website. The query may include an identifier for the client device, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a cookie, or other unique identifier for the client device. The query may also include an identifier for a user of the client device. - In
step 404, advertisements responsive to the query are identified. The identified advertisements may be associated with one or more ereatives. Each advertisement may also be associated with one or more keywords and a bid amount provided by the advertiser associated with the advertisement. Each advertisement may also be associated with a display order for each creative. The display order may be selected by the advertiser associated with the advertisement. Advertisements may be text-only, image-only, or a combination of both image and text. - The bid amount for the advertisement may be dependent on the current creative to be provided, based on the display order for the creative. For example, a given advertisement may have three creatives. The first creative may have a bid amount of $1.00, the second creative may have a bid amount of $0.90, and the third creative may have a bid amount of $0.75. Thus, the first time the advertisement is identified at
step 404, the bid amount may be $1.00. - In
step 406, a particular advertisement from the advertisements identified atstep 404 is identified, based on the bid amount of the advertisement. For example, a given web page may have four display slots for advertisements. For an advertisement to be selected, it may have a bid amount associated with it that is in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query. For example, the bid amount of $1.00 may be in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query. - Based on the advertisement identified at
step 406, a creative associated with the advertisement is provided to the client device atstep 408. The creative provided atstep 308 may be dependent on the display order for the creative. For example, if the advertisement identified atstep 406 has three creatives associated with it, the creative which has been specified to be displayed first may be provided atstep 408. The creative may be provided to be presented on a web page with search results responsive to the query. - At
step 410, a second query from the web page from the same client device or same user is received. The client device may be identified by a unique identifier, such as an IP address or cookie, included in the query. The user may be identified by a unique identifier, such as a cookie, included in the query. The second query may have the same or similar query terms as the query received atstep 402. - At
step 412, advertisements responsive to the second query may be identified. Again, each advertisement may have multiple creatives, a bid amount, and a display order for each of the multiple creatives, as described with reference to step 404. The bid amount for an advertisement may be dependent on the current creative to be provided, as described above. For example, the second time an advertisement is identified, the bid amount may be that of the second creative of the advertisement. In the example given above, the bid amount may be $0.90. - At step 414, one of the advertisements identified at
step 412 is identified, based on the bid amount, as described with reference to step 406. As described above, the bid amount of $0.90 may be in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query identified atstep 412. - At
step 416, if the advertisement identified at step 414 is the same as the advertisement identified atstep 406, a creative associated with the advertisement is provided to the client device. The creative provided atstep 416 may be dependent on the display order for the creative. For example, if the advertisement identified at step 414 and step 408 has three creatives associated with it, the creative which has been specified to be displayed second may be provided atstep 416, since the creative to be displayed first was provided atstep 408. -
FIG. 5 illustrates anexemplary method 500 for providing multiple creatives according to display order, according to an embodiment. Theprocess 500 can be implemented, for example, by thecreative provider 108 and/or the advertisement management system ofFIG. 4 . In some implementations, thecreative provider 108 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of theprocess 500. In other implementations, a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of theprocess 500. - In
step 502, a first request for advertisements is received from a first publisher. The first request for advertisements may be transmitted by the publisher in response to a request from a user on a client device requesting a resource, such as a web page, provided by the publisher. In one embodiment, the first request for advertisements may be received from a mobile application executing on a mobile communications device. The request from the user may include a unique identifier for the client device or the user of the client device, which may be transmitted along with the request for advertisements. - In
step 504, advertisements responsive to the request are identified. The identified advertisements may be associated with one or more creatives. Each advertisement may also be associated with one or more keywords and a bid amount provided by the advertiser associated with the advertisement. The keywords of responsive advertisements may be related to the content of the web page provided by the publisher. Further, advertisements responsive to the request may be identified based on the actions of the user or based on the particular advertisement locations, as explained above, Each advertisement may also be associated with a display order for each creative. The display order may be selected by the advertiser associated with the advertisement. Advertisements may be text-only, image-only, or a combination of both image and text. - The bid amount for the advertisement may be dependent on the current creative to be provided, based on the display order for the creative. For example, a given advertisement may have three creatives. The first creative may have a bid amount of $1.00, the second creative may have a bid amount of $0.90, and the third creative may have a bid amount of $0.75. Thus, the first time the advertisement is identified at
step 504, the bid amount may be $1.00. - In
step 506, a particular advertisement from the advertisements identified atstep 504 is identified, based on the bid amount of the advertisement. For example, a given web page may have four display slots for advertisements. For an advertisement to be selected, it may have a bid amount associated with it that is in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query. For example, the bid amount of $1.00 may be in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query. - Based on the advertisement identified at
step 506, a creative associated with the advertisement is provided to the publisher atstep 508. The creative provided atstep 508 may be dependent on the display order for the creative. For example, if the advertisement identified atstep 506 has three creatives associated with it, the creative which has been specified to be displayed first may be provided atstep 508. The creative may be provided to be presented on the web page or resource requested by the user. In one embodiment, the creative may be provided to a publisher, who then presents it along with the web page. In one embodiment, the creative may be provided to the user, or the user's web browser, which then presents the creative along with the web page. - At
step 510, a second request for advertisements is received from a second publisher. In one embodiment, the second publisher may be the same as the first publisher. In one embodiment, the second publisher may not be the same as the first publisher. The second request for advertisements may be transmitted by the publisher in response to a request from a user on a client device requesting a resource, such as a web page, provided by the second publisher. In one embodiment, the second request for advertisements may be received from a mobile application executing on a mobile communications device. The request from the user may include a unique identifier for the client device or for a user of the client device, which may be transmitted along with the second request for advertisements. The client device may be identified by a unique identifier, such as an IP address or cookie, included in the query. The user of the client device may also be identified by a unique identifier, such as a cookie, included in the query. - At
step 512, advertisements responsive to the second query may be identified. Again, each advertisement may have multiple creatives, a bid amount, and a display order for each of the multiple creatives, as described with reference to step 504. The bid amount for an advertisement may be dependent on the current creative to be provided, as described above. For example, the second time an advertisement is identified, the bid amount may be that of the second creative of the advertisement. In the example given above, the bid amount may be $0.90. - At
step 514, one of the advertisements identified atstep 512 is identified, based on the bid amount, as described with reference to step 506. As described above, the bid amount of $0.90 may be in the top four bid amounts of all advertisements responsive to the query identified atstep 512. - At step 516, if the advertisement identified at
step 514 is the same as the advertisement identified atstep 506, a creative associated with the advertisement is provided. In one embodiment, the creative may be provided to a publisher, who then presents it along with the web page or resource. In one embodiment, the creative may be provided to the user, or the user's web browser, which then presents the creative along with the web page. The creative provided at step 516 may be dependent on the display order for the creative. For example, if the advertisement identified atstep 514 and step 508 has three creatives associated with it, the creative which has been specified to be displayed second may be provided at step 516, since the creative to be displayed first was provided atstep 508. - A
creative provider 108 may identify that the same client device submitted two queries using a unique identifier included with each query submitted by the client device. For example, the unique identifier may be an IP address associated with the client device. Additionally, a client device may be identified by a cookie or other unique identifier for the client device. Each query submitted by a user using a client device may include a unique identifier for the client device. - A
creative provider 108 may identify that the same user submitted two queries using a unique identifier included with each query submitted by the user. For example, a user may log in to a web site through multiple client devices, but in each case, the web site will be able to identify the user through the log-in information. Therefore, each query submitted by a user through the site may include a unique identifier for the user. The unique identifier may be presented as a cookie. - A user may limit the scope of information collected by cookies through, for example, browser options, browser plug-ins, or through user preferences with a content provider, cookie provider, a related federated user identity system, and the like. For example, users may opt out of the collection of information by cookies for a particular cookie provider or all cookie providers through browser settings. A user may also delete cookies periodically to limit the scope of information collected. Further, privacy of user information can be protected via anonymization of user data, pseudoanonymization, separation of identity data from other data, time limitations on data storage, and the like.
- According to an embodiment, steps 402, 404, 406, 408, 410, 412, 414, and 416 may be performed by the
creative provider 108. Further, steps 502, 504, 506, 508, 510, 512, 514, and 516 may be performed by thecreative provider 108. - In the above example, the bid amount for each creative decreased based on the display order for the creative. However, the bid amount for each creative may increase instead. For example, the advertiser may set the bid amount for a first creative to be $1.00, while the second creative may have a bid amount of $1.15. Such a bidding strategy may be considered by an advertiser, since after a first creative has been provided, providing a second creative related to the first may result in a greater likelihood of a conversion.
- In one embodiment, each creative may be associated with a desired maximum number of display occurrences. The maximum number of display occurrences may be selected by the advertiser associated with the advertisement. Thus, for example, the advertiser associated with
advertisement 110 may specify thatCreative_1 110 a should be displayed 3 times, and thatCreative_2 110 b should be displayed 2 times. Accordingly,Creative_1 110 a may be provided the first threetimes advertisement 110 is selected for a user's query. OnceCreative_1 110 a has been provided three times,Creative_2 110 b may then be provided. The number of times each creative is provided may also be selected by the advertiser by specifying a budget for each creative, as described further below. - In one embodiment, a user who already has viewed a particular creative associated with an advertisement may no longer be presented that creative. Thus, for example, the advertiser associated with
advertisement 110 may specify thatCreative_1 110 a should be displayed only once to a user. Ifadvertisement 110 is selected for a user's query afterCreative_1 110 a has been displayed to the user,Creative_1 110 a will not be shown on a subsequent selection ofadvertisement 110. In this way, multiple creatives can tell a story, and advertisers may be able to effectively storyboard an advertisement campaign. - In one embodiment, an advertiser may specify a budget for each creative associated with an advertisement. As an example, an advertiser may have a budget of $3000 for a particular campaign. The advertiser may further select how much of that budget may be allocated to each creative associated with the particular advertisement. For example,
Creative_1 110 a ofadvertisement 110 may have a budget of $1000.Creative_2 110 b ofadvertisement 110 may have a budget of $2000.
