Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to artificial intelligence enabled triaging and workflow management. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to providing an urgency score for patients needing a follow-up visit based on the processing of medical data with a machine-learned model, which generates predictions that can be used for generating the urgency score.
- a diagnosis can span multiple visits in a healthcare facility, leading to delays in diagnosis, and poor customer experience. This can include follow-up examination after follow-up examination.
- Delays can be caused by: the extensive time it takes to interpret the results of an image or specimen taken at a prior visit; unavailability or lack of expertise of staff to interpret the results of an image or specimen; and/or scheduling difficulties with respect to the subsequent visit. Patients are often called in to have a quick follow-up examination that could have easily been completed during the previous visit if the original examination data was processed immediately. However, efficiency issues related to human processing often create a time delay hurdle.
- the method can include obtaining, by a computing device, initial medical data.
- the method can include processing, by the computing device, the initial medical data with a machine-learned model to generate a probability score based at least in part on a determined probability of a positive test result.
- the method can include determining, by the computing device, if the probability score is above a positive threshold and providing, by the computing device, a suggested next action based at least in part on whether the probability score is above the positive threshold.
- the system can include one or more processors and one or more non-transitory computer readable media that collectively store instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the computing system to perform operations.
- the operations can include obtaining one or more predictions for a patient.
- the operations can include processing the one or more predictions to generate an urgency score.
- the urgency score can be descriptive of an urgency for a follow-up.
- the operations can include determining a ranking for the patient based at least in part on the urgency score.
- the ranking can determine when a patient is seen for a follow-up in relation to other patients.
- the operations can include obtaining examination data.
- the examination data can include medical data from an examination of a patient.
- the operations can include generating one or more predictions from one or more machine-learned models based on the examination data.
- the operations can include modifying a medical workflow for the patient based on the one or more predictions.

- Systems and methods for diagnostic follow-up can shorten the time until final diagnosis and can add efficiency to many medical diagnosis processes.
- the systems and methods can lead to less office visits, which can lessen the time between a first check-up and a final diagnosis.
- the systems and methods can help provide a suggested next action to have a follow-up exam before the patient leaves, which can cut-out a second visit before the patient even leaves.
- the systems and methods can include obtaining an initial set of medical data, which can include answers to a questionnaire, an image, a specimen, or testing data.
- the systems and methods can further include processing the initial medical data with a machine-learned model to generate a probability score.
- the probability score can be based at least in part on a determined probability of a positive test result.
- the systems and methods can then determine if the probability score meets a positive threshold, in which the positive threshold can be based on a level of certainty for a positive test result which would require further testing. If the positive threshold is met, the systems and methods may suggest a follow-up test.
- the suggestion of a follow-up can be a direct recommendation of a follow-up test or can be a prioritization of immediate human review, which can lead to a human expert immediately reviewing the initial medical data to determine whether to recommend a follow-up test. If the positive threshold is not met, the systems and methods may suggest allowing the patient to leave or informing the patient of the results.
- the systems and methods can be used for a variety of diagnostic fields, including but not limited to mammography.
- the system can begin with a patient visiting a medical facility for a medical exam (e.g., a medical imaging exam or a biopsy).
- An image or specimen can be collected, and the patient can be asked to wait at the medical facility.
- a machine-learned model can process the image or specimen.
- the artificial intelligence model may optimize for any of the follow-up stages in the workflow, including mortality rate, disease state, likelihood of human experts to recall a patient for further diagnostic stages, etc.

- the initial medical data can include but is not limited to questionnaire data, image data, or examination data.
- Examination data can include x-rays, mammograms, EKG results, or any form of examination data.
- the examination data can include a specimen taken from the patient.
- the specimen can be a biological specimen taken for specific diagnosis or general diagnosis.
- the initial medical data can then be processed by a machine-learned model to generate predictions.
- the machine-learned model may be trained to generate predictions related to a specific medical field or a specific disease, illness, or diagnosis.
- the machine-learned model may be trained for determining a likelihood of breast cancer based on the initial medical data.
- the machine-learned model can be trained to generate general predictions related to a variety of possibilities related to a variety of diagnosable fields.
- the machine-learned models may be trained to generate predictions related to the general field of medical pathology.
- the one or more predictions can include predictions related to the urgency of a follow-up and a prediction of the likelihood of a positive test result.
- the predictions can include whether a follow-up is advisable, whether a human expert would advise a follow-up, an initial diagnosis, a binary prediction on an illness, a time to event, a disease state, or another prediction related to the processed medical data.
- the one or more predictions can be used to modify the medical workflow.
- the modification of the workflow can include providing suggestions for next actions based on the one or more predictions.
- the modification of the medical workflow can include generating an urgency score for the patient based on the one or more predictions and modifying a triaging ranking for the patient relative to one or more other patients based on the urgency score for the patient.
- modifying the medical workflow can include automatically scheduling a same day follow-up test based on the one or more predictions.
- modifying the medical workflow can include classifying the patient into an urgent group or a non-urgent group.
- the systems and methods can include a ranking scheme for determining a ranking for testing to determine which patients need to stay for further testing and which patients can be sent home.
- an image or specimen can be prioritized for an interpretation. If the interpretation indicates a high probability of being positive, the patient can get routed to the next stage of the diagnostic funnel. If the interpretation indicates a low probability of being positive, the patient can be instructed to go home. Patient's image or specimen can continue through the usual interpretation queue.
- the interpretation queue may be ordered by a suspicion score, an urgency score, or a probability score. The ordering by score can take place above a certain score threshold, after which the cases can be ordered chronologically, to avoid starving out the least suspicious cases.
- systems and methods for ranking urgency and next patient up can include obtaining one or more predictions for a patient.
- the predictions can include a likelihood of a positive test result for a diagnosis.
- the predictions can also include a mortality rate for the diagnosis, a possible disease state, a gestation period for a disease, the patient's susceptibility, or other factors that can relate to urgency of a potential follow-up.
- the one or more predictions can be processed to generate a score.
- the score can be descriptive of an urgency for a follow-up test or visit.
- the score can then be used to determine a ranking for the patient.
- the ranking can then be used to decide when a follow-up visit for the patient will occur in relation to other patients.
- Ranking may include determining whether the score is above or below a threshold. If the score is above the threshold, the patient can be ranked by the urgency of the follow-up. In this case, the patient can be ranked above patients with less urgency and below patients with higher urgency. If the score is below a threshold, the patient can be ranked chronologically, where the patient is ranked above patients with a later visit time and below patients with an earlier visit time. In some implementations, the ranking system can be flipped, wherein the higher urgency scores are ranked chronologically, and the lower urgency scores are ranked by score. In some implementations, a higher urgency score can be indicative of a higher urgency level. In some implementations, a lower urgency score can be indicative of a higher urgency level.
- the threshold can be based on a variety of factors and can be manually set or automatically set based on the variety of factors.
- the threshold can be based at least in part on time of individual follow-ups, hospital occupancy, hospital capacity, a set urgency level, or other factors.
- the threshold can be set to ensure that all patients are seen in a timely fashion, while ensuring the more urgent patients are seen as soon as possible.
- the systems and methods can be run iteratively for each step of the diagnostic process.
- the iterative nature can occur multiple times in one visit, such that a patient may receive a follow-up examination or multiple follow-up examinations during the initial visit.
- the systems and methods can be used to provide immediate feedback from a medical visit.
- the systems and methods can be used to provide an immediate binary feedback of whether the patient should go home or receive an immediate follow-up examination.
- the feedback may be delivered via a human to human exchange or via any communication medium (e.g., text message, email, phone call, page, etc.).
- the system may automatically inform the patient without further selection from human interaction.
- the systems and methods disclosed herein can include training the machine-learned models with training sets that include images or specimens paired with long term outcomes.
- the models may be iteratively trained, and the training can include supervised learning.
- the supervised learning may continue until a certain level of accuracy is achieved.
- the machine-learned model can be trained with data on how many negatives can occur before a positive result, mortality rate, disease state, and likelihood of recall for each particular disease or illness.
- the probability score and the urgency score can be calculated in a variety of processes that can include, but is not limited to, weighting of scores, summation of scores, an individual score, or a combination of weighting and summation.
- the urgency score can be calculated by a set of partitioned pools that each intake and produce a score. The scores can then be summed to provide a final urgency score. Alternatively, the scores may be aggregated or multiplied together.
- the data used by the systems and models (e.g., for training and/or inference) described herein can be de-identified data.
- personally identifiable information such as location, name, exact birth date, contact information, biometric information, facial photographs, etc.
- the data can be de-identified to protect identity of individuals and to conform to regulations regarding medical data, such as HIPAA, such that no personally identifiable information (e.g., protected health information) is present in the data used by the models and/or used to train the models.

Abstract
Systems and methods for artificial intelligence enabled instant diagnostic follow-up can provide efficiency to the medical diagnosis process by providing multiple examinations in the same medical visit for medical workflows that previously required multiple visits. The systems and methods can provide further medical benefit by implementing triaging systems to ensure the most urgent cases are seen immediately.
Description
- This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/140,494, filed Jan. 22, 2021. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/140,494 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- The present disclosure relates generally to artificial intelligence enabled triaging and workflow management. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to providing an urgency score for patients needing a follow-up visit based on the processing of medical data with a machine-learned model, which generates predictions that can be used for generating the urgency score.
- In medical workflows, frequently multiple steps lead to a diagnosis. For non-emergent diseases, a diagnosis can span multiple visits in a healthcare facility, leading to delays in diagnosis, and poor customer experience. This can include follow-up examination after follow-up examination.
- Delays can be caused by: the extensive time it takes to interpret the results of an image or specimen taken at a prior visit; unavailability or lack of expertise of staff to interpret the results of an image or specimen; and/or scheduling difficulties with respect to the subsequent visit. Patients are often called in to have a quick follow-up examination that could have easily been completed during the previous visit if the original examination data was processed immediately. However, efficiency issues related to human processing often create a time delay hurdle.
- Moreover, serious cases may be overshadowed by a large volume of normal ones, which can cause diseases to go undiagnosed for weeks or months. Purely chronological follow-up ordering can see those with low urgency illnesses being prioritized the same as those with life threatening diseases.
- Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or can be learned from the description, or can be learned through practice of the embodiments.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method. The method can include obtaining, by a computing device, initial medical data. In some implementations, the method can include processing, by the computing device, the initial medical data with a machine-learned model to generate a probability score based at least in part on a determined probability of a positive test result. The method can include determining, by the computing device, if the probability score is above a positive threshold and providing, by the computing device, a suggested next action based at least in part on whether the probability score is above the positive threshold.
- Another example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computing system for ranking urgency and next patient up. The system can include one or more processors and one or more non-transitory computer readable media that collectively store instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the computing system to perform operations. The operations can include obtaining one or more predictions for a patient. The operations can include processing the one or more predictions to generate an urgency score. The urgency score can be descriptive of an urgency for a follow-up. In some implementations, the operations can include determining a ranking for the patient based at least in part on the urgency score. The ranking can determine when a patient is seen for a follow-up in relation to other patients.
- Another example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to one or more non-transitory computer readable media that collectively store instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause a computing system to perform operations. The operations can include obtaining examination data. In some implementations, the examination data can include medical data from an examination of a patient. The operations can include generating one or more predictions from one or more machine-learned models based on the examination data. The operations can include modifying a medical workflow for the patient based on the one or more predictions.

- Generally, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for artificial intelligence enabled triaging or other medical process or workflow management. The systems and methods disclosed herein can provide for quicker diagnostic follow-up by determining the likelihood of positive results with machine-learned models. Systems and methods for diagnostic follow-up can shorten the time until final diagnosis and can add efficiency to many medical diagnosis processes. The systems and methods can lead to less office visits, which can lessen the time between a first check-up and a final diagnosis. For example, the systems and methods can help provide a suggested next action to have a follow-up exam before the patient leaves, which can cut-out a second visit before the patient even leaves. In some implementations, the systems and methods can include obtaining an initial set of medical data, which can include answers to a questionnaire, an image, a specimen, or testing data. The systems and methods can further include processing the initial medical data with a machine-learned model to generate a probability score. The probability score can be based at least in part on a determined probability of a positive test result. The systems and methods can then determine if the probability score meets a positive threshold, in which the positive threshold can be based on a level of certainty for a positive test result which would require further testing. If the positive threshold is met, the systems and methods may suggest a follow-up test. The suggestion of a follow-up can be a direct recommendation of a follow-up test or can be a prioritization of immediate human review, which can lead to a human expert immediately reviewing the initial medical data to determine whether to recommend a follow-up test. If the positive threshold is not met, the systems and methods may suggest allowing the patient to leave or informing the patient of the results.
- The systems and methods can be used for a variety of diagnostic fields, including but not limited to mammography. The system can begin with a patient visiting a medical facility for a medical exam (e.g., a medical imaging exam or a biopsy). An image or specimen can be collected, and the patient can be asked to wait at the medical facility. While the patient is still at the medical facility, a machine-learned model can process the image or specimen. The artificial intelligence model may optimize for any of the follow-up stages in the workflow, including mortality rate, disease state, likelihood of human experts to recall a patient for further diagnostic stages, etc. In some implementations, in cases where the exam has a very high probability of being negative, the patient may be informed about the result. In cases where the exam has a higher probability of having a positive result a notification (e.g., mobile call, text, email, page, etc.) can be sent in order to alter the patient's journey during the visit.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods can begin with the intake of initial medical data. The initial medical data can include but is not limited to questionnaire data, image data, or examination data. Examination data can include x-rays, mammograms, EKG results, or any form of examination data. The examination data can include a specimen taken from the patient. The specimen can be a biological specimen taken for specific diagnosis or general diagnosis.
- The initial medical data can then be processed by a machine-learned model to generate predictions. In some implementations, the machine-learned model may be trained to generate predictions related to a specific medical field or a specific disease, illness, or diagnosis. For example, in some implementations, the machine-learned model may be trained for determining a likelihood of breast cancer based on the initial medical data. In some implementations, the machine-learned model can be trained to generate general predictions related to a variety of possibilities related to a variety of diagnosable fields. The machine-learned models may be trained to generate predictions related to the general field of medical pathology.
- In some implementations, the one or more predictions can include predictions related to the urgency of a follow-up and a prediction of the likelihood of a positive test result. The predictions can include whether a follow-up is advisable, whether a human expert would advise a follow-up, an initial diagnosis, a binary prediction on an illness, a time to event, a disease state, or another prediction related to the processed medical data.
- The one or more predictions can be used to modify the medical workflow. The modification of the workflow can include providing suggestions for next actions based on the one or more predictions. Moreover, the modification of the medical workflow can include generating an urgency score for the patient based on the one or more predictions and modifying a triaging ranking for the patient relative to one or more other patients based on the urgency score for the patient. In some implementations, modifying the medical workflow can include automatically scheduling a same day follow-up test based on the one or more predictions. Furthermore, in some implementations, modifying the medical workflow can include classifying the patient into an urgent group or a non-urgent group.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods can include a ranking scheme for determining a ranking for testing to determine which patients need to stay for further testing and which patients can be sent home.
- In some implementations, an image or specimen can be prioritized for an interpretation. If the interpretation indicates a high probability of being positive, the patient can get routed to the next stage of the diagnostic funnel. If the interpretation indicates a low probability of being positive, the patient can be instructed to go home. Patient's image or specimen can continue through the usual interpretation queue. In some implementations, the interpretation queue may be ordered by a suspicion score, an urgency score, or a probability score. The ordering by score can take place above a certain score threshold, after which the cases can be ordered chronologically, to avoid starving out the least suspicious cases.
- In some implementations, systems and methods for ranking urgency and next patient up can include obtaining one or more predictions for a patient. The predictions can include a likelihood of a positive test result for a diagnosis. The predictions can also include a mortality rate for the diagnosis, a possible disease state, a gestation period for a disease, the patient's susceptibility, or other factors that can relate to urgency of a potential follow-up. The one or more predictions can be processed to generate a score. The score can be descriptive of an urgency for a follow-up test or visit. The score can then be used to determine a ranking for the patient. The ranking can then be used to decide when a follow-up visit for the patient will occur in relation to other patients.
- Ranking may include determining whether the score is above or below a threshold. If the score is above the threshold, the patient can be ranked by the urgency of the follow-up. In this case, the patient can be ranked above patients with less urgency and below patients with higher urgency. If the score is below a threshold, the patient can be ranked chronologically, where the patient is ranked above patients with a later visit time and below patients with an earlier visit time. In some implementations, the ranking system can be flipped, wherein the higher urgency scores are ranked chronologically, and the lower urgency scores are ranked by score. In some implementations, a higher urgency score can be indicative of a higher urgency level. In some implementations, a lower urgency score can be indicative of a higher urgency level.
- The threshold can be based on a variety of factors and can be manually set or automatically set based on the variety of factors. The threshold can be based at least in part on time of individual follow-ups, hospital occupancy, hospital capacity, a set urgency level, or other factors. The threshold can be set to ensure that all patients are seen in a timely fashion, while ensuring the more urgent patients are seen as soon as possible.
- The systems and methods can be run iteratively for each step of the diagnostic process. In some implementations, the iterative nature can occur multiple times in one visit, such that a patient may receive a follow-up examination or multiple follow-up examinations during the initial visit.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods can be used to provide immediate feedback from a medical visit. For example, the systems and methods can be used to provide an immediate binary feedback of whether the patient should go home or receive an immediate follow-up examination. The feedback may be delivered via a human to human exchange or via any communication medium (e.g., text message, email, phone call, page, etc.). In some implementations, the system may automatically inform the patient without further selection from human interaction.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein can include training the machine-learned models with training sets that include images or specimens paired with long term outcomes. The models may be iteratively trained, and the training can include supervised learning. The supervised learning may continue until a certain level of accuracy is achieved. In some implementations, the machine-learned model can be trained with data on how many negatives can occur before a positive result, mortality rate, disease state, and likelihood of recall for each particular disease or illness.
- The probability score and the urgency score can be calculated in a variety of processes that can include, but is not limited to, weighting of scores, summation of scores, an individual score, or a combination of weighting and summation. In some implementations, the urgency score can be calculated by a set of partitioned pools that each intake and produce a score. The scores can then be summed to provide a final urgency score. Alternatively, the scores may be aggregated or multiplied together.
- The data used by the systems and models (e.g., for training and/or inference) described herein can be de-identified data. For example, personally identifiable information, such as location, name, exact birth date, contact information, biometric information, facial photographs, etc. can be eliminated from the records prior to being transmitted to and/or utilized by the models and/or a computing system including the models. For example, the data can be de-identified to protect identity of individuals and to conform to regulations regarding medical data, such as HIPAA, such that no personally identifiable information (e.g., protected health information) is present in the data used by the models and/or used to train the models.
- Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., examination data). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
- The systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, the system and methods can generate one or more predictions that can lead to fewer follow-up visits and quicker diagnosis. The systems and methods can further be used to provide a triage for ranking patients to allow for the most urgent follow-ups to occur first. Furthermore, the systems and methods can enable the medical providers to provide a follow-up examination for a patient before the patient even leaves the preliminary examination.
- Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is the ability to automatically notify a patient of a need for a follow-up or the notification giving a patient the okay to go home.
- With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.

FIG. 1A depicts a block diagram of anexample computing system 100 that performs triaging according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thesystem 100 includes auser computing device 102, aserver computing system 130, and atraining computing system 150 that are communicatively coupled over anetwork 180. - The
user computing device 102 can be any type of computing device, such as, for example, a personal computing device (e.g., laptop or desktop), a mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone or tablet), a gaming console or controller, a wearable computing device, an embedded computing device, or any other type of computing device. - The
user computing device 102 includes one ormore processors 112 and amemory 114. The one ormore processors 112 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. Thememory 114 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. Thememory 114 can storedata 116 andinstructions 118 which are executed by theprocessor 112 to cause theuser computing device 102 to perform operations. - In some implementations, the
user computing device 102 can store or include one ormore triage models 120. For example, thetriage models 120 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models such as neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) or other types of machine-learned models, including non-linear models and/or linear models. Neural networks can include feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (e.g., long short-term memory recurrent neural networks), convolutional neural networks or other forms of neural networks.Example triage models 120 are discussed with reference toFIGS. 2, 4-6 , & 8. - In some implementations, the one or
more triage models 120 can be received from theserver computing system 130 overnetwork 180, stored in the usercomputing device memory 114, and then used or otherwise implemented by the one ormore processors 112. In some implementations, theuser computing device 102 can implement multiple parallel instances of a single triage model 120 (e.g., to perform parallel triaging across multiple instances of patients getting examined). - More particularly, the one or more triage models can be used to process examination data to generate one or more predictions. The one or more predictions can be used to generate an urgency score. In some implementations, the one or more predictions can include the urgency score. In some implementations, the one or more predictions can include a probability score indicative of a probability of a positive test result. The urgency score and/or the urgency score can be used to determine a suggested next action for the medical workflow. For example, in some cases, if the probability score is above a positive threshold, the patient may be contacted to have an immediate follow-up examination. If a positive threshold is not met, the patient may be notified that they can leave the medical facility.
- In some implementations, the urgency score can be used to determine when the patient will be seen for a follow-up. For example, a first patient with a high likelihood of having a severe disease can be prioritized over a second patient with a low likelihood of having a minor illness, and therefore, the first patient may be assigned a follow-up visit before the second patient regardless of visit time. However, in some implementations, the triage model can be accompanied by or can include a ranking model, which in some instances may have a multiple pronged method for ranking. In some implementations, the ranking model can include ranking based on the urgency score for scores above a certain threshold and can include ranking based on the time of the visit for scores below a certain threshold. The threshold can be based on a threshold urgency score or can alternatively be based on a number of patients.
- Additionally or alternatively, one or
more triage models 140 can be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by theserver computing system 130 that communicates with theuser computing device 102 according to a client-server relationship. For example, thetriage models 140 can be implemented by theserver computing system 140 as a portion of a web service (e.g., a medical waitlist service). Thus, one ormore models 120 can be stored and implemented at theuser computing device 102 and/or one ormore models 140 can be stored and implemented at theserver computing system 130. - The
user computing device 102 can also include one or moreuser input component 122 that receives user input. For example, theuser input component 122 can be a touch-sensitive component (e.g., a touch-sensitive display screen or a touch pad) that is sensitive to the touch of a user input object (e.g., a finger or a stylus). The touch-sensitive component can serve to implement a virtual keyboard. Other example user input components include a microphone, a traditional keyboard, or other means by which a user can provide user input. - The
server computing system 130 includes one ormore processors 132 and amemory 134. The one ormore processors 132 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. Thememory 134 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. Thememory 134 can storedata 136 andinstructions 138 which are executed by theprocessor 132 to cause theserver computing system 130 to perform operations. - In some implementations, the
server computing system 130 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. In instances in which theserver computing system 130 includes plural server computing devices, such server computing devices can operate according to sequential computing architectures, parallel computing architectures, or some combination thereof. - As described above, the
server computing system 130 can store or otherwise include one or more machine-learnedtriage models 140. For example, themodels 140 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models. Example machine-learned models include neural networks or other multi-layer non-linear models. Example neural networks include feed forward neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.Example models 140 are discussed with reference toFIGS. 2, 4-6 , & 8. - The
user computing device 102 and/or theserver computing system 130 can train themodels 120 and/or 140 via interaction with thetraining computing system 150 that is communicatively coupled over thenetwork 180. Thetraining computing system 150 can be separate from theserver computing system 130 or can be a portion of theserver computing system 130. - The
training computing system 150 includes one ormore processors 152 and amemory 154. The one ormore processors 152 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. Thememory 154 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. Thememory 154 can storedata 156 andinstructions 158 which are executed by theprocessor 152 to cause thetraining computing system 150 to perform operations. In some implementations, thetraining computing system 150 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. - The
training computing system 150 can include amodel trainer 160 that trains the machine-learnedmodels 120 and/or 140 stored at theuser computing device 102 and/or theserver computing system 130 using various training or learning techniques, such as, for example, backwards propagation of errors. For example, a loss function can be backpropagated through the model(s) to update one or more parameters of the model(s) (e.g., based on a gradient of the loss function). Various loss functions can be used such as mean squared error, likelihood loss, cross entropy loss, hinge loss, and/or various other loss functions. Gradient descent techniques can be used to iteratively update the parameters over a number of training iterations. - In some implementations, performing backwards propagation of errors can include performing truncated backpropagation through time. The
model trainer 160 can perform a number of generalization techniques (e.g., weight decays, dropouts, etc.) to improve the generalization capability of the models being trained. - In particular, the
model trainer 160 can train thetriage models 120 and/or 140 based on a set oftraining data 162. Thetraining data 162 can include, for example, medical data (e.g., images, text, etc.) paired with a diagnosis. In some implementations, thetraining data 162 can further include information related to the mortality rate, the disease state, the examinations needed, the likelihood of first test positive result, and/or the gestation period for the diagnosis. In some implementations, the machine-learned model can be trained on the pairings and can then be trained with supervised learning. A human expert can ensure the correct outcomes are being reinforced and ensure incorrect biases do not form from the initial training set. In some implementations, the supervised training can continue indefinitely, and in some implementations, the supervised training can be completed when a certain level of accuracy is obtained. - In some implementations, if the user has provided consent, the training examples can be provided by the
user computing device 102. Thus, in such implementations, themodel 120 provided to theuser computing device 102 can be trained by thetraining computing system 150 on user-specific data received from theuser computing device 102. In some instances, this process can be referred to as personalizing the model. - The
model trainer 160 includes computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. Themodel trainer 160 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. For example, in some implementations, themodel trainer 160 includes program files stored on a storage device, loaded into a memory and executed by one or more processors. In other implementations, themodel trainer 160 includes one or more sets of computer-executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media. - The
network 180 can be any type of communications network, such as a local area network (e.g., intranet), wide area network (e.g., Internet), or some combination thereof and can include any number of wired or wireless links. In general, communication over thenetwork 180 can be carried via any type of wired and/or wireless connection, using a wide variety of communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP), encodings or formats (e.g., HTML, XML), and/or protection schemes (e.g., VPN, secure HTTP, SSL). - The machine-learned models described in this specification may be used in a variety of tasks, applications, and/or use cases.

The score may be a probability score related to the likelihood of a positive test result, or alternatively, the score may be an urgency score related to various factors that can include a mortality rate of a potential diagnosis, a disease state of the potential diagnosis, and/or health of the patient. The suggested action can be determined based on what grouping the score falls into. For example, thetriage model 200 may be trained to suggest one of three actions. If the score falls into the confidently negative grouping, the suggested action can be notifying thepatient 210 of a negative result. If the score falls into the not highly suspicious grouping, the suggested action can be adding the patient's case to theworklist 208. Lastly, if the score falls into the highly suspicious grouping, the suggested action can be immediatefurther examination 206. - In some implementations, the groupings can be based at least in part on determined thresholds. For example, the groupings can be based on the level of likelihood of a positive result.

FIG. 3 depicts an illustration of an example suggestedaction 300 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In some implementations, theexample suggestion 300 can include the proposedaction 304 descriptive of a modification to the medical workflow, and, with the proposedaction 304, the suggested action can includereasoning 306 that is descriptive of a reason for the suggested action. Thus, in some implementations, the suggestedaction 300 can include acatalog 302 that is operable to show a list of previous suggested actions or results for the patient or a plurality of patients. - The illustration depicted in
FIG. 3 includes an example suggestedaction 300 in which priority review is suggested based on the processing completed by the triage model. In this implementation, two matters are listed in thecatalog 302, including the open matter with the proposedaction 304 for priority review. The open matter can include the proposedaction 304 and thereasoning 306 for the proposedaction 304. For example, inFIG. 3 , thereasoning 306 for priority review is further accompanied by patient information. Thereasoning 306 can include a reference to a case study, a reference to a set of training data, an augmented image, or another form of data interpretable by a human expert. -
FIG. 4 depicts an illustration of anexample ranking model 400 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In some implementations, theranking model 400 is trained to rank a set of input data based on anurgency score 402 and/or chronologically 406. Thus, in some implementations, theranking model 400 can include athreshold 404 that is operable to determine whether the input data is ranked based on theurgency score 402 or chronologically 406. - The
ranking model 400 ofFIG. 4 includes a ranking based on urgency scores and a ranking based on the chronology of the patients' visits. In this implementation, a triage model has processed a set of initial medical data to generate one or more predictions. The one or more predictions can be processed by theranking model 400 to generate urgency scores for each set of predictions. The urgency scores can then be used to rank the urgency of each patient's case. Theranking model 400 can then determine which cases are above and below athreshold 404. If the case is above thethreshold 404, the case may be ranked based on theurgency score 402, in which the case is ranked below cases with higher urgency scores and above cases with lower urgency scores. If the case is below thethreshold 404, the case may be ranked based on thechronology 406 of the patient's visit. Thethreshold 404 can be a determined threshold urgency score based on a determined urgency level, a certain number of patients, or a variety of other factors. -
FIG. 5 depicts a block diagram of anexample triage model 500 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thetriage model 500 is similar to thetriage model 200 ofFIG. 2 except that thetriage model 500 further includes an iterative function to convey the possible iterative nature of some implementations. - The
triage model 500 can includeintaking examination data 502, processing theexamination data 504, and generating predictions, a score, and/or arank 506. The generated predictions, score, and/or rank can then be used to determine a suggested action. The suggested action can include suggesting a follow-up 508 or suggesting the patient leave 510. The process can be repeated after each examination until a diagnosis is determined. For example, a patient may go in for a breast cancer screening. The patient may be examined with a mammography machine to generateexamination data 502 in the form of a medical image (e.g., a mammogram). The medical image can be processed 504 to generate one or more predictions, a probability score, and an urgency score. The one or more predictions can include a possible disease state, a predicted size of a mass, or a predicted location for the cancerous growth. In some implementations, the probability score can be descriptive of a determined likelihood of breast cancer based on the processing of the medical image. The urgency score can be determined by a variety of factors including the likelihood of breast cancer, a predicted cancerous stage, a predicted size, and the age and health of the patient. One or both of the scores can then be used to determine a suggested action. - In some implementations, if the probability score is above a threshold probability, the suggested action can be a follow-up
examination 508. The follow-up examination can be completed, and the process may start over with the new examination data being processed. In some implementations, the follow-up examination can occur during the same medical visit as the original examination. Alternatively, if the probability score is below a threshold, the patient may be told they can leave thefacility 510. The examination data can be continued to be examined, or, depending on the score, the patient may be notified of a negative result. - In some implementations, if the urgency score is above a threshold urgency, the suggested action can be a follow-up
examination 508. The follow-up examination can be completed, and the process may start over with the new examination data being processed. In some implementations, the follow-up examination can occur during the same medical visit as the original examination. Alternatively, if the urgency score is below a threshold, the patient may be told they can leave thefacility 510. The patient may be added to a waitlist or scheduled for a future visit based on the lower urgency score. -
FIG. 6 depicts a flow chart diagram of an example method to perform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. AlthoughFIG. 6 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particularly illustrated order or arrangement. The various steps of themethod 600 can be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. - At 602, a computing system can obtain initial medical data. The initial medical data can include answers to a questionnaire, one or more images, one or more specimens, and/or textual data. For example, the initial medical data can be a mammogram.
- At 604, the computing system can process the initial medical data with a machine-learned model. In some implementations, the machine-learned model can output a probability score based at least in part on a determined probability of a positive test result. For example, the probability score can be indicative of how likely the processed mammogram will result in a cancer diagnosis.
- At 606, the computing system can determine if a threshold is met. In some implementations, a threshold can be met by having a score above a threshold, or alternatively, a threshold can be met by having a score below a threshold. The threshold may be a positive threshold, in which any probability score above the positive threshold has a high likelihood of a positive result.
- At 608, the computing system can provide a suggested next action. The suggested action can be based at least in part on whether the probability score is above the positive threshold. In some implementations, if the probability score is above the positive threshold, the suggested action may be a follow-up examination. Alternatively, if the probability score is below the positive threshold, the suggested action may be letting the patient go home or notifying the patient of a negative result.

FIG. 7 depicts a flow chart diagram of an example method to perform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. AlthoughFIG. 7 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particularly illustrated order or arrangement. The various steps of themethod 700 can be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. - At 702, a computing system can obtain one or more predictions. The one or more predictions can be predictions related to the medical state of a patient. In some implementations, the one or more predictions can include a probability score, a possible disease state, a mortality rate, or other predictions related to a possible diagnosis.
- At 704, the computing system can process the one or more predictions. The predictions may be processed by one or more machine-learned models.
- At 706, the computing system can generate a score based at least in part on the one or more predictions. The score may be an urgency score generated by processing the one or more predictions. In some implementations, the urgency score can be descriptive of an urgency for a follow-up visit. The urgency may be based at least in part on a severity of a potential disease or illness, the likelihood of a positive result, a disease state, a gestation period, a mortality rate, or the health of the patient.
- At 708, the computing system can determine a ranking for the patient based at least in part on the score. In some implementations, the ranking for the patient can be made in relation to other patients. The ranking may be purely on the urgency score as compared to the urgency score of other patients. In some implementations, the ranking can be a hybrid ranking based on a threshold, in which all scores above the threshold are ranked based on the urgency score, and all scores below the threshold are ranked based on the time of the patient's visit.
- The ranking can be used to determine an order of a follow-up visit for the patient in relation to other patients.
