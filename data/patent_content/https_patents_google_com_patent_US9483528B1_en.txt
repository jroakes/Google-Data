- the update module 210 receives the user social activity and updates the social ranking score for the website based on the user social activity.
- the update module 210 receives a signal responsive to a user action for changing the social ranking for the website. Responsive to the signal, the update module 210 updates the social ranking score for the website based on the user action for changing the social ranking for the website. For example, a user 125 positively endorses the website and the update module 210 receives a signal indicating that the user 125 intends to increase the social ranking for the website. The update module 210 updates the social ranking score for the website based on the user 125 positively endorsing the website.

- the update module 210 updates the social ranking score for the next website based on the 10 times factor.
- the update module 210 applies a random value change to the social ranking score for a website to protect user privacy. For example, when updating the social ranking score based on a newly received user activity by a user 125 , the update module 210 may change the social ranking score by a random value before publishing the updated score to users 125 so that the effect of an update to the social ranking score based on the newly received user activity could not with certainty be perceptible to any users 125 or cannot be reliably distinguished from the effects of updates due to other users' activity.

In another example, the score module 208 determines user social activities positively endorsed by more than a predetermined number of users 125 as candidate user social activities. In some implementations, the method 400 includes classifying 404 the user interaction data based on a plurality of social activity types associated with the user social activities. The plurality of user social activities can include one or more characteristics describing the user social activities.
- the method 400 can include computing 408 a quantity of the candidate user social activities.
- the score module 208 computes the number of the candidate user social activities.
- the score module 208 computes the number of each category of candidate user social activities.

- the method 400 can also include computing 410 a quality of the candidate user social activities.
- the score module 208 may determine that a candidate user social activity positively endorsed by more users 125 has a higher quality.
- the score module 208 determines a weight for each category of the candidate user social activities. For example, the score module 208 determines a weight of 0.6, 0.3 and 0.1 for the candidate user social activities positively endorsed by more than 2,000 users 125 , 1,500-2,000 users 125 and 1,000-1,500 users 125 , respectively.
- the method 400 can include calculating 412 a social ranking score for the website based on the quantity or quality of the candidate social activities. For example, the score module 208 calculates a social ranking score for the website based on the number of the candidate user social activities positively endorsed by more than a predetermined number of users 125 . In some instances, the score module 208 calculates a social ranking score for the website by combining the quantity and the quality of the candidate user social activities.
- the score module 208 calculates the social ranking score for the website by combining the weighed numbers of the candidate social activities positively endorsed by more than 2,000 users 125 , 1,500-2,000 users 125 and 1,000-1,500 users 125 .
- the score module 208 calculates the social ranking score for the website by summing the weighed numbers of the candidate social activities positively endorsed by more than 2,000 users 125 , 1,500-2,000 users 125 and 1,000-1,500 users 125 .
- the method 400 can include receiving 414 a signal responsive to a user action for changing the social ranking score for the website. For example, a user 125 positively endorses the website and the update module 210 receives a signal indicating that the user 125 intends to increase the social ranking for the website.
- the method 400 can also include updating 416 the social ranking score for the website responsive to the signal.
- the update module 210 updates the social ranking score for the website based on the user social activity of positively endorsing the website.
- the method 400 can also include displaying the social ranking score for the website.
- the user interface module 214 receives the social ranking score for the website from the update module 210 or the score module 208 and generates graphical data for providing a user interface that displays the social ranking score for the website next to a URL for the website, an acknowledgement button or a share button associated with the website in the user interface.
- the method 500 can include determining 502 two or more similar websites.
- the combining module 212 determines two or more similar websites that contain the same content provided by the same provider.
- the method 500 can also include determining 504 social ranking scores for the two or more similar websites.
- the combining module 212 can cooperates with the score module 208 to determine social ranking scores for the two or more similar websites.
- the combining module 212 retrieves the social ranking scores for the two or more similar websites from the storage 197 .
- the method 500 can include combining 506 the social ranking scores for the two or more similar websites.
- the combining module 212 sums the determined social ranking scores for the two or more similar websites.
- the method 500 can also include storing 508 the result of combining the social ranking scores in the storage 197 .
- FIG. 6 is a graphic representation of an example user interface 600 for allowing a user 125 to increase a social ranking for a property or entity.
