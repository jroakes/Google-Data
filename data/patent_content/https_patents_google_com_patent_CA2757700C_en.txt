[0002] The present invention is directed to on-line advertising and, more particularly, to the generation of data for on-line advertising and to the display of on-line advertising.

Description of Related Art
[0003] The display of keyword-triggered advertisements on the same web pages that provide responses to Internet search queries has been shown to be extremely profitable. Typically, users carry out searches of the Internet by entering one or more keywords as a query into a search engine or similar web page. The search engine then provides the results of the search on one more web pages that show the search results arranged according to some predetermined order or ranking.
[0004] Recently, location-based advertising has been introduced to deliver advertisements that are targeted to the current location of a user or to a location specified by the user as part of the search query. As an example, in response to a user query for camera stores located in Manhattan, the user may be shown ads for stores located solely in New York City.
However, the generation of a sufficient inventory of location-based ads for a given advertiser is often difficult.
In addition to storing the ad content and keywords that are currently used to supply keyword-triggered advertisements, C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806 every store location of the advertiser may also need to be stored, thereby greatly increasing the amount of information to be stored.

[0005]
Inventories of location-based advertisements are often generated by manually entering store locations into a file. For large chain advertisers, large amounts of data must be entered and such entry is often too cumbersome to be worth their effort.
Alternatively, some mechanism for uploading data files containing store locations is provided. For entry or file uploading to be carried out, however, both the advertiser and the search engine provider must agree on a common format for the data as well as agree on a method of periodically updating and/or uploading the data. As a result, location-based advertising has not been adopted by many advertisers.

As a result, location-based advertising has not been adopted by many advertisers.
[0006] Often, a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising model is used in which the advertiser only pays when a user actually clicks on an advertisement to visit the web site of the advertiser. However, many businesses are not interested in the Internet traffic generated by an ad as their sales are more dependent on the amount of "foot-traffic" such ads generate, i.e., the number customer drawn into their stores by an ad. For such advertisers, ads that merely provide customers with a link to the advertisers' web site is not that valuable.
[0007] Some mapping sites display conventional content-advertisements based on locations shown on a map in response to a location inquiry by a user. Such advertisements, however, may not be targeted to the particular interests of the user.
Alternatively, other mapping sites provide permanent links which show the advertiser's locations on the map. Such advertisements likewise do not target the user's interest and may be of little help to the user.

[0008] Keyword-triggered ads may also be sold which appear directly on the displayed map. However, advertisements in this form may be of limited value to advertisers because only C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 a few lines of ad copy can be shown and often only appear for limited durations. Moreover, such advertisements do not show other information that is of interest to the user, such as the advertiser's retail locations, and do not provide the user with any relation between the displayed map and the advertised business, such as by showing store locations on the map.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009] In accordance with aspects of the present invention, an advertising model for local search queries which provides trackable value to advertisers as well as being useful to users.
[0010] An aspect of the invention is a method of automatically generating location-specific content for a particular entity having a plurality of physical locations.
Database entries that contain identifying data associated with the particular entity are searched for to obtain location information of each of the plurality of physical locations.
The location information, in correlation with one or more keywords associated with the particular entity, is stored in a computer-readable electronic database such that a user-generated query that includes at least one of the keywords and a search location causes a processor to execute operations that initiates a search of the computer-readable electronic database for the location information of the physical locations that are in proximity to the search location. At least one result that is displayable to the user is provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0030] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, an example of a system 100 in accordance with aspects of the present invention includes computers 150, 151, 152 in communication with one another, such as over a network 195, and may include a server 110. As shown in FIG. 2, the server 110 may contain a processor 120, memory 130, and other components typically present in a computer.
[0031] The memory 130 stores information accessible by processor 120, including instructions 140 (e.g., an algorithm) that may be executed by the processor 120, and data 135 that may be retrieved, manipulated, and/or stored by the processor.
The memory may be of any type capable of storing information accessible by the processor, such as a hard-drive, ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, write-capable or read-only memories.
The memory may be of any type capable of storing information accessible by the processor, such as a hard-drive, ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, write-capable or read-only memories.
[0032] The processor 120 may comprise any number of well known processors, such as processors sold by Intel Corporation. Alternatively, the processor may be a dedicated controller for executing operations, such as an ASIC.
[0033] The instructions 140 may comprise any set of instructions to be executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by the processor. In the present application, the terms "instructions," "steps", and "programs"
are used interchangeably. Such instructions may be stored in any computer language or format, such as in object code or C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806 modules of source code. The functions, methods, and routines of the instructions of the invention are explained in more detail below.

Such instructions may be stored in any computer language or format, such as in object code or C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806 modules of source code. The functions, methods, and routines of the instructions of the invention are explained in more detail below.
[0034] Data 135 may be retrieved, stored or modified by the processor 120 in accordance with the instructions 140. The data may be stored as a collection of data. For example, though the invention is not limited by any particular data sLructure, the data may be stored in computer registers, in a relational database as a table having a plurality of different fields and records, as XML documents, or in flat files. The data may also be formatted in any computer readable format such as, but not limited to, binary values, ASCII or EBCDIC
(Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code). Similarly, the data may include images stored in a variety of formats such as vector-based images or bitmap images using lossless (e.g., BMP) or "lossy" (e.g., JPEG) encoding. Moreover, the data may include any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as descriptive text, proprietary codes, pointers, references to data stored in other memories (including other network locations), or information used by a function to calculate such relevant data.

[0035] Though the processor 120 and the memory 130 are functionally illustrated in FIG. 2 as being within the same block, it is understood that the processor and the memory may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing or location. As an example, some or all of the instructions and/or data may be stored on a removable CD-ROM whereas other instructions and/or data may be stored within a read-only computer chip. Some or all of the instructions and/or data may be stored in a location physically remote from, yet still accessible by, the processor. Similarly, the processor may comprise a collection of processors which may or may not operate in parallel.
[0036] In an aspect of the invention, the server 110 communicates with one or more client computers 150-52. Each wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806 client computer may be configured in a manner similar to the server 110, with a processor, memory and instructions, as well as a user input device 170 and a user output device, such as display 160. Each client computer may be a general purpose computer, intended for use by a person 190, 191, 192, shown in FIG. 1, and having all of the internal components normally found in a personal computer (PC), such as a central processing unit (CPU), a display 160, a CD-ROM, a hard-drive, a mouse, keyboard, a touch-sensitive screen, speakers, a microphone, networking equipment such as a modem and/or a router (i.e., a telephone, cable or other router), as well as all of the components used for connecting these elements to one another.
[0037] The server 110 and client computers 150-152 are capable of direct and indirect communication with other computers, such as over the network 195. Although only a few computers are depicted in FIG. 1, it is appreciated that a typical system can include a large number of connected servers and clients, with different computers being located at different nodes of the network. The network 195, as well as any intervening nodes, may comprise various configurations and protocols including the Internet, intranets, virtual private networks, wide area networks, local networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, Ethernet local area networks, wireless fidelity ("WiFi") local area networks, and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
Communication may be facilitated by any device capable of transmitting data to and receiving data from other computers, such as modems (e.g., dial-up or cable modems), network interfaces and wireless interfaces. The server may be a web server. Although certain advantages are obtained when information is transmitted or received in the manner noted above, other aspects of the invention are not limited to any particular manner of transmission of information. For example, in some aspects of the invention, information may be sent using a recording medium, such as a disk, tape, CD-ROM, wo 2010/117675 PCMS2010/028806 or may be sent directly between two computer systems using a dial-up modem. In other aspects, the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and then manually entered into the system.

In other aspects, the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and then manually entered into the system.
[0038] Moreover, computers in accordance with the systems and methods described herein may comprise any device capable of processing instructions, transmitting data to, and/or receiving data from humans and other computers. Such computers may include network computers lacking local storage capability, PDA's with modems, and Internet-capable wireless phones.
[0039] An aspect of the invention automates the generation of an inventory of location based advertisements for subsequent use by a search engine or other program that responds to user queries. The automated generation of such advertisements may be carried out within the server 110 of FIG. 1, which may be the same server that executes the search engine program or similar program.
Alternatively, the inventory of advertisements may be carried out within one of the user systems 150, 151, 152 and then delivered over the network 195 to a server that runs the search engine program or similar program.
Alternatively, the inventory of advertisements may be carried out within one of the user systems 150, 151, 152 and then delivered over the network 195 to a server that runs the search engine program or similar program.
[0040] Preferably, the location based advertisement inventory is generated for a business that is already an advertiser so that data regarding the advertiser is already stored in the server 110 or the user system 150, 151, 152.
Such advertiser data is matched against a data feed or a file that contains, at the very least, business addresses and telephone numbers. For example, a business name contained in the advertiser data can be used to find entries in a Yellow Pages data feed or other business listing data feed that contains the business name. Alternatively, other information can be matched, such as an Internet address (URL) of an advertiser's web site. Such matching can be carried out using any of a number of known correlation techniques.

C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806
[0041] As a further alternative, advertiser data can be matched against data stored in a file that is read by the server or user system or that is uploaded to the user system or server. The data in such feeds or files may be transmitted in a markup language containing tags, such as keyhole markup language (KML), or another geographic information system (GIS) format be used. Updates of the inventory of location-based advertisements may be carried out by simply reading or uploading a new file and then repeating the matching operation described above. As a further alternative, instead of a data teed or file, an online application programming interface (API) can be dynamically accessed to match and accumulate data for the advertisement inventory.
[0042] In addition to the addresses and telephone numbers of business locations, other information may also be read from the data feed or file. As an example, the geo-location of each business site may be included as well as the hours and/or days that each business location is open. Additionally, icons may be incorporated that provide information regarding each particular site, such as whether a business is temporarily closed.
[0043] FIG. 3 shows an example of a web page 300 that displays the results of a known keyword-based search. More specifically, FIG. 3 shows an example in which a user searches for coffee houses and cafes in San Francisco. The user enters search terms that specify the category "Coffee Houses & Cafes"
and the location "SF". A list of the search results 304 including the name, address, and telephone number of each located business as well as a portion of a user review. An icon is displayed next to each search result and contains a letter associated with that search result. The icons are also shown on a map 306 and identify where each coffee house or cafe is located on the map.
and the location "SF". A list of the search results 304 including the name, address, and telephone number of each located business as well as a portion of a user review. An icon is displayed next to each search result and contains a letter associated with that search result. The icons are also shown on a map 306 and identify where each coffee house or cafe is located on the map.
[0044] Though such known web pages may include the display of an advertisement based on keywords which may be used by the search engine or similar program to display a paid C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/0281306 advertisement, such search engines or similar programs are unable to provide location based advertisements. As a result, the advertisement does not contain information that is specific to a user's location. For example, for the keyword based search of "coffee houses" and "cafes" in San Francisco, an advertisement for a national chain of coffee houses is displayed but Is not specific to San Francisco and, in fact, the advertisement may advertise a national chain that does not have any stores in San Francisco.
[0045] An aspect of the present invention provides location-specific advertisements by generating layers that may be used to overlay the web page showing the search results.
FIGS. 4A-4B show an example of a web page in accordance with another aspect of the invention in which a user is provided with the option of displaying one or more such layers on a web page 400. In this example, a user is looking for the locations in San Francisco of a chain coffee houses known as "Tom's" and has entered "toms in sf" as search term 402. The web page displays a list 404 of the business sites located and a map 406 showing the location of each business site. The search engine or similar program that generates the web page also accesses the advertiser data for "Tom's" to determine and display a list of categories 410.

The search engine or similar program that generates the web page also accesses the advertiser data for "Tom's" to determine and display a list of categories 410.
[0046] In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the search engine or similar program also searches an inventory of location-based advertisements and determines that two advertisers match these categories and have stores in San Francisco. Typically, the targeting of a location-based advertisement to a particular region or regions is indicated in a field within the advertisement data. In the present example, the search engine or similar program searches for advertisements that are tagged specifically for San Francisco, and if such advertisements are not found, searches for advertisements that are tagged for wider regions that include San Francisco.

C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806
[0047] The web page preferably displays a "sponsored layers" box 408 that lists each located advertiser, an icon associated with that advertiser, and a check box 409 that allows the user may click on to turn on or off the display the of the store locations of that advertiser on the map 406. The icons that are displayed may be determined from the advertiser information or, alternatively, may be address bar icons, "favicons", that appear on the address bar when the advertiser's web page is displayed by a browser program.
FIG. 4A shows the sponsored layer 408 adjacent to the list of search results 404.
Alternatively, as FIG. 4B shows, the sponsored layers 408 may be displayed atop the map 406.
FIG. 4A shows the sponsored layer 408 adjacent to the list of search results 404.
Alternatively, as FIG. 4B shows, the sponsored layers 408 may be displayed atop the map 406.
[0048] FIG. 5 shows an added layer that is displayed when the user clicks on one of the boxes in the sponsored layers box shown in FIG. 4B. For example, by clicking the check box next to "Tom's", an additional layer is shown atop the map 506 which displays, at each store location on the map 506, an icon associated with the advertiser. In addition to showing the additional layer atop the current map 506, the search engine or similar program then displays this layer atop any other maps that are displayed as the result of further searches by Lhe user. As an example, if the user next carries out a search that results in the display of a map of Boston, each store location of "Tom's" in Boston will be displayed unless the user clicks off the checkbox next to "Tom's".
[0049] FIG. 6 shows another example in which a web page 600 provides the results of a user search for a hardware store chain known as "HW Hardware". In this example, the additional layer is displayed atop a map of a region and shows an icon associated with "HW Hardware" at each store location within the depicted region.
[0050] The web page 600 displays "hw hardware" as the search terms 602, a list 604 of HW Hardware stores in the depicted area, and a map 606 showing the locations of these stores.
Additionally, the search engine or similar program determines from the advertiser information that HW Hardware is C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806 a paid advertiser so that the web page includes an advertisement 608 for HW Hardware as well as a list of categories 610 that pertain to HW Hardware.
Additionally, using the inventory of location-based advertisements, an additional layer is displayed in which a favicon or other icon associated with HW Hardware is shown at each store location.
Additionally, the search engine or similar program determines from the advertiser information that HW Hardware is C:2k 02757700 2011-10-04 wo 2010/117675 PCT/US2010/028806 a paid advertiser so that the web page includes an advertisement 608 for HW Hardware as well as a list of categories 610 that pertain to HW Hardware.
Additionally, using the inventory of location-based advertisements, an additional layer is displayed in which a favicon or other icon associated with HW Hardware is shown at each store location.
[0051] Also, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the user may search for a specific category of business, and the search engine or similar program performs a search that not only takes into account a previously entered location keyword but also identifies the locations of paid advertisers within that location. FIG. 7 shows an example in which the user who carried out the search whose results are shown in FIGS. 4A or 4B subsequently carries out a search for a bank. A web page 700 shows the search term 702 "bank", a list 704 of the banks located by the search, and a map 706 shows the locations of the banks.
Additionally, using the inventory of location-based advertisements, it is determined that one of the banks located by the search, "ABC Bank", is a paid advertiser, and a layer is displayed showing the favicon associated with the bank at each bank locations.
Additionally, using the inventory of location-based advertisements, it is determined that one of the banks located by the search, "ABC Bank", is a paid advertiser, and a layer is displayed showing the favicon associated with the bank at each bank locations.
[0052] In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, various layers may be generated and combined to provide different ways of displaying location-based advertisement as shown, for example, in FIGs. 8A-8G. FIG. 8A
shows a map 902 of a section of a city, for example, without showing any additional layers. FIG. 8B
shows, atop the map 902, another layer that is added after a search for "Tom's" is carried out. The added layer includes a results box 904 that identifies "Tom's" with a marker 906 that is adjacent to its name. A box 908 provides the user with various viewing options. The map 902 also includes markers 906 at each store location of "Tom's".

The map 902 also includes markers 906 at each store location of "Tom's".
[0053] FIG. 80 shows a further layer 910 that may be displayed when the user clicks on a check box next to the phrase "See 3 results as a list" in box 908 shown in FIG. 8B.
The layer 910 is either opaque or semi-transparent and covers over the map 902. The layer 910 displays the number of business locations located within or near the region shown in map 902 the searched for business. Also, the layer allows the user to scroll through the individual locations according to some particular order, such as in order of proximity to a particular location.

Also, the layer allows the user to scroll through the individual locations according to some particular order, such as in order of proximity to a particular location.
[0054]
Additionally, the layer 910 may list a sponsored advertiser, e.g., "Smith's", which may be in the same type of business as the first advertiser or, alternatively, may simply be an advertiser having businesses within the region shown by map 902 shown in Fig. 8A.
Additionally, the layer 910 may list a sponsored advertiser, e.g., "Smith's", which may be in the same type of business as the first advertiser or, alternatively, may simply be an advertiser having businesses within the region shown by map 902 shown in Fig. 8A.
[0055] FIG. 8D
shows the layers that are displayed as a result of the user clicking on the check box 905 of FIG. 9C.
Here, an icon 916 associated with the advertiser "Smith's" is shown at each store location on the map in addition to the icons associated with "Tom's".
Alternatively, the layers shown in Fig. 8D are displayed as a result of a user's search for "Tom's" instead of that shown in Fig. 8B. Namely, a layer for an advertiser is automatically displayed as the search result. Then, the user clicks on either "Tom's" in box 914 or "Smith's" in box 914. Fig. 8E
shows the results of clicking on the box next to "Smith's" which the layer associated with "Smith's" becomes the active layer so that box 918 allows the user to scroll a list of "Smith's" stores. Alternatively, as Fig. 9G shows, the user clicks on "Tom's" to cause the layer associated with "Tom's" to become the active layer and causes box 908 to be displayed so that the user can select to see three search results as a list.
