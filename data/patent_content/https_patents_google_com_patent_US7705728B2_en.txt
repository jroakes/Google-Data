Definitions
- the present invention relates to mobile telecommunications and, more particularly, to selectively sending notifications; when an object tracking device is outside a range of an anchor beacon.
- the ability to use electronic tracking and/or location determination devices is becoming a popular means to automatically determine the location of designated objects. For example, it is becoming a standard feature for mobile telephones to be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) components, which permit precise location determinations for emergency 911 calls. This feature also allows associated functions to be added to a mobile device, such as a GPS navigational capability. This type of electronic tracking is also often used in shipping systems to track packages and in the automotive industry to provide anti-theft and protection services.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- a mobile telephone that includes GPS components and a geo fencing feature can be configured by a family member, such as a parent, to establish permitted zones for school, work, friends' houses, malls, and the like, for the carrier of the mobile telephone.
- Notifications can be automatically sent to the parent's mobile telephone when a monitored family member, such as a child, enters or leaves any of the established zones.
- Notifications can also be issued when a mobile telephone travels over an established speed, which presumably indicates a child or teen is traveling in a vehicle at excessive speeds.
- Current solutions require users establish a set of geographical coordinates, such as GPS coordinates for a geo fence zone, which can be complicated or at least inconvenient for many users. It is believed that many of these users would prefer to be able to set an anchor beacon with a user adjustable range, where the geo fence boundary can be based upon this range. Such a capability is not currently available using any known solution.
- the present invention discloses a solution for associating an object tracking device with one or more anchor beacons, which can he a fixed device or a mobile device.
- Each anchor beacon can emit a signal which is received by the object tracking device.
- the object tracking device When within a signal range, the object tracking device is believed to be in a safe region, and no action is taken.
- the object tracking device can send a notification to a remotely located tracking server using an Over the Air (OTA) communication.
- OTA communication can be any wireless communication sent over a wireless network.
- the tracking server can then determine whether to send a notification to a caretaker's computing device to inform the caretaker of the tracked object's current position.
- a set of safe mobile computing devices can be established, which when proximate or collocated with the object tracking device, prevent a notification from being issued.
- the object tracking device can be placed within a pet's collar.
- An anchor beacon can emit a signal that covers an owner's yard.
- the owner can also have a mobile communication device with location determination capabilities that is registered with a tracking server.
- a notification signal can be sent from the object tracking device to the tracking server.
- the tracking server can then determine whether the registered communication device is proximate to the pet, which indicates that the owner is walking the dog. If so, the tracking server can optionally issue one or more OTA commands to the tracking device, potentially altering a location measuring interval now that the pet is outside the range of the anchor beacon.
- the range can be based on a received signal quality and whether that quality exceeds a signal quality threshold established for the tracking device.
- the quality of a signal can be determined by any of many means known to those in the art. Examples include received signal strength, packet error rates, bit error rates, etc.
- the range can be any configurable value, not to exceed a maximum broadcast range of the anchor beacon.
- the tracking server can issue a notice to the mobile communication device, such as calling or text messaging the pet owner, so that the owner is aware that, the pet has left the yard.
- the location of the pet can be continuously tracked by the tracking server until the pet is returned to the safe region.
- the tracking server can use the pet's location and a location of the mobile device to guide an owner to their wayward pet,
- a geo fence boundary i.e., a safe region
- the tracking device can be any other mobile device, such as a different mobile phone.
- the tracking server can determine a relative position of the two devices to each other. When the tracking device is outside the geo fence boundary (i.e., a mobile boundary centered upon the first mobile phone), the tracking server can automatically convey a notice to a designated caretaker. Thus, notifications are sent when the tracking device is not proximate to the mobile device. Additionally, multiple different mobile devices can establish multiple geo fence boundaries.
- one aspect of the present invention can include a system for tracking objects comprising at least one anchor beacon, at least one object tracking device, and a tracking server.
- Each anchor beacon can broadcast a signal over a designated range, which can be user configurable.
- Each object tracking device can include a beacon sensor for detecting the signal broadcast by the beacon.
- the tracking device can also include a location detector and a wireless transceiver.
- the tracking server can automatically receive a message via the wireless transceiver when the beacon sensor is unable to detect the signal broadcast by the beacon or when the broadcast signal quality falls below an established signal quality threshold.
- the message can include a location of the object, tracking device.
- Multiple time spaced messages providing updated location information concerning the object tracking device can be repetitively received by the tracking server while the beacon sensor is unable to detect the signal broadcast.
- the tracking device can selectively notify one or more registered notification computing devices when the object tracking device is outside the designated range of the anchor beacon. Further, real-time guidance can be provided to the notification computing device, such as a mobile computing device, to help a user find the object tracking device.
- an anchor beacon can emit a broadcast over a range that is detectable by an object tracking device.
- the object tracking device can automatically detect a presence or absence of the broadcast as well as a signal broadcast quality. When the broadcast is present and has a quality greater than an established threshold, the object tracking device can take no action. When the broadcast is absent, the object tracking device can determine a current location for the object tracking device and can convey an OTA communication to a tracking server. The OTA communication can indicate the absence of the broadcast and can also include the current location.
- the tracking server can selectively send a notification to a previously designated communication device to notify a user that the object tracking device is outside the range.
- Still another method of the present invention can include a method for associating anchor beacons with location tracking devices.
- Anchor beacons can be stationary or mobile devices.
- a signal can be broadcast from each anchor beacon over a range.
- An object tracking device attached to a movable object can selectively detect the signal.
- a location of the object tracking device can be determined.
- the determined location can be conveyed to a remotely located tracking server.
- the tracking server can selectively convey a notification to at least one previously designated communication device to notify a user that the object tracking device is outside the range. The steps of the method can be repeated until a safe state for the location tracking device is determined.
- a safe state can be entered when the object tracking device detects the signal, when the object tracking device detects a different signal broadcast from a different authorized anchor beacon, when the tracking server conveys an over the air command to the object tracking device that indicates a safe state, when the object tracking device detects a presence of a proximately located safe device, and/or when the object tracking device receives an approved signal from a proximately located safe device.
- various aspects of the invention can be implemented as a program for controlling computing equipment to implement the functions described herein, or a program for enabling computing equipment to perform processes corresponding to the steps disclosed herein.
- This program may be provided by storing the program in a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a semiconductor memory, or any other recording medium.
- the program can also be provided as a digitally encoded signal conveyed via a carrier wave.
- the described program can be a single program or can be implemented as multiple subprograms, each of which interact within a single computing device or interact in a distributed fashion across a network space.
- FIG. 1 is a set of diagrams that illustrate how a proximity of a tracking device to defined safe devices automatically results in notifications being sent when the tracking devices are away from the safe devices in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 2 is a graphical representation illustrating the basic interactions occurring within an object tracking system in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a system that selectively notifies concerned parties when a tracking device is outside a region defined as safe in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 4 illustrates two flow charts which depict how an object tracking device and a tracking server interact in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 1 is a set of diagrams 100 , 120 , and 140 that illustrate how a proximity of a tracking device to defined safe devices automatically results in notifications being sent when the tracking devices are away from the safe devices in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- Safe devices can include stationary and/or moving anchor beacons that define a safe region as well as specific mobile devices designated by a user.
- Diagram 100 begins with example area 101 that defines the initial positions and settings of its components.
- Example area 101 can include a sale region 102 that can be created by an anchor beacon 105 .
- the size of the safe region 102 can be governed by the beacon range 106 . It should be appreciated that the size of the safe region 102 can vary in shape and size depending upon the number of anchor beacons 105 that are used to define the safe region 102 , the type of broadcast signal output by the anchor beacon 105 , and the presence of objects that block the anchor beacon's 105 signal within the safe region 102 .
- a user can adjust a power setting of the anchor beacon 105 to adjust the range 106 and size of safe region 102 as well as one or more antenna orientations.
- a user can establish a signal quality threshold that defines a designated range of permitted movement for the tracking device. Changing this threshold can change a permitted range from the anchor beacon, in diagrams 110 , 120 , and 140 , it is assumed that the tracking device is set at a designated range, which is used to define the safe region 102 .
- An owner 103 and their pet 110 can be located within the safe region 102 .
- Owner 103 can possess a mobile device 104 .
- the pet 110 can wear a tracking collar 112 that contains a power conserving tracking device. While the pet 110 is within the safe region 102 , the tracking collar 112 can operate under the shown tracking settings 113 .
- These tracking settings 113 illustrate that the tracking collar 112 can function in a low power mode when near an anchor beacon 105 and that owner notifications are unnecessary in this situation.
- This new set of tracking settings 114 can include a change in the power mode of the tracking collar 112 due to the activation of its wide area communications component, such as a WAN transceiver. Additionally, the new tracking settings can trigger the generation of a notification that can be sent to one or more designated devices. In this example, die owner 103 can receive the notification stating that the object has left the safe region 102 on their mobile device 104 .
- the owner 103 can be walking their pet 110 outside of the safe region 102 .
- the owner 103 can be in possession of their mobile device 104 while on the walk and this mobile device 104 can he designated as a safe device.
- Designation of the mobile device 104 as a safe device can result in it having associated tracking settings 125 .
- the tracking settings 125 can indicate that, an active tracking mode and wide area communications have been activated for the tracking device (collar 112 ), and that notifications are unnecessary. This is similar to the change in settings illustrated in diagram 100 , where the tracking collar 112 can no longer remain in the low power mode.
- a tracking server 130 can receive location signals 127 and 128 from the mobile device 104 and tracking collar 112 , respectively. With the locational information contained within the location signals 127 and 128 , the tracking server 130 can determine the proximity of the tracking device (collar 112 ) to a safe device (mobile device 104 ) and the anchor beacon 105 . The tracking server 130 can then use these determined distances to check against a user-defined tracking profile 135 ,
- the tracking profile 135 can contain preset conditions and corresponding allowed safe distances. Since the tracking device (collar 112 ) meets the condition for the safe device (mobile device 104 ) and both devices are within the distance allowed from the anchor beacon 105 , the tracking server 130 can determine that the pet 110 is intentionally outside of the safe region 102 and that this is not a cause for alarm. Other settings can be established in profile 135 for different devices having different owners. For example, a device 199 can be a mobile telephone carried by a child who is permitted to walk the pet 110 up to two miles from the yard so long as the child stays within forty feet of the pet 110 .
- a different person associated with device 195 can be permitted to travel with the pet 110 up to fen miles from the yard so long as the pet 110 stays within twenty feet of device 195 . It can be appreciated that a range of values for the “allowed safe distance” can include zero to infinity and all values in between.
- a special safe power mode can be employed that selectively turns on a WAN transceiver and detection component at a long iteration, such as once every fifteen minutes. This means a location of the pet 110 is conveyed to the tracking server 130 at fifteen minute intervals. If the pet 110 strays too far from the safe device, the tracking collar 112 can be adjusted to an active tracking mode, having a shorter iteration between location transmissions than the safe power mode. For example, the WAN transceiver and detection component can be activated once every five minutes in the active tracking mode, causing a location of the pet 110 to be sent to the server 130 every five minutes. In one configuration, distance transmission iterations can be dynamically shortened to conserve power when the power remaining in the tracking collar 112 is low.
- Diagram 140 illustrates a situation similar to diagram 120 , where the pet 110 is outside of the safe region 102 with its owner 103 who is carrying a mobile device 145 .
- proximity between an owner 103 and a pet 110 can be based upon a personal area network 150 range.
- both the mobile device 145 and the tracking collar 112 can be BLUETOOTH enabled devices, which are automatically aware of one another when within BLUETOOTH range. Broadcasts from the collar 112 to a tracking server 155 can occur only when the collar 112 is outside of the safe region 102 and outside of the BLUETOOTH range of device 145 .
- the BLUETOOTH range is indicated by the dashed line labeled personal area network (PAN) 150 .
- diagram 140 shows a configuration that permits the collar 112 to selectively remain in low power mode, even when outside of the safe region 102 .
- Communications that authorize the mobile device 145 as a safe device can occur between device 145 and a remotely located device 155 , which can be a server hosting the tracking profile 160 .
- the device 155 can send an authorization key to device 145 , which is conveyed to the collar 112 via the PAN 150 .
- the authorization key can automatically time-out, which allows the computing device 155 to account for profile parameters, such as distance from sale region 102 .
- the authorization key can expire every half hour, requiring a new updated key be requested 152 .
- a new key can be conveyed within a response 154 , when the mobile device 145 is located an allowed distance from region 102 . When outside of this distance, no key will be sent in response 154 , which causes collar 112 to shift from a low-power mode to an active tracking mode, which in turn results in a notice (not shown) being sent.
- FIG. 2 is a graphical representation 200 illustrating the basic interactions occurring within an object tracking system in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. These interactions can occur between the following components: anchor beacon 201 , tracking device 202 , WAN server 203 , and safe device 204 .
- Interaction can begin when the tracking device 202 receives signal 205 from the anchor beacon 201 . Since the tracking device 202 can receive the signal 205 broadcast 207 from the anchor beacon 201 , it can be determined that the tracking device 202 is within the safe region defined by the broadcast area of the anchor beacon 201 . Therefore, the tracking device 202 can be placed in a low power mode 208 . Since the anchor beacon 201 defines the safe region, it can be set in a state of constant broadcast 207 .
- the tracking device 202 can be determined that the tracking device 201 has left the safe region defined by the anchor beacon 201 . At this point, the tracking device 202 can be automatically taken out of the low power mode 208 through the execution of a wake up process 212 .
- the wake up process 212 can activate the WAN transceiver 213 and location detector 214 . Activation of these components can increase the power consumption of tracking device 202 .
- the location detector 214 can then determine the location of the tracking device 202 and send its location 215 to the WAN server 203 . Upon receipt of this information, the WAN server 203 can access the tracking profile 220 associated with the tracking device 202 . The contents of the tracking profile 220 can resemble the information illustrated in the tracking profile 135 of FIG. 1 .
- the WAN server 203 can attempt to determine the proximity of the tracking device 202 to a safe device 204 . It should be appreciated that this step should be performed for each safe device 204 defined within the tracking profile 220 . In order to make this determination, the WAN server 203 can query the location 222 of the safe device 204 . The safe device 204 can respond to this query with its locational information 223 .
- Step 224 shows that the safe device is proximate, which results in a power saving tracking command 226 being sent to the tracking device 202 .
- This command 226 causes device 202 to enter a safe tracking mode 228 .
- location information can be conveyed over a WAN at a long interval.
- the tracking device 202 can determine that no beacon signal 232 is present. This causes a location 234 of the device 202 to be conveyed to WAN server 203 .
- the server can again query the profile 236 for safe devices.
- Device 204 can be queried 238 for a location, which is provided in response 240 .
- the WAN server 203 can determine 242 that the safe device 204 is now no longer proximate to the tracking device 202 .
- a notice 244 is to be sent to safe device 204
- the WAN server 203 can send the notice 244 to any receptive device designated by a user and that sending the notice 244 to the safe device 204 is merely an illustration of a possible configuration.
- a power active tracking command 246 is to be issued from the server 203 to the tracking device 202 .
- This command 246 can cause device 202 to be adjusted from safe tracking mode to an active tracking mode 248 .
- the active tracking mode 248 can have a shorter interval for conveying current location information to server 203 .
- the tracking device 202 can check for a signal 250 from an anchor beacon 201 , which is present. This means that the device 202 is now in a safe region. A notice 252 to this effect can be sent to the WAN server 203 , which can send a similar notice 254 to the safe device 204 , so the owner or guardian is no longer concerned about the object associated with the tracking device 202 .
- the tracking device 202 can shift back from the active tracking mode to the low power mode 256 .
- the invention can be implemented without the anchor beacon 201 . That is, proximity between the tracking device 202 and the safe device 204 can determine whether a tracking server sends a notice to a designated notification device (e.g., a caretaker's device).
- a designated notification device e.g., a caretaker's device
- FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a system 300 that selectively notifies concerned parties when a tracking device is outside a region defined as safe in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.

- a user can access the administration interface 351 via computing device 305 . For example, a user could access the interface over the Internet from a mobile telephone.
- the power source 320 of the tracking device 315 can include power modes 322 . As shown in this example, the power source 320 supports three power modes 322 .
- the low power mode can be analogous to a sleep mode and can be invoked when the tracking device 315 is within the safe region.
- the tracking mode can be analogous to a full power mode and can be invoked when the tracking device 315 is outside of the safe region and not proximate to a safe device; the system 300 is actively trying to locate the object. Should the tracking device be proximate to a sale mobile device 345 , the safe tracking mode can be invoked, which consumes less power than the active tracking mode.
- presented data stores can be a physical or virtual storage space configured to store digital information.
- Data stores 325 and 352 can be physically implemented within any type of hardware including, but not limited to, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a semiconductor memory, a digitally encoded plastic memory, a holographic memory, or any other recording medium.
