- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , publishers 109 , and a content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , and publishers 109 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, e.g., scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by, for example, a publisher 109 , e.g., an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few examples.
- the resources 105 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the publishers 109 on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, tablet devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 and the presentation of content to a user.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can access, for example, the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the data representing the resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page
- other content e.g., advertisements
- a search result 118 or a resource 105 can be sent responsive to a request received from a user device 106 .
- the search result 118 or resource 105 can be sent with a request for the web browser of the user device 106 to set a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie.
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- a cookie can represent, for example, a particular user device 106 and/or a particular web browser.
- the search system 112 can include a server that replies to a search query 116 by sending a search result 118 in an HTTP response.
- Such an HTTP response can include instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) requesting the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server.
- each cookie can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the cookie was initially set on the particular user device 106 . If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, subsequent page requests to the same server can include the cookie for that server. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies can allow an external service, such as the search system 112 or other system, to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions.
- the cookie can store a variety of data, including a unique or semi-unique identifier.
- the identifier can be anonymized so that the privacy of users is protected. For example, in some implementations, semi-unique identifiers are associated with users, but actual identifying information of the users is not stored in a cookie. Additionally, any identified user interactions can be generalized rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users.
- the content management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results 118 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results 118 are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request, such as content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot.
- content items having selection keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 116 may be selected as eligible content items by the content management system 110 .
- Content items may be selected, for example from a content repository 115 .
- One or more selected content items can be provided to the user device 106 in association with providing an associated resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive bids from content providers 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction).
- some content providers 108 prefer that the number of impressions allocated to their content and the price paid for the number of impressions be more predictable than the predictability provided by an auction.
- a content provider 108 can increase the likelihood that its content receives a desired or specified number of impressions, for example, by entering into an agreement with a publisher 109 , where the agreement requires the publisher 109 to provide at least a threshold number of impressions (e.g., 1,000 impressions) for a particular content item provided by the content provider 108 over a specified period (e.g., one week).
- the content provider 108 , publisher 109 , or both parties can provide data to the content management system 110 that enables the content management system 110 to facilitate satisfaction of the agreement.
- the content provider 108 can upload a content item and authorize the content management system 110 to provide the content item in response to requests for content corresponding to the website 104 of the publisher 109 .
- the publisher 109 can provide the content management system 110 with data representing the specified time period as well as the threshold number of impressions that the publisher 109 has agreed to allocate to the content item over the specified time period.
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on a goal of allocating at least a minimum number of impressions to a content item in order to satisfy a delivery goal for the content item during a specified period of time.
- User interaction data representing user interactions with presented content items can be stored in a historical data store 120 .
- User interaction data can be associated with unique identifiers (e.g., cookies) that each represent a corresponding user device 106 with which a given user interaction was performed.
- unique identifiers e.g., cookies
- data can be stored in the historical data store 120 representing the content item impression.
- the data is stored in response to a request for the content item that is presented.
- a request for content can include data identifying a particular cookie, such that data identifying the cookie can be stored in association with data that identifies the content item(s) that are presented in response to the request.
- data can be stored in the historical data store 120 representing the selection of the content item.
- the historical data store 120 can store references to content items and data representing conditions under which each content item was selected for presentation to a user.
- the historical data store 120 can store selection keywords, bids, and other criteria with which eligible content items are selected for presentation.
- the historical data store 120 can include information related to conversions.
- a conversion occurs when a user performs a specified action.
- conversion data representing the conversion can be stored in the historical data store 120 .
- Such conversion data can be stored in association with one or more cookies for the user device 106 that was used to perform the user interaction.
- What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways.
- a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item, is referred to a web page, and then consummates a purchase before leaving that web page.
- Actions that constitute a conversion can be specified by each content provider 108 on a content provider by content provider basis.
- each content provider 108 can select, as a conversion, one or more measurable/observable user actions such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, or registering on a website.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- a conversion can be defined to occur upon the occurrence of a final action that is used to define the conversion. For example, if a user visiting five web pages defines a conversion, the conversion occurs upon the user's request for the fifth web page, and the four page views that occurred prior to the request for the fifth web page are considered to have occurred prior to the conversion.
- the historical data store 120 can include data that represents conversion cycles.
- a conversion cycle can be defined as a period that begins when a user is presented a content item and ends at a time at which the user takes action (e.g., that constitutes a conversion).
- a conversion cycle can be measured and/or constrained by time or actions and can span multiple user sessions.
- User sessions can be defined as sets of user interactions that are grouped together for analysis. Each user session includes data representing user interactions that were performed by a particular user and within a session window (i.e., a specified period).
- the session window can be, for example, a specified period of time (e.g., one hour, one day, or one month) or can be delineated using specified actions.
- a user search session can include user search queries and subsequent actions that occur over a one hour period and/or occur prior to a session ending event (e.g., closing of a search browser).
- a content provider 108 can be provided various reports 122 .
- a content provider can be provided a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), interactions (e.g., selections (i.e., clicks)), and conversions that have been identified for the content items that are provided by the content provider 108 .
- a campaign performance report can also provide a total cost, a cost-per-click, and other cost measures for a content item over a specified period of time.
- a user interaction report can measure user interactions with content that is distributed to users for the content provider 108 .
- the reports 122 that are provided to a particular content provider 108 specify performance measures measuring user interactions with content that occur prior to a conversion.
- the content management system 110 can determine a suggested time for a content provider 108 for linking interactions and events (e.g., conversion events) based on data in the historical data store 120 .
- the suggested time can be, for example, a lookback window which defines a time window for linking interactions with events.
- the suggested time can be included in one or more of the reports 122 that are provided to the content provider 108 .
- the content management system 110 can automatically configure one or more campaigns associated with the content provider 108 to use the determined lookback window.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for determining a suggested lookback window.
- a content management system 202 can identify data for a content provider from a historical data store 204 , in response to a request received for a report for a content provider, or as part of an automated process which automatically and periodically determines a lookback window for the content provider.
- the data identified from the historical data store 204 can include data related to presentation of content to users and data related to interactions of users with content presented by the content provider.
- the identified data can also include data related to events, such as conversion events.
- the identified data can be, for example, data for the content provider that corresponds to a specified time period. Other examples include the content provider specifying a particular country or other geographic area for which to identify data, or one or more channels or mediums (e.g., search, display channels) for which to identify data.
- the content management system 202 can develop or identify one or more models for linking interactions with events.
- the content provider may have previously selected one or more models to be associated with one or more campaigns of the content provider.
- a model can include one or more criteria for use in evaluating an interaction to determine when an interaction should be linked to a given event.
- a model can include one or more rules which define whether an interaction is attributed to a conversion, and for some models, one or more rules which assign a weight to attributed interactions.
- the content management system 202 can identify a set of models 210 which include a first-interaction model 210 a which includes criteria specifying that a first interaction in a time period is linked to a given event, a last-interaction model 210 b which includes criteria specifying that a last interaction in a time period is linked to a given event, an all-interactions model 210 c which includes criteria specifying that all interactions in a time period are linked to a given event, and a “last-four, weighted” model 210 d which indicates that the four most recent interactions are linked to a given event, at specified weights.
- the “last-four, weighted” model 210 d can, for example, specify that the four most recent interaction are to be weighted, in order of increasing age, using weights of, for example, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.
- the content management system 202 can evaluate each of the identified models 210 a - d using the identified data from the historical data store 204 .
- the content management system 202 can evaluate, among other historical data, example historical data 216 .
- the example historical data 216 includes, among other data, data for a content provider “P 1 ”.
- the example historical data 216 includes data 218 for a conversion event by a user “U 1 ”.
- the example historical data 216 indicates that, prior to the conversion event, the user “U 1 ” performed several interactions related to a campaign of the content provider “P 1 ”.
- data items 220 - 226 indicate that the user was presented a content item “C 1 ”, selected the content item “C 1 ”, was presented a content item “C 4 ”, and selected the content item “C 4 ”, respectively.
- the content management system 202 can, for each event identified in the historical data 204 , determine for each model a number of interactions that occurred in each of a set of time periods prior to a time of event for a given event.
- the time periods can be specified, for example, in terms of days, hours, or some other time value.
- a table 230 represents information that can be determined by the content management system 202 .
- the table 230 includes information for time periods 232 a - f having durations of 0-1 days, 2-5 days, 6-10 days, 11-20 days, 21-30 days, and 31-60 days, respectively.
- the time periods do not overlap. In other implementations, one or more of the time periods may overlap.
- the content management system 202 can, when evaluating the first-interaction model 210 a , determine that the interaction corresponding to the data 220 is to be linked to the conversion event corresponding to the data 218 .
- the content management system 202 can determine that the time period 232 c of 6-10 days is associated with the interaction corresponding to the data 220 by comparing a timestamp included in the data 220 to a timestamp included in the data 218 .
- the content management system 202 can increment a counter associated with the first-interaction model 210 a and with the time period 232 c (e.g., a counter corresponding to a table cell 234 ).
- the content management system 202 can, when evaluating the last-interaction model 210 b , determine that the interaction corresponding to the data 226 is to be linked to the conversion event corresponding to the data 218 .
- the content management system 202 can determine that the time period 232 b of 2-5 days is associated with the interaction corresponding to the data 226 by comparing a timestamp included in the data 226 to a timestamp included in the data 218 .
- the content management system 202 can increment a counter associated with the last-interaction model 210 b and with the time period 232 b (e.g., a counter corresponding to a table cell 236 ).
- the content management system 202 can, when evaluating the all-interactions model 210 c , determine that the four interactions corresponding to the data 220 , 222 , 224 , and 226 , respectively, are to be linked to the conversion event corresponding to the data 218 .
- the content management system 202 can determine that the time period 232 c corresponds to the interactions corresponding to the data 220 and 222 and can determine that the time period 232 b corresponds to the interactions corresponding to the data 224 and 226 .
- the content management system can add two to a counter corresponding to the all-interactions model 210 c and to the time period 232 b (e.g., a counter corresponding to a table cell 238 ) and can add two to a counter corresponding to the all-interactions model 210 c and to the time period 232 c (e.g., a counter corresponding to a table cell 240 ).
- the content management system 202 can, when evaluating the “last-four, weighted” model 210 d , determine that the four interactions corresponding to the data 220 , 222 , 224 , and 226 , respectively, are to be linked to the conversion event corresponding to the data 218 , but at a respective weight for each of the four interactions. For example, values of 0.4 and 0.3 can be added to a counter associated with the model 210 d and with the time period 232 b (e.g., a counter corresponding to a table cell 242 ), to apply weights for the interactions corresponding to the data 226 and 224 , respectively.
- values of 0.2 and 0.1 can be added to a counter associated with the model 210 d and with the time period 232 c (e.g., a counter corresponding to a table cell 244 ), to apply weights for the interactions corresponding to the data 222 , and 220 , respectively.
- the content management system 202 can perform one or more mathematical operations on the determined number of interactions in each time period for each model and can produce a result for each model for each time period. For example, the content management system 202 can accumulate interactions associated with a respective time period to determine a total number of interactions associated with the time period, as illustrated by totals 246 a - f that are respectively associated with the time periods 232 a - f.
- the content management system 202 can, for example, determine a time window for each of the models 210 a - d . For example, the content management system 202 can determine which of the time windows 232 a - f has the most associated interactions for each respective model 210 a - d , or the content management system 202 can use another calculation to determine a time window for each model 210 a - d.
- the content management system 202 can determine one or more suggested times (e.g., lookback window(s)) for the content provider based on the result(s) of the performed mathematical operation(s) and on the time windows determined for each model 210 a - d . For example, a single time can be suggested, a time can be suggested for each model 210 a - d used in the evaluating, a time can be suggested for each model 210 a - d that is associated with (e.g., used by) the content provider, a time can be suggested for each channel in a set of channels used by the content provider, or a time can be suggested for each of one or more campaigns that are associated with the content provider.
- a suggested time represents an amount of time before an event (e.g., a conversion) in which interactions are linked (e.g., attributed) to the event.
- the content management system 202 can determine a suggested time by selecting a time window associated with a model from the models 210 a - d that is slowest to converge. For example, suppose that time windows of 20 days, 2 days, 10 days, and 5 days have been determined for the models 210 a - d , respectively. In this example, the content management system 202 can determine a selected time of 20 days. In some implementations, the content management system 202 can determine a suggested time by selecting a time window associated with a model that is fastest to converge (e.g., a time of window of 2 days in the above example). As another example, the content management system 202 can determine a suggested time as an aggregate of the suggested time windows of one or more models. For example, the content management system 202 can determine an average time window for the time windows associated with the models 210 a - d (e.g., an average time window of 9.25 days, which can be rounded down to 9 days or rounded up to 10 days).
- the content management system 202 can verify the suggested time(s) by comparing the suggested time(s) to data determined by an analytics system 250 and/or to data in an industry database 251 .
- the content management system 202 can, for example, identify data in the industry database 251 that is associated with content providers that are similar to the content provider, such as information about typical conversion path lengths or typical lookback windows that are used by similar content providers.
- the content management system 202 can compare such information to the suggested time(s) to verify whether the suggested time(s) are reasonable/appropriate for the content provider.
- the content management system 202 can automatically determine the suggested time(s) on a periodic basis and can store the determined suggested time(s). As part of a verification process, the content management system 202 can compare a current determined suggested time for a content provider to suggested times previously determined for the content provider, to determine whether a difference between the current time and, for example, an average previously-determined suggested time is more than a threshold. As part of the verification process, the content management system 202 can take into account predefined times, days, or date ranges which may be known to likely produce different results, such as “Black Friday”, “Cyber Monday”, the Christmas shopping season in general, Super Bowl Sunday, etc. Such analysis can take a country of the content provider into account (e.g., the content management system 202 can determine whether a particular time, day, date range, holiday, etc. applies to a given country).
- the content management system 202 can adjust the suggested time based on, for example, cookie deletion data.
- the cookie deletion data can indicate an amount of time a cookie is likely to be valid.
- a user (or a browser) can automatically or manually delete cookies, for example.
- the content management system 202 can identify a predetermined average maximum cookie age, such as from a cookie deletion database or model.
- the content management system 202 can compare a suggested time (e.g., a time that is associated with a model that is slowest to converge) to the average maximum cookie age and can set the suggested time to be, for example, the average maximum cookie age if the suggested time is greater than the average maximum cookie age.
- the content management system 202 may reduce the suggested time in such an example to avoid a bias that may occur if a time longer than the average maximum cookie age is suggested.
- a bias can occur if a suggested time longer than the average maximum cookie age is used, since interaction data that is analyzed for potential linking to events may include a disproportionate amount of data from users who don't delete cookies, or who delete cookies infrequently.
- the content management system 202 can identify a sensitivity to using a suggested time and can apply a correction factor to the suggested time based on the sensitivity. For example, a default sensitivity of 95% can be identified, which allows the system to adjust the suggested time by 5% (e.g., reduced by 5%). As another example, the content management system 202 can determine a mean suggested time from a set of determined suggested times (e.g., from a set of suggested times associated with the models 210 a - d ). The content management system 202 can add, for example, a standard deviation to the mean suggested time.
- the content management system 202 can set the suggested time to the average maximum cookie age.
- a sensitivity to use can be identified from the industry database 251 or from some other data source.
- the content management system 202 can automatically configure one or more campaigns for the content provider using the suggested time(s).
- the content management system 202 can also present the suggested time(s) to the content provider, such as on a report 252 .
- the report 252 includes a suggested lookback window 254 of 18 days for a campaign “C 1 ”.
- the report 252 can also include a cost value 256 of $200,000 which can be determined based on a comparison between the suggested lookback window 254 and a current lookback window 258 .
- the content management system 202 can identify that the current lookback window 258 that is associated with the content provider, can compare the current lookback window 258 to the suggested lookback window 254 , and can determine the cost value 256 , which represents an amount that is discounted based on the comparison. For example, suppose that using the current lookback window 258 of 15 days results in the linking of 75% of interactions for the content provider with a corresponding event.
- the cost value 256 can be determined by determining a cost for the content provider of the additional 15% of interactions that can be determined to be associated with an event as a result of using the more appropriate (i.e., suggested) lookback window.
- the report 252 can include information related to the verification of the suggested time(s). For example, if verification performed by the content management system 202 indicates that the suggested time(s) are sufficiently inconsistent with data from the analytics system 250 and/or the industry database 251 , the report 252 can include one or more associated warnings and/or one or more controls which the content provider can use to accept or reject the use of the suggested time(s) in light of the warning information. In some implementations, the report 252 can include a graphical representation of one or more of the suggested lookback window 254 , the current lookback window 258 , the cost difference 256 , and data that is from or based on data from the analytics system 250 or the industry database 251 .
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for determining a suggested lookback window.
- the process 300 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 or the content management system 202 described above with respect to FIG. 2 .
- Data for a content provider is identified ( 302 ), wherein the data includes data related to presentation of content and interactions of users with content presented by the content provider.
- the data can further include events.
- the data can be, for example, log data.
- the events can be, for example, conversion events.
- a sample of data for the content provider is identified. For example, a random sample of a certain percentage (e.g., ten percent) of data that is available for the content provider can be identified.
- data for a particular medium or channel e.g., a search channel, a display channel
- data for a particular country or other geographic area, a particular time period, or data matching some other filter can be identified for the content provider.
- a first model for linking interactions with events is identified ( 304 ), wherein the first model includes one or more criteria for use in evaluating an interaction to determine when an interaction should be linked to a given event.
- the criteria can include criteria that define different types of sponsored content or different mediums for presentation of the sponsored content.
- the criteria can also include, for example, one or more rules which define which interactions are linked to an event, and for some models, weights that may be applied to some or all interactions.
- the first model can be a first-interaction model where a first interaction in a time period is linked to a given event, a last-interaction model where a last interaction in a time period is linked to a given event, a weighted model where multiple interactions are linked to a given event with each interaction having a respective weight, or a model for which all interactions in a time period are linked to a given event with a same weight applied to each interaction.
- Other models are possible.
- Linking can include, for example, for a given event, crediting an entity associated with an interaction that occurred in a suggested time prior to an occurrence of the given event. Linking can include, for example, attributing the interaction to the event. For example, in implementations where events are conversions and where the model is a first-interaction model, a first interaction (e.g., a first selection or click) of a content item in a time period before a conversion event can be attributed to the conversion event.
- a first interaction e.g., a first selection or click
- the first model is evaluated by one or more processors ( 306 ).
- the evaluating can include, for each event, determining for the first model and using the data, a number of interactions that occurred in each of a plurality of time periods prior to a time of event for a given event ( 308 ).
- the time periods can be non-overlapping.
- the time periods can include, for example, from zero to three days before the event, from four to ten days before the event, from eleven to twenty days before the event, from twenty one to thirty days before the event, and more than thirty days before the event. Other time periods and a different number of time periods can be used. Time periods can be defined in terms of days, hours, or some other time amount. Determining that a particular interaction occurred in a particular time period before the event can include comparing a timestamp associated with the event to a timestamp associated with the interaction.
- the evaluating can include performing a mathematical operation on the number of interactions in each time period for the first model, producing a result ( 310 ).
- the mathematical operation can be an accumulation and the result can be a total number in a respective time period.
- the evaluating can include determining a suggested time (i.e., to be suggested to the content provider) for linking interactions and events based at least in part on the result for each time period ( 312 ), where the suggested time represents an amount of time before an event in which interactions are appropriately linked to the event.
- the suggested time can define a time window (e.g., a lookback window) for linking interactions with (e.g., attributing interactions to) events.
- the criteria includes criteria that define different types of sponsored content or different mediums for presentation of the sponsored content, the suggested time can be attributable to such criteria.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for determining a suggested lookback window.
- the process 400 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 or the content management system 202 described above with respect to FIG. 2 .
- One or more second models for linking interactions with events are determined ( 402 ), wherein the one or more second models are different from a first model (e.g., the first model described above with respect to FIG. 3 ).
- Each of the one or more second models includes one or more criteria for use in evaluating an interaction to determine when an interaction should be linked to a given event for a respective model.
- the first model can be, for example, a first-interaction model where a first interaction in a time period is linked to a given event and the one or more second models can include one or more of a last-interaction model where a last interaction in a time period is linked to a given event, a weighted model where multiple interactions are linked to a given event but each at a respective weight, and a model for which all interactions in a time period are linked to a given event with each interaction weighted (e.g., equally).
- a first-interaction model where a first interaction in a time period is linked to a given event
- the one or more second models can include one or more of a last-interaction model where a last interaction in a time period is linked to a given event, a weighted model where multiple interactions are linked to a given event but each at a respective weight, and a model for which all interactions in a time period are linked to a given event with each interaction weighted (e.g., equally).
- the one or more second models are evaluated by one or more processors ( 404 ).
- the evaluating can include, for each event, determining for each model and using data identified for a content provider, a number of interactions that occurred in each of the plurality of time periods prior to a time of event for a given event ( 406 ).
- the data identified for the content provider can be as described above for step 302 of the process 300 .
- the evaluating can include performing a mathematical operation on the number of interactions in each time period for each model, producing a result for each model for each time period ( 408 ).
- the mathematical operation can be an accumulation and the result can be a total number in a respective time period.
- the evaluating can include determining a suggested time for event linking for the content provider based at least in part on the result in each time period for each model ( 410 ). Determining the suggested time can include picking a time window associated with one model of the first and the one or more second models. For example, a time window associated with the first model or the one or more second models that is a slowest model to converge can be selected. As another example, a time window associated with the first or one of the second models that is the fastest to converge can be selected. As yet another example, a time window that is a median time window from among time windows associated with the first and the one or more second models can be selected.
- a suggested time window can be selected that is an aggregate of the suggested time windows for at least two models of the first and the one or more second models.
- one or more outlier time windows can be excluded from the aggregating. For example, a slowest to converge and a fastest to converge can be excluded. As another example, time windows that are above a first threshold or below a second threshold can be excluded based on an assumption that such time windows are not reasonable.
