History resource request, the request of historical content item etc.).
The systematic collection being discussed here with regard to user personal information or can using personal information in the case of,
May provide the user with control program or whether feature collects user profile (for example, with regard to the social networkies of user, social action
Or the information of activity, the current location of occupation, the preference of user or user) or control whether and/or how from content service
Device receives the chance of content that may be more relevant with user.Additionally, particular data can before it is stored or is used quilt
Processed in one or more modes so that the information that individual can identify is removed.For example, it is possible to process user identity so that
The information that individual can identify can not be determined for this user, or can be general in the case of obtaining positional information
The geographical position (such as arriving city, ZIP code or state rank) changing user is so that the ad-hoc location of user can not be determined.Therefore,
How user can be collected with regard to user with control information and be used by content server.
Third party content supplier is being provided for being presented together with the resource of request via the Internet or other network
During third party content item, it is possible to use content item management service is controlling or otherwise to affect to third party content item
Select and distribute.For example, third party content supplier can specify and select standard used in the selection to third party content item
Then (such as key word) and corresponding bid value.Bid value can select system using to select and to send in auction by content item
Hair is in the content item presenting together with resource.For example, third party content supplier can be given in auction with user with
(for example, supplier is with being intended to user to pay the corresponding bid of agreement of certain amount of money in the case of the content item interaction of supplier
$ 3 is paid) in the case of clicking on the content item of supplier.In other examples, third party content supplier can give in auction
The corresponding bid of agreement (for example, the supplier's agreement going out and being chosen and pay in the case of distributing certain amount of money in content item
Pay $ 0.005 or supplier agrees to prop up when content item is chosen or clicks on when content item is chosen and distributes
Pay $ 0.05).In some instances, content item selects system to determine third party content supplier using content item interaction data
Content item efficiency.For example, user can be more likely to click in the third party on some webpages better than other content items
Rong Xiang.Therefore, for place the auction bidding of third party content item for high-effect webpage, some classifications webpage and/or
It is probably higher for other criterions, but these bids are for poorly efficient energy webpage, the webpage of some classifications and/or other standard
It is probably relatively low for then.

Click-through rate (CTR), is defined as the hits to content item divided by the number that flashes.Other efficacy measure can also be used, such as
(wherein action can be click on content item or link therein, the purchase of product, the transfer of content item to every action cost (CPA)
Deng), conversion ratio (CVR), often click through cost (CPC) (count when content item is clicked), every selling cost (CPS), often guide
Cost (CPL), effective CPM (eCPM) and/or other efficacy measure.
In some instances, webpage or other resource (such as applying) include can showing selection wherein and distributing
Third party content item one or more content item positions.Define the code of content item position of webpage or other resource (for example,HTML etc.) can include in the third party that content item selects system request will present together with webpage
Hold the instruction of item.In some embodiments, code can include having can include the content item of one or more parameters please
Seek URL (for example ,/page/contentitem？Devid=abcl23＆devnfo=A34r0 image request).Real at some
Apply in mode, such parameter can be the coded string of such as " devid=abcl23 " and/or " devnfo=A34r0 ".
Selection to the third party content item that will be distributed together with resource by content item selection system can be based on several shadows
The factor of sound, bid that prediction click-through rate (pCTR), prediction conversion ratio (pCVR) are associated with content item etc..Such shadow
The factor of sound can be used to generate the value of such as fraction, can by content item select system by inch of candle by this fraction and its
Other score ratio of its content item are relatively.
During the auction of the content item position of the resource for such as webpage, several different types of bid value can be by the
Tripartite content provider is used for various third party content items.For example, whether auction can include clicking in third party based on user
Rong Xiang, user whether based on third party content item assume execution specific action, whether third party content item is chosen and distributes
Bid and/or other types of bid.For example, whether it is chosen based on third party content item and the bid that distributes can be relatively
Low bid (for example, $ 0.005), but can be higher bid (for example, $ based on the bid whether user executes specific action
5).In some instances, can adjust and bid to consider and the probability that is associated of type bid and/or due to other reasons
Adjustment bid.For example, the probability that user executes specific action is probably low, such as 0.2%, but selected and distribute the
The probability of tripartite's content item is probably 100% (for example, the selected and content item that distributes selected feelings during auctioning at it
Under condition, this content item will appear from, so bid is not adjusted).Therefore, it can based on bid value and probability or the life of another modified values
The value becoming such as fraction or normalized value is to use in auction.The bid whether being chosen and distributing based on third party content item
Value or fraction can be $ 0,005*1.00=0.005, and whether executed based on user the bid of specific action value or point
Number can be $ 5*0.002=0.01.In order that the revenus maximization being generated, content item selection system can choosing from auction
Select the third party content item with peak.In some embodiments, content item select system because of with this bid phase
Association high value or fraction and select the content item being associated with the bid whether executing specific action based on user.
Once third party content item is selected Systematic selection it is possible to provide to client terminal device using network by content item
For realizing the data presenting on the display of client terminal device for the third party content item.
In some instances, come using login page URL (URL), first size value and the second size value
It is probably useful for automatically generating content item for third party content supplier.That is, given third party content provides
The login page of person and the size of content item position, it is possible to use the size being determined according to login page URL and content item data
To automatically generate content item, such as advertisement based on one or more content item templates.In some embodiments, can be on demand
(all as in response to internally holding the request of item) generates content item, or can generate content item and the data of this content item is permissible
It is stored in data base or present to the third party content supplier generating content item in user interface.

Element can be determined by the right part anchor of the right edge with respect to content item and with respect to the bottom anchor of the bottom margin of content item
Justice).The index value of each element can be used to carry out prioritization to the element of content item template.
Anchor be used between two elements of description content item template or element with will be from content item template generation
Content item between relation.Anchor is by benchmark (for example, another element or content item itself), distance (for example, such as pixel (px)
Fixed range or such as 10% relative distance), type (for example, top, bottom, left part or right part) and motility instruction
Accord with (that is, the position of anchor is variable or fixing) to define.
Using one or more content item templates and content item data, content item generates system can be for given size
Set (such as first size value and the second size value) comes for each content item template generation content item and to its marking, so that
Space utilization maximizes.Content item generates system and can parse the layout configuration file of content item template to determine content item template
One or more elements layout element data.Content item generates system and may then based on the anchor of layout element data, wants
The size value of content item generating and content item data to determine placeholder for each element in one or more elements.
Content item generates system can be using one or more element renderers come based on one of placeholder and these anchors or many
Individual it is whether flexible (that is, a part for cleared space distribution changes in size) and is directed to every in one or more elements
Individual element determines that initial space distributes.In some instances, initial space distribution can identical with placeholder (for example, if first
By only fixing grappling justice, then initial space distribution can be identical with placeholder for element).
Content item generates system and can change have flexibly based on initial space distribution and by using Growth Function
Anchor any unit usually extend initial space distribution so that content item space utilization maximize and be directed to one or more units
Each element in element determines the distribution of final space.Content item generate system may then based on determined by the distribution of final space
And determine that content item whether there is any conflict.Such conflict can include the overlap of element, element exceeds the chi of content item
Very little spilling, not enough back gauge, text block and/or other content item template particular conflict.
If there is conflict, then content item generates system and can eliminate one from one or more elements of content item template
Individual element and return placeholder is determined with the reduction set based on element.The element being removed from one or more elements can
(for example, remove that to have indicator element relatively low in terms of importance for content item template with the index value based on element
The element of highest index value).In some embodiments, will determine as element to be removed based on layout element data can be by
It is designated as required element.In such example, content item generates system and can select new content item template, parses this template,

Apply in mode, one or more content item templates can be that the constraint XML of the one or more elements defining content item template joins
Put file.Each content item template includes at least one element of the required element as content item template.Additionally, content item mould
Each element of plate includes index value, element term and defines this element with respect to another element and/or with respect to content item
At least two anchors (at least one left part or right part anchor and at least one top or bottom anchor) of the arrangement of itself (for example, are pressed
Button element can bottom margin by the right part anchor of the right edge with respect to content item and with respect to content item bottom anchor
To define).The index value of each element can be used to carry out prioritization to the element of content item template.Will be with reference to Fig. 5
It is more fully described content item template and anchor to Fig. 7 C.
In some embodiments, content item generates system 120 and can retrieve content from content item template database 206
Whole set as content item template in item template.In other embodiments, content item generation system 120 can be internal
The content item template holding item template database 206 is filtered to obtain the subset of content item template.
In some embodiments, content item generation system 120 can be come really using first size value and the second size value
The set determining content item template is to generate content item.For example, if first size value is 580 pixels (width is that is,
580 pixels) and the second size value is 100 pixels (that is, in height for 100 pixels), then have and be vertically stacked
Image, the content item template of text, logo and button element (such as shown in Figure 14 C to Figure 14 D) may be not suitable for
Such size.Therefore, content item generation system 120 can be from the content item retrieving from content item template database 206
Such content item template is excluded in the set of template.In some embodiments, content item template can be with instruction from content
One or more values of the minimum of content item of item template generation and/or maximum aspect ratio are explained.Content item generates system 120 can
To determine the ratio of first size value and the second size value, and using determined by than come to determined by ratio in minimum aspect ratio
Content item template below or more than maximum aspect ratio is filtered.Therefore, it can exclude for first size value and the
It is probably less useful content item template for two size values.
In some embodiments, except size value filtration in addition to or replace size value filter be also based on content item number
Filter according to content item template.For example, if content item data does not include text data, content item generates system 120
The content item template not including text element can only be retrieved.Content item template can be included in content in a template with instruction
One or more values of element annotate for such filtration.
Generate data, the set of one or more content item template and content item data using content item, layout generates
Device 200 generates one or more content items as be herein more fully described.
With reference to Fig. 3, layout generator 200 includes layout resolver 220, anchor manager 222, one or more element render
Device 224, space manager 226 and Conflict solving device 228.Layout resolver 220 receives content item template and by this content
Item template is parsed into associated data (for example, the anchor number of one or more layout element and one or more of layout element
According to, element term, index value, require designator etc.).Layout resolver 220 will be more fully described with reference to Fig. 5.
Anchor manager 222 receive the set of the layout element of one or more parsings and associated data and based on one or
The associated data of multiple elements, first size value and the second size value and content item data are directed to the cloth of one or more parsings
Each of the set of office's element element determines placeholder.Placeholder be element can anchor based on element, to be generated in
Hold the size of item and will be used for filling the maximum space that the content item data of element occupies in content item.Because some elements
Other elements can be depended on based on anchor, so anchor manager 222 execution topological sorting is to determine for for one or more
Element determines the order of placeholder.If that is, element (such as logo element) is included with reference to another element (such as button
Element) anchor, then may need in the placeholder determining confirming button element before placeholder for logo element.If button
Element is also included to the anchor of another element (such as pictorial element), then may need the placeholder in button element or logo element
In any one before determine pictorial element placeholder.Therefore, the anchor dependence that topological sorting is executed to based on them is right
Layout element is ranked up.The placeholder of each element of sorted lists of element can be determined using anchor manager 222.Anchor
The placeholder of each element is exported corresponding element renderer 224 by manager 222.Will with reference to Fig. 6 to Fig. 7 C in more detail
Description anchor manager 222.
Element renderer 224 receive each corresponding element placeholder and for each element be based on placeholder and
The motility of one or more anchors and determine initial space distribute.Element renderer 224 can include pictorial element renderer, literary composition
This element renderer and button element renderer.Initial space distribution be element can based on placeholder content item layout
In occupy and stand this element the motility of one or more anchors space.In some embodiments, image dissector
230 (shown in Fig. 4) can be used for determining the ledge of image together with pictorial element renderer 224 and/or be held
Row cuts to the intelligence of image to determine initial space distribution.Image renderer 224 will be more fully described with reference to Fig. 8.
Space manager 226 receives initial space from one or more element renderers 224 and distributes and for being generated
Each element of content item determine the distribution of final space.Space manager 226 is based on corresponding initial space distribution for only
Each element with fixing anchor determines the distribution of final space, one or more for having based on the distribution of corresponding initial space
Flexibly each element of anchor determines that minimum space distributes, and is changed using Growth Function and have one or more flexible anchors
The space of each element is distributed with using any remaining space.Space manager will be more fully described with reference to Fig. 9 to Figure 10 B
226.
The final space that Conflict solving device 228 receives the one or more elements for content item is distributed and based on final
Space is distributed and is determined whether there is any conflict.Such conflict can include the overlap of element, element exceeds content item
The spilling of size, not enough back gauge, text block and/or other content item template particular conflict.If there is conflict, then conflict solution
Certainly device 228 can eliminate an element from the set of one or more elements and the new set of element is returned to anchor tube reason
Device 222 determines placeholder with the new set based on element.The element being removed from one or more elements can be based on unit
The index value of element (for example, removes and has relatively low in terms of the importance highest index for content item template of indicator element
The element of value).In some embodiments, if being determined element to be removed to be indicated as required element, Conflict solving
Device 228 can send data parsing the new content item template in the set of content item template to layout resolver 220, or
Person's Conflict solving device 228 can stop the generation of content item and output error is (for example, other interior without can use
If holding item template).In some embodiments, Conflict solving device 228 can receive from conflict system 232 (shown in Fig. 4)
One or more rules for conflict.Conflict system 232 can be included for defining each element based on size of content item
The back gauge delimiter of required back gauge.Conflict system 232 can also be included based on size of content item and/or other content item template
Particular conflict rule and define when it may happen that the conflict rule blocked of text.
Fig. 4 describes the general of the layout generator 200 of Fig. 2 and the procedure chart of the embodiment of process flow of score indicator 208
State.The details of this process flow will be more fully described with reference to Fig. 5 to Figure 11.
With reference to Fig. 5, layout resolver 220 receives the collection of one or more layout templates from content item template database 206
Close.The one or more element of content item template definition and will be from one or more units of the content item of this content item template generation
The arrangement of element.In some embodiments, one or more of content item templates can be to define corresponding content item template
One or more elements constraint XML configuration file.In other embodiments, described in other markup languages can be used for
One or more content item templates.Each content item template includes at least one unit of the required element as this content item template
Element.Additionally, each element of content item template includes index value, element term and defines this element with respect to another element
And/or at least two anchors of the arrangement with respect to content item itself.The index value of each element can be used to content item mould
The element of plate carries out prioritization.
Embodiment for the content item template XML configuration file of web type content item can include product image primitive
Element, the element of button element, logo element and title element.Such content item template XML configuration file can be by following fixed
Justice：
Can based on the above item template XML configuration file generate the content item 900 shown in Figure 14 A to Figure 14 B,
920.Layout resolver 220 can receive content item template XML configuration file and this document is parsed into four elements：Product
Pictorial element, button element, logo element and title element.Layout resolver 220 can also parse element term, index value,
Whether association anchor and/or element are needs.Layout resolver 220 is then by the set of the layout element of parsing and associated data
It is sent to anchor manager 222.
With reference to Fig. 6, anchor manager 222 receives the set of layout element of parsing and associated data, first size value and the
Two size values and content item data.Anchor manager 222 is configured to associated data based on one or more elements, the first chi
Very little value and the second size value and content item data and be directed to each of layout element of one or more parsings and determine and account for
Position symbol.Placeholder is the maximum space that element can occupy in content item.Because some elements can depend on it based on anchor
Its element, so anchor manager 222 execution topological sorting is to determine for determining the suitable of placeholder for one or more elements
Sequence.If that is, element (such as logo element) includes the anchor with reference to another element (such as button element), may need
Will be in the placeholder determining confirming button element before placeholder for logo element.In some instances, topological sorting also may be used
To determine that two or more elements do not rely on other elements still using the index value for determining which placeholder
Depend on the element having been directed towards that defining placeholder.
Anchor be used between two elements of description content item template or element with will be from content item template generation
Content item between relation.Anchor by benchmark (for example, another element or content item itself), distance (for example, fixed range, all
As pixel (px), or the relative size of benchmark, such as the 10% of content item size), (for example, the edge of element, from this for type
Edge metering is to the distance of benchmark, such as top, bottom, left part or right part) and motility designator (that is, the position of instruction anchor
Put variable or fixing value) defining.In some embodiments, if motility designator is omitted, anchor lacks
Save as fixing anchor.If anchor is fixing, even if element is overlapping with another element, exceed size of content item etc. also not
This anchor can be changed.In such example, Conflict solving device 228 will detect conflict, as will be referred to Figure 11 in further detail below
Ground description.If anchor is flexible anchor, that side for the space distribution of element can change in size.For example, if
What content item template included logo element is all flexible two anchors (for example, left part anchor and right part anchor), then, as will be referred to space
Manager 226 discusses in greater detail below, and space manager 226 distributes the space increasing logo to be adapted to logo element
The possible Breadth Maximum of placeholder.If the space distribution of logo can not be increased to the occupy-place of logo by space manager 226
The Breadth Maximum of symbol, then space manager 226 logo element is fitted in the center of placeholder and exceptional space is returned to
Buffer is used for other elements of content item.
Fig. 7 A to Fig. 7 C describes the diagram of the content item 300 including button element 310, and this button element has with by first
Anchor and the arrangement of the layout of content item 300 defined in the second anchor.The expression of the first anchor 320 and the expression quilt of the second anchor 330
Illustrate.If the first anchor is defined by following item：
Anchor reference=" contentitem " type=" right " distance=" 10px "
Then the right side of button element 310 is positioned as 10 from the right side of content item 100 pixels.With reference to Fig. 7 B, if interior
Hold item 300 to reduce in size, even if then size of content item changes, the right side of button element 310 also keeps from content item 300
10, right side pixel.If right part anchor is alternatively defined by following item：
Anchor reference=" contentitem " type=" right " distance=" 0.2 "
Then the right side of button element 310 is positioned in 20% with a distance from the size of the right content item 300 of content item 300
Place.With reference to Fig. 7 C, if content item 300 similarly reduces in size, the distance on the right side of button element 310 is from content item
300 right side similarly reduces to maintain 20% distance.
Referring back to Fig. 6 and be referenced for above web type content item content item template XML configuration file enforcement
Mode, the product pictorial element through parsing includes title " productimage ", index value 1 and instruction product pictorial element is
Boolean required for content item template.Arrange by three grapplings for the product pictorial element through parsing for the content item template
Justice.First anchor has the reference to content item itself, has the type of left part and the distance of zero pixel.Therefore, product figure
The left side of content item is arrived in the left side of pixel element by " grappling ".Similarly, the second anchor has the reference to content item itself, has top
The type in portion and the distance of zero pixel.Therefore, the top side of content item is arrived in the top side of product pictorial element by " grappling ".3rd
Anchor has the reference to content item itself, has the type of bottom and the distance of zero pixel.Therefore, product pictorial element
The bottom side of content item is arrived by " grappling " in bottom side.Product pictorial element does not include right side anchor, so the right side of product pictorial element
Location-dependent query is in the view data from content item data.
Button element through parsing includes title " button " and index value 3.Button element is unwanted, because Boolean
Do not indicate that this button element is needs.That is, if the non-indicator element of value is needs, this element defaults to and is not required to
The element wanted.Button element for content item template is arranged by two grappling justice.First anchor has to the logo unit through parsing
