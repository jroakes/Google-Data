Specific embodiment
General introduction
Geographic application depends on the physical orientation of display device --- such as " longitudinal direction " and " transverse direction " --- with various presentations
Form to show geographical contents via display device.When the physical orientation of display device is directionally changed to newly determine by user from current
Xiang Shi, geographic application are in view of new orientation and (ii) the display device orientation before current orientation of (i) display device updates
Form is presented, and in some cases, updates geographical contents.More generally, geographic application can be with view of display device
The history of physical orientation come generate geographical contents present.
Under exemplary scene, display device is the touch-screen of tablet PC (or being referred to as " flat board ").Flat board is in
Portrait orientation, geographic application shows the information table of the numerical map together with the bottom for occupying screen on the top for occupying screen.Information
Table is included in the general introduction of certain business selected on numerical map.The example geo content is presented and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1
It is state S1.If geographic application detects the instruction that user wishes the relevant information of the business checked in more detail with select,
Then geographic application can adjust the presentation so that Informational Expression is occupying whole screen substantially.The example geo content is presented on
State S2 is schematically illustrated as in Fig. 1.
Locality ought to be rotated during to transversal orientation flat board with state S1 and user, and geographic application adjust automatically is in
Now numerical map is shown with the right side of screen and in the left side display information table of screen.The presentation is illustrated out in figure 3
It is state S3.According to implementation method, information table can include the same or different levels of detail relevant with the business of selection
It is secondary.
If then user is rotated to portrait orientation flat board, geographic application changes to recover state from state from S3
S1.If however, user rolls the information table in state S3 and then rotates to portrait orientation, geographic application flat board
It is changed into state S2 as an alternative.When user is again rotated to transversal orientation flat board, geographic application is changed into from state S2
State S3.
Therefore, geographic application can be changed into state S3 from state S1 and from state S1, by the instruction of previous state
Storage in memory, and is changed into state S1 or state S2 according to the instruction of storage from state S3.
In general, these and similar technology allow geographic application being efficiently differently directed using display device
On screen display resource (screen real estate), and make transformation more directly perceived.As a particular example, work as user
Sat down while holding and holding display device and make unintentionally geographic application will present from longitudinal direction change into horizontal when, geographic application
Can display device be rotated back into portrait orientation in response to user to recover previous presentation.
Exemplary state transitions
The state transition diagram 10 of Fig. 1 illustrate in one embodiment of technology outlined above in some geographical contents
The transformation between form is presented.The example geo application of these transformations can be realized referring to Fig. 2 discussion and can run
The exemplary user equipment of geographic application.
With continued reference to Fig. 1, display device is in portrait orientation under state S1 and S2.Presentation form according to state 1, can
Screen 12 for showing geographical contents includes map screen 14 and information screen 16.Map screen 14 occupies the upper of screen 12
Portion, and information screen 16 occupies the bottom of screen 12.In the illustrated embodiment, map screen 14 is significantly greater than information screen
Curtain 16.For example, map screen 14 and information screen 16 can respectively occupy about 4/5ths and 1/5th of screen 12.Screen
14 and 16 can be independently operable.In other words, in some cases, geographic application can update in response to user input
The display of one in screen 14 and 16, without update in screen 14 and 16 another.
Geographic application can be shown in map screen 14 interactive digital map and in information screen 16 display with
The relevant information of numerical map.For example, numerical map can be corresponding with certain geographic area, user searches for certain type in it
Business, such as dining room.Information screen 16 can include the general of the place corresponding with a Search Results in Search Results
State.For example, information screen 16 can list some important informations, such as dining room title, its grading and arrival dining room institute of driving
Amounts of time.
Presentation form according to state S2, information table 26 occupies at least most of of whole screen 12 or screen 12.Letter
Breath table 26 can be corresponding with the extended version of information table 16.For example, information table 26 can be including brief with information table 16
The relevant detailed description in the dining room of description, one or multiple pictures, video etc..
On the other hand, the presentation form of S3 can include：Map screen 34, the map screen 34 is big with map screen 14
It is similar on body；And information screen 36, the information screen 36 can the detailed description including place, the information screen 36 and information
Screen 26 is generally similar.In the illustrated embodiment, state S3 present form under screen relative placement with
The relative placement that the screen under form is presented of state S1 is different.Specifically, information screen 36 can be placed in a left side for screen 12
Side, and map screen 34 can be placed in the right side of screen 12.Further, map screen 34 can take up the bright of screen 12
The aobvious part (for example, 3/4ths relative to a quarter) more than information screen 34.
Discuss the exemplary contents of screen 14,16,26,34 and 36 in more detail referring to Fig. 3.More generally, so
And, it is possible to use any suitable presentation form with any suitable numeral and screen size.
Geographic application can will orient in response to display device and change into laterally to be changed into state from state S1 from longitudinal
S2 (transformation T1).Equally, geographic application can will orient in response to display device and change into longitudinal direction from transverse direction and turn from state S2
Change back to state S1 (transformation T2).However, as illustrated in fig. 1, geographic application can be with for the multiple " sub- state " in state S3
Form is presented using identical.Therefore, geographic application can detect that the user for putting on the information screen 36 in state S3 hands over
Mutually, such as one or some scroll commands, and it is changed into other the sub- states (transformation T3) in state S3.As a result, when
Then display device will be oriented when laterally changing into longitudinal, and geographic application is changed into state S2 (transformation T4), rather than state
S1.In other words, whether interacted with geographical contents depending on the user under state S2, geographic application can be in response to identical event
To be changed into two different conditions from state S3.
Referring still to Fig. 1, if display device changes orientation from longitudinal direction when geographic application is in state S2 (transformation T5)
It is changed into laterally, then geographic application returns to the presentation form of state S3.More specifically, geographic application returns to sub- state, geographic application
To be oriented from horizontal longitudinal direction of changing into response to display device and be changed into state S2 from the sub- state, rather than state S1.
Therefore, change definition circulation S1-S3-S1-S3 of the orientation between longitudinal direction and transverse direction etc. and S2-S3-S2-S3
Deng.In order to realize that these change, geographic application can store presentation form in the previous orientation in display device and/or
The instruction of person's state.For example, locality ought to in state S1 and display device will orient from it is vertical change into level when, ground
Ought to be with instruction state S2 can be stored before state S3 is changed into.By this way, when display device changes physical orientation
When becoming longitudinal again, geographic application can determine that it should be changed into state S2 from state 3, rather than state S1.
In some embodiments, geographic application also responds to control of user's activation in information screen 26 for aobvious
Registration word map and be changed into state S1 (transformation T6) from state S2.Geographic application can be in response to the more detailed of user's selection place
Thin view and be changed into state S3 (transformation T7) from state S1.For example, user can click on, rap, " pulling " or with it
He changes T7 by mode active information screen 16 to trigger.
