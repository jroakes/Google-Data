- type e.g. manufacturer or brand identification
- attribute information color, pattern, shape
- one or more embodiments may employ object determinator 140 , which may determine the information about the object(s) in the image of a given content item 102 using image analysis and recognition, text analysis, metadata analysis, human input, or a combination thereof. In this way, the object determinator 140 may use both information determined from the source, and existing or known information from a source other than the content item.
- an embodiment includes an editor interface 160 for enabling manual confirmation of programmatically determined information, as well as manual editing or correction.
- FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B illustrate how manual enrichment and/or editor interface 160 may operate, according to one or more embodiments of the invention.
- system 100 handles images that are generated independently of the system, so that the system has limited advance knowledge about what the contents of the images are, or what form or formatting is used in conveying objects shown in the images (e.g. alignment, image formatting).
- the system may operate on a collection or library where some knowledge of the contents of the images is known in advance. This knowledge may be provided by, for example, human operators. For example, specific online merchants may be known to sell products of a specific category, or products at a particular site may be known to be of a particular classification when displayed under a specific tab. Human operators may provide this information in advance.
- Procurement 105 may perform anyone of many processes to procure content items 102 that contain unprocessed images.
- procurement 105 may crawl network locations to locate web files, including files that contain images.
- procurement 105 may interface or receive feeds from a library of collection of content item 102 .
- procurement 105 may receive triggers to access other sites or network locations, and/or handle uploads or content item submissions from users.
- Content items 102 may include files or portions thereof that contain images (exclusively, or in combination with other data).
- content items 102 correspond to image files, combination of text/image files, or to portions of records or pages (e.g. web pages) that contains images (and possibly text).
- Content items 102 may also contain metadata, which includes tags or other data that may not necessarily form part of the displayed content of the content item.
- the output of procurement 105 includes images 104 , and possibly pertinent text.
- Embodiments provide that system 100 attempts to determine information about objects identified in content items 102 before or independent of image recognition/analysis processes are performed.
- procurement 105 extracts text and metadata 103 from content item 102 .
- the text and metadata 103 are forwarded to the object determinator 140 .
- a text and metadata analyzer 145 may determine an object identifier 143 for an object contained in the content item.
- the object identifier 143 may correspond to an identification of a class or type, although other information may also be determined.
- the text and metadata analyzer 145 portion of the object determinator 140 determines as much information as possible from the text and metadata 103 . For example, in the case where content item 102 includes a web-based record of a shoe (e.g.
- the text and metadata analyzer 145 may use the text and metadata to determine various levels of classification about the shoe, including whether it is for men or women, the type of shoe (sneakers, dress shoes, sandals), its coloring, price range, manufacturer, its quality (e.g. sample ratings provided on a website where the shoe is provided for sale), the material used to manufacture the shoe, and various other information. When such detailed information is not available, the text and metadata analyzer 145 may use the text and metadata 103 to perform an analysis on the content item 102 , in order to identify hints or clues as to the object of the content item 102 . Such analysis may correspond to, for example, key word identification of the text of the content item, as well as metadata associated with the source of the content item 102 .
- the metadata may correspond to the domain, or a category, specification or attribute associated with the content item.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a more detailed description of how the text and metadata analyzer 145 of the object determinator 140 may be used, under one or more embodiments of the invention.
- the object image data analysis 146 can be used in conjunction with text and metadata information.
- the image segmentizer 110 may receive the image content 104 of the content item 102 from procurement 105 .
- the image segmentizer 110 segments the image content into a foreground image and a background image, with the foreground image corresponding to a segmented image 114 .
- procurement 105 receives or uses hints or a priori knowledge in segmenting an segmented image 114 from the background (e.g. such as through text, metadata and/or human provided knowledge).
- the image segmentizer 110 may know to segment an image to separate a shoe, neck tie, or other object from a background.
- image segmentizer 110 may segment foreground objects from other foreground objects.
- image segmentizer 110 in the case where the image contains a man wearing a suit in a street, image segmentizer 110 may separate the neck tie and the suit jacket and the person wearing a suit separately, all from a background that shows the street.
- the image segmentizer 110 may implement any one of many foreground/background segmentation algorithms.
- a background is assumed to be at the sides of the images, whereas the foreground can be assumed to be at the center.
- the intensity distribution of both foreground and background can be obtained from the center and side pixels respectively.
- a mixture of Gaussian models can be learnt for the foreground and background pixels. Such models can be applied to the whole image and each pixel can be classified as foreground and background.
- the foreground and background can be determined by doing a statistical analysis of pixel distributions on the image, such as shown and described with a method of FIG. 2 .
- the segmented image 114 that is outputted from the image segmentizer 110 is subjected to an alignment process 115 .
- the alignment process 115 may perform functions that normalize the alignment of the segmented image 114 . Normalizing the segmented image 114 may facilitate analysis of the image (e.g. recognition of its attributes) and/or the presentation of panels or other content containing the segmented image 114 in some processed form.
- the output of either of the image segmentizer 110 or the alignment process 115 may be provided to feature extraction 120 .
- Feature extraction 120 may detect or determine features of either the segmented image 114 , or a normalized segmented image 115 .
- Data provided as a result of the feature extraction 120 (“feature data 134 ”) may include data that descriptive of particular aspects or characteristics of segmented image 114 , as well as of the segmented image 114 as a whole.
- Certain features may be extracted that are class-specific descriptors that apply to the image object as a whole, such as primary color, patters, shape, and texture.
- Features that apply to the segmented image 114 as a whole may be referred to as “global features”.
- One or more embodiments also provide that feature extraction 120 determines “local features”, meaning those features that are localized to a specific part or portion of the segmented image 114 .
- global feature may be extracted from the overall image and segmentation mask.
- Local features may be extracted by dividing the overall image into sub-regions, and then detecting some or all of the features in each sub-region. Local features may also be extracted by identifying and/or compiling characteristics of key points or regions on the image.
- Various embodiments described herein also provide for obtaining sub-regions in an image.
- the image can be divided uniformly into sub-regions.
- regions of key-points can be used to obtain the sub-regions.
- corner points, or homogenous blobs can be used as key points in an image.
- the regions can be selected by random sampling on the image.
- a preliminary segmentation algorithm can be executed on the image, and output resulting regions of segmentation can be used as sub-regions.
- the feature extraction can, for some types of objects, determine features that are specific to a sub-class or even unique to a particular object. For example, feature extraction may identify features that uniquely identify a hand-woven carpet, or even a face.
- global and local features are used for different types of visual search processes for an item.
- a search process may seek to match an overall appearance of an object to a specific feature that is provided in the search input.
- a search process may seek a match of an object that has similar characteristics in a selected or specific area.
- Analysis data generator 135 may include components (vector generator 132 and text translator 136 ) for recording both kinds of data.
- Quantifiable data may take the form of vectors, for example, which carry values that identify or are descriptive of various features.
- the vector generator 132 may use detected features represented by feature data 134 to generate a vector representation of a set of features for a particular object item.
- the vector representation may comprise one or more signatures 128 , which may be generated for a particular segmented image 114 .
- One segmented image 114 may have multiple signatures 128 , for one or more local features and/or global features, or alternatively one signature 128 that is representative of the one or more local and/or global features.
- the signature(s) 128 of a particular image object may identify the given object (or a portion of an object) either uniquely or by a set of class-specific characteristics.
- a uniquely identified object may have a unique pattern, be handmade or even be a face of a person or animal. Additionally, signatures may be descriptive of both local and global features.
- One or more embodiments include a text translator 136 that converts class-specific feature data 134 (or signatures 128 ) into text, so that local and/or global features may be represented by text data 129 .
- an extracted global feature may be converted into text data that is descriptive of the feature.
- certain global features such as a primary color, may be determined by value, then converted into text. For example, if the primary color is determined to be a hue of orange, the text translator 135 may convert the feature extraction 134 into the text “orange” and assign the text value to a field that is designated for the type of feature. Processes and algorithms for performing feature extraction and vectorization or quantification are described in greater detail below, including with FIGS. 7-10 .
- Both signatures 128 and text data 129 may be provided to an indexer 160 , which generates index data 162 for use with one or more indexes 164 .
- the index data 162 may thus carry data that is the result of recognition or image analysis processes. Subsequent searches may specify or use image data provided in the one or more indexes 164 .
- the object determinator 140 may include an image analysis component 146 for analyzing image data, as provided by any of the other modules, in order to determine information that may suffice as the object identifier 143 , in the absence of adequate text or metadata 103 .
- the image analysis component 146 may use image input, corresponding to the output of one or more of the image segmentizer 110 , alignment process 115 , and/or feature extraction 120 .
- the image analysis component 146 may operate on either pixilated data or quantified data, such as determined by quantification/vectorization component 134 .
- text and metadata 103 may be analyzed by the text analysis component 145 to determine object identifier 143 in the form of a general category of the object carried in the content item 102 . This may be performed even before segmentation is initiated, or alternatively after some or all of the image processing steps are performed, in order to generate a label or classification for objects in the images of the content items. For example, some shape recognition process may be performed on the result of the aligned image 115 to classify the object as a “shoe”. Once classified, such an embodiment enables the feature extraction 120 to look for features that are specific to shoes, such as heels, or straps.
- the shape recognition process may be executed on the image data output from the image segmentizer 110 , so that the desired alignment angle of the object may be determined from the image.
- the image information can be used in conjunction with the text and metadata information.
- a classifier can be built, such as nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machines, neural networks or na ⁇ ve bayes classification. As a first step, a training set of items with corresponding categories is obtained. Then, any of the aforementioned classifier is built using any combination of metadata and image content information. A new input item is classified using the learnt classifier.
- system 100 is capable of analyzing at least some content items 102 on sources that carry very little information about what objects were originally provided with the content item.
- content item 102 may correspond to a web page of a blog about an individual or a topic such as fashion, and the person maintaining the web page may lack descriptive text on the image carried on the page.
- object determinator 140 may operate off an image output (segmented image 114 , normalized image object 115 , feature data 134 ) to programmatically determine information about objects in the image. This may include identification of objects by type or classification, detection of the presence of faces or persons, and even the possible identification of persons in the image.
- presence detection may be implemented for multiple features, where the detection of one feature serves as the marker for detection of another feature. For example, a person may be detected from a marker that corresponds to a face, leading to detection of the persons' legs, and then his or her shoes.
- the object determinator 140 may use text and metadata to identify hints from surrounding text that are not explicitly descriptive or readily associated with the image of the content item. Such text and metadata, provided with or in association with the content item, may facilitate or confirm a determination of the object identifier 143 by the image data analysis 146 .
- the image data analysis 146 may run assumptions to determine if any assumption correlates to image data 138 (with or without text and metadata 103 ). For example, in the case where the blog includes the name of a celebrity, the object image data analysis 146 may seek (i.e.
- the object determinator 140 may seek faces or other readily detectable objects, and exclude or further use these objects to confirm identification of objects contained in the content item 102 .
- the object image data analysis can be made fully automated to search for clothing and apparel items in an image. This may include steps comprising some or all of (i) Face detection, (ii) Clothing segmentation (using the face location as a hint, and via removal of skin) (iii) Getting a confidence metric related to how well the segmentation is, (iv) Using a similarity matching based on high-confident clothing regions.
- the image is analyzed to find people in the image.
- Face detection algorithms can be used as part of this step. Suitable face detection algorithms for use with embodiments described herein are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/246,742, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING THE USE OF CAPTURED IMAGES THROUGH RECOGNITION, filed on Oct. 7, 2005.
- An output of the face detection algorithms include identification of the locations of faces in the image.
- the locations of the face and the eye are used a s a prior to find the location of the clothing of the person.
- the location of the upper-body-clothing is certain distance below the face.
- a region growing based segmentation algorithm starting from a box roughly located around the center of the upper torso.
- the location of the center of the upper torso can be determined based on the face location, and face size.
- the region growing segmentation algorithm should also take skin color into account.
- the skin color can be learnt via generic skin model obtained over a large set of people dataset, or it can be learnt using the face location of the particular person. More specifically, the color distribution around the face location is assumed to be the skin color distribution, and the pixels of such distribution would be excluded from the clothing region segmentation.
- a region growing segmentation algorithm can be used for segmenting the clothing.
- a fixed size oval can be used to select the clothing location.
- any embodiment of segmentation such as matting or box-segmentation as described below can be used.
- the location of face is used to automatically generate a surrounding box to start the segmentation.
- skin color is optionally detected and rejected from the segmented clothing region.
- the confidence metric can be a function of many things, including the size of the clothing region, how many faces there are in the image, the smoothness and uniformity of color in the segmented region, the gender of the person (which can be detected by means of a gender classifier), and existence and locations of other regions and faces in the picture.
- a similarity search is applied towards an index of 164 , as part of a search 1260 as also described in the following sections.
- results determined programmatically may be enhanced through manual enrichment. Accordingly, one or more embodiments provide for the editor interface 160 to interface with results of more than one modules or processes, for purpose of enabling a manual operator to manually confirm or reject results. As described with embodiments of FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B , the editor interface 160 may enable the individual editor to confirm/reject results in groupings.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a category-mapping system for enabling human operators to facilitate a system such as described in FIG. 1 .
- An embodiment such as shown by FIG. 2 may use text and metadata of individual content items 102 to determine information about objects contained in the images of a content item.
- the determined information may include, for example, object identifier information 143 (see FIG. 1 ), which identifies an object of the content item 102 by one or more classifications.
- the text and metadata of content items 102 may be used to determine information about the nature of objects represented in the images of the content items.
- One or more embodiments use human operators 224 and knowledge 226 to generate a reference list of words and phrases that identify or are used typically in association with content items of a particular classifier. For example, humans who are experts in fashion may tag or associate merchandise items of fashion with new buzzwords and associations. These associations may be maintained in an ongoing list that comprises the knowledge 226 .
- the knowledge 226 may thus provide words or phrases from which reference records 220 representing classifications may be defined.
- the reference record 220 may further include weights and other factors for enabling programmatic classification based on the list of words or phrases 222 contained in each record.
- the reference list of words or phrases may be incorporated into reference records 220 as a definition or partial definition of a corresponding category or classification. In this way, each reference record 220 may define one or more corresponding categories or classifications.
- the descriptive words used for merchandise items may vary based on editorial variations of the different sources of the content items. This editorial variation may depend in part on the nature of the source and/or its target audience.
- a site that targets merchandise for teenage girls, for example, may refer to “sneaks” or “sneeks” for athletic footwear, while sites for other audiences may use “athletic footwear for women”.
- a given category e.g. “woman's athletic footwear”
- Each of the reference records 220 define the corresponding category using words or phrases 222 that human operators 224 determine are descriptive of a corresponding category or classification 223 .
- the knowledge database 226 may maintain lists and associations that are built by the human operators 224 over time, for purpose of recalling that certain phrases or words are indicative of a particular classification.
- Operators 224 that create a category-specific reference record 220 may leverage instances where specific words/phrases are relatively unique to one category, and that such words or phrases differentiate one domain from another domain. Operators 224 may also recognize that some words may be common to multiple categories. The human operators 224 and/or knowledge 226 may also identify words/phrases that are common to the demographic of the category (e.g. the demographic of people interested in “ woman's athletic footwear”). Examples of such classification include gender and age.
- human operators 224 assign weights 232 for contributions of individual word/phrases, based on an understanding developed by the human operator as to the vocabulary used by the demographic that is associated with a particular category or classification.
- the weights 232 may be provided before runtime as input to the weighting influence 230 .
- the weighting influence 230 may use the weights 232 to generate weighting parameters 235 for the text and metadata of individual content items at time the content items 102 are assigned to a category 223 (see below).
- the weights 232 may reflect the meaning or importance of individual words, and as such, may be provided by human operators 224 who are familiar with trends in how vocabulary is used over time. The use of weights 232 recognizes that words or phrases in one site have different significance or meanings than words or phrases at other sites.
- content items containing images, text and/or metadata may be programmatically analyzed and categorized.
- the weighting influence 230 may receive or extract associated metadata 238 (or text) from a source 201 of the content item 102 and/or the content item itself.
- the weighting influence 230 may assign the weights 232 to different fields of the metadata 238 that is retrieved from source 201 , such as metadata that identifies a brand or a network site where the content item is provided.
- the assigned weights 232 may then be processed for the metadata 238 to generate the weighting parameters 235 , in a manner described below.
- the content items 102 are initially processed by tokenizer 240 .
- the result of processing content items 102 includes generating tokens 242 from individual content items 102 that include words and phrases contained in the text and/or metadata of the content item 102 .
- the tokens 242 of individual content items 102 are forwarded to a categorizer 250 .
- the categorizer 250 may use reference records 220 and perform one or more processes to select which reference record 220 provides the best definition or definitions of categories.
- the classifier 250 determines an overall matching score to one or more of the records. The score may be influenced by presence of words that are unique to one category, versus words or phrases that are associated with multiple categories.
- weighting influence 230 may include weighting parameters 235 that take into account metadata 238 from the source 201 of the content item.
- the metadata 238 includes identification (by human operators 224 ) of the gender or demographic of the network site where the content item is located, as well as classifications made by the source of the content item (e.g. item provided in a particular labeled tab).
- the classifier 250 is able to identify one or more classifications 252 (or candidate categories) based on the combination of the tokens 242 as matched to reference records 220 , and the influence of the weighting parameters 235 provided from metadata 238 (and pre-defined by the human operators 224 ).
- the categorizer 250 makes determinations as to classifications 252 that are to be assigned to each content item 102 , or portions of individual content items 102 .
- the image content can be used in addition to the metadata for object categorization purposes. In this case, the algorithm would also justify its result with the look in the image, i.e. this image looks like a shoe or this image looks like a watch etc.
- one or more embodiments include a manual editor interface 260 that enables human operators to perform manual enrichment.
- the interface 260 may display classifications 252 , along with image portions of the content item, to human operators.
- the display of the content item images and the identified classifications are made in cascade, enabling the human operators to specify which of the determinations are not correct.
- FIG. 3 illustrates implementation of the editor interface 260 , under an embodiment of the invention.
- the editor interface 260 and resulting implementation shown by FIG. 3 , are illustrative of the manual enrichment component as a whole.
- the manual enrichment process is described with an embodiment of FIG. 4 .
- a page 310 of items 312 may be displayed to an operator.
- the page 310 may be assigned to a particular domain (category).
- the algorithm assigns all the “women's shoes”
- images that are assigned are shown all together in a page, and the editor confirms that each one of these choices is correct.
- the confirmation is in the form of rejecting incorrect determinations.
- one or more embodiments may utilize machine learning techniques when applying classification determination (i.e. domain mapping).
- classification determination i.e. domain mapping
- groundtruth data is collected that has shopping items annotated with the domain that contains those shopping items.
- Machine Learning techniques like naive bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machines can be used to learn a classification model for domain mapping.
- the classification model can be learned separately over each metadata field. Subsequently, a linear or non-linear combination of weights may be used to combine predictions from the different fields. A single classification model over all the metadata fields can also be learned.
- a learning and prediction phase of the classifier 250 may be employed.
- the learning and prediction phase may use words that are weighted by parameters that are based on the inverse document frequency (IDF).
- IDF inverse document frequency
- words or phrases collected by human operators 224 may be used by the learning and prediction phase.
- Methods like naive bayes learn the prior probabilities of the domain and the conditional probabilities of the word given the domain. By Bayes rule and conditional independence assumption of the word sequence, the learned probabilities are used to predict the conditional probability of the domain given the words in the metadata. The domain with the highest conditional probability is assigned as the target domain for the item.
- Methods like support vector machines learn a maximum margin classifier in a sparse high dimensional space where the words in the metadata form the dimensions of the space.
- the item's metadata is converted to the high dimensional feature space. The position of this point in the high dimensional space with respect to the learned classifier boundary determines the domain.
- an embodiment provides for performance of manual enrichment by showing humans a cluster or grouping of items mapped to a particular domain.
- Human operators 224 may readily “eye-ball” the results and quickly remove incorrect mappings if any.
- a full page of items that are assigned to a particular domain (category).
- the algorithm assigns all the “women's shoes”, images that are assigned are shown all together in a page, and the user is asked to confirm that each one of these choices is correct.
- embodiments recognize that it is much faster to ask the human a page of items as opposed asking for verification on each item one by one.
- the results of programmatic processes such as described with a system of FIG. 1 may have a degree of error associated therewith.
- Recognition and analysis of content items carries a certain inherent error.
- One or more embodiments recognize the inherent error, and enhance results of programmatic processes with manual enrichment.
- FIG. 4A illustrates a manual enrichment process, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- a programmatic element 410 may obtain results 422 corresponding to images 412 analyzed by any process or component described herein, including with an embodiment of FIG. 1 . These results 422 may be provided to an editor interface 420 .
- the editor interface 420 may display result groupings 422 , which displays the results 422 of the element 410 in a grouped presentation 430 .
- a human editor 424 may provide feedback 421 that includes confirmation and/or rejection of individual results provided with the grouped presentation 430 .
- the editor interface 420 may convey the feedback 421 to rectify and/or filter the results of the programmatic element 410 .
- individual results of the element 410 may be represented with panels that include an image and possibly a descriptive text element that conveys the result to a human operator 424 .
- the panels may be displayed in cascade.
- a webpage may include tens of panels, each carrying an image and/or text conveying the result of the programmatic element 410 .
- An example of such a result grouping is shown and described with FIG. 4B .
- the image may be of an item that is for sale, and the descriptive text element may provide the programmatic determined classification for the item. This may convey the results of the object identifier 140 ( FIG. 1 ), when content items 102 are analyzed.
- the text or metadata of the content item may be used to determine that the object in the image is a shoe.
- the term “shoe” or “boot” or “sneaker” may appear in the text or metadata.
- the element 410 may convey the results from the image segmentizer 110 ( FIG. 1 ), which may be in the form of an original image and a segmented image 114 ( FIG. 1 ), with or without text.
- the human editor 424 may confirm the segmented image is whole, complete etc.
- the element 410 may correspond to alignment process 115 , where results 1422 convey object images 114 ( FIG. 1 ) in aligned form.
- the feedback 1421 from human operator, when presented grouped presentation 430 may be identification or selection of panels that show an object in misalignment
- the element 410 may correspond to feature extraction 120 , and the results may be derived from performance of feature extraction 120 .
- the results may be displayed individually, with the object image 114 on which extraction is performed. Numerous other processes may be presented for manual enrichment in a similar manner.
- human editor 424 may be able to provide feedback that enables the identified erroneous result to be rectified.
- the human operator 224 may specify input that corrects the displayed alignment, via text or other kind of input.
- FIG. 4B illustrates a manual enrichment process performed on results of segmentation process, such as performed by the image segmentizer of system 100 ( FIG. 1 ), under an embodiment of the invention.
- a presentation 460 includes panels 462 comprising results of the segmentation process.
- Each panel 462 may be presented with a feature 470 for enabling the human editor to approve or reject the programmatic result (i.e. the segmentation on the image).
- a Boolean style feature is used for feature 470 .
- the feature 470 may, as default carry a “correct” value, from which the human operator may manually select “reject” when appropriate. Assuming the programmatic process is correct much more often than incorrect, the cascade presentation of panels enables one human operator to scan through thousands of panels in a relatively short time to reject those panels that convey incorrect results.
- a manual enrichment process such as shown and described with FIG. 4B may be similarly applied to any other programmatic process from which results may be generated.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method in which image segmentation and alignment may be performed using a statistical analysis, according to one or more embodiments described herein.
- a method such as described by an embodiment of FIG. 5 may be executed as part of the image segmentizer of system 100 , shown in FIG. 1 . Accordingly, reference is made to an embodiment of FIG. 1 in describing an image segmentation algorithm of FIG. 5 .
- a programmatic statistical analysis of a pixel distribution is applied to an image to determine foreground and background elements of the image.
- I an image.
- F the features of the image for each pixel. Examples of features are grayscale intensities, values in RGB color space, CIE-L*a*b* or any other color space, or texture and other image features that are derived from the raw image data.
- P be a set of pixels that are at a distance of k pixels from the image boundary.
- Let m be the median vector of the feature vectors for the pixels belonging to set P.
- the following algorithm can be used for segmentation:
- T is a predefined threshold.
- a connected component analysis is performed for the background pixels. Connected components are identified when they are of size less than M and label pixels belonging to these connected components as foreground. M is assumed to be a predefined threshold.
- a connected component analysis is performed for the foreground pixels. Connected components are identified that are of size less than M. Pixels belonging to these connected components are labeled as background.
- a connected component analysis is performed on the background to identify connected components that do not touch the image boundary.
- the pixels belonging to these connected components are labeled as foreground.
- n is a predefined threshold.
- the final labeling returns a map in which each pixel is labeled either as foreground and background.
- the foreground pixels define the segmented image 115 , and can then be used for alignment and feature extraction, as performed by other modules of system 100 .
- segmentation algorithms may be performed.
- Min-cut Max-flow based segmentation Random walk and first arrival probabilities based image segmentation
- Curve evolution Curve evolution and active contours.
- a human is asked to draw a box around the object/product that tightly encases the object.
- the parts of the original image that are outside the box are considered to be background (we will refer to these as background seeds).
- a subset of the image inside the box is assigned to be foreground (similarly called foreground seeds).
- the subset is chosen depending on object-specific knowledge, for example, for t-shirts the middle of the box is a good foreground guess, while for pants the middle top is a good stable guess.
- the knowledge of what regions are typically good foreground guesses can be extracted by extracting statistics from a training set of segmented object/product examples. The complete segmentation is then obtained by enforcing the assumption that colors and textures are coherent in the foreground and background regions, respectively.
- this coherence is enforced using a Markov Random Field over the image pixels, which associates edges with high similarity scores to pairs of adjacent image pixels with similar color and texture, and edges with low similarity scores to pairs of adjacent image pixels lying on boundaries between homogeneous regions.
- a Markov Random Field over the image pixels, which associates edges with high similarity scores to pairs of adjacent image pixels with similar color and texture, and edges with low similarity scores to pairs of adjacent image pixels lying on boundaries between homogeneous regions.
- this pairwise pixel similarity graph we can solve for a partitioning of the pixels, that is consistent with the foreground/background seeds and cuts the set of edges with minimal similarity cost.
- the Markov Random Field is augmented with additional color models for the dominant colors in the foreground and background, respectively, which factor as a separate term.
- the input of foreground and background can be obtained via a person scribbling on the foreground and background respectively.
- step 520 provides for manual confirmation of the segmentation performed on the images 104 , in determining the segmented image 115 .
- manual confirmation is performed by displaying to a human editor the segmented segmented image 115 , and enabling the human editor to accept, reject or edit the segmented image 115 determination.
- steps of alignment and preprocessing may include an objective to align or format images into to a canonical view, and to determine and focus on various parts of the object in the content item.
- focus items are category-dependent.
- step 530 provides that an object classification is determined or retrieved.
- information provided through object determinator 150 is used to determine the object classification. Different levels of specificity may define the object class, depending on, for example, the information available from the metadata, text and/or source of the content item 102 .
- Step 540 determines the focus item(s) of the image, based on the determined classification.
- the image of a content item may be known (or determined) to carry a watch, in which case the focus item may correspond to the dial area.
- the focus item may include the regions of the toe and the heel.
- step 550 one or more rules or algorithms that are specific to the class of the object carried in the image is implemented to perform a desired alignment.
- Different types of objects include different shapes and features which need to be accommodated in the alignment process.
- FIGS. 6A-6C illustrates results of an embodiment as applied to an image of a shoe.
- the content item image 104 ( FIG. 1 ) corresponds to a shoe image.
- the image may be retrieved from, for example, a picture on a web page, or a record for display on a web page (such as on an e-commerce site).
- FIG. 6B illustrates the result of segmentation performed on the image 104 ( FIG. 1 ), corresponding to the segmented image 114 .
- the pixels of the vertical foreground are summed.
- an embodiment sums all the pixels that are foreground in that particular column.
- the example of the sum is shown in FIG. 6C .
- the sum graph is analyzed, and the side that has the higher slope is selected as the heel.
- the direction of the largest eigenvector corresponds to the principal direction along which the mass of the object is spread. However, if the ratio of the first to the second largest eigenvalue is small, the principal direction is not prominent, and a determination may be made to leave the image in the original orientation.
- watches, rings, bracelets and necklaces are items for which such an alignment process works well, provided good segmentation is available.
- the focus may be of a large stone or pendant, and ignoring it in the computation of the PCA can further improve the quality of the alignment.
- Hough transform can be used to find the round parts of an image.
- each pixel of the image is taken after the segmentation mask, and the circle or ellipse that passes through each 4-point selection is recorded.
- least square fitting can be applied to find the best matching circle or ellipse. In order to speed up the process, this process might be applied on a large number of random selections, as opposed to very possible selection of four points.
- the edges of the segmentation mask is found first, which serve as the boundary pixels. Then the circles or ellipse are fitted to the boundary pixels only.
- a voting is applied on all the circles to find the circle that has the biggest number of hits.
- the voting can be applied on one aspect first, such as the center location of the circle and then the radius.
- the final best vote(s) are declared as the winner circle/ellipse(s).
- this algorithm can be used to find the face of the watch. Once the face is extracted, more attention can be applied on the face area either while applying feature extraction, or while doing feature (similarity) matching.
- the results can be reviewed by the human beings for quality assurance.
- a page that includes many images and their corresponding segmentations are shown to the humans. The person would click yes or no if the segmentation is correct or wrong respectively.
- An example of a such user-interface system or front-end is provided in FIG. 13 .
- the query items that are clicked “No” can then be queued up for further detailed processing.
- the detailed processing might involve painting all the pixels of the foreground by a simple user-interface and virtual paintbrush, or drawing a rectangle around the object.
- a feature corresponds to a visual characteristic of an image of an object.
- a feature is extracted when it is identified, or substantially identified, and then represented as data that is separate from the image.
- extracted features are quantified in the form of vectors or values.
- some features are identified and then represented as text data.
- One or more embodiments provide that images of objects are analyzed in order to identify features of those objects. These features may correspond to colors, patterns, shapes, or other physical characteristics. Extracted features may then be used in the application of the analyzed images. Applications for extracted features include, for example, enabling programmatically generated descriptive terms, or enabling search inputs that are specific to identified features.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a feature extraction module, under an embodiment of the invention.
- a feature extraction module 710 may operate independently of any other module or component shown. Any image input 712 that conveys an object may be used. Techniques such as described below may extract features 714 from the image input 712 .
- the image input 712 includes a segmented image, that is aligned, through use of elements such as described with an embodiment of FIG. 1 . As such, embodiments such as described with FIGS. 7-9 may be used to implement the feature extraction module 130 of the system shown in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 9 illustrates components that comprise the global feature module, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the global feature extraction component 820 includes a color feature extraction component 910 , shape feature component 920 , and/or text feature component 930 .
- the color feature extraction component 910 may be used to determine different types of global color features.
- One global color feature is the dominant or primary color(s) of the image object.
- a process 912 of color feature extraction component 910 may perform anyone of numerous techniques for the determination of a primary color of the object in an image.
- a dominant color descriptor is used. This color feature extracts the dominant colors of an object.
- the input is a segmented image of an object and the output is a list of the dominant colors and their weights.
- process 912 determines principle colors using a k-means clustering algorithm.
- a red-green-blue (RGB) space or any other color space (HSV, lab etc) can be used.
- a k-means clustering algorithm may be implemented by first sampling a fixed number of RGB pixels in a given object image (e.g. object image 114 uses in system 100 of FIG. 1 ). A set of k centers (not too close together) are chosen from the pixels. The k-means is used to determine the final cluster centers (in RGB space). If two clusters are close together, then they are merged. If a cluster is two small, it is removed. The final cluster centers are the dominant colors and the cluster size is normalized to be the weight.
- the second component is the angle between the two RGB vectors. This angle is sensitive to color changes, but insensitive to changes in lighting.
- the third component is a normalization term based on the lengths of the two RGB vectors. This normalization term prevents bright colors (with high RGB vectors) from being penalized unfairly. In addition, colors with RGB vectors below a certain length (very dark pixels) only use the L2 distance of the RGB vectors.
- colors may be determined using color histograms of an overall image of an object.
- an image may be divided into multiple regions, and an individual color histogram may be obtained for each regions.
- Such an approach not only captures the color variations, but may also capture the layout distribution of the colors.
- a perceptual color space is developed.
- a collection of color names are obtained (e.g. blue, green, pink, red, black). Then, colors covering the RGB space are shown to humans, who provide feedback that matches colors to the corresponding names. In this way, a variety of color tones that are assigned to a particular color name are identified.
- a machine learning technique may be executed to learn the mappings between the colors vectors and the color names. As an option, a color look-up table can be used for this purpose.
- a shape feature component 920 may identify a global shape feature from an image object.
- the shape feature component 920 may use the segmentation mask for a given image object in obtaining the shape feature.
- the component 920 determines the shape features from the boundaries of the foreground pixels.
- a contour feature can be used.
- First edge detection is applied to detect the boundary pixels.
- one of the several techniques can be applied to the collection of boundary pixels.
- the boundary pixels are put into a vector.
- Elliptic Fourier Descriptors, or Moment Descriptors can be calculated on the collection of the boundary pixels.
- the shape feature component applies a Principal Component Analysis on the collection of boundary pixels.
- the list of boundary points are aligned. For example, a north-most point in the image can be chosen as the starting point of the boundary sequence. Then the boundary pixel locations may be written to a vector in order. Then Principal Component Analysis is applied on this list, and the first few k Eigen Values are chosen as the representative of the contour of the image.
- the component 920 uses the shape features that represent the areal distribution of pixels.
- One such example is Region-Shape-Descriptor (RSD).
- the region-based shape descriptor utilizes a set of ART (Angular Radial Transform) coefficients.
- ART is a 2-D complex transform defined on a unit disk in polar coordinates.
- RSD takes into account all pixels constituting the shape, including both the boundary and interior pixels. It is therefore applicable to objects consisting of a single connected region or multiple regions, possibly with holes.
- the shape feature component 920 is configured to capture the layout of the image that can be used.
- Edge histogram distributions is one such feature.
- the edge histogram descriptor represents local-edge distribution in the image. Specifically, dividing the image space into n-x-n sub-images, the local-edge distribution for each sub-image can be represented by a histogram. To generate the histogram, edges in the sub-images are categorized into five types: vertical, horizontal, diagonal (45 degrees), diagonal (135 degrees), and non-directional edges. Then the combination of these histograms on the overall sub-images serve as a layout descriptor for the image. This feature can also be used as a texture descriptor. As such, it would capture both shape and texture features of the image.
- texture feature component 930 obtains the histograms of the scalar convolution outputs. In another embodiment, texture feature component 930 combines the outputs of multiple convolution filters into a multi-dimensional histogram.
- vector quantization can be used for this objective. First, k-mean clustering can be applied on a collection of convolution outputs. This step determines the cluster centers. Then vector quantization can be applied for each image and a distribution of the convolution outputs is obtained per image. This distribution is used as a feature vector for representing the texture of the input image. In one embodiment, texture feature component 930 obtains texture features using only data from within the segmentation mask.
- the texture feature can be obtained from a box or other geometric shape that is completely included in the segmentation mask.
- Gabor filters can be used to extract the texture features. This feature is a Gaussian weighted sinusoid, and is used to model individual channels in an image, where each channel corresponds to a specific type of texture. Then for each channel, some type of statistics such as the energy, and energy deviation or energy distribution are saved.
- the metadata feature component 940 determines metadata features from content associated with the object image.
- the term metadata is used to denote the text fields associated with a procured (e.g, through web crawling) content item. These include the item title, description, brand, associated keywords, price, unique product number and product categories the item is thought to belong to.
- the metadata feature component 940 may be implemented as part of the object identifier 140 of FIG. 1 , including as part of the text and metadata analyzer 145 .
- Metadata has several different uses. One major use is to extract features that would then be used to identify the similarity of different objects. Important clues for similarity of two product items can be extracted from their metadata descriptions. For example, metadata usually contains the item type (casual sandal), brand (TeVa), a description of the item containing useful expressions such as rubber sole, strappy, leather. Based on these features, a similarity score between two items can be obtained.
- the relative importance of the different terms (words and phrases) in the metadata is estimated using the inverse document frequency (IDF).
- IDF score for a term is the logarithm of the number of all product items in a sample collection, divided by the number of product items in that collection whose descriptions contain the term. Intuitively, when a term is relatively rare in the whole collection of documents, it is considered more important for similarity. A description of an item can thus be represented using a sparse vector containing the IDF scores for the terms that appear in its description. The similarity of two items then can be defined as the cosine of their IDF score vectors.
- the text in the different text fields may contain terms of different level of importance with regard to the perceived similarity of two items.
- the IDF term vectors for each of those fields can be compared separately, and combined to obtain the final score.
- the combination can be a simple linear function of the separate text field scores, or a more complicated non-linear combination.
- This combination can be defined by human operators, or learned on a collected data set (ground truth dataset) of similarity data, where users specify which items they think are similar, and which are different. Any standard classification or regression method, including but not limited to logistic regression, least-squares regression, linear discriminant analysis, boosting, support vector machines etc. can be used in learning this combination.
- buzzword expressions are words or phrases deemed to be of particular importance for determining item similarity (e.g. pointed-toe shoes, lace-up shoes, analog watch).
- the IDF terms associated with these buzzwords can be weighted separately from the rest; the tradeoff can be learned on a collected set of similarity data and standard classification or regression algorithms.
- buzzword expressions can be combined into sets. For example, a set of buzzwords that describes different kinds of shoe toe styles would include buzzwords such as split toe, round toe, square toe, open toe, or pointed toe. As there is a fairly limited number of such sets, the IDF scores for these items can be ignored, and instead the importance of each buzzword set relative to the rest can also be learned using a collected set of similarity data and standard classification or regression algorithms.
- the set of buzzwords describing the item can be enriched based on visual cues.
- the item colors can be estimated from the associated picture of the item using a clustering algorithm, such as k-means or Gaussian mixture models.
- the top colors and their amounts that are identified can be added to the item metadata.
- separate detectors can be built that detect certain properties of product items (e.g. which shoes have stilettos) in the images of the items. These detectors can be trained on a labeled collection of items, using standard image classification algorithms such as but not limited to boosting and support vector machines. Buzzwords detected above a given level of certainty are added to the metadata.
- human operators can do manual enrichment on the set of buzzwords.
- the simplest embodiment has humans scanning all items of interest to identify a particular buzzword (e.g. whether shoes have stilettos).
- a more advanced embodiment pre-filters the candidate items uses automatic enrichment methods such as those described in the previous paragraph.
- textual cues can also be used in manual enrichment. For example, if the item is labeled as sandals, it can be determined with reasonable certainty that a number of buzzwords such as boots, knee-high, closed toe, etc. do not apply with very high probability.
- the image classification techniques can be used to add metadata features. For instance, a “Strappy” shoe detector can be used to identify that a shoe is strappy, and the word “Strappy” can be added to the metadata of the particular item.
- FIG. 10 illustrates a method for determining and extracting local features from an image object, under an embodiment of the invention.
- a method such as described may be performed by any of the feature extraction modules described above, including with an embodiment of FIG. 1 or FIG. 7 .
- a method such as described may be implemented on an object image.
- the feature extraction module such as described with an embodiment of FIGS. 7-9 may be configured to extract local features.
- the use of local features provides the user with the ability to fine tune or limit a visual or image search by specifying sub-regions of a given region for use as the basis of a search query.
- the features from a sub-region of the image enables a search based on only a sub-region of the image.
- a user may perform a visual search for shoe, while specifying a heel shape or an image of a heel as the query.
- local HOG features can be obtained in key points of an image. The steps of this algorithm are described next.
- step 1010 provides that each image is normalized such that all images have same bounds and extents. Normalizing the image includes normalizing an overall size of the image. With reference to an embodiment of FIG. 8 , step 1010 may be performed by, for example, image region identification process 830 , as part of a process of identifying regions of an object image.
- step 1010 is more relevant for searching online shopping images where there is often only one object in the image under analysis.
- the act of pre-normalizing the image to a fixed size avoid issues that may otherwise be caused by the scale changes.
- the system estimates a tight bounding box around the segmented foreground in the image and normalizes the image to a pre-determined fixed resolution.
- descriptors are computed around these key points or regions. These descriptors attempt to capture the shape, color or texture around the key points or regions in a high dimensional feature vector.
- histograms for color channels can be used as color descriptors, three-dimensional spatial-orientation histograms of image gradients as shape descriptors, and Gabor filters as texture descriptors.
- CSH Color-Spatial Histograms
- HOG Histogram of Oriented Gradients
- Geometric Blur feature shape descriptors
- Gabor filters are computed around these key points or regions.
- the spatial context is automatically defined to be proportional to the region of the region detector. If a key point detector which does not provide any scale information is used, then the system uses a user configurable predefined M ⁇ M pixel region around the key point as the spatial context.
- CSH Color Spatial Histogram features
- HOGs histogram of oriented gradients
- Color Spatial Histogram features These features can be used as an alternative to simple color histograms.
- CSH Color Spatial Histogram features
- To compute these descriptors the local image region around the key point or region is divided into pre-configured K ⁇ K cells. Each cells defines local regions of L ⁇ L pixels. A color histogram is computed for each of these cells. To avoid aliasing effect, pixels which are close to cell boundaries are voted using bilinear interpolation. Any of RGB, Lab or Luv color space can be used to compute color histograms. The color histograms are then normalized by performing L2 or L1 normalization. The advantage of these color-spatial histograms is that they also capture the spatial location of the colors with respect to key point and/or region and hence have more spatial-discriminative powers.
- processing chain of HOG computation involves following steps: (i) Computing an image gradient in the local spatial region. For color images, the gradient is computed for each color channel and one with maximum magnitude is taken as final gradient value. Optionally, one can compress the image intensities by computing square root of image intensities, which helps dampen the effect of sudden gradient changes in the image region. (ii) Next, local image region may be divided around the key point and/or region into K ⁇ K cells with each cell of L ⁇ L pixels. (iii) A three-dimensional spatial-orientation histogram is computed where the weights in the histogram are weighted by their gradient magnitude.
- Step 1040 provides that a similarity measurement amongst key points or regions is enabled. This enables the identified local descriptors for form the basis of data that is searched against, for example, another local descriptor serving as a query. Similarity and feature searching is described with additional detail and variations in following sections.
- histograms from all cells are concatenated into one single feature vector. This vector is normalized by L2 or L1 normalization to provide invariance to color changes, and the final result is used as the local shape features. Once the features are obtained, for each descriptor a similarity measure is defined.
- the similarity measures allow the system to measure the similarity of one point with respect to any another point.
- the system uses one of the following distance measures: L2 metric (i.e. Euclidean distance), L1 metric, L- ⁇ metric, or Bhattacharya coefficient. Other measures which can be considered are the KL or Jensen-Shannon divergence.
- a Local Similarity Search Algorithm may be used.
- a system implementing such an algorithm may be initialized by loading all key points and/or regions and their corresponding descriptors for each image in the database. If the number of images is so large that all descriptors can not fit into the RAM of one machine, then a set of machines is employed and the images and corresponding key points and/or region descriptors are distributed on these machines.
- the key requirement in the search algorithm described below is to compute nearest neighbors for a given point. However as the number of key points or regions easily becomes very large, a naive linear search is sometimes not possible. In such systems, a component or system may compute spill-trees or Locality Sensitive Hashing on the descriptors. These algorithms provides the capability of fast returning the top N nearest neighbors for any given point.
- subsequent image searching of local features may be performed on a collection of images.
- the system searches for all key points or regions underlying the user selected region. These key points and/or regions form the query points or regions. If user selects a new query image or does not make a selection then all points and/or regions present on the image are taken as query points and/or regions.
- the system For each query point and/or region, the system searches for top N most similar key points and/or regions.
- the similarity is defined by one of the above described similarity metrics.
- Each of these N nearest neighbors are mapped to the corresponding image in the database. These mapped images form the potential search results.
- a default rank of 0 is assigned to each of these images.
- multiple points or regions from an image in the database matches to a query point or region. This results in many to many mappings of the points.
- one of the following algorithms may be used to assign ranking to images.
- one of the following algorithm may be programmatically called once for each potential image which is to be ranked.
- This algorithm first performs a greedy best one to one matching (in terms of values returned by the similarity metric above) for each query point and/or region. This converts the many to many mappings above to one to one mapping. The algorithm then converts distances returned by similarity metrics to goodness scores. As an example, for L2 metric, the system employs exponential of the L2 distance as the goodness measure. The search algorithm keeps count of number of votes (obtained by summing goodness scores for each query points and/or regions) for each image. After a vote is computed for each potential image, the output of the search algorithm is the images sorted in descending order of these votes.
- Another technique after one to one mapping is to treat these feature distances as likelihoods of matchings, and sum the distances for all points in the local region to compute the overall dissimilarity measure.
- An optional step is to compute occurrence frequency of each feature. The goodness scores during matching is then down-weighted such that more frequently occurring features have less weight. This ensures that only most striking features are used in similarity matching.
- Translation Constraint This method tries to find the best two dimensional translation that maps the query image points or regions to each of the images in the potential image list.
- the system employs the RANSAC algorithm to robustly compute the matching.
- the images are sorted in descending order of the number of points and/or regions, which satisfy the translation constraint.
- Similarity Constraint This algorithm is similar to the translation constraint but here the algorithm tries to find the best 2-D similarity transformation that maps the query image region to each of the image in the potential image list.
- one or more embodiments enable the user to fuse search results by defining multiple selections.
- the user selects an image region and the system returns the most similarly ranked images.
- the user can select another image region and ask the system to return intersection or union of the two search results.
- More than two selections can be defined in a similar fashion. This allows user to further fine tune their results by refining their queries in a stepwise manner.
- one or more embodiments enable features to be extracted that are identified as global features. However, such features are extracted only in a local region (tile). This allows users to search objects based on local appearances.
- the input is the segmented image of an object.
- the bounding box of the segmented object is tiled into a fixed number of tiles (M ⁇ M) and (global) image features (such as dominant color and EHD) are computed for each tile.
- the feature is stored as the concatenation of all the features of all the tiles.
- a local search is performed by selecting a rectangle in the query image.
- the tiles that intersect the rectangle are used in the image search.
- the feature distance is the sum of the distances of all the features in the corresponding tiles, weighted by the area of overlap between the tile and the query rectangle.
- the final distance is normalized by the number of tiles.
- the tile based features and the HOG based (key-point) based features can be combined to increase the accuracy of a local search.
- these algorithms can run in a cascade, for instance the tile based algorithm can run first to determine the candidates, and the key point based algorithm can be executed next.
- the local feature extraction component 830 may be configured to automatically detect regions and extract features on sub-regions.
- a Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) algorithm or process may be implemented.
- CBIR refers to processes that attempts to find images similar to a given query image using visual information instead of contextual text meta-data.
- Most conventional methods base the search on global (whole-image-wide) visual features such as color, texture, and shape. Although such methods can be effective in locating globally similar matches, they may miss important regional features.
- automatic region segmentation (perhaps plus manual verification) is usually employed to obtain the meaningful regions before feature extraction can be carried out on those regions.
- region segmentation is still an open problem and any region segmentation method will have dead corners.
- human verification and editing can make up for the computer errors, such manual effort can be slow and add significant costs in high-volume real-world applications.
- One or more embodiments disclose a cost-effective method for region-base image search that can be used under one embodiment.
- One primary use for an image analysis system such as described with embodiments provided above is to enable search of images and other content for applications such as e-commerce.
- a system or method for analyzing content items that carry images is to enable a search system that enables queries to specify image data or values.
- a conventional image searching system is normally based on text queries. For example, popular search engines on the Internet use text meta-data associated with each image to determine the keywords and search images based on these keywords. This conventional approach has several disadvantages.
- CBIR algorithms search for images similar to a given query image using visual information. Most algorithms are based on global (whole image wide) visual features such as color, texture and/or shape. Such methods are effective in locating globally similar matches, but may miss important regional features. Moreover they do not provide enough flexibility to the user to fine-tune their searches by selecting regions of specific image.
- embodiments described herein provide effective methods for searching visually similar images from a large database (e.g. of order of million of images) all the while providing user the flexibility of fine tuning their searches by giving relevance feedback.
- One or more embodiments also include human assistance and quality assurance in many aspects of processing, such as categorization, a segmentation, extraction of key points, all of which can be employed as preprocessing steps in the system.
- a system such as described may be used in connection with other embodiments described herein to enable search of records carrying images, using anyone or more of different kinds of records.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a search system for enabling search of images, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- a search system of FIG. 11 may be combined with a system of FIG. 1 , and/or with components described therein or elsewhere in this application, to enable searching that are based at least in part on queries that specify image data and/or values.
- embodiments described with FIG. 1 and elsewhere in this application may be used in order to aggregate data corresponding to searchable image data.
- a search system 1100 includes modules in the form of a user-interface 1110 , search 1120 , and procurement 1130 .
- the modules may operate in connection with a content analysis system 1140 that analyzes the image, text and metadata content of records.
- the system 1100 may include an index 1150 which stores index data 1152 generated from the analysis of images and content item.
- the index data 1152 may be generated as a result of the performance of the content analysis system 1140 .
- System 1100 may include a record data store 1160 that holds records 1162 that include content items analyzed by the content analysis system 1140 .
- Procurement 1130 may retrieve and populate records 1162 with record data 1164 .
- the procure 1130 retrieves record information about the content item 1102 that can be used to categorize or search by classification.
- the record data 1164 may correspond to the price of the item for sale, the brand or manufacturer of the item, and the source of where the item may be purchased.
- Other information about the content item 1102 may include, for example, its quality and/or its material of fabrication. All of the examples provided for record data 1164 illustrate use of text and metadata associated or contained within the content item 1102 that can later be used to categorize the content item.
- the content analysis system 1140 may comprise a “backend” of an overall search system.
- the content analysis system 1140 may include an image analysis component 1142 and a meta/text analysis component 1144 for analyzing content items 1102
- Content items 1102 in the form of web content, for example, containing images, text and metadata may be analyzed for purpose of (i) classifying the object or objects in a content item, (ii) generating data that is descriptive or representative of global and/or local features of the object image in the individual content items, and/or (iii) generating signatures that provide quantitative information about the appearance of the object in the image, including of the global and local features.
- the content analysis system 1140 generates or identifies text and metadata from content items 1102 or data associated with content items, for use in establishing text-based data that serves as at least a part of a comparison or matching process in an overall search algorithm.
- the text and/or metadata may include both (i) text/meta data existing in or with the associated contact record, and/or (ii) text/meta data generated from recognizing or analyzing images.
- index data 1152 may include data that represents one or more of (i) the classification(s) of a given object, (ii) global features of the object, (iii) localized segments of the object, (iv) local features of the object, (v) text and metadata carried or associated with the content item from which the object in the image was located, (vi) text and metadata generated from local features, global features or other image recognition/analysis results, and/or (vii) any combination thereof. More than one index 1150 may be used to store the index data 1152 , particularly index data of different types. The index 1150 may be maintained on a server-side system, using one or more machines.
- one or more embodiments provide for quantitatively representing the local and global feature data in the index 1150 .
- the indexes are loaded to memory when the servers get started.
- the indexes stay in the disk, and they are loaded during the search time.
- a cache can be used along with one of the other embodiments. This cache would store the most frequently used search results in the memory, and when such a search happens, it returns the results right away. If there is enough memory, then the cache can hold all possible search results.
- one or more quantization algorithms can be used to pack 4-byte floating point values to 1-byte to enhance storage and use of the index or indexes.
- the index data 1152 that corresponds to the global and/or local features may be stored linearly, one after another in an index file (or database).
- an index structure enables a subsequent search to be performed by scanning all of the index data items one by one. Distances between individual index data items may be calculated one by one, and the results of the calculated distances are also stored. Implementation of such a technique enables an optimal result to be obtained, since every single item is considered during search.
- a search that uses the index structure may take an unnecessary long time.
- the index 1150 may divided onto multiple machines. At search time, a search query is sent to multiple machines at the same time. A reply may be formulated that incorporates the first N results back from each machine. The component providing the compilation of the results may reorder the results received from each machine.
- the features are indexed using other structures, such as spill trees, ball trees, vector quantization (based trees).
- These techniques store the features in leaves of a trees structure of the index 1150 .
- Each node of the tree may serve as a decision mechanism for focusing only a part of the inventory.
- Such a technique enables a search to be performed faster than, for example, the linear technique described above.
- this techniques does not provide the exact same result as the linear search. As such, there is a loss of accuracy in the results.
- the fast features correspond to generalized criteria.
- the generalized criteria could be color or shape only.
- a cascade search is progressive, with a first pass through the index using a shortened (e.g. truncated or abbreviated) version of a signature that forms some or all of the search criteria.
- a subsequent signature may use a longer or more complete version of the signature, and then compared against the results identified from the first pass through.
- the signature and the remainder of the search criteria may be progressively expanded to match the original query.
- the signature may be searched against a portion of the index that was identified from the previous search, using the previously expanded signature/search criteria.
- the search is performed in a series of cascade operations, with a first search making a fast (i.e. less data-intensive) pass through the index or library of files being searched, in order to identify a subset.
- the fast features correspond to generalized criteria.
- a cascade search is progressive, with a first pass through the index using a shortened (e.g. truncated or abbreviated) version of a signature that forms some or all of the search criteria.
- a subsequent signature may use a longer or more complete version of the signature, and then compared against the results identified from the first pass through.
- the signature and the remainder of the search criteria may be progressively expanded to match the original query. With each expansion, the signature may be searched against a portion of the index that was identified from the previous search, using the previously expanded signature/search criteria. In this way, the search is performed in a series of cascade operations, with a first search making a fast (i.e. less data-intensive) pass through the index or library of files being searched, in order to identify a subset.
- the search criteria is broad and not computationally intensive, and serves to quickly reduce the searchable index or collection.
- a subsequent pass may progressively lengthen the signature (or make the signature or search criteria more specific) and/or search criteria, but the signature/search criteria is compared against the reduced index or collection.
- third or subsequent passes are performed in cascade, with the signature or search criteria progressively lengthening while the field of search reduces.
- image searching for example, where the image data query and field of search require use of large data items (e.g. visual signatures)
- a reduction of computational intensity of the search improves the speed by which the outcome is determined.
- the use of a cascade search structure provides one technique by which the search can be enhanced in terms of speed.
- the search criteria is not very specific and small, or not computationally intensive. As the portion of the data collection that is searched becomes smaller, the search criteria or signature becomes more specific, and larger (or more computationally intensive).
- the search results for all queries can be saved. If there are reasonably small number of search elements (e.g. 10 million), a defined set of K (where K could be a few thousands) results can be saved for each query. This way, there is no calculation of distance values on the fly.
- procurement 1130 may include web crawlers that crawl various network sites for content items 1102 .
- the type of content items 1102 that are sought may depend on the application for system 1100 .
- system 1100 is used to enable visual searching of merchandise, in which case procurement 1130 crawls (through crawl input 1132 ) e-commerce sites.
- the procurement 1130 may crawl blogs, media sites and other network sites.
- the procurement 1130 may seek content items that can provide a basis for a search for merchandise. For example, outfits worn by celebrities may be identified from pages on which celebrity gossip is provided.
- Other applications for system 1110 include social networking and online dating. In such applications, the content items may correspond to pages that show persons, faces, or clothing, attire or apparel used by persons. Numerous other applications exist.
- procurement 1130 may also operate off of content items that provide trigger input 1134 .
- Trigger input 1134 includes content items that are to form the basis of a search query, as specified by users on remote network sites that are independent of the search system 1100 . Such sites may, for example, contain images that an individual may want to use as the basis of performing a search for matching merchandise items (e.g. a user may want to wear a dress that looks similar to one worn by an actress).
- procurement 1130 may also operate off of content items supplied by a user (e.g. through upload or other online submission). For example, a user may submit a digital photograph that is to be analyzed.
- Procurement 1130 may handle trigger input 1134 and user-input 1136 similarly, in forwarding the image file data from those inputs to the content analysis system 1140 .
- pertinent portions of the analysis may be returned to a front end component for formation of a search query.
- the pertinent portions may correspond to an image that is segmented (from its original submission) to display an object, along with identification of its global and/or local features (either quantitative or as text), and possibly metadata or text provided or included in the submission.
- user-interface 1110 may be coupled or integrated with a search 1120 and executed from a server or server-side system to an audience of terminals.

- search module 1120 is equipped to perform category specific searches. These include searches where content records are searched by classification. For example, in the case where record data 1164 identifies category information from the content item 1102 or its context (e.g. manufacturer, brand, price or price range, quality, material of manufacturer), search module 1120 may be able to formulate query 1122 to include the category or classification specification.
- the category or classification 1122 may be combined with, for example, other use input (including image or text input), or alternatively provided as a stand-alone query.
- search module 1120 may use price, brand, or manufacturer, for example, to influence the search result. For example, when the user-input specifies a merchandise item, and the search yields multiple similar items in appearance, price of the items in the search may influence where and how individual items of the result are made to appear to the user.
- one or more embodiments also contemplate cross-category searching. More specifically, in the case where a user-input specifies one type of category (e.g. “shoes” in an e-commerce application), an embodiment may extend the visual characteristics of the specified category to other categories (.g. “purses” or “shirts”) to return some results that match in appearance (if not category). Such an embodiment has application to e-commerce, where a user's desire to view, for example, clothing or apparel, offers an opportunity to suggest items from a different category that may also be of interest.

Alternatively, the search module 1120 may omit the category or classification when searching, and use only image data or text input. Then on obtaining initial results, the search module 1120 may implement one or more filters to identify items by category or classification.
- the user-interface 1110 may be configured to enable a user to select or specify a portion of a processed image as the search input 1112 .

- FIG. 14 illustrates a technique for enabling and performing a similarity search using an image input, according to one or more embodiments of the invention.
- a technique such as illustrated with an embodiment of FIG. 14 may be implemented with, for example, the system 1100 of FIG. 11 . Accordingly, in describing a technique of FIG. 14 , reference may be made to system 1100 , or components thereof, for purpose of illustrating components for performing a step or sub-step being described, or alternatively for using a result of the step being described.
- a step 1410 establishes image similarity data for subsequent searches, in which techniques used to implement image similarity measurements are at least initially determined from human judgments. Similarity distances are employed in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems in order to retrieve images similar to user-provided queries.
- CBIR content-based image retrieval
- Implementing methods measuring image likeness is a challenging task as perceptual similarity is often subjective and task-dependent. For example, a criterion for measuring similarity in an image taken by a consumer level digital camera in a natural environment is different from the criterion of similarity for professional and staged images of products or merchandise such as jewelry.
- Step 1420 provides that similarity amongst images or image portions may be quantified relative to a set of assumptions using distance measurements.
- Several distance functions have been used in the past to measure the similarity of images with respect to specific visual attributes.
- the specific visual attributes include color distribution, texture, or object shapes.
- One or more embodiments described include some of these distance functions, as well as features in the preceding sections.
- An embodiment described includes methods that translate such low-level feature distances into a measure of perceptual similarity capturing the intent of the user search input.
- the search input may be provided from the user through, for example, execution of the user-interface 1110 ( FIG. 11 ) and search module 1120 ( FIG. 11 ).
- One or more embodiments provides for computer-learning of these distance functions from a training set of user similarity judgments.
- Step 1430 includes attribute matching, for purpose of measuring similarity of images with respect to a specified visual attribute (e.g. color).
- the output of each attribute matcher is a numerical value measuring the distance (dissimilarity) between two images with respect to a specific visual feature. Such measure are termed as “feature distance”.
- One or more embodiments include methods to map a set of feature distances into a single perceptual similarity measure. This computation may be cast as a regression problem in which the goal is to predict the perceptual similarity values from a set of observable feature distances. As mentioned earlier, such a similarity measurement may embody a likeness criterion that is dependent on the purpose of the image retrieval task. This regression model may be modeled after human similarity observations reflecting the user intent.
- perceptual observations are collected by asking subjects to quantify the degree of perceived similarity of images, for example by providing likeness values between 0 (opposite) and 1 (identical).
- one or more embodiments include an approach aimed at speeding up or enhancing the perceptual data collection. Since similar images are few in number as compared to images that are different from one another, the process of acquiring human judgments with high value of likeness is generally more time-consuming than the task of collecting dissimilar images.
- One goal may be to use the feature distances to identify image pairs likely to be declared as similar by the subjects. Specifically, for the purpose of collecting observations of highly similar images, only pairs having small feature distances are shown and evaluated by users.
- the highly similar images may be displayed to the user in the form of panels, cascaded so that numerous similar images are displayed at once. Similar to the techniques discussed with manual enrichment, the cascade manner in which panels are presented enables the use of manual feedback and input from operators to move quickly.
- users might define partial orderings over sets of images with respect to similarity to given queries.
- this framework can be used to combine multiple feature distances.
- a perceptual mapping from each feature can be made separately by using this framework.
- a linear least square regression can be used to learn a linear function of feature distances predicting the similarity distances from the training set of perceptual values provided by the users.
- a logistic regression can be employed instead of a linear one.
- More powerful prediction models can be obtained by applying the regression algorithms to higher-dimensional feature vectors computed from the original feature distances. For example, polynomial kernels can be used to compute nonlinear features of the inputs.
- Classification algorithms can also be used to estimate similarity values from the feature distances.
- the user-provided perceptual judgments ranging in the interval [0,1] can be interpreted as probabilities of membership to classes “similar” or “dissimilar”. These probabilities can be used as input to train binary classification methods, such as support vector machine or boosting.
- a weighted combination of the feature distances are used.
- a target function is 0 for distance vector: [Distance( x,y, 1),Distance( x,y, 2),Distance( x,y, 3), . . . , Distance( x,y,N )]
- a target function is 1 for distance vector: [Distance( x,y, 1),Distance( x,y, 2),Distance( x,y, 3), . . . , Distance( x,y,N )]
- weights w(i) may be optimized by making the vector value TotalDistance(x,y) sufficiently close to the target for the selected distance vectors.
- LDA Linear Discriminant Analysis
- one or more embodiments provide for a technique that uses one primary feature to identify an initial candidate set (for example, 10% of all the images in the database), and then use all the features to do a final match. In this way, an embodiment can perform the matching at a faster rate, with very little accuracy loss.
- FIG. 15A illustrates an example of a text search result on shoes. The user can then choose one of the shoes and run an image similarity (likeness) query on it.
- FIG. 15B illustrates an example of similarity (likeness) search results on a shoe.
- the results match the query image with a combination of color, shape, and texture.
- One aspect of searching images with image input is that results can significantly vary as between user expectations and programmatic implementation. Accordingly, one or more embodiments recognize that user-feedback, responsive to search results with image criteria, can provide a valuable resource in enabling a user to specify a desired visual characteristic of an object. As such, one or more embodiments provide for use of feedback mechanisms that can be used by individuals to specify color, shape, pattern or other image values that are characteristic of an object's appearance.
- a user's search result is accompanied by various mechanisms to that enable the user to provide feedback.
- Graphic user-interface features for providing feedback may include any one or combination of (i) sliders, (ii) color pickers, (iii) location region selection, and/or (iv) drill downs.
- a slider is a graphic-user interface feature that is moveable by the user in a linear fashion to enable a user to specify a value between a minimum and a maximum.
- One or more embodiments enable a user to use one or more sliders 1610 in order to select color (e.g. by presenting color values for one or more hues in a spectrum linearly), shape or a pattern as a characteristic of focus in providing a result or modifying an existing search result.
- An example of a slider is shown with an embodiment of FIG. 16 .
- a color picker enables the user communicate a specific color for purpose of receiving a result or modified search result that contains objects of the selected color.
- An example of a color picker 1710 is shown with an embodiment of FIG. 17 .
- the local region selection enables the user to specify input that selects a portion of an image of an object as input.
- the system focuses processing (e.g. query generation and matching) on the selected part of the image.
- a resulting search result may achieve results that are similar to the particular region.
- An example of a selector graphic feature 1810 for enabling the user to make the local region selection is shown with an embodiment of FIG. 18 .
- the feature 1810 may be graphic, and sizeable (expand and contract) over a desired position of a processed image 1820 .
- a rectangle may be formed by the user over a region of interest of the image-that being the face of a watch.
- An accompanying text 1812 explains use and operator of the feature 1810 .
- Results 1830 include items of the same class, with the localized selected feature being considered similar in likeness of or as a match.
- a drill down feature enables the user to provide pre-formulated text queries or classification identifiers to filter or modify a search result. For instance, the user can specify text input of “open toe” for the object of a shoe, and an existing search result may filter to remove content items that are processed as being “open toe”.
- one or more embodiments provide for use of sliders in the client-side relevance feedback (RF) for a system that enables content-based image retrieval, such as described with an embodiment of FIG. 11 .
- Graphic user-interface features such as sliders allows the end user to continuously change key parameters by adjusting a position of a bar or similar graphic feature.
- the position of the bar connotes a value, such as proximity or similarity in appearance.
- Manipulation of sliders enables a search result to be modified. In one embodiment, the modification is responsive and almost instant in response to the bar or feature being provided a new position.
- one or more embodiments enable the end user to more easily find desired images while reducing computation load on a central server or computer system.
- One or more embodiments further recognize that image searching systems such as described with an embodiment of FIG. 11 can have difficulty returning the best or most relevant search results with just a single query image or input form the user. For example, a user may be interested in the color, the texture, a certain object, or a combination of multiple factors.
- One or more embodiments enable the user to interact with a system and its search results, in order to enable final search results which are closer to what the user has in mind.
- a user's feedback parameters on a client side terminal result in the feedback parameters being communicated to a remote server.
- a remote server reprocesses a query based on the feedback and sends back an updated search results for the client terminal.
- Such round trip on a network may include latency issues, which may limit or hinder the user in providing the feedback to the search results.
- the server together with the initial search results, the server also sends additional information to the clients.
- the additional information includes the distances between the query image's individual features and the selected nearest neighbors' individual features.
- the user may then change key control parameters.
- the query results can be very efficiently updated at the client side with limited or no involvement of the remote server.
- the update speed can be fast enough to support seemingly continuous parameter change and corresponding instantaneous query result updates, so that the user can more readily view a most relevant search result.
- the system uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to combine many image features (as described under feature extraction) using weighted summation.
- LDA Linear Discriminant Analysis
- FIG. 19 shows an example of how image features may be combined in a query, under an embodiment of the invention.
- an original query results in a cat image. Due to the weighting on color features, only two cat-related images appear in the 48 panels that comprise the search result.
- An embodiment performs relevant feedback as follows:
- New ⁇ ⁇ Distance w ⁇ ⁇ 1 * ColorDistance ⁇ ( Query , Example ) + w ⁇ ⁇ 2 * ShapeDistance ⁇ ( Query , Example ) + w ⁇ ⁇ 3 * TextureDistance ⁇ ( Query , Example ) + w ⁇ ⁇ 4 * MetadataDistance ⁇ ( Query , Example ) .
- w1 through w4 are the weights obtained through the sliders.
- the result after increasing the pattern features are provided in FIG. 20 . It can be observed that many other cat images are included in the results.
- FIG. 16 another example is shown of how image features may be used or quantified in a query, according to one or more embodiments of the invention.
- the user views a result 1620 comprising similar shaped objects having different colors. This is a result of the color slider 1610 being minimized. By reducing the weight of the color, the user is able to get similar shape and patterns.
- a color picker relevance feedback mechanism may correspond to a user-interface feature that is used to give the user the ability to choose a particular color. Once the user chooses a color, the color features of the query image is swapped with the color of the picked color. Then a global image similarity search is applied on the database. In one embodiment, a weighted combination of the user selected color and the query color are used.
- the result 1720 is of items that have a same or similar classification, and a global color feature that is matching or most similar.
- the color picker 1710 search may thus focus on shape, texture and the metadata features from the original query image, while swapping or reweighting the color features with the color that the user has picked.
- the user may receive items with similar shape, pattern and metadata to the query item, but with the color that the user has selected.
- FIG. 17 provides an example where blue was selected by the user. The shoes start matching the query image in all aspects but the color, and the color of the returned query items are blue.
- a local search relevance feedback mechanism corresponds to a graphic user-interface feature that enables a user to select a region of interest from a processed image, under an embodiment of the invention.
- the processed image may be one that is provided or returned with a search result.
- the features for local regions are calculated prior to search time. When the user selects the region, the system uses the features extracted specifically around that region. Then the matching happens using the selected region's features. In one embodiment, only the local features are used for matching. In another embodiment, a weighted combination of global and local features is used. Still further, a cascade of features' matching can be used. For example, the first pass is made using some of the global features, and the second pass can be made using the local features.

- While some embodiments described herein provide for analyzing images of content items and storing the determined information in a searchable system of records, embodiments described herein provides for processing and use of images that are not inherently for use in commercial transactions, and are created with alternative purposes (such as to entertain or to inform).
- Such websites and content may be outside of the control of the system where image recognition analysis is performed.
- the contents of such web pages may lack conventional standards or rules.
- one or more embodiments may be applied to content items that are retrieved from web pages or other web content, where little advance information is known about the contents of the webpage or content.
- embodiments may retrieve content form websites that provide news or gossip about persons of general interest to the public.
- images from such content may be pre-processed or processed on-the-fly by embodiments described herein to enable users to specify an image or a portion of an image as a search criteria.
- an object of the image or portion thereof may be specified as search criteria for searching for similar merchandise items. Rules of similarity or likeness searches may be applied.
- one or more remote web pages are accessed to retrieve content on display.
- Information is determined about an object shown in a am image of the content on display. At least a portion of the object shown in the corresponding image is made selectable, so that its selection is associated with the determined information. A selection is detected of at least the portion of the object in the image, using the determined information.
- a system in another embodiment, includes a retrieval component and one or more modules.
- the retrieval component is triggerable by activity at a remote web page to retrieve content on display at the remote web page.
- the one or more modules are configured to identify one or more objects in the one or more images of the content on display. The modules determine whether the objects are of a class that are designated as being of interest.
- another embodiment provides for accessing a remote web page to retrieve an image on display.
- the image is analyzed to detect a person shown in the image.
- One or more of a clothing, apparel, or jewelry worn by the person shown in the image is identified.
- a portion of the image corresponding to that detected object is then made selectable, so as to enable a person viewing the web page to select, for example, an item of clothing from a person appearing in the image.
- information may be displayed about the item, including information determined from a visual search of the item.
- items related to a person e.g. clothing
- numerous other kinds and classes of items may be detected in the alternative. These include, for example, items of home decor (e.g. furniture, carpets, drapes, utensils or dishware), machinery etc.
- an embodiment such as described may include numerous e-commerce applications. For example, clothing on an image of a celebrity may be segmented and made selectable when the image is displayed on a blog. Viewers may select the clothing from the image, and see (i) a link or information where the item or an item closely resembling it can be purchased, or (ii) have a visual search performed that compares the characteristic of the selected item to other items of a same class.
- third-party or remote means a person, party or location that is outside of the domain or administrative control of another system or entity.
- FIG. 23 illustrates a method for using remote web content for purpose of identifying search criteria for performing an image search or combination search, according to one or more embodiments of the invention.
- a method such as described with an embodiment of FIG. 23 may be performed using modules and components described with other embodiments of this application. Accordingly, reference may be made to such other modules or components for purpose of illustrating a suitable component for performing a step or sub-step.
- a step 2310 provides that images on a page of a remote site are analyzed or inspected for objects of interest.
- objects of interest correspond to merchandise items, such as items of clothing or apparel. More specific examples of items of interest include shirts, pants, shoes, necklaces, watches, ties, skirts, dresses, hats, purses and backpacks. Numerous other items may also correspond to objects of interest, including, for example, houseware items (dishes), plants, animals and people.
- Step 2320 provides that identified portions of images that are determined to be objects of interest are made active.
- Active image portions of an image may act as visual links.
- a person may view the image and select an entire object of interest by selecting a region of the object (e.g. through movements of a computer mouse or pointer).
- Active image portions detect selection input, or partial selection input (such as when a pointer hovers over a link).
- the web page or other resource provided with the viewing of the page may associate an operation or set of operations with the selection (or pre-selection).
- step 2330 selection of an active image portion results in a query being submitted to a visual search engine.
- the visual search engine may correspond to any image search system, such as one described with an embodiment of FIG. 11 , configured to handle content items submitted on-the-fly.
- the query may identify the active and selected portion of the image.
- the image portion that is selected is pre-designated an identifier that is provided in the query.
- features of the active image are identified from data stored with the page or elsewhere. These features are then used in the query.
- another embodiment provides for use of a visual signature of the image portion, which may be provided in the query. The signature may be provided on the web page or elsewhere.
- the image portion may be associated with an identifier that is used to retrieve pre-determined image signatures or features, then the signature/features are included in the query.
- the query simply identifies the image for the backend system (e.g. content analysis module 1140 of FIG. 1 )
- Data for performing the search may be performed by retrieving identifiers of the image (using the image identifier) on the back end.
- one or more embodiments provide that features or signatures of the image are determined on the fly-in response to the selection action determined from the user.
- Such an embodiment may utilize, for example, modules of system 100 , such as the segmentizer 110 and feature extraction module 120 .
- one or more embodiments provide for the viewer to submit additional data that formulates the query.
- the viewer can select an image portion (e.g. a shirt).
- software enables the user to specify additional information, such as through a software-generated window on which the user may enter text.
- the user may seek to provide text that describes or classifies the object further (e.g. “woman's blouse”).
- the user may specify color, either visually or through text, if, for example, the viewer is interested in the item but would prefer another color.
- any of the user-interface features described with embodiments of FIG. 15A-FIG . 19 or elsewhere may be provided to weight one or more characteristics of the image being displayed, or to otherwise supplement or modify characteristics of that image.
- the query may also identify the domain from which the user viewed the images.
- step 2340 provides that the visual search engine returns images of objects that correspond to or are otherwise determined to be similar in appearance or design or even style, as the object of the user's selection.
- the result may display images that are linked to e-commerce sites or transaction locations. Thus, if one of the results interests the user, the user may select the result of interest and be directed to an e-commerce site or location where he can purchase the item provided with the result.
- the visual search engine may maintain a database of images, where images in the database have the following information stored: (i) a URL to identify where the image comes from (e.g. an e-commerce site), (ii) a visual signature resulting from, under one embodiment, a separate recognition process, (iii) metadata, including descriptive text.
- the visual signature may be in the form of a class-specific signature. More than one signature may be maintained.
- the signatures may include data that describes or represents global or local features (including color, pattern, and shape). Metadata may be programmatically or manually generated based on color, shape, type of object or other descriptive markers (e.g. manufacturer of a pair of shoes).
- the identifiers provided or identified by query are referenced against the database to determine the search result.
- the identifiers may include signatures of the object identified by the image portion, either provided in the query or determined through data contained in the query.
- the text or other features provided by the user at the time of selection may be referenced in the database as well.
- some weighting or rule based algorithm may be used to value text entry with the image signature of the selected object. For example, user-specified text entry may be used as a required qualifier, and the visual signature of the selected image may be used to search in the class of images that satisfy the qualifier.
- information about the domain from which the query was generated may be used to further refine or specify the criteria of the query.
- certain domains may be known to be of interest for a particular type or class of objects (e.g. shoes and handbags).
- the visual search engine may map the domain to a set of criteria (e.g. text criteria) for use with that domain.
- criteria e.g. text criteria
- the criteria determined from the domain mapping process may be used as part of a weighted or rule based algorithm.
- the objects of interest correspond to apparel or clothing of persons.
- a user may view a pair of shoes worn by a celebrity at web page and be interested in the shoes.
- Embodiments described with FIG. 1 and elsewhere in this application enable the person to select the portion of the image that has shoes (the object of interest).
- a search result is provided to the user based on characteristics or appearance of the shoes.
- the search result may be of shoes that match or are similar in appearance or otherwise to the shoes of interest.
- the search result may return different objects that have a similar appearance or style to the selected object of interest.
- some or all of the search result may include a blouse or shirt that has a similar pattern or color as the shoes of interest.
- FIG. 24 illustrates a back end process for activating images on a web page, under an embodiment of the invention.
- the backend process may be implemented using components, modules and techniques described with other embodiments, such as with embodiments of FIG. 1 .
- Each of the processes described in an embodiment of FIG. 24 may be performed by corresponding components or modules, or incorporated in functionality described with one or more embodiments described elsewhere in this application.
- a retrieval process 2410 is performed to retrieve images of a webpage for analysis.
- the retrieval process may be programmatic, manual, or a combination thereof.
- a webpage at a given network location or site may be accessed, and its images identified.
- a trigger input 2412 is provided to cause the retrieval process to be performed for a web page.
- the trigger input 2412 is provided by a webpage subscribing to a service implemented in association with the retrieval process.
- an operator of the webpage may employ a script file that is incorporated into the web page or in connection with an object on the web page.
- the script file may serve as a triggering component.
- the script file signals the retrieval process 2410 from another network location.
- the retrieval process 2410 may check the web page for new content, and extract images that are newly uploaded.
- a schedule input 2414 may be used to implement the retrieval process programmatically on remote web pages.
- the result of the retrieval process 2410 may correspond to image files 2416 that are inactive or unprocessed.
- the image files 2416 may be subjected to an image classification process 2420 .
- the image classification process seeks objects in images that are of a particular kind or type.
- image classification process 2420 seeks items for which corresponding merchandise is provided, such as apparel, clothing and jewelry.
- image classification process 2420 determines some initial information about the image as a whole in order to determine (i) whether the image file 2416 is a good candidate for enabling active portions, and/or (ii) objects of interest that are candidates or otherwise likely to be in the image.
- the image classification process 2420 recognizes that images on web pages are often candid, or freeform in nature. Such images are typical in various news and celebrity websites. Such images often do not follow rules of convention, as present normally in, for example, e-commerce content items. For example, some images may be close-ups of persons or portions of persons (e.g. stomach of a celebrity), others images may be of a celebrity from far away, another image may contain a body part like a hand or foot. Some images are bad candidates for activation. For example, a person may be occluded by objects that are not of interest, or the perspective of the image may be such that no data is usable on the image.
- classification of the image file determines the perspective, and whether the image contains a person or a portion of a person. If a person is in the image, the classification of the image may determine what portion of the person is of focus in the image.
- a programmatic process may scan pixels or image elements for features that are markers.
- markers correspond to the face of the person, as identified by, for example, eye brows, the eyes, the corner of a persons mouth, the lip shape, the tip of the nose, a person's teeth or hairline, a persons thumb or finger nail (for hand-shots in particular) or a person's toes, ankles or toe nails (for a foot shot).
- markers may be identified with different levels of certainty. See priority application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/246,742, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING THE USE OF CAPTURED IMAGES THROUGH RECOGNITION, which is incorporated by reference herein.
- the presence of another marker may confirm the determination that both markers are present. For example, if a person's eyes are present, a program may then estimate, from the size of the region where the eyes are, a position of the eye brows, nose tip or mouth corner.
- an embodiment provides that a candidate set of clothing or apparel is identified, corresponding to what clothing are apparel may reasonably be expected to be present in the image. For example, a headshot of a person may result in the determination that the image of the person may contain a hat, or a shirt, but that there will be no shoes or pants in the image.
- images that are poor candidates for activating portions are identified and marked to not be analyzed. These images may correspond to cases where there is blurriness, occlusion of objects or issues of perspective or angle of viewpoint of the image.
- the object classification process 2420 may also use other information or clues on the page to determine the nature of individual images on the page. For example, text caption accompanying an image may be analyzed to determine whether the image contains male, female or both. Female persons in images may restrict the classification of apparel or clothing to that of women's wear. Other clues may be based on the web page itself (e.g. web page with known female audience). In one embodiment, the object classification process 2420 may be performed by object exterminator 140 .
- a process 2430 analyzes the image to determine what apparel or clothing is present (“apparel identification process 2430 ”).
- the analysis may be performed to determine if the pixels or image data reflect the presence of apparel or clothing that is one of the candidates identified from process 2420 .
- the markers are used to estimate the possible location of an apparel or clothing from the candidate set.
- the estimated position may reflect the size of the image, and the size and/or posture of the person in the image.
- the image analysis may determined, for example, color values of pixels or image elements at the region to determine a color or pattern that is consistent with the existence of the candidate item of clothing or apparel. Once such a point is found, the image analysis may scan in a direction that is towards, for example, the markers of the person's face.
- a transition into a color that is known to be in the range of skin may reflect a boundary of the clothing or apparel. The boundary may be followed to determine a perimeter of the identified clothing or apparel.
- the marker may be of a person's face, and the location, size and position of the marker relative to the remainder of the image may reflect that the person is standing up.
- the analysis process 2430 may then anticipate that a certain region of the image contains pants, shorts, or even underwear. Then the apparel identification process 2430 inspects color and/or patterns to identify boundaries.
- one result of the apparel identification process 2430 is that features or characteristics of detected objects of interest are determined and extracted, or otherwise segmented away from the remainder of the image.
- the process 2430 may be performed by one or more modules of segmentation and/or feature extraction, such as described with an embodiment of FIG. 1 .
- the features or shapes may be used to identify the apparel or clothing, as well as the attributes of the apparel or clothing. For example, the shape of a determined object may match a pair of pants. Additional attributes that are descriptive of the pants include whether the pants or baggy or tight, and the color of the pants.
- a result of the process 2430 is that (i) an apparel, item of clothing or other object of interest that is determined to be contained in the image is identified (“apparel identifier 2432 ”), and/or (ii) features or characteristics (e.g. color, how the item fits) of the item are determined and extracted (“feature 2434 ”).
- the identification of the apparel or its features is stored with the page, or otherwise in association with the image. Extracted features may be performed and correspond to any feature extraction process such as described with FIG. 1 or FIGS. 7-10 .
- the apparel identifier 2432 may be class-specific, and performed with segmentizer 110 ( FIG. 1 ) in combination with object determinator 140 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Features 2434 may be in the form of text (“handbag, brown”), numeric or image-based (similarity determined handbag that is highly processed). For example, in one embodiment, an image signature of the identified object (i.e. clothing or apparel) is determined. The image signature may correspond to a vector representation of the image.
- a similarity image is pre-associated with the identified clothing or apparel of interest.
- the similarity image may be one that has been processed in a library or collection of images (e.g. e-commerce library).
- the similarity image may substitute for the identified object or apparel in the event the identified apparel/clothing is subsequently specified for a visual search. For example, if the process 2430 determines that an image of a person contains a shirt of a particular pattern, a matching or similar image from a known and processed library of images is identified. If a viewer of a page subsequently wants to do a search that specifies, for example, a pair of pants worn by an athlete, the visual search may be performed on a different, but similar pair of pants, where the image used to perform the search is highly processed.
- An activation process 2440 may then activate portions of select images on the web page.
- the activation process may encode or embed script with the source of the web page so that an identified object of interest from an image (e.g. pants of a picture of a person) is active.
- the active portion of any image may be used for a subsequent visual search.
- FIG. 24 provides for a series of programmatic processes
- one or more embodiments contemplate use of a manual process as a substitute.
- processes of apparel identification 2430 may be manually performed.
- manual processes may be performed to enrich or enhance one or more programmatic embodiments described.
- the results of the apparel identification may be presented to an editor for manual confirmation.
- embodiments described herein and elsewhere provide for searching for visual characteristics of a query item to identify other items of the same class
- an embodiment such as described with FIG. 23 or FIG. 24 contemplate cross-category searching. For example, if the search criteria corresponds to a shirt, the visual characteristics of the shirt may be used to also identify one or more items of apparel that match.
