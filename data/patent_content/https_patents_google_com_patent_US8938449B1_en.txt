Definitions
- This specification relates to image labeling.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, video or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, book articles, and news articles. Users communicate across the internet using various forms of communication, such as electronic mail, discussion groups, blogs, and personal web pages.
- a search system can identify resources in response to a text query that includes one or more search terms or phrases.
- the search system ranks the resources based on their relevance to the query and on measures of quality of the resources and provides search results that link to the identified resources.
- the search results are typically ordered for viewing according to the rank.
- a search system can determine the relevance of an image to a query based on labels associated with an image.
- a label typically describes a category or topic for an image, or content depicted in an image, and is readable by a human or a computer (or both).
- the search system can rank images based on the relevance of the query to the various labels associated with the images, and produce image search results based on the rankings.
- Labels associated with a particular image may be manually associated with the image by a user or automatically associated using computer vision techniques.
- labels are created automatically for an image by a computer using computer vision techniques.
- manually associating labels with an image is time-consuming and rarely done in a consistent manner across different users.
- computer vision techniques are limited to what a computer can detect in an image, which may limit the accuracy of the labels.
- This specification describes technologies relating to image labeling.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing images stored in an image data store, the images being associated with respective sets of labels, the labels describing content depicted in the image and having a respective confidence score that is a measure of confidence that the label accurately describes the content depicted in the image; selecting a first image from the images and determining for each of the other images and independent of the labels, a proximity score that is a measure of a relatedness of the other image to the first image; and adjusting the set of labels associated with the first image based on the respective proximity scores of the other images and the confidence scores of the labels of the other images.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the subject matter described in this specification may be used for improved image ranking in an image search, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency.
- the subject matter described in this specification may also take advantage of multiple signals (e.g., proximity metric values), and as such can scale as more signals become available.
- the subject matter described herein is implemented as a single-pass system, which has a lower maintenance burden than an iterative image label creation method.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which an image labeling system creates image labels.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example data flow in which image labels are created.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example image labeling process.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for adjusting a set of labels.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an example data processing apparatus.
- a label is data that describes the content of an image, e.g., an item in the image, a context of the image, a topic to which the image relates, etc.
- a confidence score is a measure of confidence that the label accurately describes the content of the image.
- An image labeling system selects an image and creates a graph of other images that are proximate to the selected image in time, space, social-graph, photo album, etc., with weights appropriate to the proximity. The graph represents a measure of relatedness of the other images to the selected image as defined by one or more of the applicable weights.
- a weight for geo-location can be determined using distance squared
- a weight for social distance can be determined using communication frequency between users, etc.
- the image labeling system uses a probabilistic combination technique to adjust the probability of some labels for the image, and outputs the final set of smeared labels.
- a single picture of a barbeque on a first user's album was taken at a second user's house and was appropriately labeled due to the canonical nature of the image (e.g., computer labeled due to the image of a charcoal grille).
- Other images taken at the same time and place in the first user's album with a very low confidence for the label “barbeque” then have their respective confidence scores for the label “barbeque” adjusted (e.g., to indicate a greater likelihood that those images are related to a barbeque) such that when searching for “barbeque” the second user receives pictures of the same event from the album of the first user.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which an image labeling system creates image labels.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the example environment 100 also includes an image data store 104 , an image labeling system 106 , and images 108 .
- An image data store 104 stores images 108 which may be transmitted through the network 102 .
- the images 108 are first communicated or transmitted across the network 102 to the image data store 104 by users.
- a user may be an individual, a corporation, or any other entity capable of transmitting, or causing transmission of, images 108 across the network 102 .
- users may access the network 102 in order to store images and/or share images 108 with other users.
- a user can share and/or store images 108 by transmitting them across the network 102 to the image data store 104 .
- Once an image has been transmitted to the image data store 104 it may become available for viewing and searching by other users of the social network.
- an individual may have stored images according to “photo albums,” and may have shared (allowed access to) the albums with other individuals.
- a user does not share access to images stored in the data store.
- Each image in the image data store 104 is associated with one or more proximity metric values.
- Proximity metric values are metric values that generally provide information about the associated image and that can be compared to metric values of other images to determine a proximity, e.g., a measure of relatedness, of the image to the other images.
- the metric values that can be used as proximity metric values can be independent of the image content, and can relate to the time, place, user(s), albums, social-graph and other information related to the image or the user that took the image.
- Example metrics include the time the image was captured (timestamp), the location where the image was captured (geo-location), the user who uploaded the image to the image data store 104 (user identifier), and a semantic album name generally associated with an image or group of images (album). Other appropriate metrics may be associated with an image, such as the time the image was uploaded to the image data store 104 , the user who captured the image, the device used to capture the image, etc.
- a user may cause the image data store 104 to not store proximity metric values for one or more images. For example, a user may opt out of having such proximity metric values associated with the images the user uploads.
- identifiers associated with users e.g., user account numbers, user identifiers derived from facial recognition techniques, etc. are anonymized to protect the users privacy.
- Proximity metric values may become associated with an image in a variety of ways; for example, they may be stored in metadata associated with an image when it was captured, they may be provided by a user, or they may be provided by a computer or other data processing apparatus.
- a particular user's camera may include a GPS device, and each image is tagged with GPS coordinates and a time of capture.
- the image is uploaded to the image data store, the image is further tagged with such information as a user identifier of a user uploading the image, a photo album identifier, and information for the nodes in a social graph with which the image is associated.
- Each image in the image data store 104 is also associated with one or more labels which help identify the content of the image.
- One example type of a label is a semantic label.
- a semantic label includes human readable text, and generally is designed to allow a person to identify the content of an image (e.g., “barbeque,” or “wedding”). Semantic labels can be processed by a computer to identify the content of an image.
- Labels can be associated with images by persons or by a computer that utilizes a computer vision technique. For example, a user can assign to an image a label that the user feels appropriately identifies the content of the image. Likewise, a label may also be associated with an image by the image labeling system 106 .
- the image labeling system 106 may implement one or more computer vision techniques, or may receive data from a separate system, such as a vision-based label system 105 that implements computer vision techniques, to create a label for an image.
- Such computer vision techniques include optical character recognition (OCR) technology that can be used to identify text (e.g., text from signs, banners, etc.), facial recognition technology that can be used to identify individuals (e.g., names of persons previously identified, or matches of individuals among images), general computer vision technology that can be used to identify particular image content (e.g., distinctive landmarks, such as building; products, such as particular automobiles, soft drinks, and the like; etc.) or other methods or combination of methods for identifying the content of an image.
- OCR optical character recognition
- image labeling system 106 adjusts existing sets of labels associated with the images 108 .
- Each label is associated with a confidence score which is a measure of confidence that the label accurately describes the content depicted in the image.
- the confidence score is generally a value that falls within a certain range, such as 0 and 1.
- a confidence score of 0 can indicate the minimum (or no) confidence associated with the label, while a confidence score of 1 can indicate that the label accurately describes the image.
- Other ranges of values indicating a level of confidence may be used (e.g., 1 and 100, a binary range indicating that the label either matches or does not, a semantic range of values—poor, fair, good, better, best).
- labels that are added by persons, or that are confirmed by persons are assigned a default confidence score, e.g., 1, 0.9, or some other value that indicates a relatively high level of confidence.
- the confidence scores vary in proportion to the level of confidence for each label.
- an image may have the following set of labels and associated confidence scores on a scale from 0 to 1: ⁇ “barbeque”:0.79, “charcoal grill”: 0.72, “football game”:0.44, “wedding”:0.06 ⁇ .
- “barbeque” has a high confidence score (0.79) relative to the other labels; and “wedding” has a low confidence score (0.06) relative to the other labels.
- a label is removed from (or never associated with) the set of labels associated with an image if the confidence score of that label is below a confidence score threshold. For example, if a confidence score threshold is 0.10, the label “wedding” with a confidence score of 0.06 may be removed from the set of labels associated with the image. Removing labels with low confidence scores is designed to ensure that each label associated with an image has a certain measure of confidence that the label accurately describes the content of the image, preventing erroneous label associations.
- users of the social network may search for images 108 stored in the image data store 104 .
- a user interested in finding images relating to a summer barbeque might enter the query “summer barbeque” into a search engine, hoping to find images which are related to the query.
- the search engine can search through the image data store 104 looking for images that have labels related to the search query “summer barbeque,” and provide a set of images as a result to the user who entered the query. Searching for images involves reading the labels associated with the images, and in some implementations, the search results may be ranked based on the labels and the confidence scores associated with those labels.
- the image labeling system 106 accesses the images 108 stored in the image data store 104 .
- Each accessed image is associated with a set of labels and a set of metrics. While the sets associated with a particular image may be empty, each set generally includes at least one value.
- the image labeling system 106 may choose to access all of the images stored in the image data store 104 , or the image labeling system 106 may access only a proper subset of the images 108 .
- the image labeling system 106 accesses images which meet certain metric value criteria. For example, the image labeling system 106 may access only images which have a timestamp value within a certain range (e.g., between 08/01/2011, 00:00:00 GMT and 08/07/2011, 23:59:59 GMT), and/or within a certain distance (e.g., 1 kilometer). Accessing images based on proximity metric values being within a certain range(s) can limit the number of images to a subset which are more likely to be related to one another, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency. In the example environment 100 , the shaded images indicate the images meeting metric value criteria.
- a certain range e.g., between 08/01/2011, 00:00:00 GMT and 08/07/2011, 23:59:59 GMT
- a certain distance e.g. 1 kilometer
- the image labeling system 106 selects a first image from the images 108 which were accessed and determines, for every other accessed image, a proximity score which is a measure of how related the other image is to the first image.
- the proximity score is a value that falls within a certain range; for example, 0 and 1.
- a proximity score of 0 can indicate the minimum (or no) relation between the other image and the first image
- a proximity score of 1 can indicate that the other image is the same as the first image.
- Other ranges of values indicating a level of relatedness may be used (e.g., 1 and 100, a binary range indicating that the other image is either related to the first image or not, a semantic range of values—poor, fair, good, better, best).
- the proximity score for each other image is determined based on a comparison of the proximity metric values associated with the first image and the corresponding proximity metric values associated with the other image. For example, a first image may have a timestamp of 01/01/2011 and a geo-location for a location New York, N.Y., USA; and the other image may have a timestamp of 01/01/2011 and a geo-location of Boston, Mass. Since the timestamps are closely related, that would likely increase the probability that the images are related. However, the geo-locations are not very closely related (from a distance standpoint), and thus would likely decrease the probability that the images are related. From the proximity metric data, the image labeling system 106 determines a proximity score for the other image.
- the proximity score between a first and second image may be determined based on weights given to the relationship between their respective proximity metric values.
- the proximity score may be based on two weights: one weight based on a comparison of the images' timestamps, and a second weight based on a comparison of the images' geo-locations.
- a weight for the timestamp may be 1.0 because the timestamps are identical (e.g., both are 01/01/2011).
- a weight for the geo-location may be 0.10 because the geo-locations are quite different (e.g., New York, N.Y. is about 190 miles from Boston, Mass.).
- the geo-location of an image may be more significant in the proximity score calculation than the timestamp.
- the geo-location is quite different, and the proximity score for the image may only be 0.15 (on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 indicating unrelated images, and 1 indicating that the images are the same).
- the precision of each proximity metric value may also affect the proximity score.
- a timestamp which is only as precise as the day e.g., 01/01/2011
- a timestamp which includes hours, minutes, and seconds e.g., 01/01/2011, 16:41:59 GMT.
- a more precise timestamp may increase the relatedness of the images relative to the less precise timestamp.
- two images taken on the same day may indicate a certain level of relatedness, but two images taken at the same second/minute/hour of the same day may indicate a higher level relatedness.
- the precision of other proximity metric values such as geographic location, may also affect the proximity score.
- the image labeling system 106 adjusts the set of labels associated with the first image based on the respective proximity scores of the other images and the confidence scores of the labels of the other images.
- the confidence score of a pre-existing label associated with the first image is adjusted. For example, one of the other images may have a proximity score of 0.90 and it may have one label, “barbeque” with a confidence score of 0.80. If the label “barbeque” already exists in the set of labels associated with the first image, the confidence score of that pre-existing label may be adjusted.
- P 11 ′ adjusted confidence score of the first label of the first image
- P 11 the pre-existing confidence score of the first label of the first image
- P 21 the confidence score of the first label of the other image
- PS 12 the proximity score for the other image (as it relates to the first image).
- the confidence score of the label “barbeque” of the first image is adjusted to 0.82.
- the confidence score of the “barbeque” label associated with the first image increased because the other image was very highly related to the first image (0.90 proximity score on a scale of 0 to 1 where 1 indicates that the images are the same) and because the “barbeque” label likely described accurately the content depicted in the other image (0.80 confidence score on a scale of 0 to 1 where 1 indicates a maximum confidence that the label describes the content depicted in the image).
- the image labeling system 106 adds a label to the set of labels associated with the first image based on the respective proximity scores of the other images and the confidence scores of the labels of the other images. For example, if, in the example given above, the label, “barbeque” did not already exist in the set of labels associated with the first image, the image labeling system may add it to the set of labels associated with the first image.
- the confidence score for the new label may be equal to the confidence score of that label as it applies to the other image (0.80 in the example above).
- a formula is used to determine the confidence score to associate with the new label.
- An example formula can be: P 11 P 21 *PS 12
- w j Proximity score, e.g., based on social/temporal/geo/album-semantic relations, between image i and image j.
- the proximity scores can be adjusted in proportion to the current value of P li so that the final value of P li′ asymptotically approaches a maximum confidence score of 1.0; the final value of P li′ may be limited to a maximum confidence value, e.g., 0.9; etc.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example data flow 200 in which image labels are created.
- the image labeling system 106 can access images 202 a stored in an image data store 104 . Each image is associated with a set of metrics and a set of labels.
- an example set of metrics is shown as ⁇ T 1 , G 1 , U 1 , A 1 ⁇ , where T 1 is a proximity metric value which represents a timestamp (the time the image was captured) of Image 1 , G 1 is a proximity metric value which represents a geographic location (“geo-location,” e.g., geographic coordinates or nearest address where the image was captured) associated with Image 1 , U 1 is a proximity metric value which represents the user who caused transmission of the Image 1 to the image data store 104 , and A 1 is a proximity metric value which represents an album name (a semantic identifier indicating a group of images to which the image belongs) of Image 1 .
- the example list of proximity metrics is not exhaustive, and other appropriate metrics that can be determined independent of the underlying image content can also be used.
- an example set of labels is shown as ⁇ L 11 :P 11 , L 12 :P 12 . . . L 1m :P 1m ⁇ , where L 11 is a label associated with Image 1 , and P 11 is the confidence score (also referred to as a probability) associated with the label, L 11 .
- An example set of ⁇ T 1 , G 1 , U 1 , A 1 ⁇ metrics and labels for Image 1 may be as follows:
- the set of labels for Image 1 indicates that the content of the image is highly related to “barbeque,” moderately related to “football game,” and only very slightly related to “wedding.”
- a computer vision technique previously applied to Image 1 may have determined that the image contained the following attributes: an outdoor picture with a grill located in the foreground, several people in the picture wearing shirts with professional football team logos, a football in the air, and a large cake on a table. Those example attributes may have resulted in the creation of the set of labels shown above.
- the image labeling system 106 selects a first image from the images 202 a and determines, for each of the other images of the images 202 a , a proximity score from the proximity metrics.
- the proximity score for each other image indicates how related that other image is to the first image, and, in some implementations, is determined independent of the labels. For example, the image labeling system 106 selects Image 1 and determines, for each other image (Image 2 through Image n ) a proximity score that indicates how related each other image is to Image 1 .
- the image labeling system 106 accesses one or more proximity metric values associated with each of the images 202 a and determines the proximity score based on the one or more proximity metric values to form an image graph 204 of images 204 - 1 . . . 204 - t.
- the image labeling system 106 accesses the proximity metric values associated with Image 1 204 - 1 and Image 2 204 - 2
- the proximity metric values for Image 1 may be as follows:
- the proximity metric values for Image 2 may be as follows:
- the image labeling system 106 compares the proximity metric values associated with each image to determine the proximity score. For example, the timestamps are only 30 minutes and 1 second apart, which may indicate the images are more likely to be related than not.
- the geo-location is the same address, which also increases the likelihood that the images are related.
- the image labeling system 106 accesses a user's social graph data to determine how closely related the user of Image 1 is to the user of Image 2 . Assume that Jane Doe belongs to John Smith's social graph, e.g., is a contact that belongs to a subgroup “co-worker” in the social graph. Accordingly, the image labeling system 106 determines that John Smith and Jane Doe are socially related, and thus the proximity score is adjusted (e.g., increased to indicate a greater likelihood that those images are related). Other factors may be considered in determining the degree of social relation between users.
- the number of communications between Jane Doe and John Smith over a period of time may be considered.
- degrees of separation on a social graph are considered (e.g., Jane Doe might not belong to John Smith's graph, but they have a mutual friend linking them).
- the album names associated with the images do not have matching words, so this might indicate that the images are less likely to be related.
- “Party” and “Picnic” may be identified by the image labeling system 106 as synonyms, which might indicate a higher likelihood that the images are related.
- determining a proximity score is the average of binary values (0 or 1) given to each of the compared proximity metrics to indicate whether each proximity metric value of the first image matches or is related to the corresponding proximity metric of the other image.
- PS nm is the proximity score on an image n relative to another image m
- PM jk is the proximity metric j for an image k.
- the proximity scores can be asymmetric, i.e., PS nm ⁇ PS mn . For example, if a user n has added a user m to a circle for the user n, but the user m has not added the user n to a circle the user m, then PS nm may be greater than PS mn , and the user n appears to have a greater interest in the user m that does the user m in user n.
- the set of images 204 that are selected based on the proximity score threshold may be a relatively small set, e.g., hundreds.
- the image labeling system 106 adjusts the set of labels associated with the selected image 204 - 1 based on the respective proximity scores of the other images 204 - 2 through 204 - t and the confidence scores associated with the labels of the other images 204 - 2 through 204 - t .
- Image 1 might have the following set of labels:
- Image 2 might have a proximity score of 0.75 and the following set of labels:
- the image labeling system 106 adjusts the set of labels for Image 1 204 - 1 based on the proximity score (e.g., 0.75) of Image 2 204 - 2 and its associated set of labels.
- the other image may be associated with a label which is not included in the set of labels associated with the first image.
- Image 2 has a “pool” label which is not included in the set of labels for Image 1 .
- the label associated with the other image is added to the set of labels for the first image.
- the label “pool” from Image 2 may be added to the set of labels for Image 1 .
- the confidence score associated with the added label is based on the confidence score of the existing label and the respective proximity score. For example, Image 2 has a proximity score of 0.75 (as it relates to Image 1 ), and the confidence score of the “pool” label associated with Image 2 is 0.80.
- An example formula to determine the confidence score for the “pool” label being added to the set of labels for Image 1 may be a product of the proximity score and the confidence score.
- the confidence score for the label “pool” associated with Image 1 would be 0.60 (i.e., 0.75*0.80) using the example formula.
- the set of labels associated with the first image is adjusted in response to the confidence score of one or more labels associated with one of the other images being above a confidence score threshold. For example, given a confidence score threshold of 0.50, the labels associated with Image 2 204 - 2 having a confidence score of 0.50 or greater would be used to adjust the labels of Image 1 204 - 1 .
- This threshold is designed to reduce “noisy” image labels from propagating among the set of images 204 .
- the image labeling system 106 produces, for each image in the set of accessed images 202 a , an adjusted set of labels.
- the image labeling system 106 provides adjusted sets of labels for storage in the image data store 104 .
- the adjusted set of labels can be used for subsequent processing (e.g., image searching, etc.).
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example image labeling process 300 .
- the process 300 may be used by a data processing apparatus that is used to realize the image labeling system 106 .
- Images stored in an image data store are accessed ( 302 ). Each of the images is associated with a respective set of labels, and each label describes content depicted in the image. Each label has a respective confidence score that is a measure of confidence that the label accurately describes the content depicted in the image.
- a first image from the images is selected ( 304 ), and one or more proximity metric values associated with each of the images are accessed ( 306 ).
- the proximity metric values include one or more of a timestamp that represents the time that an image was first recorded, a location that represents the geographic location in which the image was first recorded, an album name that is a semantic identifier associated with the image, and a user identifier associated with the image.
- a proximity score is determined ( 308 ).
- Each proximity score is determined independent of the labels, and is a measure of a relatedness of the respective other image to the first image.
- each proximity score is determined based on a comparison of the proximity metric values of the first image and the corresponding proximity metric values of the other image.
- the proximity score for a first image and a second image may be based on a comparison of the timestamp, geo-location, album name, and user associated with each image.
- the set of labels associated with the first image is adjusted ( 310 ).
- the adjustment is based on the respective proximity score of the other images and the confidence scores of the labels of the other images.
- one or more confidence scores of the labels associated with the first image are adjusted based on a product of the confidence score for the label for the other image and the proximity score.
- a new label can be added to the set of labels associated with the first image if the product of the confidence score of the label for the other image and the proximity score meets a threshold confidence level, e.g., 0.70.
- a first image may have a set of labels that does not include the label “wedding.”
- the “wedding” label may be added to the set of labels associated with the first image based on a second image having a proximity score of 0.80 and a confidence score of 0.90 associated with the label “wedding.”
- thresholds for the proximity scores and confidence scores are used to reduce the likelihood that labels lacking confidence or unrelated images are used to adjust a set of labels. Adjustment of the set of labels associated with the first image according to these thresholds is further defined by the process described below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for adjusting a set of labels.
- the process 400 may be used by a data processing apparatus that is used to realize the image labeling system 106 .
- the process 400 is used to select which other images to used when adjusting labels for a first image, and for each of those other images, which labels to use for the adjustment.
- the proximity score of one of the other images is compared to a proximity score threshold ( 402 ). If it is determined in step 404 that the proximity score of the other image is greater than the proximity score threshold, the process continues to step 408 , otherwise the process continues to step 406 . In step 406 , the set of labels associated with the first image is not adjusted based on the selected other image, and the process 400 ends (or, alternatively, selects another image if another image remains to be processed).
- each label associated with the other image having a confidence score exceeding a confidence score threshold is selected ( 408 ).
- the set of labels associated with the first image is adjusted based on the selected labels ( 410 ), and the process ends (or, alternatively, selects another image if another image remains to be processed).
- the set of labels associated with the first image is adjusted based on, for each label of each other image having a confidence score greater than the confidence score threshold, a product of the respective proximity score of the other image and the respective confidence score of the label of the other image.
- a confidence score threshold may be 0.75.
- a second image may have a proximity score of 0.50 as it relates to a first image (assume this is greater than the proximity score threshold) and have a set of labels as follows: ⁇ “barbeque”:0.90, “football game”:0.80, “pool”:0.70 ⁇ . Because the second image has two labels with confidence scores greater than 0.75, the set of labels associated with the first image is adjusted twice (once for each label greater than the threshold). One adjustment is based on the value 0.45 ⁇ the product of the proximity score of the second image (0.50) and the confidence score of the label “barbeque” (0.90). The second adjustment is based on the value 0.40 ⁇ the product of the proximity score of the second image (0.50) and the confidence score of the label “football game” (0.80).
