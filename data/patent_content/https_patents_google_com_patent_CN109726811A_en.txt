Specific embodiment
This description describes the computer journeys being embodied as on one or more computers in one or more positions
The system of sequence, Training Control device neural network is to generate output sequence.

Fig. 1 shows Exemplary neural network training system 100.Neural metwork training system 100 is implemented as at one
Or the example of the system of the computer program on one or more computers in multiple positions, wherein realize described below
System, component and technology.
The training of neural metwork training system 100 has the control of parameter 112 (being known as " controller parameter " in the present specification)
Device neural network 1 10 processed generates output sequence.As described above, controller neural network 1 10 can be configured as generate it is various
Any one of output sequence.
Particularly, in some implementations, controller neural network 1 10 is recurrent neural network, one by one time step
Generate the output sequence time.In each time step, recurrent neural network is configured as receiving the previous output in output sequence
Previous output is handled as input, and according to controller parameter, to generate the score value point on it may export in the time step
Cloth.Then, system 100 is selected by the way that the possibility output of highest score is sampled or selected in being distributed from score value in the time step
Output.However, in general, controller neural network can be any kind of neural network, generation output, output definition
Corresponding score value distribution in the possibility output of each time step in output sequence.Other kinds of neural network is shown
Example includes based on the neural network and convolutional neural networks from attention.
100 Training Control device neural network 1 10 of system is to use repetitive exercise process from the initial value of controller parameter 112
Determine the trained values of controller parameter 112.
In each iteration of training process, parameter value is updated 116 in iteration by the training engine 120 in system 100
Applied to current controller parameter value 114.
In order to improve trained validity, system 100 keeps priority query 130.Any in training process gives repeatedly
Dai Zhong, priority query 130 include one group of K previously generated during the training period by controller neural network 1 10 for identification
The data of output sequence, and, for each output sequence in this set, measure the corresponding reward of the quality of output sequence.
In general, K is greater than 1 fixed integer, for example, 5,10 or 20.Priority query 130 can be initial at the beginning of training process
Sky is turned to, or can be initialized with K random sequence or Fault Sequence.
In each iteration, system 100 makes controller neural network generate a batch according to current controller parameter value 114
142 new output sequences.
Then, reward engine 140 is that each new output sequence determines corresponding reward 144.The reward of given output sequence
It is the numerical value for measuring output sequence quality, that is, executing for task is just trained to relative to controller neural network 1 10.
In some implementations, each new output sequence is supplied to external system and is used to assess by reward engine 140, and from
The reward of external system acquisition sequence.
In other implementations, reward engine 140 assesses the quality of each new output sequence to determine for output sequence
Reward.
For example, reward engine 140 can train when output sequence defines the framework for the neural network of goal task
(for example, training iteration or t raining period for being directed to predetermined quantity) has the reality of the neural network of the framework defined by output sequence
Example, and then determine that the neural network of training is used as reward to the accuracy of test data set.
As another example, when output sequence defines computer program, in one sampled from computer programming task
Or in multiple test cases execute by sequence definition program code (for each test input be individually performed).Based on program
Output scores to each test case, and score value is added and is used for program to calculate, that is, the final reward for sequence.
As another example, when output sequence defines the hyper parameter of the neural network training process for target nerve network
When, reward engine 140 can train the target nerve network with the hyper parameter defined by output sequence, and then determine instruction
Experienced neural network is to the accuracy of test data set as reward.
Training engine 120 is used for using reward 144 generated and the data kept in priority query 130 to determine
The controller parameter value of iteration updates 116, and determines the update 132 to the data kept in priority query.Below with reference to Fig. 2
It is described in more detail at given iteration with 3 and updates priority query and update controller parameter.
The data kept in the queue and controller parameter are iteratively updated, system 100 can be trained effectively
Controller neural network 1 10 is to generate the output sequence of high quality.
Some tasks need to generate final output sequence, that is, are not that controller nerve is continued to use after training is completed
Network 110 generates new output sequence.For these tasks, after training is completed, for example, having completed number of thresholds
Iteration after or after having determined that controller parameter value has restrained, system 100 can choose with highest reward
Priority query 130 in final output sequence of the output sequence as task.
Although Fig. 1 illustrates only the single instruction communicated with the single instance of controller neural network and single priority query
Practice engine 140, but in some implementations, training process can be distributed.Particularly, it in order to accelerate to train, can use asynchronous
Distribution setting, wherein parameter server stores the sharing model parameters of multiple controller neural network copies.Each network pair
This training engine asynchronously samples a collection of sequence from its local network copy, and calculates gradient described below.So
Afterwards, gradient is sent to parameter server, parameter server asynchronous refresh shared parameter.Copy is used from parameter server
Most recent parameters regularly update its local parameter value.Each copy has the priority query that the size of oneself is K.
Fig. 2 is the flow chart for the instantiation procedure 200 of Training Control device nerve network system.For convenience, process
200 will be described as being executed by the one or more system for computer for being located at one or more positions.For example, being properly programmed
Neural metwork training system (such as neural metwork training system 100 of Fig. 1) can be with implementation procedure 200.
System can repeat process 200 to repeat to update the value of the parameter of controller neural network.
System generates the new output sequence (step of a batch using controller neural network according to the current value of controller parameter
202).This batch generally includes the output sequence of fixed quantity, such as ten, 50 or 100.In order to generate each new output sequence
Column, the score value profile samples that system is generated from controller neural network, for example, until scheduled the sequence ends output token is adopted
Sample or until sequence reaches scheduled maximum length.Because system samples rather than select in each time step from score value distribution
Highest score output is selected, so different from each other or even all sequences are all usually according to identical ginseng by new output sequence
Numerical generation.
System obtains the corresponding reward (step 204) of each new output sequence.As described above, new output sequence is measured in reward
Quality, and system can be received from external system and be rewarded, that is, in response to providing new output sequence for assessing, Huo Zheke
To generate reward by the quality for assessing new output sequence.
System determines that priority query's parameter updates, and the reward based on new output sequence and currently in priority query
Data update priority query's (step 206).Determining priority query's parameter is more fully described below with reference to Fig. 3 to update
With update priority query.
System optionally determines that intensified learning parameter value updates (step 208) from the reward of new output sequence.In other words,
System determines another update to the current value of controller parameter, and which increase for using extensive chemical by controller neural network
The received reward of output sequence institute that habit technology generates.For example, intensified learning technology can be Policy-Gradient technology, and system
The gradient that the network parameter about REINFORCE target can be for example determined by backpropagation, maximizes for new sequence
Reward average value.In some cases, it can use baseline item (for example, exponential moving average of reward) enhancing
REINFORCE target.
System optionally also determines that entropy regularization parameter value updates (step 210).Particularly, system can be for example by anti-
To the gradient for determining the network parameter about entropy regularization term is propagated, promote to explore possible output by controller neural network
The space of sequence.Entropy regularization term is intended to increase the uncertainty of model and encourages to explore, and be each time step by
The gradient of the summation of the entropy for the score value distribution that controller neural network generates, while generating (i) new output sequence as described above；
(ii) current score values of the sequence in priority query as described above；Or both.
One or more parameters are updated the current value for being applied to controller parameter by system.Particularly, system can calculate
The total and/or weighted sum that parameter calculated updates, and then according to the update rule for Training Control device neural network
Total and/or weighted sum is applied to current value by (for example, learning rules, ADAM update rule or RMSprop updates rule).
Fig. 3 is for determining that priority query's parameter updates and update the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 300 of priority query.
For convenience, process 300 will be described as being executed by the one or more system for computer for being located at one or more positions.
For example, properly programmed neural metwork training system (such as neural metwork training system 100 of Fig. 1) can be with implementation procedure 100.
System can be directed to each iteration implementation procedure 300 of training process, to repeat to determine to controller nerve net
The update of the parameter of network simultaneously repeats to update priority query.
System selects at least one output sequence (step 302) from the sequence currently in priority query.Namely
It says, system by controller neural network from previously being generated and currently selected in one group of K output sequence in priority query
Select at least one output sequence.In some implementations, system single output sequence of stochastical sampling from K sequence.It is some its
During he realizes, the subset of some other fixed sizes of all K sequences of Systematic selection or K sequence.
For the output sequence of each selection, system is determined according to the current value of controller parameter by controller neural network
Distribute to the corresponding score value (step 304) of selected output sequence.
For example, system is distributed to selected by following manner determination when controller neural network is recurrent neural network
The corresponding score value for the output sequence selected: each specific time of multiple time steps in selected output sequence is walked
It is long, the previous output in selected output sequence is provided as the input to controller neural network, that is, in specific time
The output of time step before step-length, so that controller neural network generates in the possibility output for specific time step-length
Score value distribution.Then, system is distributed to previous in selected output sequence by the score value distribution identification of time step
The score value of output (that is, in output of specific time step-length) after output.Once it is complete to be directed to all multiple time steps
At the operation, system combines the score value of the identification of multiple time steps just to generate the score value for distributing to output sequence.For example,
The score value of distribution can be the logarithm in the product for the score value of the time step identified.
For each selected sequence, system is determined to be updated to corresponding the first of the current value of controller parameter, is increased
Add the score value (step 306) that selected output sequence is distributed to by controller neural network.Particularly, system is for example by anti-
To the gradient for propagating the determining network parameter relative to the priority query's target for depending on distributed score value.Particularly, exist
Under some cases, priority query's target is only distributed score value, i.e., according to the selected sequence of current parameter value
Log likelihood.When selecting multiple output sequences, the phase of system in combination (for example, average or summation) each selected sequence
The first update is answered to generate priority query's parameter update for iteration.
What reward of the system based on the sequence in priority query and a part as present lot generated
The reward of new output sequence updates priority query's (step 308).Particularly, system is according to new output sequence and in holding
Output sequence in data (that is, currently in priority query) determines the K output sequence with highest reward.Then, it is
System modifies kept data, i.e. priority query, to identify identified each of K output sequence and K output sequence
Corresponding reward.In other words, system is from any sequence removed not in the K sequence rewarded with highest in priority query
Column, and any new sequence in the K sequence rewarded with highest is added to priority query.If having K highest
Two sequences in the sequence of reward be it is duplicate, then system considers to remove one of repetitive sequence.
