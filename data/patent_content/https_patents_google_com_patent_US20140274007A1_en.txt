- Various intervening nodes, such as node 203 may correspond to persons known or unknown to the caller or the called party.
- the server 140 periodically updates the association map 200 to create categories, time associations, and other associations such that various nodes may be determined to have a probability of being within proximity of one another at given points or periods of time.
- the nodes correspond to contacts that may be used as intermediary contacts between the caller and the called party, depending upon the various associations that may exist between the nodes.
- Such intermediary contacts may be candidates at any given time based on various factors such as, but not limited to, the candidate's proximity to a called party.
- the time associations and other associations may thus be used by the server 140 to provide augmented contact information to the mobile device 110 , via contact tracker 100 .

- the contact tracker 100 may detect that an outgoing call is being made when the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 detects digits being entered by the user (i.e. the caller) via dialer 112 over the communication path 115 .
- the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may then provide the dialed digits or other information to the server communication logic 105 for transmission to the server 140 using the communication transceivers 111 and wireless communication channel 125 .
- the mobile communication logic 171 of the contact finder 170 receives the information sent by the contact tracker 100 and takes appropriate action.
- the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may also make a determination of whether the mobile device that was called using the dialer 112 answered the call such that the call was a successful call.
- the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may make a determination of whether the called mobile device answered the call and established a communication channel with the mobile device 110 , whether a ring back signal was received and call continued to go unanswered by the called mobile device, or whether the call was directed to a voicemail server. Any one of those events may be considered an unsuccessful call.
- the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 will send notification to the contact finder 170 via the server communication logic 105 .
- the notification will be received by the mobile communication logic 171 and the contact finder 170 will take appropriate action. That is, for an unsuccessful call, the contact finder 170 will invoke the searching routine 175 which will search the association map 200 in the database 160 to determine a candidate (that is, an alternative mobile device for an alternative called party) that the caller may attempt to contact so as to locate the initial called party who did not respond to the call.
- the searching routine 175 determines one or more nodes of the association map 200 that are candidates based on various factors and probability calculations and provides at least one candidate having a highest probability of being in proximity to the called party or, in some embodiments, the called party's mobile device. After the highest probability candidate is determined, the mobile communication logic 171 will transmit augmented contact information over the wireless communication channel 125 to the mobile device 110 . The augmented contact information will be received by the contact tracker 100 , via server communication logic 105 , which will then be provided via communication path 109 to redirector 108 . Redirector 108 may then interact with the dialer 112 over the communication path 116 or may interact with messaging applications 113 over the communication path 118 .
- the redirector 108 may attempt to establish a new, second call with the candidate, or in some embodiments may send a text message to the candidate.
- the caller i.e. the mobile device 110 user
- the redirector 108 may wait to receive permission from the caller to proceed with attempting to contact the candidate.

- the call log 403 entries may also show a date 405 and possibly a time such that the user of mobile device 110 knows when calls were placed, received, or missed.
- the user of mobile device 110 may position a cursor 411 with respect to a desired entry in the call log 403 and may initiate a call directly from the call log 403 .
- the user may position cursor 411 over the contact “Allen Jones” and may make a selection such that the dialer 112 initiates a call to Allen Jones.
- the dialer 112 will then interact with the communication transceivers 111 over communication path 119 to establish a wireless communication channel using WAN 120 , or some other appropriate network, and will attempt to place a call to the appropriate mobile device of the called party Allen Jones.
- call attempt information 101 is transmitted by the contact tracker 100 to the server 140 which is used by the contact finder 170 .
- the contact finder 170 extracts the contact information for Allen Jones and creates a corresponding node in the association map 200 .
- the association map updater 106 component of the contact tracker 100 may access various resources to provide further information regarding the association of Allen Jones to the caller.
- the association map updater 106 may interact with contact list 415 , calendar application 417 , social media application 419 , various sensors 421 of the mobile device 110 that sense the environment, or various call logs 423 such as the call log 403 . If any data entries or other references to the called party Allen Jones are identified by the association map updater 106 , that information will be sent as updates 406 to the server 140 , more specifically to the association mapping logic 173 of contact finder 170 .
- the association mapping logic 173 will accordingly update or modify the association map 200 .
- the contact finder 170 waits to determine whether the call is successful or unsuccessful. If the call is determined to be unsuccessful, the searching routine 175 proceeds to search the association map 200 to determine a candidate (i.e. an alternative contact) who may be in proximity to Allen Jones. If an appropriate candidate is identified by the searching routine 175 , then the contact finder 170 sends augmented contact information, which may be considered call redirect information, to the mobile device 110 .
- the contact tracker 100 receives the augmented contact information and may provide, in some embodiments, the notification message 427 to the user of mobile device 110 .
- the notification message 427 queries the user as to whether the contact tracker 100 should continue to locate Allen Jones, since the original call attempt was unanswered or went to voicemail and was therefore deemed unsuccessful by the contact finder 170 .
- the user may select “NO” in which case the process ends, or the user may select “YES” in which case the redirector 108 will use the augmented contact information received and attempt to contact the mobile device of the candidate.
- the candidate will correspond to a node of the association map 200 and will have a probability of being in proximity to Allen Jones.

- FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a method of operation of a server that creates an association map in accordance with various embodiments.
- a method of operation of the server 140 begins in block 801 as shown.
- the server 140 checks a relevant mobile device for data collection permission settings. These data collection permission settings may be stored in memory of the particular mobile device.
- server 140 also has access to a collection of privacy rules (not shown) which may also be stored in the database 160 or may be stored in another remote database within the network 150 , or within the respective mobile device.
- the mobile device 110 and each of the mobile devices of the group of mobile devices 130 , may have associated privacy rules in the remote database. These user privacy settings control how information is gathered and accessed on each of the particular mobile devices and may be settable by the mobile device users in some embodiments. Therefore as shown in decision block 805 , the server 140 checks the privacy rules, for the specific user corresponding to the mobile device, to see if the data collection operation about to be performed is in compliance with the privacy rules for that user. If the privacy rules are violated in decision block 805 , then the method of operation ends as shown in block 825 .
- the server 140 proceeds with the method of operation and may obtain various information such as location data in block 807 , call logs in block 809 , user histories in block 811 , local contact lists in block 813 such as those stored in memory of the mobile device, social networking contact lists in block 815 , calendar entries in block 817 and device sensor data in block 819 .

In order to accomplish this, the association mapping logic 173 may apply weighting factors as shown block 821 . That is, based on the collected data, some factors may increase certain probabilities over others. As shown in block 823 , the association mapping logic 173 then creates the association map node for the user and for the particular mobile station from which data is being collected. The process then ends as shown in block 825 .
- FIG. 9 and FIG. 10 provide further details of a method of operations of a server in accordance with various embodiments.
- a method of operation begins in block 901 .
- the contact finder 170 begins to monitor specific mobile devices for call attempts as shown in input block 903 .
- the contact finder 170 may obtain called number contact information from various mobile devices.
- mobile device 110 contact tracker 100 has an association map updater 106 component that may monitor various information of the mobile device 110 and send those information updates to the contact finder 170 on server 140 .
- FIG. 9 provides further details of a method of operations of a server in accordance with various embodiments.
- a call attempt made by the mobile device will result in the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 obtaining the called number contact information by, for example, communicating with dialer 112 . Therefore in block 905 , the contact finder 170 obtains the called number contact information from the mobile device by communicating with contact tracker 100 . The server 140 may then monitor whether the call is successful as shown in decision block 907 . If the call is successful in decision block 907 , such as what when the called party answers the call, then the method of operation ends in block 931 as shown.
- the contact finder 170 receives information from the corresponding mobile device to that effect and deems the call to be not successful in decision block 907 .
- the contact finder 170 may communicate with the contact tracker 100 of the mobile device to notify the user and to request permission to proceed with the search as shown in block 909 .
- An example of such notification message was illustrated in FIG. 4B as notification message 427 which notifies the user of mobile device 110 the call attempt was unanswered or was redirected to voicemail and requests the user's permission to continue to locate the called party. If the user permission is granted in decision block 911 , then the searching routine 175 initiates a search of the association map 200 as shown in block 913 .
- the searching routine 175 will determine initial search criteria such as, but not limited to, the current date, current time and possibly other information that may be relevant to finding an association map 200 node that may be within proximity of the called party.
- the searching routine 175 proceeds to search for associated contacts in proximity to the called party in block 917 . Further details of block 917 are shown in FIG. 10 .
- the contact finder 170 receives user permission to locate the called party, and in block 1003 proceeds to initiate a search of the association map.
- the searching routine 175 may initially establish a contact category for the called party as shown in 1005 . This categorization procedure was discussed above previously with respect to FIG. 2 where the association map 200 included various categorizations and time associations such as the time association 209 and the family association 207 , etc. That is, the searching routine 175 will go through the various decision blocks shown in FIG. 10 to determine whether the called party is a family member as an 1007 , the coworker as in 1009 , a business contact as in 1011 , a social contact is in 1013 or some other generally known contact as in 1015 .
- the method of operation proceeds to block 1019 and the searching routine 175 identifies and accesses any relevant directories for the specific category. For example if the called party is determined to be a coworker in decision block 1009 , the searching routine 175 may look for databases related to the employer that may have information related to that coworker beyond what is already known from contact lists or call logs of the mobile device 110 . If none of the decision blocks provide a positive categorization, the method of operation proceeds to decision block 1017 which decides if the called party is contained within the association map 200 at all. If not, then the searching routine 175 will notify the user that data is not available as shown in block 1031 and the method of operation returns to block 919 of FIG. 9 .
- the searching routine 175 searches through the association map 200 and attempts to identify associations between the called party the caller, and other parties based on the date, time of day, and other criteria that may be predefined, etc. and attempts to locate nodes in the association map 200 corresponding to persons who may be within proximity of the called party.
- proximity refers to physical proximity meaning that the candidate person identified by the searching routine 175 has a probability of being physically near the called party and having a mobile device that is operative such that the caller may call the candidates mobile device and attempts to reach the original called party.
- the searching routine 175 establishes the candidate list in block 1025 .
- the searching routine 175 may check or verify location information for each of the candidates of the candidate list as shown in block 1027 . That is, those candidates who have contact tracker 100 components on their corresponding mobile devices will be able to send location information in some scenarios to the contact finder 170 . In such cases, proximity is more readily verified if location available is likewise available for the called party.
- the contact finder 170 may also check candidate device sensor data, as shown in block 1029 , to determine the environment in which the candidate device is situated, and possibly to determine settings of the corresponding mobile device.
- the searching routine 175 may determine that a certain candidate is within proximity of the called party, but may also determine by obtained sensor data that the candidate's mobile device is set to silent mode. In this case, the searching routine 175 would not consider that candidate to be a viable option for contacting the called party since the candidate's device is likewise unable to inform the candidate that a call attempt is being made. If no other contacts are identified in the decision block 1023 , then the method of operation again returns to block 1031 and notifies the user that data is not available.
- the contact finder 170 method of operation enters into a loop operation as shown in block 919 where a number of candidates determined previously in block 917 is designated as index “N.”
- the looping operation continues provided that the number of candidates, index “N,” and is greater than or equal to one.
- the searching routine 175 may apply the weighting factors that were discussed above to determine the candidate contact with the highest probability of being within proximity to the originally called party. Privacy rules may again be checked for compliance is shown in decision block 923 and if any particular candidate should not be contacted due to privacy rule compliance then the candidate is removed from the contact candidate list as shown in block 925 . The index and is then decremented by a factor of one as shown in block 927 .
- the method of operation ends as shown in block 931 .
- N is greater than, or equal to, one the looping operation of block 919 continues. Therefore, at least one candidate contact is selected from the list of candidate contacts and, if privacy rules are complied with in decision block 923 , the searching routine 175 will send the contact information for the highest probability as shown block 933 , and the method of operation ends in block 931 .
- the user of the corresponding mobile device that is, the caller may then attempt to contact the candidate contact in an attempt to reach the original called party.

FIG. 10 is a flow chart providing further details of the method of operation illustrated inFIG. 9 . - The present disclosure provides a method of operation that includes detecting that a first call placed by a caller using a first mobile device to a called party using a second mobile device was not answered by the called party using the second mobile device. The method of operation includes determining at least one candidate contact with a third mobile device who has an association with the called party and a probability of being in proximity to the called party at the time of the first call. A second call may then be placed using the first mobile device to call the third mobile device.
- The method may also include determining the association of the at least one candidate contact with the called party, and determining the probability that the at least one candidate is in proximity to the called party at the time of the first call. This may be accomplished by generating a list of candidate contacts from an association map, where each of the candidates has an association with the called party. Based on the association, at least one candidate contact is determined that has a probability of being in proximity to the called the called party at the time of the first call. The association may be made based on at least one of calendar information, history of communication with the called party, or location information collected from the third mobile device.
- The method may include determining at least one candidate from the list of candidate contacts that has the highest probability of being in proximity to the called party. In some embodiments the method may include obtaining location information from the third mobile device of the at least one candidate selected from the list of candidates, and determining that the location information is for a location that is in proximity to the called party at the time of the first call.
- The method may include generating the association map by creating a group of association map nodes where each node corresponds to a contact in the association map. The method may include generating the association map by accessing information on at least one mobile device for each node of the association map. The accessed information may be call logs, user history, contact lists stored on the mobile device, social networking contact lists, calendar entries, sensor data, or location data.
- Generating the association map may include categorizing various contacts corresponding to each node of the association map and creating associations for each node based on the categorizations. For example, contacts corresponding to each node may be categorized as a family member, coworker, business contact, or social contact. Various time associations may also be created between the various contacts or nodes.
- In one disclosed embodiment, a mobile device is operative to perform the various disclosed methods and includes a dialer, operatively coupled to at least one communication transceiver, and a contact tracker, operatively coupled to the dialer. The contract tracker is operative to perform the various disclosed methods of operation.
- A system is also disclosed that includes a server operatively coupled to a database. The database contains an association map that has various nodes. Each node corresponds to a contact and has at least one association with a different node. The associations define, among other things, relationship categories such as, but not limited to, family member, coworker, business contact, or social contact. The associations may also include location information, time and date for at least one node. The system includes a mobile device that is operatively coupled to the server. The mobile device includes a dialer, operatively coupled to at least one communication transceiver and a contact tracker, operatively coupled to the dialer. The contract tracker can detect that a first call placed by a caller using a first mobile device to a called party using a second mobile device was not answered by the called party using the second mobile device. The contact tracker then obtains, from the server, at least one candidate contact having a third mobile device, an association with the called party, and a probability of being in proximity to the called party at the time of the first call, and places a second call to the third mobile device.
- Turning now to the drawings wherein like numerals represent like components,
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system that includes amobile device 110 havingcontact tracker 100 and communicating with aserver 140 in accordance with an embodiment. Theserver 140 may be a cloud-based server and is accessible via anetwork 150 which may be, for example, the Internet or some other IP-based network. Theserver 140 may either include, or be operatively coupled to, adatabase 160 which contains anassociation map 200 in accordance with an embodiment. Themobile device 110 may communicate with various other mobile devices such as the group ofmobile devices 130. The group ofmobile devices 130 includes at leastmobile devices mobile device 130 may communicate with theserver 140 to send various update information and other information. For example, theserver 140 may collect location information, environment sensor information, application state or usage data, device state, or other information, from the group ofmobile devices 130. Each mobile device of the group ofmobile devices 130, and themobile device 110, have an account with theserver 140 and may login to theserver 140 either by user action or by an automatic login feature of a corresponding contact tracker operating on the respective mobile device. For example,mobile device 110 includes thecontact tracker 100 which may automatically, and from time to time, log into theserver 140 to provide certain information. Additionally, thecontact tracker 100 may inform theserver 140 of various actions taken by themobile device 110. In one example, themobile device 110 may place a call over awireless communication channel 121 through the wide area network (WAN) 120 in an attempt to contact a called party who is a owns, or uses, a mobile device of the group ofmobile devices 130. For example, the caller (i.e., user or owner of mobile device 110) may try to callmobile device 132. Previously, or in the interim, themobile device 132 may have sentinformation 135 to theserver 140. Likewisemobile device 131 may have sentinformation 134 toserver 140, andmobile device 133 may have sentinformation 136 toserver 140. For example,mobile device 131 may usewireless communication channel 123 to communicate with theserver 140. The information being sent may include location information, device state information, environment sensor information, application state or usage data, or any other type of information, etc. regarding the specific mobile device. - When the
mobile device 110 places the call through theWAN 120, thecontact tracker 100 may intercept information related to the call attempt and sendcall attempt information 101 to theserver 140. Theserver 140 may then monitor themobile device 110 actions using thecontact tracker 100 to determine if the call was successful or not. That is, if the call tomobile device 132 goes unanswered or is redirected to a voicemail server, thecontact tracker 100 may detect this by interfacing with various components or circuitry of themobile device 110. Themobile device 110 will inform theserver 140 which may, in response, sendaugmented contact information 103 that may be used to redirect the call to another mobile device of the group ofmobile devices 130. In one use case example, the called party may havemobile device 132 turned off or set to silent mode such that the called party is unable to detect the incoming call onmobile device 132. However, theserver 140 will be able to determine whether one of the other mobile devices of the group ofmobile devices 130 is within proximity ofmobile device 132 and, correspondingly, in proximity to the called party. For example,mobile device 131 may be in proximity tomobile device 132. Theserver 140 analyzes anassociation map 200 contained in thedatabase 160 and determines an association between the called party who owns or usesmobile device 132, and the owner or user ofmobile device 131. Theserver 140 may also determine associations between other mobile devices of the group ofmobile devices 130 and betweenmobile device 110. Based on the association or associations determined using theassociation map 200, and other information including probability calculations, theserver 140 may determine thatmobile device 131 may be useful for contacting the called party who owns or usesmobile device 132. Theserver 140 will then proceed to sendaugmented contact information 103 to thecontact tracker 100 which may then be displayed to the user onmobile device 110. That is, the user may be notified of an alternative approach to contacting the called party. - The terms “user” and “caller” as used herein refer to an owner or user of a mobile device who initiates a call or messaging operation to a called party using the respective mobile device. The “called party” as used herein refers to the person being contacted and may be an owner or user of another mobile device, such as one (or more) of the mobile devices of the group of
mobile devices 130 shown in theFIG. 1 example. Thus, in the example under discussion, the user ofmobile device 110 who is the caller may use theaugmented contact information 103 to callmobile device 131 in the caller's attempts to reach the called party. Themobile device 131 however may be owned or used by another person other than the called party. Such other person is referred to herein as a “candidate contact” and has been determined by theserver 140 to have a probability of being in within proximity of the called party. - With respect to communication between the various mobile devices and the
server 140, theWAN 120 may be connected to thenetwork 150 by abackhaul connection 151 such that themobile device 110 and the group ofmobile devices 130 may communicate with theserver 140 and thecorresponding network 150 using thewide area network 120. However, themobile device 110 and group ofmobile devices 130 may use any other suitable wireless or other network to communicate withnetwork 150 and theserver 140. -
FIG. 2 is diagram representing anassociation map 200 in accordance with an embodiment. Among other things, theassociation map 200 creates time associations between various nodes contained in the association map. Each node of the association map corresponds to a person who may, or may not be a contact of any other person corresponding to a node. For example, the caller will have anode 201 on theassociation map 200 and the called party may have anode 213 on theassociation map 200. Various intervening nodes, such asnode 203, may correspond to persons known or unknown to the caller or the called party. Theserver 140 periodically updates theassociation map 200 to create categories, time associations, and other associations such that various nodes may be determined to have a probability of being within proximity of one another at given points or periods of time. Put another way, the nodes correspond to contacts that may be used as intermediary contacts between the caller and the called party, depending upon the various associations that may exist between the nodes. Such intermediary contacts may be candidates at any given time based on various factors such as, but not limited to, the candidate's proximity to a called party. - The time associations and other associations may thus be used by the
server 140 to provide augmented contact information to themobile device 110, viacontact tracker 100. The augmented contact information will correspond to one of the nodes of theassociation map 200 that may increase the probability of contacting a called party even when the called party is unreachable via their own mobile device. The called party may be unreachable due to any number of reasons such as their respective mobile device being turned off, out of battery power, or in a mode setting that does not allow the called party to detect an incoming call. - Although the
association map 200 shown inFIG. 2 appears in the figure as a two-dimensional object, theassociation map 200 may have any number of dimensions mathematically and may therefore be viewed as a multidimensional graphical representation. The multidimensional aspect may be achieved through the use of various vectors and matrices to create relationships between the various nodes. Put another way, the various nodes may be related via various categories such as, but not limited to, contact type, physical location or proximity, and time. Theassociation map 200 is dynamic in that it may change with time as is updated by theserver 140 periodically as theserver 140 obtains information updates from themobile device 110 and from the group ofmobile devices 130. - In
FIG. 2 , the dotted line portions represent various possible categorizations or groupings which are types of associations and that may be used to determine other associations. For example, thecaller node 201 may be contained within thetime association 209 which includes various nodes as shown at some particular interval or point of time. Overlapping with thetime association 209 may be another association such asfamily association 207 which includes family members of the caller corresponding tocaller node 201. Thecaller node 201 may also be included in acoworkers association 205. Theassociation map 200 may make other associations that do not overlap at a particular time such asfriends association 211 which, in this example, includes the calledparty node 213. - As an example, if the called party corresponding to
caller node 201 attempted to contact a called party corresponding to calledparty node 213 and the call was unsuccessful, theserver 140 searches theassociation map 200 to locate another node which represents a person having an association with the called party and who has a probability of being in proximity to the called party corresponding tonode 213. Referring to the example discussed above with respect toFIG. 1 , if one of the group ofmobile devices 130 is used or owned by one of the candidate contacts corresponding to anassociation map 200 node, then theserver 140 may inform thecontact tracker 100 of the mobile telephone number of the mobile device corresponding to the node. That is, provided that the mobile device relates to a person who has a high probability of being within proximity of the called party. Theassociation map 200 is created by theserver 140 by collecting information from the various mobile devices and searching through various other sources of information as will be described in detail herein. - A partial schematic block diagram of the
mobile device 110 andserver 140 is provided inFIG. 3 . In accordance with various embodiments, themobile device 110 includes acontact tracker 100. Thecontact tracker 100 may be composed of various components such asserver communication logic 105,association map updater 106, outgoing call/message interceptor 107, andredirector 108. Thecontact tracker 100 or any of its components may be implemented independently as software and/or firmware executing on one or more programmable processors (including CPUs and/or GPUs), and may also include, or may be implemented independently, using ASICs, DSPs, hardwired circuitry (logic circuitry), or combinations thereof. That is, thecontact tracker 100 may be implemented using an ASIC, DSP, executable code executing on a processor, logic circuitry, or combinations thereof. Thecontact tracker 100 or any of its components may be referred to as “logic” herein and may be implemented in any of the various ways described above in accordance with various embodiments. - The various components of the
contact tracker 100 are operatively coupled to one another as shown bycommunication path 109. Thecommunication path 109 may be implemented by a communication bus in some embodiments or, in other embodiments, may be implemented by software coupling. As used herein the term “software coupling” refers to application programming interfaces (APIs) or libraries that facilitate sharing of information, receiving or sending commands, etc., in order to facilitate operations and functionality between the various components when such components are implemented as software or firmware. Additionally, thecontact tracker 100 may communicate with various components or applications of themobile device 110 using other appropriate operative coupling such as software coupling. For example, the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may communicate withdialer 112, and one ormore messaging applications 113, using therespective communication paths redirector 108 may communicate with thedialer 112 andmessaging applications 113 viacommunication paths - As described with respect to
FIG. 1 , thecontact tracker 100 communicates with theserver 140, which may be a cloud server, and which may be located within thenetwork 150 which may be the Internet or some other IP-based network. Theserver 140, in accordance with embodiments, includescontact finder 170. The communication between thecontact tracker 100 and theserver 140 may be accomplished by acommunication channel 125, which may be a bidirectional wireless channel through theWAN 120, or which may be “connectionless” such as an Internet Protocol (IP) connection provided by theWAN 120, or some other suitable network, in some embodiments. - The
contact finder 170 may be implemented as software or firmware executing on at least one processor of theserver 140 and may include the componentsmobile communication logic 171,association mapping logic 173 and at least one searchingroutine 175. Themobile communication logic 171 is operatively coupled to theassociation mapping logic 173 bycommunication path 177 which may be facilitated by software coupling. Likewise the mobile communication logic is operatively coupled to the searching routine 175 bycommunication path 178 which may be facilitated by software coupling. Thecontact finder 170 is also operatively coupled to thedatabase 160 which contains theassociation map 200 as was discussed above. An operative coupling between theserver 140,contact finder 170 and thedatabase 160 is accomplished bycommunication path 176 which may be, or may include, software coupling. The software coupling provides access to thedatabase 160association map 200 by theassociation mapping logic 173 and the searching routine 175. The searching routine 175 may use various algorithms such as, but not limited to, Dijkstra's algorithm or other appropriate algorithms to search through theassociation map 200 nodes and establish paths through the various associations. The software coupling overcommunication path 176 may be accomplished using libraries or APIs or may include database interoperation interfaces such as but not limited to SQL or any other suitable database protocol or interface. In embodiments where thecloud server 140 is a cloud based server, thecontact finder 170 or any of the components shown inFIG. 3 may be distributed among various cloud servers. Similarly, thedatabase 160 and theassociation map 200 may be distributed among various cloud based database servers in some embodiments. - The
mobile device 110 includes adialer 112 and one ormore messaging applications 113 that are operatively coupled bycommunication path 119 to one ormore communication transceivers 111, one of which is operative to establishcommunication channel 125. Theserver communication logic 105 is operatively coupled to the one ormore communication transceivers 111 bycommunication path 114, and communicates withmobile communication logic 171 over thecommunication channel 125. Themobile device 110 uses thedialer 112 to receive the caller's entered digits to place a call or may use the one ormore messaging applications 113 to send messages such as text messages to a called party. - The
contact tracker 100 may detect that an outgoing call is being made when the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 detects digits being entered by the user (i.e. the caller) viadialer 112 over thecommunication path 115. The outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may then provide the dialed digits or other information to theserver communication logic 105 for transmission to theserver 140 using thecommunication transceivers 111 andwireless communication channel 125. Themobile communication logic 171 of thecontact finder 170 receives the information sent by thecontact tracker 100 and takes appropriate action. The outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may also make a determination of whether the mobile device that was called using thedialer 112 answered the call such that the call was a successful call. That is, the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may make a determination of whether the called mobile device answered the call and established a communication channel with themobile device 110, whether a ring back signal was received and call continued to go unanswered by the called mobile device, or whether the call was directed to a voicemail server. Any one of those events may be considered an unsuccessful call. - In that case, the outgoing call/
message interceptor 107 will send notification to thecontact finder 170 via theserver communication logic 105. The notification will be received by themobile communication logic 171 and thecontact finder 170 will take appropriate action. That is, for an unsuccessful call, thecontact finder 170 will invoke the searching routine 175 which will search theassociation map 200 in thedatabase 160 to determine a candidate (that is, an alternative mobile device for an alternative called party) that the caller may attempt to contact so as to locate the initial called party who did not respond to the call. The searching routine 175 determines one or more nodes of theassociation map 200 that are candidates based on various factors and probability calculations and provides at least one candidate having a highest probability of being in proximity to the called party or, in some embodiments, the called party's mobile device. After the highest probability candidate is determined, themobile communication logic 171 will transmit augmented contact information over thewireless communication channel 125 to themobile device 110. The augmented contact information will be received by thecontact tracker 100, viaserver communication logic 105, which will then be provided viacommunication path 109 toredirector 108.Redirector 108 may then interact with thedialer 112 over thecommunication path 116 or may interact withmessaging applications 113 over thecommunication path 118. Theredirector 108 may attempt to establish a new, second call with the candidate, or in some embodiments may send a text message to the candidate. In some embodiments, the caller (i.e. themobile device 110 user) may be provided notification of the candidate and given a choice as to whether to proceed to contact the candidate or not. In this case theredirector 108 will wait to receive permission from the caller to proceed with attempting to contact the candidate. - The diagrams of
FIG. 4A andFIG. 4B are helpful for understanding various use cases and interactions between theserver 140 and various mobile devices. Among other things,FIG. 4A illustrates further details of operation of theassociation map updater 106 and theassociation mapping logic 173 which resides onserver 140. Themobile device 110 inFIG. 4A is shown displaying acall log 403 which displays a list of incoming, outgoing and missed calls. The example call log 403 lists various contact names and associated indicators such asincoming call indicator 407,outgoing call indicator 409 and missedcall indicator 413. The call log 403 entries may also show adate 405 and possibly a time such that the user ofmobile device 110 knows when calls were placed, received, or missed. As is known to those of ordinary skill, the user ofmobile device 110 may position acursor 411 with respect to a desired entry in thecall log 403 and may initiate a call directly from thecall log 403. For example, the user may positioncursor 411 over the contact “Allen Jones” and may make a selection such that thedialer 112 initiates a call to Allen Jones. Thedialer 112 will then interact with thecommunication transceivers 111 overcommunication path 119 to establish a wireless communicationchannel using WAN 120, or some other appropriate network, and will attempt to place a call to the appropriate mobile device of the called party Allen Jones. - As was discussed with respect to
FIG. 1 , callattempt information 101 is transmitted by thecontact tracker 100 to theserver 140 which is used by thecontact finder 170. In one example, thecontact finder 170 extracts the contact information for Allen Jones and creates a corresponding node in theassociation map 200. Theassociation map updater 106 component of thecontact tracker 100 may access various resources to provide further information regarding the association of Allen Jones to the caller. For example, theassociation map updater 106 may interact withcontact list 415,calendar application 417,social media application 419,various sensors 421 of themobile device 110 that sense the environment, orvarious call logs 423 such as thecall log 403. If any data entries or other references to the called party Allen Jones are identified by theassociation map updater 106, that information will be sent asupdates 406 to theserver 140, more specifically to theassociation mapping logic 173 ofcontact finder 170. - The
association mapping logic 173 will accordingly update or modify theassociation map 200. Returning to the example briefly mentioned above where the caller usesmobile device 110 to place a call to Allen Jones using the call log 403 entry, thecontact finder 170 waits to determine whether the call is successful or unsuccessful. If the call is determined to be unsuccessful, the searching routine 175 proceeds to search theassociation map 200 to determine a candidate (i.e. an alternative contact) who may be in proximity to Allen Jones. If an appropriate candidate is identified by the searching routine 175, then thecontact finder 170 sends augmented contact information, which may be considered call redirect information, to themobile device 110. - The
contact tracker 100 receives the augmented contact information and may provide, in some embodiments, thenotification message 427 to the user ofmobile device 110. Thenotification message 427 queries the user as to whether thecontact tracker 100 should continue to locate Allen Jones, since the original call attempt was unanswered or went to voicemail and was therefore deemed unsuccessful by thecontact finder 170. The user may select “NO” in which case the process ends, or the user may select “YES” in which case theredirector 108 will use the augmented contact information received and attempt to contact the mobile device of the candidate. As discussed above the candidate will correspond to a node of theassociation map 200 and will have a probability of being in proximity to Allen Jones. -
FIG. 5 is another partial schematic block diagram of amobile device 110 in accordance with some embodiments.FIG. 3 , which was described above, andFIG. 5 are partial schematic block diagrams of mobile devices and servers that are examples of apparatuses in accordance with various embodiments.FIG. 3 andFIG. 5 provide examples of mobile devices and servers for the purpose of describing to those of ordinary skill how to make and use the disclosed subject matter by way of various embodiments. It is to be understood that these figures provide partial schematic block diagrams in that, although the diagrams show at least those components necessary to describe the features and advantages of the various embodiments to those of ordinary skill, various other components, circuitry, and devices may be necessary in order to implement a complete functional apparatus such as the example mobile devices, and example servers, and that those various other components, circuitry, devices, etc., even though not shown, are understood to be present by those of ordinary skill. - Thus, the partial schematic block diagram of
FIG. 5 illustrates an example embodiment ofmobile device 110 where thecontact tracker 100 is implemented as executable code executed by aprocessor 501. The executable code corresponding to thecontact tracker 100 may be stored in non-volatile, non-transitory memory such asmemory 511 as shown, and read frommemory 511 as needed for execution byprocessor 501. Further, thecontact tracker 100 may be executed as part of asoftware stack 502. Thecontact tracker 100 may include theserver communication logic 105,association map updater 106, outgoing call/message interceptor 107 andredirector 108, which provide features and functions as were discussed above with respect toFIG. 3 . In some embodiments, some of the components attributed to theserver 140 inFIG. 3 may be included in thecontact tracker 100. These components include theassociation mapping logic 173 and the searching routine 175 which are represented using dotted lines to illustrate that they may be present in thecontact tracker 100, or remotely on a server as shown inFIG. 3 . Likewise, the association map may be stored in themobile device 110, or may be distributed with a portion stored on themobile device 110 and a portion stored remotely. Each of the components shown inFIG. 5 have corresponding executable code, within thecontact tracker 100 executable code stored inmemory 511, and such executable code is also executed by theprocessor 501 in accordance with the example embodiment ofFIG. 5 . Thecontact tracker 100 may also communicate and interact with one ormore applications 503 which are also executed by theprocessor 501, or with other components ofmobile device 110. Theapplications 503 may also be stored as executable code (not shown) inmemory 511. The various components ofcontact tracker 100 are each operatively coupled to each other bycommunication path 109 which is software coupling in this example, and each of the components may also communicate with various application programming interfaces (APIs) 504 for interfacing and communicating with one or more of theapplications 503. Some of theapplications 503 that thecontact tracker 100 may interface with through theAPIs 504 include, but are not limited to, acalendar application 417, asocial media application 419, adialer 112, and amessaging application 113. - The
mobile device 110 is one kind of apparatus in accordance with an embodiment and includesconnection bus 505 to provide operative coupling between various components including the at least oneprocessor 501,memory 511, communication transceivers 111 (which includenetwork transceiver 507 and peer-to-peer transceiver 509), display/GUI 513,other UI 515,sensor hub 517, etc. Theconnection bus 505 provides operative coupling in that various intermediate or interveningmobile device 110 components, circuitry, and the like, may exist in between, and/or along, the communication path between any two or more operatively coupled components, etc. - It is to be understood that
FIG. 5 illustrates examples of components that may be present in amobile device 110 and that one or more of the various components shown inFIG. 5 , other than thecontact tracker 100, may be omitted from themobile device 110 without detracting from enjoyment of the benefits, features and advantages of the present disclosure. That is, different mobile devices may or may not include some of the example components shown inFIG. 5 and therefore none of these example components are to be construed as being required for any particular embodiment. - The display/
GUI 513, if present, may provide a touchscreen user interface and, in some embodiments, may also provide a graphical user interface (GUI). Thenetwork transceiver 507, if present, may provide wireless communication capabilities for one or more wide area network communications systems such as, but not limited to, Wi-Fi cellular, 2G, 3G or 4G wireless communications systems. The peer-to-peer transceiver 509, if present, may provide wireless connectivity capabilities such as, but not limited to, Bluetooth™, Wireless USB, ZigBee, or other technologies, etc. such as near field communication (NFC). Theother UI 515, if present, may include a track ball mouse, etc., and may communicate withsensor hub 517. Thesensor hub 517 includescommunication bus 518 and provides interfaces for a group ofsensors 421 that may include touch sensitive elements, physical switches, gyroscopic position sensors, accelerometers, thermometers, etc. The display/GUI 513, if present, may include touchscreen functionality as noted above, and may be operative to receive command and control signals from theother UI 515 directly, or via theprocessor 501, of viasensor hub 517, for functions such as, but not limited to, mouse cursor control click to provide selection input and or drag and drop features or other functionality in some embodiments. - The
memory 511 is a non-volatile, non-transitory memory, and stores the executable code corresponding to thecontact tracker 100 including any component logic. Theprocessor 501 is operative to execute the executable code, which may be stored inmemory 511, to perform the methods of operation disclosed herein. - The various embodiments also include non-volatile, non-transitory computer readable memory, other than
memory 511, that may contain executable instructions or executable code, for execution by at least one processor, that when executed, cause the at least one processor to operate in accordance with the functionality and methods of operation herein described for either a mobile device, a server, or both. The computer readable memory may be any suitable non-volatile, non-transitory, memory such as, but not limited to, programmable chips such as EEPROMS, flash ROM (thumb drives), compact discs (CDs) digital video disks (DVDs), etc., that may be used to load executable instructions or program code to other processing devices such as mobile devices, servers or other devices such as those that may benefit from the features of the herein described embodiments. -
FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a high level method of operation of a mobile device in accordance with various embodiments. Referring to the example of amobile device 110 shown inFIG. 5 , the method of operation begins inblock 601, and themobile device 110 records state information as shown inblock 603. For examplemobile device 110 may collect information from the group ofsensors 421 which are operatively coupled bycommunication bus 518 to thesensor hub 517. In addition to the possible sensors noted above, thesensors 421 may include, but are not limited to, a light sensor, temperature sensor, gyroscopic position sensor, infrared LED touch sensor, capacitive touch sensor, accelerometer, ambient audio sensor, or any other type of sensor from which environment data may be collected. Theassociation map updater 106 may be responsible for collecting the environmental sensor information and may either transmit raw sensor information or may perform some analysis on the sensor information prior to transmitting it to theserver 140. For example, theassociation map updater 106 may apply certain algorithms to the environment sensor information and make determinations as to whether themobile device 110 is in motion, in a vehicle, in a high noise environment, on a train or some other form of transportation that has a certain associated known vibration or movement pattern, or some other processing on the data to augment it prior to sending it to the server. In other embodiments, theserver 140 will receive raw data and perform any such necessary processing accordingly. In addition to environment information collected through thesensor hub 517, theassociation map updater 106 may also collect location information fromlocation detection 519 or from the nearfield proximity detection 521 in some embodiments. All of the information collected will be used by theserver 140 to make some determination as to the state and location ofmobile device 110, in conjunction with theassociation map 200, and will determine what other nodes in theassociation map 200 may be in proximity to themobile device 110 at any given period of time. - Thus as shown in
block 605,association map updater 106 will provide the state information toserver 140.Blocks dialer 112 receiving a selection of new dialed digits in order to place a call. That is, the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 may receive the input for the caller messaging attempt from either thedialer 112 ormessaging application 113, inblock 607 using an appropriate one of theAPIs 504, and may provide the received input toserver 140 is shown inblock 609. If the call is unsuccessful as was discussed above,server 140 will send augmented contact information to themobile device 110. As shown inblock 611,contact tracker 100 may receive the augmented contact information from theserver 140. As shown inblock 613, theredirector 108 may proceed with the call to the high probability candidate or may attempt to contact the high probability candidate using messaging based on the received augmented contact information. The method of operation then ends inblock 615 as shown. -
FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating a high level method of operation of a server in accordance with various embodiments. Referring to theserver 140 shown inFIG. 3 , the method of operation begins inblock 701 as shown and themobile communication logic 171 receives call attempt information inblock 703. The call attempt information may be detected by the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 inmobile device 110 and sent to theserver 140. The searching routine 175 then determines a relationship or association of the called party with the caller is shown inblock 705. This is done by searching theassociation map 200 as was discussed above. Searching routine 175 also determines relationships or associations of the called party to other parties, which correspond to other nodes in theassociation map 200, as shown inblock 707. Then, inblock 709, the searching routine 175 uses theassociation map 200 to determine how to contact the called party by using a mobile device of an associated contact (i.e. a candidate) from theassociation map 200. Theserver 140 provides augmented contact information with the appropriate information for that contact to the caller as shownblock 711. The method of operation ends as shown inblock 713. -
FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a method of operation of a server that creates an association map in accordance with various embodiments. With reference to theserver 140 shown inFIG. 3 , a method of operation of theserver 140 begins inblock 801 as shown. Inblock 803, theserver 140 checks a relevant mobile device for data collection permission settings. These data collection permission settings may be stored in memory of the particular mobile device. In addition to theassociation map 200 which is stored in thedatabase 160,server 140 also has access to a collection of privacy rules (not shown) which may also be stored in thedatabase 160 or may be stored in another remote database within thenetwork 150, or within the respective mobile device. Themobile device 110, and each of the mobile devices of the group ofmobile devices 130, may have associated privacy rules in the remote database. These user privacy settings control how information is gathered and accessed on each of the particular mobile devices and may be settable by the mobile device users in some embodiments. Therefore as shown indecision block 805, theserver 140 checks the privacy rules, for the specific user corresponding to the mobile device, to see if the data collection operation about to be performed is in compliance with the privacy rules for that user. If the privacy rules are violated indecision block 805, then the method of operation ends as shown inblock 825. However if the privacy rules are complied with indecision block 805, then theserver 140 proceeds with the method of operation and may obtain various information such as location data inblock 807, call logs inblock 809, user histories inblock 811, local contact lists inblock 813 such as those stored in memory of the mobile device, social networking contact lists inblock 815, calendar entries inblock 817 and device sensor data inblock 819. Theassociation mapping logic 173 will then analyze the data before determining the position of the node corresponding to the mobile device within theassociation map 200. In order to accomplish this, theassociation mapping logic 173 may apply weighting factors as shownblock 821. That is, based on the collected data, some factors may increase certain probabilities over others. As shown inblock 823, theassociation mapping logic 173 then creates the association map node for the user and for the particular mobile station from which data is being collected. The process then ends as shown inblock 825. -
FIG. 9 andFIG. 10 provide further details of a method of operations of a server in accordance with various embodiments. Referring again to theserver 140 shown inFIG. 3 which has thecorresponding contact finder 170, a method of operation begins inblock 901. Thecontact finder 170 begins to monitor specific mobile devices for call attempts as shown ininput block 903. Inblock 905, thecontact finder 170 may obtain called number contact information from various mobile devices. For example, as was discussed above previously,mobile device 110contact tracker 100 has anassociation map updater 106 component that may monitor various information of themobile device 110 and send those information updates to thecontact finder 170 onserver 140. In the example method of operation provided inFIG. 9 , a call attempt made by the mobile device will result in the outgoing call/message interceptor 107 obtaining the called number contact information by, for example, communicating withdialer 112. Therefore inblock 905, thecontact finder 170 obtains the called number contact information from the mobile device by communicating withcontact tracker 100. Theserver 140 may then monitor whether the call is successful as shown indecision block 907. If the call is successful indecision block 907, such as what when the called party answers the call, then the method of operation ends inblock 931 as shown. However, when a ring back signal persists at the mobile device or when the call is routed to a voicemail server, thecontact finder 170 receives information from the corresponding mobile device to that effect and deems the call to be not successful indecision block 907. - In some embodiments, the
contact finder 170 may communicate with thecontact tracker 100 of the mobile device to notify the user and to request permission to proceed with the search as shown inblock 909. An example of such notification message was illustrated inFIG. 4B asnotification message 427 which notifies the user ofmobile device 110 the call attempt was unanswered or was redirected to voicemail and requests the user's permission to continue to locate the called party. If the user permission is granted indecision block 911, then the searching routine 175 initiates a search of theassociation map 200 as shown inblock 913. Inblock 915, the searching routine 175 will determine initial search criteria such as, but not limited to, the current date, current time and possibly other information that may be relevant to finding anassociation map 200 node that may be within proximity of the called party. The searching routine 175 proceeds to search for associated contacts in proximity to the called party inblock 917. Further details ofblock 917 are shown inFIG. 10 . - In
block 1001 ofFIG. 10 , thecontact finder 170 receives user permission to locate the called party, and inblock 1003 proceeds to initiate a search of the association map. The searching routine 175 may initially establish a contact category for the called party as shown in 1005. This categorization procedure was discussed above previously with respect toFIG. 2 where theassociation map 200 included various categorizations and time associations such as thetime association 209 and thefamily association 207, etc. That is, the searching routine 175 will go through the various decision blocks shown inFIG. 10 to determine whether the called party is a family member as an 1007, the coworker as in 1009, a business contact as in 1011, a social contact is in 1013 or some other generally known contact as in 1015. For a positive result to any of the these decision blocks, the method of operation proceeds to block 1019 and the searching routine 175 identifies and accesses any relevant directories for the specific category. For example if the called party is determined to be a coworker indecision block 1009, the searching routine 175 may look for databases related to the employer that may have information related to that coworker beyond what is already known from contact lists or call logs of themobile device 110. If none of the decision blocks provide a positive categorization, the method of operation proceeds todecision block 1017 which decides if the called party is contained within theassociation map 200 at all. If not, then the searching routine 175 will notify the user that data is not available as shown inblock 1031 and the method of operation returns to block 919 ofFIG. 9 . However, if the called party is contained within theassociation map 200, in other words if a corresponding node exists in theassociation map 200 indecision block 1017, then the method of operation also proceeds to block 1019. Inblock 1021, the searching routine 175 searches through theassociation map 200 and attempts to identify associations between the called party the caller, and other parties based on the date, time of day, and other criteria that may be predefined, etc. and attempts to locate nodes in theassociation map 200 corresponding to persons who may be within proximity of the called party. - By “proximity” as used herein the present disclosure refers to physical proximity meaning that the candidate person identified by the searching routine 175 has a probability of being physically near the called party and having a mobile device that is operative such that the caller may call the candidates mobile device and attempts to reach the original called party.
- Proceeding to
decision block 1023, if such other contacts are identified then the searching routine 175 establishes the candidate list inblock 1025. In some embodiments, the searching routine 175 may check or verify location information for each of the candidates of the candidate list as shown inblock 1027. That is, those candidates who havecontact tracker 100 components on their corresponding mobile devices will be able to send location information in some scenarios to thecontact finder 170. In such cases, proximity is more readily verified if location available is likewise available for the called party. Thecontact finder 170 may also check candidate device sensor data, as shown inblock 1029, to determine the environment in which the candidate device is situated, and possibly to determine settings of the corresponding mobile device. In other words the searching routine 175 may determine that a certain candidate is within proximity of the called party, but may also determine by obtained sensor data that the candidate's mobile device is set to silent mode. In this case, the searching routine 175 would not consider that candidate to be a viable option for contacting the called party since the candidate's device is likewise unable to inform the candidate that a call attempt is being made. If no other contacts are identified in thedecision block 1023, then the method of operation again returns to block 1031 and notifies the user that data is not available. - Returning now to
FIG. 9 block 919, thecontact finder 170 method of operation enters into a loop operation as shown inblock 919 where a number of candidates determined previously inblock 917 is designated as index “N.” The looping operation continues provided that the number of candidates, index “N,” and is greater than or equal to one. Inblock 921, the searching routine 175 may apply the weighting factors that were discussed above to determine the candidate contact with the highest probability of being within proximity to the originally called party. Privacy rules may again be checked for compliance is shown indecision block 923 and if any particular candidate should not be contacted due to privacy rule compliance then the candidate is removed from the contact candidate list as shown inblock 925. The index and is then decremented by a factor of one as shown inblock 927. Once the index N equals zero as shown indecision block 929, the method of operation ends as shown inblock 931. However, as long as N is greater than, or equal to, one the looping operation ofblock 919 continues. Therefore, at least one candidate contact is selected from the list of candidate contacts and, if privacy rules are complied with indecision block 923, the searching routine 175 will send the contact information for the highest probability as shownblock 933, and the method of operation ends inblock 931. The user of the corresponding mobile device (that is, the caller) may then attempt to contact the candidate contact in an attempt to reach the original called party. - While various embodiments have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
