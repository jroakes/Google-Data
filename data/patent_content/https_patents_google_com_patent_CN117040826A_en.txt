Detailed Description
SUMMARY
In general, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for managing a personalized model based on blockchain data. In particular, the systems and methods disclosed herein may utilize blockchain data to facilitate access rights of one or more computing systems to interact with user data. For example, the systems and methods may store user data in a blockchain, and may enable the data to be used by others based on permissions associated with the blockchain.
User data, such as a user's search history, may be written on the blockchain and/or permissions associated with the user's search history may be stored on the blockchain. The user can then control how this information is used. For example, a user may choose to share their search history with a search engine to better personalize search results, but may choose not to share their search history with a particular social media platform. More specifically, the user may control how and what specific user data is shared. For example, the users may share some, but not all, of the search history information, and so on.
In some implementations, any type of application can be built on top of the user data.
Additionally and/or alternatively, the personalized model may be written to the blockchain. When the user navigates to a new web page, the history may then be brought back and the personalized model may be updated.
In some implementations, the systems and methods may select what data to use to update one or more personalization models (e.g., based on permissions stored on the blockchain).
One party may write data to a blockchain (e.g., social media platform) and systems and methods may read the data (or vice versa).
For example, the systems and methods may include receiving an access request from a third party computing system. The access request may describe a request to access user data of a particular user. In some implementations, user data may be stored on a blockchain. The systems and methods may include determining a particular entity associated with a third party computing system. A particular entity may be associated with a web platform. The system and method may include sending a notification to a particular user computing system. A particular user computing system may be associated with a particular user. In some implementations, the notification may describe the access request and the particular entity. User input data may be received from a particular user computing system. The user input data may describe a user's response to the access request. The system and method may include determining an access action based on user input data. The access action may describe a level of access to user data on the blockchain to be provided to the third party computing system.
In particular, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may utilize blockchains to provide a security system for providing user data to third parties, which may limit and/or remove the ability of third parties to copy and/or edit user data. Additionally and/or alternatively, the system and method may be utilized to provide users with the ability to erase their information from the blockchain, which when paired with the mitigation of the ability to copy user data may allow users to erase (or erase) user data from the internet. In some implementations, a user may facilitate read-write access to user data, which may allow the user to decide which and to what extent to store and/or view their data. For example, a user may utilize the systems and methods disclosed herein to facilitate whether a search engine, social media platform, shopping website, web browser, and/or streaming service are allowed to view user-specific data. The user data may include a user's search history, a user's browsing history, user preferences, and/or a personalized model (e.g., a machine learning model trained on training data associated with the user).
The systems and methods may receive an access request from a third-party computing system (e.g., a third-party computing system associated with a web platform). In some implementations, the access request may describe a request to access user data of a particular user. User data may be stored on a blockchain (e.g., a distributed, de-centralized blockchain associated with a blockchain computing system). In some implementations, the user data can include search history data describing previously entered search queries. The search history data may include previous search queries, search results, number of search queries, and/or categories associated with the search. The user data may include browser history data associated with the user (e.g., associated with a user computing system associated with the user). The browser history data may include previously accessed web pages, access times, and/or other relevant metadata. Additionally and/or alternatively, the user data may include preference data describing one or more user preferences. The preference data may have been generated based on one or more user inputs to the preference interface. Alternatively and/or additionally, preference data may have been generated based on one or more user interactions in a previously accessed web platform. The preference data may describe notification preferences, clothing preferences and sizes, preferred addresses (e.g., preferred mailing addresses and/or preferred email addresses), viewing preferences (e.g., dark and bright modes, portrait and landscape, etc.), and/or coarse preferences (e.g., child protection settings).

In some implementations, the particular entity may be a social media entity. Alternatively and/or additionally, the particular entity may be a search engine entity. The particular entity may include a trading platform. The determination may be based on third party input data, metadata, a computing system identifier, profile data, web domain data, and/or a web address.
The notification may be sent to a particular user computing system. A particular user computing system may be associated with a particular user. In some implementations, the notification may describe the access request and the particular entity. The transmission may occur via a network. The notification may be generated based on the type of access request and/or based on the type of entity. The notification may be a push notification sent to the user's mobile device (e.g., an authentication notification sent to a dual authentication mobile application). Alternatively and/or additionally, the notification may include a one-time access option, a periodic (termed) access option (e.g., one day, one week, one month, and/or one year), and/or a continuous access option (e.g., to allow continuous access authorization until a future action occurs).
The system and method may receive user input data from a particular user computing system. The user input data may describe a user's response to the access request. The user input data may describe a selection of an option provided via the user interface of the notification. The user input data may describe a user selection to provide data access to the third party computing system.

The non-replaceable token (NFT) may be an authenticity certificate of the digital asset. NFTs may be non-interchangeable, thus making their value dependent on the price anyone may be willing to pay for an asset. NFTs can print on blockchains so that their scarcity and authenticity can be maintained. A digital asset may be defined as anything that a digital store, and may be uniquely identified, with which an organization may implement value. Examples of digital assets may include tweets, social media comments, documents, audio, images, videos, logos, website domains, slide presentations, spreadsheets, CSS files and formats, executable code, and/or websites.
FIG. 1B depicts a block diagram of an example blockchain 50 that may be utilized by the blockchain computing system 170 of the example computing system 100 of FIG. 1A. The example blockchain 50 may include a plurality of blocks that may be used to store data having one or more encryption characteristics. Blockchain 50 may be stored on a de-centralized computing system that includes a plurality of computing devices. The blockchain 50 may be a public blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that is open without access restrictions such that anyone with internet access may send transactions or verify transactions as part of a decentralized distributed system), a private blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that provides access based on permissions set by a network administrator), or a hybrid blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that has both unrestricted and restricted blocks in combination). The blockchain 50 may include a job certification feature that may include one or more cryptographically formatted certificates. The workload certification may be provided when a request to update blockchain 50 (e.g., a request to update a ledger based on a new transaction) is made. The proof of work may convey that a certain device or group of devices has performed a certain amount of computation and may then be verified by other parties. Once verified, the blockchain 50 may be updated or may remain unchanged in response to a verification failure. The proof of work feature may be utilized to mitigate the computational cost of each device in the system that must perform the same computational functions and checks to determine that the request is valid for updating the blockchain 50.
Each block may include a hash, a previous hash associated with the hash of the previous block, and data. In some implementations, each block may include a random number. The hash may be a fixed length hash value, which may be a fingerprint of a particular block. The hash value may be generated based on a hash function (hash function) and may change each time the data for that particular block is changed. The previous hash may include a hash value of a block immediately preceding the particular block. Previous hashes may be utilized to ensure that the downstream ground truth (ground truth) remains unchanged unless proper verification occurs. The data may include transaction data (e.g., transaction ledgers), time stamps, values associated with cryptocurrency values, non-replaceable tokens (e.g., non-replaceable tokens including scripts referencing digital assets), random number data, and/or universal blockchain data. The random number (i.e., a number that is used only once) may be a number added to a block in the blockchain that may satisfy the difficulty level limit when the block is re-hashed. The random number may be a number that the blockchain solves for receiving incentives (e.g., cryptocurrency).
Blockchain 50 may include one or more security protocols and/or features. The blockchain 50 may include an encryption system. For example, blockchain 50 may verify that blockchain 50 is valid by ensuring that the stored previous hash stored in the block matches the hash value of the previous block returned from the last block to the first block (e.g., the originating block). In some implementations, blockchain 50 may include a proof of job verification that may rely on verifying a computational proof prior to effecting a change to stored data (e.g., stored ledgers). Based in part on the number of blocks in the blockchain 50, proof of work verification may take seconds, minutes, and/or hours. Additionally and/or alternatively, blockchain 50 may be implemented on a distributed, decentralized computing system. In some implementations, each computing device in the distributed decentralized computing system may store a portion (e.g., one of the plurality of blocks) or all of the blocks in the blockchain 50. Thus, the system may verify the data by ensuring that the data is consistent across most, if not all, of the distributed systems. Before adding new data, each node of the distributed system may be checked for tampering.
The data may include data associated with a cryptocurrency value (e.g., a ledger associated with a particular cryptocurrency value), data associated with a digital asset (e.g., an irreplaceable token cast on blockchain 50, which may include a script associated with the digital asset), data associated with a smart contract (e.g., a smart contract that includes conditions for automatically initiating actions in response to meeting criteria), and/or timestamp data (e.g., timestamp data for block creation, casting, transactions, etc.).
In particular, fig. 1B depicts a first block 10, a second block 20, a third block 30, a fourth block 40, and an nth block 60. Although five blocks are depicted, any number of blocks may be utilized. The first block 10 may be an origin block (e.g., a first global block in a blockchain). The first block 10 may include a corresponding first hash 12 (e.g., a hash value associated with the first block 10). The first block 10 may include a first previous hash 14 (e.g., if the first block 10 has a block preceding it in the blockchain 50, then the hash of the previous block may be stored on the first block 10). Additionally and/or alternatively, the first block 10 may include data 16 and a random number (nonce) 18.
The second block 20 may follow the first block 10. The second block 20 may include a corresponding second hash 22 (e.g., a hash value associated with the second block 20). The second block 20 may include a second previous hash 24 (e.g., the second previous hash 24 may be the same as the first hash 12 or reference the first hash 12). Additionally and/or alternatively, the second block 20 may include data 26 and a random number 28.
The third block 30 may follow the second block 20. The third block 30 may include a corresponding third hash 32 (e.g., a hash value associated with the third block 30). The third block 30 may include a third previous hash 34 (e.g., the third previous hash 34 may be the same as the second hash 22 or reference the second hash 22). Additionally and/or alternatively, the third block 30 may include data 36 and a random number 38.
Additionally and/or alternatively, the fourth block 40, the nth block 60, and other potential blocks may include respective hashes, respective previous hashes, and data. The first data 16, the second data 26, the third data 36, and the data of the other blocks may include overlapping data, may be different and/or the same, such that the data is repeated for all blocks. In some implementations, each block may be associated with a different transaction (e.g., a different coin, a different sale, etc.). The first random number 18, the second random number 28, the third random number 38, and random numbers of other blocks may be different and may be solved during mining.
The data in each tile may include ledger data, which may include timestamps, exchanged assets and/or cryptocurrency, participants involved in transactions, and/or various other information.
In some implementations, a plurality of different blockchains may be used with the systems and methods disclosed herein. Different blockchains may include different configurations.
