Definitions
- Content selection service 104 may include an autobidder feature configured to generate content auction bids on behalf of a third-party content provider based in part on auction parameters specified by the content provider. Such parameters may be stored as part of an account of the provider and used by content selection service 104 to control how and when the provider participates in content auctions.
- An account of a provider may include any number of bid-related parameters, such as a minimum bid amount, a maximum bid amount, a target bid amount, or one or more budget amounts (e.g., a daily budget, a weekly budget, a total budget, etc.).
- a bid amount may correspond to the amount the third-party provider is willing to pay in exchange for their content being presented at client device 102 .
Abstract
Description
max_biddisplay =k*CPCsearch
where max_biddisplay is the maximum bid amount used by the autobidder for display content placements, CPCsearch is the recent CPC for search content placements, and k is an adjustment factor used to adjust the maximum bid for display content. To adjust a performance metric associated with a particular type of first-party content,
where CPCdisplay_old is the provider's old CPC for display content, CPCdisplay_new is the provider's new CPC for display content that results from a change in the provider's bids, kold is the old adjustment factor used to relate CPC values across different first-party content types, and knew is the new adjustment factor. In one implementation,
where a change in the adjustment value results in a proportionate change in the provider's CPC value. In other implementations,
momentum=α*Δk previous
where 0≤α≤1 and Δkprevious is the previous change made to the k factor.
new_k final=smoothing_factor*k current+(1−smoothing_factor)*k new +α*Δk previous
where smoothing_factor and α are values selected to reduce the impact of CPC oscillations or sudden CPC changes and new_kfinal is the finalized k value used by
CPC_ratio_bias=CPC_ratiotrue−CPC_ratioideal
where CPC_ratiotrue is a provider's actual CPC ratio and CPC_ratioideal is the target CPC ratio used by content selection service 104 (e.g., a 1:1 mapping between the CPCs of the different content types, etc.). Another metric that may be determined by
where CPCtrue is the CPC for display content, CPCideal is the ideal CPC for the display content, and CPCsearch is the CPC for search content. In yet another implementation,
Variance_CPC_ratio_bias=Var(CPCtrue−CPCideal)
These metrics may be calculated by
