- the page module 210 may periodically search the page database 110 (e.g., monthly) for recently added pages and download the recently added pages.
- the page module 210 may determine which of the pages have location information specifying a geographic location. For example, a page including an article about a particular place (e.g., historical landmark) may also include location information specifying a geographic location of the place. Each page having location information may specify the corresponding geographic location in a well-defined format (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) that can be easily identified by the page module 210 . The page module 210 may select the pages having location information for further processing by the historical tour system 135 , and discard the pages without location information.
- a well-defined format e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates
- the historical information module 220 may retrieve historical information for the corresponding geographic location from the historical database 120 via the network interface 270 .
- the historical information may include one or more historical images for the geographic location including a date for each historical image.
- the historical database 120 may comprise a historical image database that stores historical images. Each historical image may be indexed by a geographic area, and may comprise a satellite image, aerial image, and/or street-level image. For each historical image, the historical image database may also include a date (e.g., the date the image was taken). In this aspect, for each selected page, the historical information module 220 may retrieve historical images for the corresponding geographic location from the historical image database including the dates of the images. For example, the historical information module 220 may retrieve historical images that are indexed by geographic areas that include the corresponding geographic location.
- the historical image database may store the historical images using a tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure), in which an image at a higher level in the tree structure shows a larger geographic area of the Earth with a lower level of detail, and an image at a lower level in the tree structure shows a smaller geographic area of the Earth with a higher level of detail.
- the historical image database may be used by an Earth browser to allow a user to navigate a virtual map of the Earth at a selected date.
- the Earth browser may do this by retrieving historical images from the tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure) corresponding to the portion of the Earth being viewed by the user and the selected date, and stitching together the historical images to provide the user with a virtual map of that portion of the Earth at the selected date.
- the Earth browser may display a time slider that allows the user to select the date by sliding the time slider along a timeline to the date. For example, the user may use this feature to view how a section of Las Vegas, Nev. has changed over time.
- the historical information module 220 may retrieve historical images for the corresponding geographic location from the tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure) including the dates of the images.
- the historical information module 220 may only retrieve historical images that have at least a minimum level of detail.
- the historical information module 220 may only retrieve historical images at levels in the tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure) corresponding to levels of detail that are equal to or greater than the minimum level of detail.
- the score module 230 may compute a score for the geographic location based on one or more of the components discussed below.
- a first component may comprise a page rank of the page.
- the score module 230 may obtain the page rank of the page by sending a page rank request for the page to the page rank server 125 , and receiving the page rank from the page rank server 125 in response to the request via the network interface 270 .
- the page rank may be a value indicating the importance or popularity of the page, in which a higher value corresponds to a higher level of importance or popularity.
- the page rank may be based on the number of other pages linking to the page, the page ranks of the other pages linking to the page, and/or other factors. Page ranks may be used by a search engine to rank search results. Since the page rank indicates the importance or popularity of the page, the score module 230 may use the page rank as an indicator of the likelihood that a user will be interested in learning the history of the corresponding geographic location.
- a second component may comprise the number of historical images retrieved from the historical database 120 for the geographic location.
- a third component may be based on the age of one or more of the historical images retrieved for the geographic location. For example, the third component may be based on the age of the oldest historical image. In this example, the third component may be assigned a higher value the greater the age of the oldest historical image. In another example, the third component may be based on an average of the dates of the historical images. In this example, the third component may be assigned a higher value the older the average date of the historical images.
- a fourth component may be based on a correlation between dates in the page and the dates of the historical images retrieved for the geographic location.
- the page module 210 may be configured to extract dates from the content (e.g., text and/or information box(es)) of the page.
- the dates may be in various formats instead of a single well-defined format. For example, the date of Nov. 21, 1990 may be specified as 11-21-1990, 11/21/1990 or other format.
- the score module 230 may be configured to recognize dates in various formats.
- the page module 210 may recognize a term that corresponds to a date and determine a date from the term. For example, the page module 210 may recognize that the term “World War II” corresponds to a date within a range of years (e.g., 1935 and 1945).
- the score module 230 may assign a value to the fourth component based on a correlation of the dates in the page with the dates of the historical images retrieved for the geographic location. For example, the score module 230 may assign a higher value to the fourth component when one of the dates in the page is the same as or within a small range (e.g., five years) of one or more of the dates of the historical images. For the case where the page module 210 can only resolve a date in the page to within a range of years (e.g., 1935 to 1945 for “World War II”), the score module 230 may assign a higher value to the fourth component when the range of years overlaps with one or more of the dates of the historical images.
- a small range e.g., five years
- the score module 230 may compute a score for the geographic location based on the one or more components. For example, the score module 230 may assign the geographic location a score equal to one of the components. In another example, the score module 230 may compute a weighted sum of two or more of the components and assign the geographic location a score based on the weighted sum. In yet another example, the score module 230 may compute a product of two or more of the components and assign the geographic location a score based on the product. If the score for the geographic location does not meet a minimum score threshold, then the score module 230 may eliminate the geographic location and the corresponding page from further consideration by the historical tour system 135 .
- the score module 230 may perform the above process for each of the selected pages to compute a score for the corresponding geographic location.
- the region module 240 may determine one or more regions (e.g., city, zip code, county, state and/or country) within which the geographic location is located and associate the one or more determined regions with the geographic location. For example, for a geographic location in San Francisco, the associated regions may include San Francisco, Calif. and the United States of America.
- regions e.g., city, zip code, county, state and/or country
- the region module 240 may determine one or more regions for a geographic location by sending a reverse geocode request to the geocode server 130 for the geographic location, and receiving one or more regions from the geocode server 130 in response to the request via the network interface 270 .
- the geocode server 130 may be configured to gecode a region, in which the region is converted into a geographic location (e.g., a geographic location in the center of the region), and to reverse geocode a geographic location, in which the geographic location is converted into one or more regions.
- the region module 240 may limit the rate at which it sends reverse geocode requests to the geocode server 130 to allow other clients to request services from the geocode server 130 .
- the region module 240 may determine which of the geographic locations are located within the region (e.g., city, zip code, county, state and/or country). For each region, the region module 240 may determine whether a particular geographic location is located within the region by determining whether one of the regions associated with the location matches the region.
- the region module 240 may determine which of the geographic locations are located within the region (e.g., city, zip code, county, state and/or country). For each region, the region module 240 may determine whether a particular geographic location is located within the region by determining whether one of the regions associated with the location matches the region.
- the page module 210 selects the pages having location information specifying a geographic location.
- the historical information module 220 retrieves historical information for the corresponding geographic location from the historical database 120
- the score module 230 computes a score for the corresponding geographic location
- the region module 240 determines one or more regions for the corresponding geographic location.
- the region module 240 also determines which of the geographic locations are located within the region.
- the above information may be stored in the memory 265 .
- the location selection module 250 may use the above information to determine which of the geographic locations to include in a historical tour of a region.
- the location selection module 250 is configured to select which of the geographic locations to include in a historical tour of a region. To do this, the location selection module 250 may first retrieve the geographic locations that are located within the region from the memory 265 , as determined by the region module 240 . The location selection module 250 may treat the geographic locations located within the region as candidates for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. After retrieving the geographic locations within the region, the location selection module 250 may retrieve the scores computed for the geographic locations by the score module 230 from the memory 265 . The location selection module 250 may then select which of the geographic locations within the region to include in the historical tour of the region based on the scores for the geographic locations.
- the location selection module 250 may select the geographic locations within the region having the N highest scores (e.g., 20 highest scores) for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. If the region has fewer than M locations (where M ⁇ N), then the location selection module 250 may instruct the tour generation module 260 to skip generating a historical tour of the region. In this case, a historical tour of the region is not generated. If the number of locations within the region is between M and N, then the location selection module 250 may select all of the locations regardless of their scores.
- the location selection module 250 may cluster the geographic locations within the region into a plurality of clusters according to location.
- the location selection module 250 may do this by applying a clustering algorithm (e.g., a k-means clustering algorithm) to the geographic locations, in which the geographic locations in the same cluster are geographically close to one another.
- a clustering algorithm e.g., a k-means clustering algorithm
- the location selection module 250 may select the highest scoring location in each cluster for the historical tour. This aspect may be used to provide geographically diverse locations for the historical tour.
- the location selection module 250 may cluster the geographic locations within the region into a plurality of clusters according to the dates of their corresponding historical images.
- the geographic locations in the same cluster may have corresponding imagery dates that are spaced close to one another in time.
- the location selection module 250 may select the highest scoring location in each cluster for the historical tour. This may be done to provide a historical tour having historical images that are diverse in time.
- the location selection module 250 may select the locations within a particular cluster for the historical tour. This may be done to provide a historical tour for a particular time period (e.g., 1970's).
- the location selection module 250 may also use any combination of the above techniques to select geographic locations within the region for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. For example, the location selection module 250 may first cluster the geographic locations within the region into a plurality of clusters according to location and select the top scoring geographic location in each cluster. Of these geographic locations, the historical tour system 135 may then select the locations having the N highest scores for the historical tour.
- the location selection module 250 may perform the above process for each of a plurality of different regions to select the geographic locations for inclusion in the historical tour of the region.
- the tour generation module 260 After the location selection module 250 selects the geographic locations for inclusion in the historical tour of a region, the tour generation module 260 generates the historical image tour of the region based on the selected geographic locations.
- the historical image tour may be in the form of a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file that, when interpreted by an Earth browser, sequentially moves a view of a virtual map to each of the selected geographic locations along a path.
- the virtual map may provide a two or three-dimensional representation of the Earth, which may be generated by stitching together satellite, aerial and/or street level images and/or using three-dimensional models.

- the content may include text and/or images extracted from the page.
- the historical images and/or content from the corresponding page may be presented in a bubble and/or screen overlay.
- the historical tour may also include a link to the page and/or one or more links included in the page. The user may click on the link to obtain additional information about the location.
- the historical tour may also instruct the Earth browser to show the region at a date corresponding to a date of one of the historical images and/or a date in the page.
- the tour generation module 260 may store the historical tour in the historical tour database 140 .
- the tour generation module 260 may perform the above process for each of a plurality of regions to generate a historical tour of each region, and store the historical tour of each region in the historical tour database 140 .
- the Earth browser may determine whether a historical tour is available for the region in the historical tour database 140 . If a historical tour is available, then the Earth browser may display an icon representing the historical tour. The user may launch the historical tour, for example, by clicking on the icon. For the example in which the historical tour is in the form of a KML file, the Earth browser may retrieve the KML file from the historical tour database 140 and process the KML file to render the historical tour.

FIG. 1 shows asystem 100 according to an aspect of the subject technology. Thesystem 100 may comprise apage database 110, ahistorical database 120, apage rank server 125, ageocode server 130, ahistorical tour system 135, and ahistorical tour database 140. In one aspect, thehistorical tour system 135 may be configured to generate a historical tour of a region using thepage database 110, thehistorical database 120, thepage rank server 125, and thegeocode server 130, as discussed further below. The historical tour, which may be in the form of a keyhole markup language (KML) file, may sequentially move a view of a virtual map to each of a plurality of geographic locations along a path. At each geographic location, the historical tour may present the user with at least one historical image and information for the location. - Referring to
FIG. 2 , thehistorical tour system 135 may include apage module 210, ahistorical information module 220, ascore module 230, aregion module 240, alocation selection module 250 and atour generation module 260. The modules may communication with one another using various communications protocols via abus 275 or other communication structure. For example, the modules may be implemented on one or more processors that execute software to perform the various functions of the modules described herein. For modules implemented on the same processor, the modules may communicate with one another via shared memory, interprocess communication structure and/or other communication structure. In another example, the modules may be implemented on distributed computing systems, in which modules implemented on different computing systems may communicate with one another via a network. - The
historical tour system 135 may also include anetwork interface 270 that allows each of the modules to communicate with one or more of the databases and/or servers show inFIG. 1 over a network connection. Thehistorical tour system 135 may also includememory 265, which may be shared by the modules and used to pass information between the modules. An example of an electronic system in which the modules may be implemented is described with reference toFIG. 5 below. Processes of each of the modules according to various aspects of the subject technology will now be described with reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 . - The
page module 210 may be configured to download a plurality of pages (e.g., web pages) from thepage database 110 via thenetwork interface 270. For example, thepage database 110 may include a Wikipedia database (URL: www.wikipedia.org) and/or other online encyclopedia database. In another example, thepage database 110 may include a geographic information system (GIS) database with geographically referenced data. Although only onepage database 110 is shown inFIG. 1 , it is to be understood that thepage module 210 may download pages from more than one page database. In one aspect, thepage module 210 may periodically search the page database 110 (e.g., monthly) for recently added pages and download the recently added pages. - After downloading a plurality of pages from the
page database 110, thepage module 210 may determine which of the pages have location information specifying a geographic location. For example, a page including an article about a particular place (e.g., historical landmark) may also include location information specifying a geographic location of the place. Each page having location information may specify the corresponding geographic location in a well-defined format (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) that can be easily identified by thepage module 210. Thepage module 210 may select the pages having location information for further processing by thehistorical tour system 135, and discard the pages without location information. - For each page selected by the
page module 210, thehistorical information module 220 may retrieve historical information for the corresponding geographic location from thehistorical database 120 via thenetwork interface 270. For example, the historical information may include one or more historical images for the geographic location including a date for each historical image. - In one aspect, the
historical database 120 may comprise a historical image database that stores historical images. Each historical image may be indexed by a geographic area, and may comprise a satellite image, aerial image, and/or street-level image. For each historical image, the historical image database may also include a date (e.g., the date the image was taken). In this aspect, for each selected page, thehistorical information module 220 may retrieve historical images for the corresponding geographic location from the historical image database including the dates of the images. For example, thehistorical information module 220 may retrieve historical images that are indexed by geographic areas that include the corresponding geographic location. - In one aspect, the historical image database may store the historical images using a tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure), in which an image at a higher level in the tree structure shows a larger geographic area of the Earth with a lower level of detail, and an image at a lower level in the tree structure shows a smaller geographic area of the Earth with a higher level of detail. In this example, the historical image database may be used by an Earth browser to allow a user to navigate a virtual map of the Earth at a selected date. The Earth browser may do this by retrieving historical images from the tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure) corresponding to the portion of the Earth being viewed by the user and the selected date, and stitching together the historical images to provide the user with a virtual map of that portion of the Earth at the selected date. The Earth browser may display a time slider that allows the user to select the date by sliding the time slider along a timeline to the date. For example, the user may use this feature to view how a section of Las Vegas, Nev. has changed over time. In this aspect, for each selected page, the
historical information module 220 may retrieve historical images for the corresponding geographic location from the tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure) including the dates of the images. Further, thehistorical information module 220 may only retrieve historical images that have at least a minimum level of detail. For the example, thehistorical information module 220 may only retrieve historical images at levels in the tree structure (e.g., quadtree structure) corresponding to levels of detail that are equal to or greater than the minimum level of detail. - After historical information is retrieved for the geographic location of a selected page, the
score module 230 may compute a score for the geographic location based on one or more of the components discussed below. - A first component may comprise a page rank of the page. In this example, the
score module 230 may obtain the page rank of the page by sending a page rank request for the page to thepage rank server 125, and receiving the page rank from thepage rank server 125 in response to the request via thenetwork interface 270. The page rank may be a value indicating the importance or popularity of the page, in which a higher value corresponds to a higher level of importance or popularity. The page rank may be based on the number of other pages linking to the page, the page ranks of the other pages linking to the page, and/or other factors. Page ranks may be used by a search engine to rank search results. Since the page rank indicates the importance or popularity of the page, thescore module 230 may use the page rank as an indicator of the likelihood that a user will be interested in learning the history of the corresponding geographic location. - A second component may comprise the number of historical images retrieved from the
historical database 120 for the geographic location. - A third component may be based on the age of one or more of the historical images retrieved for the geographic location. For example, the third component may be based on the age of the oldest historical image. In this example, the third component may be assigned a higher value the greater the age of the oldest historical image. In another example, the third component may be based on an average of the dates of the historical images. In this example, the third component may be assigned a higher value the older the average date of the historical images.
- A fourth component may be based on a correlation between dates in the page and the dates of the historical images retrieved for the geographic location. In this example, the
page module 210 may be configured to extract dates from the content (e.g., text and/or information box(es)) of the page. The dates may be in various formats instead of a single well-defined format. For example, the date of Nov. 21, 1990 may be specified as 11-21-1990, 11/21/1990 or other format. To handle various formats, thescore module 230 may be configured to recognize dates in various formats. In one aspect, thepage module 210 may recognize a term that corresponds to a date and determine a date from the term. For example, thepage module 210 may recognize that the term “World War II” corresponds to a date within a range of years (e.g., 1935 and 1945). - In this aspect, after dates are extracted from the page by the
page module 210, thescore module 230 may assign a value to the fourth component based on a correlation of the dates in the page with the dates of the historical images retrieved for the geographic location. For example, thescore module 230 may assign a higher value to the fourth component when one of the dates in the page is the same as or within a small range (e.g., five years) of one or more of the dates of the historical images. For the case where thepage module 210 can only resolve a date in the page to within a range of years (e.g., 1935 to 1945 for “World War II”), thescore module 230 may assign a higher value to the fourth component when the range of years overlaps with one or more of the dates of the historical images. - After the
score module 230 determines one or more of the above components, thescore module 230 may compute a score for the geographic location based on the one or more components. For example, thescore module 230 may assign the geographic location a score equal to one of the components. In another example, thescore module 230 may compute a weighted sum of two or more of the components and assign the geographic location a score based on the weighted sum. In yet another example, thescore module 230 may compute a product of two or more of the components and assign the geographic location a score based on the product. If the score for the geographic location does not meet a minimum score threshold, then thescore module 230 may eliminate the geographic location and the corresponding page from further consideration by thehistorical tour system 135. - The
score module 230 may perform the above process for each of the selected pages to compute a score for the corresponding geographic location. - For each of the geographic locations, the
region module 240 may determine one or more regions (e.g., city, zip code, county, state and/or country) within which the geographic location is located and associate the one or more determined regions with the geographic location. For example, for a geographic location in San Francisco, the associated regions may include San Francisco, Calif. and the United States of America. - In one aspect, the
region module 240 may determine one or more regions for a geographic location by sending a reverse geocode request to thegeocode server 130 for the geographic location, and receiving one or more regions from thegeocode server 130 in response to the request via thenetwork interface 270. Thegeocode server 130 may be configured to gecode a region, in which the region is converted into a geographic location (e.g., a geographic location in the center of the region), and to reverse geocode a geographic location, in which the geographic location is converted into one or more regions. In this aspect, theregion module 240 may limit the rate at which it sends reverse geocode requests to thegeocode server 130 to allow other clients to request services from thegeocode server 130. - For each of a plurality of different regions, the
region module 240 may determine which of the geographic locations are located within the region (e.g., city, zip code, county, state and/or country). For each region, theregion module 240 may determine whether a particular geographic location is located within the region by determining whether one of the regions associated with the location matches the region. - Thus, for each page downloaded from the
page database 110, thepage module 210 selects the pages having location information specifying a geographic location. For each page selected by thepage module 210, thehistorical information module 220 retrieves historical information for the corresponding geographic location from thehistorical database 120, thescore module 230 computes a score for the corresponding geographic location, and theregion module 240 determines one or more regions for the corresponding geographic location. For each region, theregion module 240 also determines which of the geographic locations are located within the region. The above information may be stored in thememory 265. As discussed further below, thelocation selection module 250 may use the above information to determine which of the geographic locations to include in a historical tour of a region. - The
location selection module 250 is configured to select which of the geographic locations to include in a historical tour of a region. To do this, thelocation selection module 250 may first retrieve the geographic locations that are located within the region from thememory 265, as determined by theregion module 240. Thelocation selection module 250 may treat the geographic locations located within the region as candidates for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. After retrieving the geographic locations within the region, thelocation selection module 250 may retrieve the scores computed for the geographic locations by thescore module 230 from thememory 265. Thelocation selection module 250 may then select which of the geographic locations within the region to include in the historical tour of the region based on the scores for the geographic locations. - In one aspect, the
location selection module 250 may select the geographic locations within the region having the N highest scores (e.g., 20 highest scores) for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. If the region has fewer than M locations (where M<N), then thelocation selection module 250 may instruct thetour generation module 260 to skip generating a historical tour of the region. In this case, a historical tour of the region is not generated. If the number of locations within the region is between M and N, then thelocation selection module 250 may select all of the locations regardless of their scores. - In another aspect, the
location selection module 250 may cluster the geographic locations within the region into a plurality of clusters according to location. Thelocation selection module 250 may do this by applying a clustering algorithm (e.g., a k-means clustering algorithm) to the geographic locations, in which the geographic locations in the same cluster are geographically close to one another. After the geographic locations are clustered into the plurality of clusters, thelocation selection module 250 may select the highest scoring location in each cluster for the historical tour. This aspect may be used to provide geographically diverse locations for the historical tour. - In another aspect, the
location selection module 250 may cluster the geographic locations within the region into a plurality of clusters according to the dates of their corresponding historical images. In this aspect, the geographic locations in the same cluster may have corresponding imagery dates that are spaced close to one another in time. After the geographic locations are clustered into the plurality of clusters, thelocation selection module 250 may select the highest scoring location in each cluster for the historical tour. This may be done to provide a historical tour having historical images that are diverse in time. In another example, thelocation selection module 250 may select the locations within a particular cluster for the historical tour. This may be done to provide a historical tour for a particular time period (e.g., 1970's). - The
location selection module 250 may also use any combination of the above techniques to select geographic locations within the region for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. For example, thelocation selection module 250 may first cluster the geographic locations within the region into a plurality of clusters according to location and select the top scoring geographic location in each cluster. Of these geographic locations, thehistorical tour system 135 may then select the locations having the N highest scores for the historical tour. - The
location selection module 250 may perform the above process for each of a plurality of different regions to select the geographic locations for inclusion in the historical tour of the region. - After the
location selection module 250 selects the geographic locations for inclusion in the historical tour of a region, thetour generation module 260 generates the historical image tour of the region based on the selected geographic locations. The historical image tour may be in the form of a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file that, when interpreted by an Earth browser, sequentially moves a view of a virtual map to each of the selected geographic locations along a path. The virtual map may provide a two or three-dimensional representation of the Earth, which may be generated by stitching together satellite, aerial and/or street level images and/or using three-dimensional models. Thetour generation module 260 may order the locations in the historical tour based on an order that results in the shortest path. An example of an Earth browser on which the historical tour may be presented is Google Earth®. However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the historical tour may be present using any application or service that provides a two or three-dimensional representation of the Earth. - At each selected geographic location, the historical tour may present the user with one or more of the historical images retrieved from the
historical database 120 for the location. The historical tour may also present content from the corresponding page (i.e., the page that included the location information specifying the geographic location). The content may include text and/or images extracted from the page. The historical images and/or content from the corresponding page may be presented in a bubble and/or screen overlay. The historical tour may also include a link to the page and/or one or more links included in the page. The user may click on the link to obtain additional information about the location. In one aspect, the historical tour may also instruct the Earth browser to show the region at a date corresponding to a date of one of the historical images and/or a date in the page. - After generating the historical tour of the region, the
tour generation module 260 may store the historical tour in thehistorical tour database 140. Thetour generation module 260 may perform the above process for each of a plurality of regions to generate a historical tour of each region, and store the historical tour of each region in thehistorical tour database 140. - When a user navigates to a particular region using an Earth browser running on a computing device, the Earth browser may determine whether a historical tour is available for the region in the
historical tour database 140. If a historical tour is available, then the Earth browser may display an icon representing the historical tour. The user may launch the historical tour, for example, by clicking on the icon. For the example in which the historical tour is in the form of a KML file, the Earth browser may retrieve the KML file from thehistorical tour database 140 and process the KML file to render the historical tour. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method for historical tour generation according to an aspect of the subject technology. Atstep 310, each page including a geographic location is selected from a plurality of pages. Atstep 320, for each of the selected pages, historical information is retrieved from a database based on the corresponding geographic location. Atstep 330, the geographic locations that are located within a region are determined. Atstep 340, a plurality of geographic locations are selected from the geographic locations located within the region. Atstep 350, a historical tour of the region is generated based on the selected geographic locations. The historical tour may comprise at least a portion of the historical information retrieved for the selected geographic locations.Steps 330 through 350 may be repeated to generate a historical tour for each of a plurality of different regions. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method for historical tour generation according to an aspect of the subject technology. Atstep 410, for each of a plurality of geographic locations, at least one historical image is retrieved from a database corresponding to the geographic location. The plurality of geographic locations may be located within the same region. Atstep 420, for each of the plurality of geographic locations, a score is computed based on a date of the at least one historical image corresponding to the geographic location. Atstep 430, a subset of the plurality of geographic locations is selected based on the scores for the plurality of geographic locations. Atstep 440, a historical imagery tour is generated based on the selected geographic locations, wherein the historical tour comprises at least one of the retrieved historical images. -
FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology may be implemented. For example, the electronic system may be used to implement thehistorical tour system 135 illustrated inFIG. 2 .Electronic system 500 includes abus 508, processing unit(s) 512, asystem memory 504, a read-only memory (ROM) 510, apermanent storage device 502, aninput device interface 514, anoutput device interface 506 and anetwork interface 516. -
Bus 508 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices ofelectronic system 500. For instance,bus 508 communicatively connects processing unit(s) 512 withROM 510,system memory 504, andpermanent storage device 502. - From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 512 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject disclosure. For example, each module of the
historical tour system 135 may include instructions that are stored in one or more of the memory units and executed by the processing unit(s) 512 to implement the processes of the module. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different implementations. -
ROM 510 stores static data and instructions that are needed by processing unit(s) 512 and other modules of the electronic system.Permanent storage device 502, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even whenelectronic system 500 is off. Some implementations of the subject disclosure use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) aspermanent storage device 502. - Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as
permanent storage device 502. Likepermanent storage device 502,system memory 504 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlikestorage device 502,system memory 504 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such a random access memory.System memory 504 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored insystem memory 504,permanent storage device 502, and/orROM 510. From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 512 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations. -
Bus 508 also connects to input and output device interfaces 514 and 506.Input device interface 514 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used withinput device interface 514 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called “cursor control devices”). Output device interfaces 506 enables, for example, the display of images generated by theelectronic system 500. Output devices used withoutput device interface 506 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal displays (LCD). - Finally, as shown in
FIG. 5 ,bus 508 also coupleselectronic system 500 to a network (not shown) through anetwork interface 516. In this manner, theelectronic system 500 can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components ofelectronic system 500 can be used in conjunction with the subject disclosure. - These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
- Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
- While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
