Abstract
This document describes fifth generation new radio enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) techniques and apparatus. The techniques include a user equipment (102) transmitting a request message to a base station (104) for a UE-specific format for a downlink control channel. The user equipment (102) then receives a downlink control channel message from the base station (104) according to the UE-specific format. This allows the user equipment (102) to decode the downlink control channel message based on the UE-specific format indicated in the request message. The user equipment (102) uses the decoded downlink control channel message to obtain downlink control information that can be used to access the encoded data on the downlink shared channel. These techniques reduce the power consumed in decoding a message on the downlink control channel as compared to conventional techniques that rely on blind decoding.
Description
Background
Typically, providers of wireless networks manage wireless communications through the wireless network. For example, a base station manages wireless connections with user equipment connected to a wireless network. The base station determines a configuration for the wireless connection, such as bandwidth, timing, and protocol for the wireless connection. The base station then transmits a control message to the user equipment to indicate to the user equipment the configuration for the radio connection. Having the base station allow for determining a configuration for wireless connections allows the base station to manage wireless connections with many wireless devices. However, without information about the condition of the user equipment, the base station may select a sub-optimal configuration for the wireless connection between the base station and the user equipment.
With the recent development of wireless communication technology, providers may also have access to the higher frequency radio spectrum relative to traditional wireless deployments. Such access, in combination with other technologies, enables the base station to provide a wider bandwidth, lower latency, and increased data rates for the wireless connection. However, with suboptimal configurations, these wireless connections with wider bandwidths and higher frequency bands may cause the user equipment to consume excessive power relative to traditional wireless deployments.
Disclosure of Invention
This document describes techniques and apparatus for a fifth generation new radio (5G NR) enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). The techniques include a user equipment transmitting a request to a base station for a UE-specific PDCCH format. In aspects, a user equipment transmits an uplink Radio Resource Control (RRC) message or a Medium Access Control (MAC) Control Element (CE). The base station may then grant the user equipment a specific PDCCH format by using a downlink RRC message or MAC CE upon request. This allows the user equipment to identify the UE-specific PDCCH format and the appropriate aggregation level with which to decode the message on the PDCCH. These techniques reduce the power consumed in decoding a message on the PDCCH compared to conventional techniques that rely on blind decoding.

Detailed Description
A base station of a wireless network manages wireless connections with User Equipment (UE) devices by scheduling communication resources and determining a configuration through which the user devices communicate. The base station transmits Downlink Control Information (DCI) to the user equipment using a physical channel such as a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). The PDCCH bearer includes information of scheduling assignments and other control information. Typically, the PDCCH is transmitted on an aggregation of one or more consecutive Control Channel Elements (CCEs), where each CCE includes multiple resource element groups.
However, little information is provided to the user equipment to decode the PDCCH payload. For example, the user equipment is typically unaware of the detailed control channel structure, including the number of control channels and the number of CCEs to which each control channel is mapped. Thus, the user equipment typically performs "blind decoding," which involves monitoring the entire PDCCH candidate set (e.g., the set of consecutive CCEs on which the PDCCH may be mapped) in each downlink subframe received from the base station. In an example, a single subframe may include multiple PDCCHs, and some PDCCHs may not be related to a particular user equipment. In order to find a user equipment specific PDCCH, the user equipment may require a large number of attempts to successfully decode the PDCCH candidate. The user equipment may use its Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) to attempt decoding of the PDCCH candidates. Generally, the RNTI is used to demask a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of the PDCCH candidate, and if no CRC error is detected, the user equipment determines that the PDCCH carries control information specific to the user equipment. However, there is a problem of inefficiency in attempting to decode signals that may not be correlated with the user equipment, which results in excessive power consumption.
This document describes techniques and systems for 5G NR enhanced PDCCH. These techniques include the user equipment requesting a specific PDCCH format to reduce the amount of blind decoding typically performed on the PDCCH by the user equipment when using conventional techniques. In aspects, a user equipment transmits a Radio Resource Control (RRC) message or a Medium Access Control (MAC) Control Element (CE). The base station may then grant the user equipment specific PDCCH format by using a downlink RRC message or MAC CE upon request. This allows the user equipment to identify a specific PDCCH format and the appropriate aggregation level by which to decode the PDCCH. Furthermore, the user equipment may avoid blind decoding and thus reduce the amount of power consumed by decoding the PDCCH.
This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts of the 5G NR enhanced PDCCH. The simplified concepts are further described in the detailed description that follows. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

When implemented as part of a wireless network, the base station 104 may be configured to provide or support a macrocell, microcell, picocell, wide area network, or any combination thereof. In various aspects of the 5G NR enhanced PDCCH, the base station 104 may be referred to as an eNB, a gNB, or a relay (or vice versa).
The serving cell base station 104 communicates with the user equipment 102 via a radio link 106, which radio link 106 may be implemented as any suitable type of radio link. The wireless link 106 may include a downlink for data and control information communicated from the serving cell base station 104 to the user equipment 102 and/or an uplink for other data and control information communicated from the user equipment 102 to the serving cell base station 104. The wireless link 106 may include one or more wireless links or bearers implemented using any suitable communication protocol or standard, or combination of communication protocols or standards such as third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP LTE), 5G NR, etc.

UE 102 may connect to a public network, such as the internet 112, via EPC110 to interact with remote services 114.
Fig. 2 illustrates an example device diagram 200 of the user equipment 102 and the serving cell base station 104. It should be noted that for clarity, not all features of the user equipment 102 and the serving cell base station 104 are illustrated here. In other words, the user equipment 102 and/or the serving base station 104 may also include any other suitable components to implement the respective communication or processing functions of either device. In this example, user equipment 102 includes an antenna 202 for communicating with base station 104 in E-UTRAN 108, a radio frequency front end 204(RF front end 204), an LTE transceiver 206, and a 5G NR transceiver 208. RF front end 204 of user device 102 may couple or connect LTE transceiver 206 and 5G NR transceiver 208 to antenna 202 to facilitate various types or modes of wireless communication. LTE transceiver 206 and 5G NR transceiver 208 are examples of radio frequency transceivers.
The antenna 202 of the user equipment 102 may include an array of multiple antennas configured to be similar to each other or different from each other. The antenna 202 and the RF front end 204 may be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands defined by the 3GPP LTE and 5G NR communication standards and implemented by the LTE transceiver 206 and/or the 5G NR transceiver 208. By way of example and not limitation, antenna 202 and RF front end 204 may be implemented for operation in a lower gigahertz frequency band, a lower 6GHz frequency band, and/or a higher 6GHz frequency band as defined by the 3GPP LTE and 5G NR communication standards. Alternatively, the 5G NR transceiver 208 may be replaced with a 5G NR receiver (or transmitter), and the operations described herein as being performed by the 5G NR transceiver 208 may be performed by the 5G NR receiver (or transmitter).
The user device 102 also includes a processor 210 and a computer-readable storage medium 212(CRM 212). Processor 210 may be a single core processor or a multi-core processor composed of a variety of materials, such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectric, copper, and the like. The computer-readable storage media described herein do not include propagated signals or carrier waves. The CRM212 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), Random Access Memory (RAM), static RAM (sram), dynamic RAM (dram), non-volatile RAM (nvram), read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, a hard disk, or an optical data storage device, for storing device data 214 for the user device 102. The device data 214 includes user data, multimedia data, applications, and/or an operating system of the user device 102 that are executable by the processor 210 to enable a user to interact with the user device 102 or its functionality.
The CRM212 also includes a communication manager 216, which in one embodiment is embodied on the CRM212 (as shown). Alternatively or additionally, the communication manager 216 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of the user device 102. In at least some aspects, the communication manager 216 implements techniques for 5G NR enhanced PDCCH via configuration or action by the RF front end 204, the LTE transceiver 206, and/or the 5G NR transceiver 208.
The equipment diagram of the serving cell base station 104 shown in fig. 2 includes a single network node (e.g., an E-UTRAN node B or a gdnodeb). The functionality of the serving cell base station 104 may be distributed across multiple network nodes and/or devices, and may be distributed in any manner suitable for performing the functions described herein. In this example, the serving cell base station 104 includes an antenna 218, a radio frequency front end 220(RF front end 220), one or more LTE transceivers 222, and/or one or more 5G NR transceivers 224 for communicating with the user equipment 102. The RF front end 220 of the serving cell base station 104 may couple or connect an LTE transceiver 222 and a 5G NR transceiver 224 to the antenna 218 to facilitate various types of wireless communication.
The antenna 218 of the serving cell base station 104 may include an array of multiple antennas configured to be similar to or different from each other. The antenna 218 and the RF front end 220 may be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands defined by the 3GPP LTE and 5G NR communication standards and implemented by the LTE transceiver 222 and/or the 5G NR transceiver 224. Further, the antennas 218, RF front end 220, LTE transceiver 222, and/or 5G NR transceiver 224 may be configured to support beamforming, such as massive multiple input multiple output (mimo), for transmission and reception of communications with the user equipment 102.
The serving cell base station 104 also includes a processor 226 and a computer readable storage medium 228(CRM 228). The processor 226 may be a single core processor or a multi-core processor composed of a wide variety of materials, such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectric, copper, and the like. The CRM228 may include any suitable memory or storage device that may be used to store device data 230 for the serving cell base station 104, such as Random Access Memory (RAM), static RAM (sram), dynamic RAM (dram), non-volatile RAM (nvram), read-only memory (ROM), or flash memory. The CRM228 of the serving cell base station 104 is not configured to store the propagated signal or carrier. The device data 230 includes network scheduling data, radio resource management data, applications, and/or an operating system of the serving cell base station 104, which may be executed by the processor 226 to enable communication with the user equipment 102 or to enable functionality of the serving cell base station 104.

Alternatively or additionally, the base station manager 232 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of the serving cell base station 104. In at least some aspects, the base station manager 232 configures the LTE transceiver 222 and the 5G NR transceiver 224 for communication with the user equipment 102 and with the EPC 110.
Example procedure
Fig. 3 depicts an example method 300 of communicating with a base station by a user equipment in accordance with an aspect of the technology described herein. The order in which the method blocks are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described method blocks can be combined in any order to implement a method, or an alternate method.
At 302, a user equipment establishes a connection with a base station. For example, the user equipment 102 may establish a connection with the base station 104 via the wireless link 106. Establishing the connection may include the processor (e.g., processor 210) executing code or instructions stored in the computer-readable storage medium 212 (e.g., executing the communication manager 216 code and the device data 214 code stored in the CRM 212).
At 304, the user equipment transmits a request message for a specific format of a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) to the base station. In aspects, the user equipment 102 transmits the request message as an uplink RRC message, a MAC CE, a Scheduled Uplink (SUL), or a non-scheduled uplink transmission. The request message may include various information such as a specific demodulation reference signal (DMRS) density, a modulation order, and/or an aggregation level. The request message may request a specific Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbol index within a subframe, which will be used to carry the PDCCH. This allows the user equipment to select a specific symbol for the subframe to carry the PDCCH. In addition, the request message may include a preference for frequency bandwidth of the PDCCH.
In at least some aspects, the request message includes a request for a particular cross-carrier scheduling mapping when multiple carriers are involved in the connection. This provides flexibility for the user equipment to indicate a preference for mapping. In one example, a user equipment may only monitor a particular carrier with low power operation as compared to other carriers with relatively high power operation. There may be a preference for a particular carrier that has lower interference than other carriers. In another example, the user equipment may indicate a preference for a lower frequency bandwidth for the PDCCH based on a desired signal quality of the PDCCH. In addition, if the user equipment does not receive a PDCCH grant on a particular carrier, the grant for that carrier may be carried by one or more other carriers. Thus, some carriers may perform cross-carrier scheduling for user equipment on other carriers.
In another example, multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) may be used for a UE, such as in an LTE-NR dual connectivity system. In response, the request message may include a request that the PDCCH only exist in a particular RAT of the plurality of RATs. cross-RAT scheduling may be requested if PDCCH is present in only one of LTE or NR networks. In addition, the request may include a request that the PDCCH be present in the subset of UE-defined active carriers rather than one or more other active carriers omitted from the subset of UE-defined active carriers. In this way, the user equipment may identify which active carrier may be, and which active carrier may not be part of, the connection. The base station 120 may transmit the downlink control channel using the subset of UE-defined activated carriers requested in the request message and not transmit the downlink control channel using one or more other carriers omitted from the subset of user-defined activated carriers based on the request.
Optionally, at 306, the user equipment receives an additional message from the base station acknowledging the request message for the specific format used for the PDCCH. For example, the user equipment 102 may receive a message from the base station 104 granting a UE-specific format. In aspects, the additional message may be received via a downlink RRC message, a MAC CE, a scheduled downlink, or an LTE downlink.
At 308, the user equipment receives a PDCCH message from the base station according to the UE-specific format. In aspects, the user equipment 102 receives a PDCCH message from the base station 104 via the wireless link 106.
At 310, the user equipment decodes the PDCCH message based on the UE-specific format indicated in the request message. For example, after performing deinterleaving, precode de-precoding, symbol combining, symbol demodulating, and descrambling, the user equipment 102 may decode the PDCCH payload without blind decoding since the user equipment knows the UE-specific format used for the PDCCH. Thus, the user equipment 102 may decode PDCCH using only the relevant format (e.g., the requested UE-specific format) and thus reduce the excessive power consumption typically used when blindly decoding all PDCCH candidates in each subframe.
At 312, the user equipment uses the decoded PDCCH message to obtain Downlink Control Information (DCI) that can be used to access the encoded data on the downlink shared channel. In an example, the user equipment 102 accesses DCI in the decoded PDCCH message. The DCI includes information corresponding to a resource allocation and a transport format of a downlink shared channel, and information related to hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) on the downlink shared channel.
Fig. 4 depicts an example method 400 for communicating with a user equipment through a base station in accordance with an aspect of the technology described herein. The order in which the method blocks are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described method blocks can be combined in any order to implement a method, or an alternate method.
At 402, a base station establishes a connection with a user equipment. For example, the base station 104 may establish a connection with the user equipment via the wireless link 106. Establishing the connection may include the processor (e.g., processor 226) executing code or instructions stored in the computer-readable storage medium 228 (e.g., executing base station manager 232 code and device data 230 code stored in the CRM 228).
At block 404, the base station receives a request message for a UE-specific format for a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). For example, the base station 104 may receive the request message from the user equipment 102 via the wireless link 106. The request message may be received via any suitable uplink signal or control channel of the wireless link or wireless connection. In an example, the request message is received via an uplink RRC message, MAC CE, SUL, or LTE uplink.
Optionally, at 406, the base station transmits an additional message to the user equipment granting a UE-specific format for the PDCCH. For example, the base station 104 may transmit a downlink RRC message or MAC CE to the user equipment 102 indicating that the requested UE-specific format has been granted and that the user equipment 102 should use the UE-specific format to decode the upcoming PDCCH message.
At 408, a PDCCH message is generated by compiling at least Downlink Control Information (DCI) based on a UE-specific format requested by the user equipment and mapping one or more Control Channel Elements (CCEs) to the DCI. For example, the base station 104 may form the PDCCH payload by channel coding the DCI, which includes adding a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) attachment, followed by convolutional coding and rate matching according to PDCCH format capacity. The coded DCI bits (e.g., PDCCH payload) are then mapped to CCEs according to the PDCCH format. After performing operations including scrambling, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation, layer mapping, and precoding, the coded DCI bits are converted into complex modulated symbols, which are then interleaved and mapped to physical resource elements.
At 410, the base station transmits the PDCCH message to the user equipment according to the UE-specific format to enable the user equipment to decode the PDCCH message based on the UE-specific format.
