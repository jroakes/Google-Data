Definitions
- Known ad hoc networking methods typically organize the network on the basis of geographic proximity of the nodes or the strength of signals received by the various nodes.
- Known methods of ad hoc network organization also require nodes to regularly transmit network information to all other nodes in the network, which results in increased radio traffic and interference. Increased radio interference inhibits the formation and maintenance of ad hoc networks having a large number of nodes and requires nodes to transmit at a greater power, which reduces their battery life.
- Bluetooth radios Another obstacle to widespread implementation of the use of standards based radios, such as Bluetooth radios, especially in asset-tracking applications, is the limited life of the radio due to its power consumption.
- Each standards based radio associated with an asset being tracked often operates from a battery that is included within the housing of the radio.
- the battery is able to effectively power the radio for only a short period of time.
- a Bluetooth radio whether of the class 1 , 2 , or 3 type, utilizes about 40 mAh of current when actively receiving transmissions. Even in standby mode, wherein the radio is neither receiving nor transmitting but is in a low power consumption mode from which it can quickly return to an active state, such a radio utilizes about 10 mAh of current.
- Bluetooth radios therefore can be expected to last less than about ninety (90) days, and only half that long in fairly active asset-tracking applications.

- the first group of transceivers comprises a number not greater than the number of transceivers from which communications can be received by the transceiver without radio frequency interference due to its channel capacity.
- the limited number of transceivers excludes the first group of transceivers and also otherwise comprises a number not greater than the number of transceivers from which communications can be received by the transceiver without radio frequency interference due to its channel capacity.

- each WRT includes a class designation with a first plurality of WRTs having a first class designation and a second plurality of WRTs having a second class designation different from the first class designation.
- the step of forming an ad hoc hierarchical class-based network for each of the first plurality and second plurality of WRTs preferably includes the steps of: filtering, by each WRT, transmissions from other WRTs for an identification of its class designation within the transmission; transmitting, from a primary WRT of the first plurality, a primary availability signal including an identification of the first class designation and an identification of the primary WRT transmitting the primary availability signal; transmitting, from a primary WRT of the second plurality, a primary availability signal including an identification of the second class designation and an identification of the primary WRT of the second plurality transmitting the primary availability signal; transmitting, from a WRT receiving a primary availability signal having an identification therein of its class designation, a registration signal including an identification of the class designation and an identification of the WRT transmitting the registration signal; and identifying a WRT transmitting a registration signal as a secondary WRT by a primary WRT of the same class designation, the primary WRT thereby assuming a higher level in the ad

- each Wireless Tag also includes, apart from its WT ID, a “class designation” representative of an attribute, characteristic, relation, or behavior of the asset (and not the Wireless Tag itself), and each Wireless Tag is said to belong to, or be a member of, a particular WT Class based on its class designation.
- Identification of the WT Class for which a particular Wireless Tag is designated preferably is stored on the Wireless Tag and is utilized by the Wireless Tag in screening broadcasts for determining whether to respond thereto with a transmission.
- the Wireless Reader Tag broadcasts at a second, stronger power level 20 a transmission specifying the same WT Class.
- the broadcast is received by the closest six Wireless Tags shown within the inner circle 2020 , which represents the effective transmission range of the Wireless Reader Tag at the second power level.
- the broadcast includes, inter alia, a command to ignore subsequent transmission specifying the same WT Class within a predetermined time period thereafter.
- the three outermost Wireless Tags S 2 receive this transmission, respond appropriately, and then power down for the predetermined time period.

- a “reset” command is broadcast to all of the Wireless Tags in order to enable receipt thereafter of a broadcast at any power level, or alternatively, the power level screening is dropped after a predetermined time period.
- the WRT class designations primarily are used by Wireless Reader Tag to screen each broadcast or multicast intended for receipt by a particular class of Wireless Reader Tags (hereinafter “WRT Broadcast”).
- WRT Broadcast a command, query, or the like (generically referred to as a message) is communicated in a transmission to members of a WRT Class in a WRT Broadcast as part of a data packet that begins with a preamble including an identification of the WRT Class intended as the target of the broadcast.
- Other information may also be included in the data packet for screening purposes by each Wireless Reader Tag.
- Wireless Reader Tags within range of the WRT Broadcast awake from a standby mode to receive the data packet, but only process the message therein with possible transmissions in response thereto when the WRT Class of the preamble matches the WRT Class of the Wireless Reader Tag (and when the other screening information, if present, also is matched).

- FIG. 23 illustrates in block diagram a Gateway 5000 making a WRT broadcast 5002 to a plurality of WRTs 5008 in accordance with the present invention.
- the Gateway 5000 represents the juncture between the networks formed by the WRTs 5008 and an external network, such as the Internet.
- the Gateway 5000 is the Network Interface Module (“NIM”) in FIG. 23 providing the wireless interface into the radio network of and controlling the messaging to the WRTs 5008 .
- the Gateway 5000 preferably includes software allowing it make broadcasts to and communicate with the WRTs 5008 .
- the Gateway 5000 itself preferably includes a network card component 5004 for interfacing with the external network using the appropriate protocols and a WRT component 5006 for communicating with the WRTs 5008 using the appropriate protocols.
- the WRT component 5006 interfaces to the network card 5004 , and the WRT component 5006 preferably comprises a LPRF communications component, such as a class 1 Bluetooth radio, for communicating directly with the LPRF communications component of each WRT 5008 , as described in greater detail below.
- the WRT component 5006 may further include a receiver circuit for performing the “tag turn-on” function of the present invention, in which case the Gateway 5000 may power off when not in use and be awaken by an appropriate broadcast when communication by way of the Gateway 5000 is desired. This is especially advantageous when the Gateway 5000 itself is powered by an internal energy source, such as a battery.
- Each WRT 5008 shown in FIG. 23 preferably is an active transceiver and includes several components. Specifically, with reference to FIG. 24 , each of the WRTs 5008 includes a LPRF communications component 5010 , a reader component 5012 physically connected to the LPRF communications component 5010 for data exchange therebetween, and a WT component 5014 physically connected to an “activation” input of the LPRF communications component 5010 for performing the “tag turn-on” function of the present invention. These components are hardwired into the WRT housing 5016 of the WRT 5008 .
- Each WRT 5008 also includes an energy source, such as a battery (not shown), as well as an antenna (not shown).
- the WT component 5014 itself, like the WRT 5008 , includes several components. As shown in FIG. 25 , these components include a radio frequency (RF) detector component 5022 , an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) component 5024 , and a memory component 5026 .
- the WT component 5014 also includes an energy source, such as a battery 5026 , as well as an antenna 5028 .
- the antenna 5028 of the WT component 5014 and/or the battery 5026 of the WT component 5028 may be shared with the LPRF communications component 5008 . Alternatively, the antenna 5028 and/or the battery 5026 may be independent from that of the LPRF communications component 5008 .
- a WRT may include an external network communications component physically connected to the LPRF communications component for data exchange therebetween.
- the NIM may comprise a satellite transceiver and/or a cellular transceiver
- the LPRF communications component preferably includes a port for interfacing with the satellite transceiver and/or cellular transceiver. If the WRT includes an external communications component, then the WRT may directly communicate with an external network without relaying communications through the Gateway.
- the WRT additionally, or alternatively, may include a sensor component physically connected to the LPRF communications component by way of an appropriate port for data exchange therebetween.
- the sensor component may include a motion detector; a digital camera; a microphone; a temperature gauge; a thermistor; a vibration sensor; and/or a global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
- GPS global positioning system
- the LPRF communications component 5010 communicates with the reader component 5012 in reading WTs located within the vicinity of the WRT 5008 , and the LPRF communications component 5010 receives and transmits data to other WRTs 5008 or to a Gateway 5000 (specifically, the WRT component 5006 of the Gateway 5000 ). Furthermore, the LPRF communications component 5010 preferably is programmed to power down to an “off” state in order to conserve battery power when the LPRF communications component 5010 no longer is actively transmitting or receiving data packets.
- the WT component 5014 physically connected to the activation input of the LPRF communications component 5010 provides the electronic signal for waking up, i.e., activating, the LPRF communications component 5010 .
- the WT component 5014 generates this electronic signal by toggling the line 5018 that runs from the WT component 5014 to the LPRF communications component 5010 in response to receipt by the WT component 5014 of a radio frequency broadcast.
- the radio frequency broadcast to which the WT component 5014 responds is a “targeted” broadcast.
- the broadcast preferably includes in a preamble thereof one or more target identifications.
- the targeted broadcast that awakens a particular WRT may originate from a Gateway, such as Gateway 5000 of FIG. 23 .
- the targeted broadcast may also originate from or be rebroadcast by the LPRF communications component of another WRT 5008 .
- a characteristic of a wireless transceiver of the present invention includes two receivers and at least one transmitter.
- a receiver and transmitter pair is included in the LPRF communications component, and a second receiver is included in the WT component. Additionally, the range at which the second receiver is capable of detecting transmissions is at least approximately commensurate with the range at which the transmitter is capable of sending transmissions.
- the advantages of this arrangement originates from the power consumption of the LPRF communications component (the transmitter/receiver pair) while awaiting receipt of transmissions versus that of the WT component (the second receiver).
- the LPRF communications component which preferably comprises a Bluetooth radio, draws on the order of approximately 40 mA of current when awaiting receipt of a radio frequency broadcast and draws on the order of approximately 10 mA of current when powered down to a standby mode.
- the LPRF communication component draws approximately no current when powered down to an off state.
- the WT component comprises at least a receiver circuit that only draws on the order of approximately 10 to 15 microamps of current while awaiting receipt of the radio frequency broadcast.
- the WRT overall draws only on the order of approximately 10–15 microamps of current attributable to the WT component while awaiting receipt of the radio frequency broadcast.
- the LPRF communications component would not power down to the off state between time periods of actively receiving and transmitting but, instead, only would power down to standby mode and, thus, the WRT overall would draw on the order of approximately 10 mA of current. Consequently, by providing the WT component as part of the WRT, the LPRF communications component may power down to the off state such that the current requirement of the WRT is reduced three orders of magnitude, i.e., from milliamps to microamps.
- WRTs of the present invention preferably are utilized in sensor information collecting and/or asset-tracking applications, and methods for forming ad hoc networks by these WRTs will now be described in detail.
- the radio frequency utilized by the WRTs preferably is 2.4 GHz, for which no license is required in any country.
- the WRTs preferably read wireless tags that, themselves, are associated with the assets to be tracked.
- the WRTs also serve the wireless tag function, with each WRT being associated with an asset to be tracked.
- a reader component of the WRT may be omitted if no wireless tag is to be read by the WRT.
- WRT Broadcasts are made by a network interface module (hereinafter “Gateway”) that serves as a communication link between the ad hoc hierarchical networks established by the Wireless Reader Tags and an external network, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.
- the Gateway includes at least a network interface and an RF interface for communication with Wireless Reader Tags of the ad hoc networks.
- An asset-tracking application server or equivalent computer system is connected with the external network and obtains through the ad hoc networks information on the tagged assets for compilation, analysis, and/or display.
- FIG. 1 a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in a shipping environment 100 including a warehouse 104 .
- a Wireless Reader Tag 110 (also represented by “LPRF” in the drawings) is attached to each pallet 120 in the shipping environment 100 .
- An actual implementation would involve thousands of pallets and LPRFs; however, for clarity only three pallets 120 and Wireless Reader Tags 110 are shown in FIG. 1 .
- Assets 134 on the pallets 120 each are tagged with a Wireless Tag 130 (also represented by “RFT” in the drawings).
- the Gateway 140 thereby facilitates monitoring, controlling, and querying Wireless Reader Tags 110 and Wireless Tags 130 in the Class-Based Networks using application software running on a server computer 160 connected to the external network 150 .
- the server 160 may be operated on a general purpose computer, such as a personal computer, minicomputer, or mainframe.
- Gateway 180 includes a GPS receiver (not depicted) for determining geographic location of shipping vehicle 184 and a mobile interface such as a cellular or satellite transmitter 186 for transmitting data to server computer 160 via a mobile phone network 188 .
- the Communicator 170 and Gateway 140 , 180 each include a Wireless Reader Tag incorporated therein.
- Gateway 140 , 180 and Communicator 170 each includes the core hardware and software of a Wireless Reader Tag, each can actively participate in the formation, control, and maintenance of the Class-Based Networks.
- Wireless Reader Tags 110 may acquire a class designation by reading Wireless Reader Tags 110 or Wireless Tags 130 nearest to it, and then store the class designation and other profile information in non-volatile read/write memory.
- a WRT can acquire or “adopt” a class designation from a surrounding WRT or WT when that function is provided for in the “profile” of the WRT.
- the class on a pallet will not need to be manually changed because it automatically updates according to location (i.e., near the shipping docks). The same may happen once a driver leaves the parking lot and the radios no longer communicate to a NIM, but now communicate with a MLG.
- the class designations may look like this:
- a “top-down” CBNF routine illustrated in FIGS. 12–21
- the cluster head may be promoted to assume the role of middle-hierarchy primary units, called “sub-primaries.”
- Sub-primaries which continue as secondary units below the first Wireless Reader Tag (cluster head), then provide connectivity for any additional Wireless Reader Tags that are attempting to join the Class-Based Network in clusters headed by the sub-primaries.
- each of the Wireless Reader Tags of the WRT Class “/circle” that received the primary_ready signal in FIG. 12 responds to the primary_ready signal with a registration_request signal.
- Upon receipt of the registration_request signal Wireless Reader Tag 1 assumes the status of a primary unit, while Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 5 assume the status of secondary units.
- FIG. 13A shows the resulting 2-tiered network hierarchy tree representative of the Class-Based Network thus formed between Wireless Reader Tags 1 – 5 .
- the luggage Upon successful check-in, the luggage is placed on the conveyer belt where it is read by another Wireless Reader Tag.
- the profile of each Wireless Tag on the luggage then is modified by altering the Tag_Status field from “check-in” to “luggage-transfer_station — 4334,” which identifies a location of the Wireless Reader Tag at the conveyor belt.
- Multiple Wireless Reader Tags are positioned along the conveyer belt system to identify the specific area of location of the luggage as it progresses. Trucks that deliver the luggage to the plane also have Wireless Reader Tags attached to the truck and alter the Tag_Status to “departure_on-transfer-truck-1441”.
- Yet another Wireless Reader Tag detects and logs the Wireless Tag into the asset-tracking system, whereupon a cross-check is made of the luggage as identified by the WT IDs with the luggage that is supposed to be on the plane. Any luggage that is not supposed to be on the plane is flagged for removal by the asset-tracking system and rerouted to its proper destination. Any luggage that is not accounted for raises an alarm, so that attendants are alerted to its arrival time, its position, or its last known position and an investigation can be made.
- a warehouse store such as Costco carries hundreds of brands of products. Nevertheless, all products need to be inventoried on a real-time basis.
- a Wireless Reader Tag is attached to each pallet of goods and assigned a class designation that denotes the manufacturer of goods on that pallet (e.g., Pillsbury, Sony, Kellogg's, etc.).
- Each Wireless Reader Tag may also include in its class designation or profile, information about the goods on the pallet.
- Each boxes on the pallet carries a Wireless Tag that is read by the Wireless Reader Tag of the pallet.
- each Wireless Reader Tag gathers information about the Wireless Tags on its pallet and relays the information back to the asset-tracking application server.
- an employee of the warehouse store can inventory goods of a selected manufacturer by sending a query that will be received only by Wireless Reader Tags of the selected class corresponding to such manufacturer. Messages directed to a selected class will not appreciably affect the battery life of Wireless Reader Tags of other classes, as only Wireless Reader Tags of the selected class will wake up from standby mode to receive the messages and process the query.
- the manufacturer classes can be divided further into categories and subcategories, thereby further collectively reduce battery consumption and radio interference.
- Containers full of material shipped via rail or ship can be received and logged into a yard by manufacture based on class information stored on Wireless Reader Tags.
- the Wireless Reader Tags form a network with other containers from a particular manufacturer and allow quick and efficient tracking of containers. Messages directed to a selected class will not affect the battery life of Wireless Reader Tags of other classes because only Wireless Reader Tags of the selected class will wake up from standby to receive the messages and process the queries.
- the manufacturer classes can be divided into categories and subcategories, thereby further collectively reduce battery consumption and radio interference.
- each WRT Class has more than one member. Otherwise, the sole member of the WRT Class communicates directly with a Gateway. However, this scenario is contemplated within the scope of the present invention.
- each Wireless Reader Tag includes the capabilities of each Wireless Tag and, therefore, it is contemplated within the scope of the present invention that each Wireless Tag of the present invention could be replaced with a Wireless Reader Tag.
- a Wireless Tag is passive, which is contemplated within the scope of the present invention, then it is believed that the Wireless Tag currently maintains therein only its unique WT ID. Being passive, no other information is maintained in the Wireless Tag. In this case, an associated Wireless Reader Tag maintains the identification of its WT Class in memory as indexed by the respective WT ID of the passive Wireless Tag. Any other information, if maintained, also is stored in the Wireless Reader Tag and indexed by WT ID, where appropriate. Of course, in this scenario, any broadcast generally is answered by each passive Wireless Tag that is within broadcast range and, hence, such implementation of passive Wireless Tags, while within the scope of the present invention, is not preferred.
- a “class-based” network represents a network, nodes of which (and specifically, the data communication devices of the nodes of which) share a common “class” designation, which class designation in such references is representative of an asset class.
- the asset class represents a grouping of assets—whether the same or different—that share something in common, such as an attribute, characteristic, relation, or behavior, and each asset comprises a person or thing that is desired to be tracked or monitored.
- an asset may be an employee, a team member, a law enforcement officer, or a member of the military.
- an asset may be, for example, a good, product, package, item, vehicle, warehoused material, baggage, passenger luggage, shipping container, belonging, commodity, effect, resource, or merchandise.
- the data communication devices of the class-based networks also are disclosed as being low power radio frequency (LPRF) devices, and each device is disclosed as preferably including a standards based radio such as, for example, a Bluetooth radio. Each data communication device further is disclosed as preferably including memory for storing sensor-acquired data.
- LPRF low power radio frequency
- a remote sensor interface (RSI) network as used herein and in some of the incorporated references represents a network, nodes of which (and specifically, the data communication devices of the nodes of which) each are disposed in electronic communication with one or more sensors for acquiring data there from.
- the RSI network may be a class-based network, in which case the nodes also share a common class designation representative of an asset class.
- the embodiments of the class-based networks described above, and those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,745,027 B2 and in application publication No. U.S. 2005/0093703 A1 each comprises an RSI network when the data communication devices of the nodes include sensor-acquired information obtained from associated sensors.
