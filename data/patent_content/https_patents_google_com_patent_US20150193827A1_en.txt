- mobile devices are capable of accessing email, the Internet, and remote networks.
- Mobile processors are quicker and more efficient. Battery life is longer.
- Color displays are now the norm, with resolutions approaching the limit of human perception. In light of these advances, consumers are turning to their mobile devices to make purchases, resulting in a burgeoning mobile commerce environment.
- a typical loyalty program required the consumer to fill out a form to enroll, often after purchasing the merchants' products. As a reward, the consumer would be able to take advantage of sales offered by the merchant. If the consumer did not enroll, however, he or she would miss out on the sales. As such, the consumer was often compelled to take the additional time to fill out the requisite forms to join the loyalty program. Not only is this an inconvenience, but the loyalty program was most likely only valid for the particular merchant, or chain, that the consumer was patronizing. If the consumer went elsewhere, he or she would have to enroll in a different loyalty program.

- FIG. 1 is a graphical representation of a platform architecture in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.
- system 100 includes mobile devices 105 a . . . 105 n (hereinafter referred to as mobile device 105 ).
- the mobile device 105 is communicatively coupled to a contactless (e.g., proximity or NFC) reader 250 within a merchant POS system 120 and a mobile wallet platform 125 .
- Reader 250 is also communicatively coupled to the merchant POS system 120 .
- the merchant POS system 120 may be within the same housing as the contactless reader 250 .
- the merchant POS system 120 and contactless reader 250 are communicatively coupled with each other but each of these components is housed separately.
- Mobile device 105 may be, for example, a smartphone, tablet, or the like. As illustrated in FIG. 2 , the mobile device may include a processor 205 , memory 200 , a contactless frontend (CLF) 235 , a baseband modem 210 , and a user interface such as a display (not shown).

If memory restrictions and performance requirements limit the amount of loyalty/offers data that can be stored on secure element 115 , additional data can be stored in mobile device memory 200 and managed by the consumer via commerce widget 215 . For example, any graphic images related to an offer can be stored in memory 200 in order to optimize secure element memory allocation. Loyalty/offers data management can be handled by the corresponding offer platform, loyalty platform, or rewards platform within the mobile commerce platform 135 .
- Commerce applet 240 includes a cached merchant data table enabling the storage/management of all data related to a given merchant. This allows the commerce data for a given merchant to be pre-loaded in secure element 115 or mobile device 105 by a wallet application. Exemplary commerce elements (and their corresponding tag values used during Tag Length Value (TLV) encoding) that are included in the cached merchant data table are defined below. This data is stored in a record oriented data buffer.

- communications between the aforementioned devices may include communications with or through other intervening systems, hardware, and/or software, and such communications may include receiving, transferring, and/or managing data.
- a mobile wallet application 110 stored on mobile device 105 includes instructions which, when executed by the processor of the mobile device 105 , cause the mobile device 105 to act as an instrument, for example, for processing transactions such as contactless commerce and/or payment transactions.
- Mobile wallet 110 communicates, through the use of APDU commands as defined in ISO 7816-4, with the commerce applet 240 via commerce API 225 and to payment applet 245 via payment API 230 .
- Commerce widget 215 is a component of the mobile wallet 110 that provides an interface for consumers to manage commerce elements (e.g., loyalty card credentials, offers and rewards), for example, through interactions with the display or user interface of a mobile device 105 .
- Commerce widget 215 maintains, for example, a master list of commerce elements present on the handset in a memory of the mobile device (e.g., 200 ).
- a subset of offers that have been identified as ready to be used are, in turn, moved to secure element 115 to be communicated to contactless reader 250 and POS terminal 120 .
- Sensitive information such as loyalty account identifiers, can be stored on secure element 115 .
- each secure element 115 is identified by a unique identification number, which may be either numeric or alphanumeric.
- each mobile wallet itself stores a customer ID (CID), which is a unique number associated with the owner of the mobile wallet. While the CID may be stored in memory 200 , since the CID is associated with a unique individual, the CID is preferably stored in the secure element 115 , and provided to the contactless reader 250 during a contactless transaction.
- CID customer ID
- Payment widget 220 is a component of the mobile wallet 110 that provides an interface for consumers to manage payment elements (e.g., credit or debit card credentials), for example, through interactions with the display or user interface of a mobile device.
- payment elements e.g., credit or debit card credentials
- Contactless reader 250 includes a reader commerce application 260 (referred to herein simply as a “reader application”) and a POS interface 270 .
- Contactless reader 250 manages two interfaces: one interface is with the secure element 115 in the mobile device 105 and the other interface is with the merchant POS system 120 which includes a reader interface 285 and a commerce application data handler 280 .
- the functionality of the contactless reader 250 is the same whether the contactless reader 250 is standalone and connected to merchant POS system 120 , or is integrated therein.
- Contactless payment functionality is also contained in the contactless reader 250 but is not shown.
- mobile device 105 is further communicatively coupled to a mobile wallet platform 125 , which in turn is communicatively coupled to the mobile commerce platform 135 through the enterprise service bus (ESB) 130 .
- ESD enterprise service bus
- the mobile commerce platform includes the offers platform, loyalty platform, and rewards platform.
- the merchant system 140 may be communicatively coupled to the mobile commerce platform 135 and the merchant POS system 120 .
- the merchant system 140 includes a database 145 and analytic engine 150 which are embodied in a processor and memory (not shown). The functionality of the analytic engine 150 is provided by interactions between the processor and the control programs stored in the memory.
- the merchant system 140 may transmit and receive data from either the mobile commerce platform 135 or the merchant POS system 120 . Transmissions through the mobile commerce platform 135 may be further sent, through the ESB 130 and mobile wallet platform 125 , to a mobile device 105 . Transmissions to the merchant POS system 120 may be through one or more wireless or wired communications (including, for example, telephonic, cell, internet, Ethernet, satellite, or radio communications).
- the mobile device 105 may be used to conduct a contactless transaction at a merchant POS system 120 equipped with the contactless reader 120 .
- the mobile device 105 is placed within a predetermined required proximity of the contactless reader 250 (i.e., taps) causing CLF 235 of the mobile device 105 to communicate with the contactless reader 250 using, for example, NFC ISO 14443 protocols.
- Contactless reader 250 also communicates with the mobile wallet 110 , commerce applet 240 , and/or payment applications on the mobile device 105 to execute contactless transactions.
- a secure element employs a Proximity Payment System Environment (PPSE) that serves as a directory of available credentials currently stored in secure element 115 . Each credential is assigned a corresponding application identifier (AID) associated with a payment application and stored in the PPSE.
- PPSE Proximity Payment System Environment
- AID application identifier
- PPSE is an application used to maintain a list of payment applications stored on secure element 115 , and provides accessibility to each payment application stored on the mobile device 105 by making them visible or not visible (i.e., accessible) to systems or devices.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating some of the components used in a first embodiment.
- the mobile device 105 is capable of communicating with the contactless reader 250 , as described above.
- the contactless reader 250 is part of the merchant POS system 120 , which itself is communicatively coupled to the merchant system 140 .
- the merchant system 140 may, in one embodiment, be within the same physical structure as the merchant POS system 120 , or could be physically separate.
- FIG. 4A is a sequence diagram illustrating a method of generating targeted communications according to the first embodiment.
- a user taps his or her mobile device 105 to the contactless reader 250 , causing CLF 235 to communicate with the contactless reader 250 .
- CLF 235 communicates with payment API 265 to transfer the payment elements.
- the CID also is transmitted from secure element 115 on the mobile device 105 to the contactless reader 250 .
- the reader application 260 then transfers the received payment elements and CID to the POS interface 270 and out to the reader interface 285 , which is managed by the commercial application data handler 280 , completing a transfer of the payment elements and CID to the merchant POS system 120 (S 400 ). If, however, the contactless transaction was not a payment transaction, but some other type of transaction that relates to an application stored on the commerce applet 240 , then the relevant elements would be transmitted to the merchant POS system 120 from the commerce applet 240 .
- step S 405 the merchant POS system 120 transmits the received CID and payment elements (if applicable) to the merchant system 140 .
- the contactless transaction includes the purchase of goods
- information on the goods purchased may also be transmitted to the merchant system 140 from the merchant POS system 120 .
- other salient information may be transmitted to the merchant system 140 including information on the physical location of the merchant POS system 120 .
- Information regarding the physical location of the merchant POS system 120 may simply be an identification number for merchant POS system 120 or the contactless reader 250 to which it is communicatively coupled. The information may also be the mailing address of the location or its GPS coordinates.
- merchant system 140 includes an analytic engine 150 and database 145 .
- the analytic engine 150 compares the received CID to information stored in profiles in the database 145 .
- a profile is a database entry that includes at least one, and typically more than one, field. Each field stores a type of information. For example, one field stores a CID corresponding to the rest of the information stored in the profile and serves as one mechanism for identifying the profile. Other fields may be used to store the payment elements, items purchased, location of the merchant POS system 120 , date and time of the contactless transaction, along with any other type of information desired to be catalogued.
- the analytic engine determines that no profile contains a field with a matching CID, then a new profile corresponding to the received CID is generated with at least one field containing the received CID. The newly-generated profile is then updated to include additional fields respectively corresponding to the information received from the merchant POS system 120 . If, in S 410 , the analytic engine determines that a profile contains a field that matches the received CID, then the fields within that profile are updated to include the information received from the merchant POS system 120 .
- one of the fields may include a frequency counter representing the number of times that the CID corresponding to the profile, containing that field, has been updated.
- the analytic engine updates this field by incrementing the counter to indicate that the CID was received (which itself represents that a contactless transaction involving the corresponding mobile device 105 occurred).
- a profile is not limited to one counter. Additional counters may be provided to track the frequency of other types of information. For example, a counter corresponding to location information (e.g., GPS coordinates) may be provided, and each time that location information is received from the merchant POS system 120 , the counter may be updated.
- the location information could be any type of information regarding the location of the merchant POS system 120 , like the examples discussed above.
- the analytic engine 150 is constructed to analyze the information stored in the database to generate targeted communications (S 415 ).
- targeted communications There may be a variety of kinds of targeted communications including, for example, offers, coupons, reward, advertising, purchase history, sale, or status information, but the targeted communications may be generally classified into two types.
- the first type of targeted communications is a reward type targeted communication which includes information indicating that item(s) will be free during the next transaction. Coupons and offers (which show price reductions) may also be considered a reward type targeted communications.
- the second type of targeted communications is non-reward type targeted communications, which includes advertisements, purchase history, sale, or status information.
- the analytic engine 150 may be constructed to generate one or more of these types of messages upon the occurrence of certain events, as determined by an analysis of information within the database 145 . For example, if the analytic engine 150 determines that the received CID corresponds to a particular profile and a corresponding counter for that profile is incremented such that the value of the counter is now equal to or greater than a threshold for issuing a reward type targeted communication, then the analytic engine 150 may set a flag, indicating that a reward level has been reached, and generate a reward type targeted communication for transmission to the merchant POS system 120 (S 420 ). Upon receipt of the reward type targeted communication from the merchant system 140 , the merchant POS system 120 may display (S 425 ) the communication on its display (not shown). Of course, the display may also display the other types of targeted communications as well.
- the analytic engine 150 will generate a status type targeted communication for transmission and display on the merchant POS system 120 in S 425 .
- the status type targeted communication indicates the progression to the next reward, and may be accompanied by one or more other types of targeted communications, such as a coupon or offer.
- an advertising type targeted communication may be displayed concurrently with the status type message on the merchant POS system 120 , in order to entice further purchases.
- a transaction receipt may also be included and displayed on the mobile device 105 .
- the payment information and CID for the subsequent purchase is transmitted to the merchant POS system 120 through the contactless reader 250 in the same manner as described above.
- the CID is transmitted to the merchant system 140 (along with information on the goods purchased).
- the analytic engine 150 determines whether a flag, indicating that a reward level has been reached, is set in the profile corresponding to the received CID.
- the analytic engine may also analyze the purchased goods to determine whether an item therein is reward eligible (S 440 ). If one of the purchased items is reward eligible, then the merchant system 140 will generate a reward redemption type targeted communication (S 445 ), and transmit that communication to the merchant POS system 120 for display (S 450 ). If the reward is redeemed, then information indicating that decision is transmitted to the merchant system 140 (S 460 ). The previous payment is refunded (or partially refunded) through communication with the mobile commerce platform 135 . The analytic engine 150 clears the flag in the profile, and sets a new threshold (or simply resets the counter) for a reward type targeted communication in the profile (S 470 ).
- the system may also be configured, however, to redeem an earned reward during the same transaction.
- a reward type targeted communication is generated and delivered to the merchant POS system 120 . If the reward is redeemed at that time, such redemption information is transmitted back to the merchant system 140 and the payment is refunded (or partially refunded) through the mobile commerce platform 135 .
- the analytic engine 150 clears the flag and sets a new threshold (or simply resets the counter) for a reward type targeted communication in the profile.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram corresponding to the second embodiment which is directed to a frequency targeted communication system using an unattended point of sale system.
- FIG. 5 is similar to FIG. 3 , except the merchant POS system 120 has been replaced by an unattended POS system 405 .
- An example of an unattended POS system 405 may be a vending machine.
- the unattended POS system 405 operates without the involvement of an operator, and functions in the same manner as the merchant POS system 120 described above.
- the communications and transmissions of data between the mobile device 105 and the unattended POS system 405 are substantially the same as described above between the mobile device 105 and the merchant POS system 120 . Accordingly, discussions of these features are omitted for brevity.
- FIG. 6A is a sequence diagram illustrating a consumer's interaction with the unattended POS system 405 .
- the payment elements and CID are transmitted to the unattended POS system 405 (S 600 ).
- the unattended POS system then transmits the received CID to the merchant system 140 (S 605 ).
- information on the goods purchased may be transmitted to the merchant system 140 , but typically is not.
- the unattended POS system 405 likely has relatively few offerings for purchase, and that such units are typically equipped with only basic processing and communications infrastructure out of an effort to keep the costs of the unattended POS system 405 low.
- the same type of information transmitted to the merchant POS system 120 in the first embodiment could also be transmitted to the merchant system 140 in the second embodiment.
- the merchant system 140 upon receipt of the CID information, analyzes the received CID information and updates the database 145 .
- the analytic engine 150 determines whether a profile exists in the database 145 with a field that contains the same CID value as the CID received from the unattended POS system 405 . If so, then a counter value, stored in a field within the profile corresponding to the received CID, is incremented to denote the contactless transaction (e.g., a purchase operation).
- the analytic engine 150 analyzes the updated profile to determine whether the counter is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold for issuing a reward type targeted communication.
- a status type targeted communication is generated (S 615 ) and transmitted to the unattended POS system 405 (S 620 ). If, however, the threshold has been reached or exceeded, then a flag indicating that a reward level has been reached is set in the profile corresponding to the received CID, and a reward type targeted communication is generated (S 615 ) and transmitted to the unattended POS system 405 (S 620 ). In either event, the targeted communication received from the merchant system 140 is displayed on a display (not shown) connected to the unattended POS system 405 (S 625 ).
- the merchant system 140 upon receiving the CID from the unattended POS system (S 630 & S 635 ), determines that a flag, indicating a reward level has been reached, is set in a profile corresponding to the received CID, then merchant system 140 generates (S 645 ) and transmits (S 650 ) a reward redemption type targeted communication to the unattended POS system 405 for display.
- goods information is typically not conveyed from the unattended POS system 405 to the merchant system 140 . Nevertheless, in an embodiment where such information is transmitted to the merchant system 140 , then the analytic engine 150 may further analyze the subsequently purchased goods to ensure that the purchased good is reward eligible.
- the unattended POS system 405 Upon receipt of the reward type targeted communication from the merchant system 140 , the unattended POS system 405 automatically displays (S 655 ) a reward redemption type targeted communication, indicating that the corresponding purchase has been refunded (or partially refunded). The unattended POS system 405 then transmits reward redemption information to the merchant system 140 indicating that the reward has been used (S 660 ). The merchant system 140 updates the database 145 accordingly, by clearing the flag in the corresponding profile and setting a new threshold for a reward (S 665 ) (or simply resetting the value of the counter).
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram corresponding to a system of the third embodiment.
- a mobile device 150 is communicatively coupled to the merchant POS system 120 through the contactless reader 250 .
- the merchant POS system 120 is also communicatively coupled to the merchant system 140 .
- the communications between these elements are substantially the same as discussed above in the first embodiment. Accordingly, a description thereof is omitted for brevity.
- the merchant system 140 is in bidirectional communication with a service provider platform 700 .
- the service provider platform includes the mobile wallet platform 125 , ESB 130 , and mobile commerce platform 135 .
- FIG. 8 illustrates one example of a pseudo loyalty type system.
- the CID is transmitted to the merchant POS system 120 through the contactless reader 250 , as described above (S 800 ).
- the merchant POS system 120 transmits the CID along with, in one embodiment, any purchase information to the merchant system 140 (S 805 ).
- the merchant system 140 analyzes the database 145 to determine whether an account exists that corresponds to the CID.
- An account in this embodiment is similar to the profile discussed above. Structurally, the account is the same as the profile, in that it represents a database entry that contains one or more fields which may be populated with a variety of information.
- the account differs from the profile in that the account is assigned an account number which represents membership in a loyalty program.
- the merchant system 140 determines that an account corresponding to the received CID does not exist in the database 145 , then the merchant system 140 creates a new account and assigns the account an account number (S 810 ).
- a merchant system is capable of provisioning onto the secure element 115 one or more commerce applets 240 .
- a commerce applet 240 stores both loyalty and offer related data.
- the merchant system 140 effects such provisioning by transmitting the account information to the service provider platform 700 , specifically the mobile commerce platform 135 (S 815 ).
- the account information includes the account number and may also include any initial point information assigned according to a loyalty program's calculation (as computed by the analytic engine 150 ) based on the purchases at the merchant POS system 120 .
- the account information may also be transmitted with a targeted communication that contains, for example, an introductory greeting.
- the mobile commerce platform 135 includes an offer platform, loyalty platform, and reward platform.
- the account information received by the mobile commerce platform 135 is communicated to the loyalty platform, which in turns generates an instruction set for provisioning a new commerce applet 240 on the mobile device 105 . That instruction set is transmitted (S 820 ) to the mobile wallet platform 125 for execution, which results in the provisioning of the new commerce applet 240 on the secure element 115 of the mobile device 105 (S 825 ). If the account information included a targeted communication, then that communication is now displayed on the mobile device 105 ( 5830 ).
- One of the advantages of the system shown in FIG. 8 is that no additional interaction from the user is required. Since the CID is transmitted during the contactless transaction, the user is not required to complete any additional steps in order to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program. Moreover, the merchant benefits by receiving purchase information from a user who was not previously enrolled in his/her loyalty program. In previous systems, that user's purchase information would have been unavailable to the merchant.
- a user's account number which is now contained within the commerce applet 240 on the secure element 115 , may also be transmitted along with the CID to the merchant POS system 120 , and then onto the merchant system 140 .
- the CID and/or account number allow the user to participate in loyalty program savings (such as sales price on certain items) without the need to present a loyalty card or provide any additional information unrelated to the payment process (such as a telephone number or address).
- the merchant system 140 may from time to time communicate coupons, offers, and rewards to the merchant's commerce applet 240 on the mobile device 105 through the mobile commerce platform 135 . These coupons, offers, and rewards may be redeemed during a contactless transaction, as they may be included in the payment elements communicated from the commerce applet 240 to the contactless reader 250 (as described above).
- the mobile wallet service provider can access the information stored in the merchant system database 145 by supplying the merchant system 140 with a user's CID or loyalty account information (or both), which acts as a password.
- the mobile wallet service provider can also receive information on contactless transactions at any time from the merchant system 140 .
- FIG. 9 illustrates a fourth embodiment representing an automated loyalty program enrollment system.
- the overall system may be structured in the same manner as illustrated in FIG. 7 .
- the automated enrollment process need not occur at a point-of-sale system (such as the merchant POS system 120 ), but may occur at a separate system designated for, among other functions, enrolling consumers in a loyalty program, without processing sales transactions.
- a user initiates a contactless transaction by tapping his/her mobile device 105 to a contactless reader 250 of, in this example, a merchant POS system 120 .
- the CID is transmitted to the merchant POS system 120 (S 900 ).
- the commercial application data handler 280 generates a query asking if the user would like to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program. The query is transmitted through the reader interface 285 to the POS interface 270 and subsequently transmitted to the mobile device 105 through the CLF 235 .
- Processor 205 causes the query to be displayed on the mobile device display (not shown). An election can then be made as to whether to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program.
- the information regarding the same is transmitted to the contactless reader 250 through the CLF 235 and then transmitted to the commercial application data handler 280 , through the POS interface 270 and the reader interface 285 . If the election is to participate in the merchant's loyalty program, then an enrollment request and the CID are transmitted from the merchant POS system to the merchant system 140 (S 905 ).
- the merchant system 140 Upon receipt of the enrollment request and the CID, the merchant system 140 requests salient user data from the service provider platform 700 (S 910 ), which the merchant system 140 will use to create the loyalty account in the database 145 and populate the fields therein. Prior to transmitting such information, however, the merchant system's 140 credentials are challenged by the mobile commerce platform 135 to ensure that the merchant system 140 is authorized to access such information. If the challenges are successful, then the service provider platform 700 sends the user's data to the merchant system 140 (S 915 ). The merchant system 140 generates a loyalty account in the database 145 and the analytic engine uses the received user data to populate various fields, such as name, address, telephone number, and the like (S 920 ). Once the account has been generated, the merchant system 140 provides the account information to the service provider platform 700 , specifically the mobile commerce platform 135 (S 925 ). Such information may include, for example, the loyalty account number.
- the mobile commerce platform 135 transmits the account information to the commerce platform, which in turns generates an instruction set for provisioning a new commerce applet 240 on the mobile device 105 . That instruction set is transmitted (S 930 ) to the mobile wallet platform 125 for execution, which results in the provisioning of the new commerce applet 240 on the secure element 115 of the mobile device 105 (S 935 ).
- the merchant system may also generate a targeted communication for transmission to the mobile wallet 110 (S 940 ).
- the targeted communication may be an initial greeting and/or another type of targeted communication such as a coupon, offer, or even a reward.
- the merchant system 140 transmits the targeted communication to the service provider platform 700 (S 945 ), which in turn transmits the targeted communication to the mobile device 105 (S 950 ).
- FIG. 10A is a sequence diagram illustrating a pseudo loyalty and targeted communication system operation.
- the overall system may be structured in substantially the same manner as illustrated in FIG. 7 .
- the operation of this system is similar to the operation of the first embodiment, except, as described below, the targeted communication is transmitted to the service provider platform 700 rather than the merchant POS system 120 .
- payment elements and the CID are transferred to a contactless reader 250 in the merchant POS system 120 during a contactless transaction, as described above (S 1000 ).
- the CID and the purchase information are transferred to the merchant system 140 (S 1005 ).
- the merchant system 140 analyzes the received CID to determine whether a corresponding profile in database 145 exists. If not, then the merchant system 140 creates such a profile in the database 145 , and populates its fields according the CID and purchase information received from the merchant POS system 120 .
- the analytic engine 150 is configured to analyze the information stored within the profile and generate targeted communications in accordance with that analysis. Also as discussed above, one type of targeted communication is a reward type targeted communication. When the analytic engine 150 determines that a reward level has been reached, as described below, a flag is set in the profile indicating that a reward is available, and a corresponding reward type targeted communication is generated for transmission to the service provider platform 700 , and from there to the mobile device 105 .
- the analytic engine 150 may employ a variety of different analyses to determine whether a reward level has been reached, depending upon the merchant's intentions.
- the analytic engine 150 may employ a simple frequency counter whose value is stored in a field and corresponds to the number of times the CID has been received by the merchant system 140 .
- the analytic engine 150 may be configured to generate a reward type targeted communication when the counter value exceeds a predetermined value.
- the analytic engine 150 may also be configured to analyze the total value of the goods purchased by summing the price information stored in one of the fields within the profile.
- the analytic engine 150 may be configured to generate a reward type targeted communication when the sum value of the goods purchased exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- the use of the total value of the goods purchased may be substituted as a metric for other information stored in a different field within the profile to determine whether a reward threshold has been reached including, for example, the quantity of items purchased, the quantity of any particular item, or the dollar value of any particular items.
- the merchant POS system 120 transmits additional information, such as geographical information, that information could also be used to determine whether to generate a reward-type targeted communication.
- geographic information the analytic engine 150 may track the user's purchases at several different locations and even generate location-based targeted communications. For example, a user may receive a special reward for conducting contactless transactions at multiple store locations.
- the analytic engine 140 generates a targeted communication (S 1020 ) and transmits that targeted communication to the service provider platform 700 , specifically the mobile commerce platform 135 (S 1021 ).
- the mobile commerce platform 135 analyzes the contents of the targeted communication to determine whether it is necessary to provision a new commerce applet 240 on the secure element 115 (as described above). If the targeted communication is a reward-type targeted communication, then the mobile commerce platform 135 analyzes the reward information, included in the targeted communication, and updates the commerce applet 240 accordingly (S 1025 ). Doing so allows for such reward information to be available for transmission to the merchant POS system 120 in a subsequent transaction. Finally, if the targeted communication includes a graphical display, then those graphical elements are transmitted to the memory 200 on the mobile device and then caused to be displayed on the display of the mobile device (not shown) (S 1030 ).
- FIG. 10B is a sequence diagram illustrating the process of redeeming a reward-type targeted communication according to the fifth embodiment.
- the mobile commerce platform 135 receives the reward type targeted communication from the merchant system 140 , and updates a corresponding commerce application on the secure element 115 accordingly.
- the mobile device 105 transfers to the contactless reader 250 the CID along with the reward and purchase elements contained in the commerce applet 240 (S 1040 ).
- the merchant POS system 120 in turn transfers the CID, the reward and purchase elements, and information on the goods purchased by the user, to the merchant system 140 (S 1045 ).
- the analytic engine 150 proceeds to update the consumer profile based on such information (S 1050 ).
- the analytic engine 150 may also compare the reward elements transmitted from the mobile device 105 with the goods purchased to determine whether a qualifying purchase was made.
- the merchant system 140 sends a refund request (or a partial refund request as the case may be) to the mobile commerce platform 135 for processing.
- the analytic engine 150 then removes the flag indicating that a reward level has been reached and resets the threshold for indicating a reward level to an appropriate value (S 1055 ).
- the merchant system 140 then transmits an update to the mobile device 105 (S 1060 and S 1065 ), through the service provider platform 700 . Since the update indicates that the reward has been redeemed, the mobile commerce platform 135 generates an instruction set for removing the reward elements from the commerce applet 240 , and transfers that instruction set to the mobile wallet platform for execution by the mobile device 105 (S 1070 ).
- FIG. 11 is a sequence diagram illustrating a historically-enriched method of generating targeted communications according to the sixth embodiment.
- a mobile device may be used to make contactless transactions, without enrolling in a merchant's loyalty program. However, should the user later elect to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program, then the user's historical transaction data may be used to populate a corresponding profile stored in database 145 as discussed below.
- the CID and purchase elements are transferred from the mobile device 105 to the contactless reader 250 of the merchant POS system 120 (S 1100 ).
- the CID and purchase information are then transferred to the merchant system 140 , along with information on the goods purchased (S 1105 ).
- the merchant system 140 compares the received CID to CIDs stored in the database 145 and respectively associated with a plurality of profiles, to determine whether a corresponding profile exists.
- the merchant system 140 creates a corresponding profile and populates that profile with the CID and purchase information (along with the information on the purchased goods) received from the merchant POS system 120 . If a corresponding profile does exist, then the merchant system 140 updates the corresponding profile to include the purchase information (along with the information on the purchased goods) received from the merchant POS system 120 (S 1110 ).
- an enrollment request is received by the merchant system 140 (S 1115 ) processed. More specifically, an account is generated in the database 145 and the fields therein are populated with the information provided by the mobile device 105 (or alternatively the user through another medium). Once the account is generated, an enrollment confirmation is transmitted to the mobile device 105 , via the mobile commerce platform 135 and the mobile wallet platform 125 (S 1120 and S 1121 ). Commerce applet 240 is then updated to include corresponding loyalty information, such as a loyalty account number.
- the enrollment request may be received by the merchant POS system 120 , or another merchant system comprising a contactless reader, and then forwarded to the merchant system 140 .
- the user may use his/her data connection on the mobile device 105 to enroll in the loyalty program through the Internet.
- the CID, loyalty information, and payment elements are transferred to the merchant POS system 120 (S 1125 ) and then transmitted to the merchant system 140 (S 1130 ).
- the merchant system 140 associates the received CID and received loyalty information, and then analyzes the database 145 to determine whether the database contains historical transaction data stored in a profile that corresponds to the received CID.
- the merchant system 140 associates the historical transaction data with the loyalty information, and populates the fields within the profile with the loyalty information (S 1135 ).
- the merchant system 140 then generates a corresponding targeted communication (S 1140 ). If the merchant system 140 determined that historical data corresponding to the received CID is contained within the database 145 and successfully associated that data with the received loyalty information, then the merchant system 140 generates a targeted communication notifying of the successful association.
- the merchant system 140 could be configured to generate additional targeted communications as well. For example, if the successful association results in a reward indicator crossing a predetermined threshold for issuing a reward type targeted communication, then such a message may be transmitted along with the notification of successful association in S 1140 . Regardless of the type of targeted communication generated in S 1140 , the targeted communication is then relayed to the service provider platform 700 (S 1145 ) which, in turn, relays the targeted communication to the mobile device 105 (S 1150 ).

Abstract
Description
- This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/925,048, 61/925,050, and 61/925,054, each of which was filed Jan. 8, 2014, and the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
- 1. Field of the Invention
- The present invention generally relates to acquiring data from a mobile device, more particularly, to systems, methods, and computer program products for generating targeted communications based on acquired information from a mobile device.
- 2. Related Art
- Mobile devices, e.g. mobile phones and tablets, have become multidimensional tools capable of accomplishing a variety of tasks. No longer confined to merely making and receiving phone calls, mobile devices are capable of accessing email, the Internet, and remote networks. These added capabilities are a result of decades of improvement in mobile technology. Mobile processors are quicker and more efficient. Battery life is longer. Color displays are now the norm, with resolutions approaching the limit of human perception. In light of these advances, consumers are turning to their mobile devices to make purchases, resulting in a burgeoning mobile commerce environment.
- In a mobile commerce environment, a user uses his/her mobile device to browse, compare, buy, and review products and services. The rise of mobile commerce has also resulted in a rethinking of how consumers and merchants interact. Traditionally, merchants have sought information on their customers' buying habits. With this information, merchants are better equipped to offer their customers more useful sales and offers, thereby increasing customer satisfaction while simultaneously increasing sales. However, collecting and analyzing this information has been a cumbersome, laborious process for both merchant and consumer.
- To attempt to collect relevant information, merchants would create loyalty programs. A typical loyalty program required the consumer to fill out a form to enroll, often after purchasing the merchants' products. As a reward, the consumer would be able to take advantage of sales offered by the merchant. If the consumer did not enroll, however, he or she would miss out on the sales. As such, the consumer was often compelled to take the additional time to fill out the requisite forms to join the loyalty program. Not only is this an inconvenience, but the loyalty program was most likely only valid for the particular merchant, or chain, that the consumer was patronizing. If the consumer went elsewhere, he or she would have to enroll in a different loyalty program. This impediment often led consumers to only enroll at stores they patronized frequently, meaning that merchants typically only had access to purchase information from a subset of his or her customers. In addition to these flaws, the traditional loyalty program relied upon the consumer to either provide their loyalty card or, if they did not have the card on them, to provide personal information such as a telephone number to identify himself or herself to the merchant prior to checking out. This additional step beyond paying delays the checkout process and thus disincentives the consumer to participate. Therefore, there is a need for an improved technological system to provide suitable data collection for the merchant while offering the consumer incentives to participate.
- The present invention provides methods, apparatuses, and computer readable mediums for generating a targeted communication based on acquired information from a mobile device.
- In one embodiment, a method of generating a targeted communication is provided. The method includes receiving, updating, determining, and generating steps. In the receiving step, user identification information from a contactless reading unit is received. In the updating step, a profile corresponding to the user identification information is updated based on the received user identification information. In the determining step, a type of targeted communication for transmission is determined. In the generation step, a targeted communication is generated based on the determination.
- In another embodiment, an apparatus for generating a targeted communication is provided. The apparatus includes a communication unit, a memory, and an analytic engine embodied in a processor. The communication unit is constructed to receive user identification information from a contactless reading unit. The memory is constructed to store a database that includes a profile corresponding to the received user identification information. The analytic engine is constructed to: update the profile corresponding to the received user identification information based on the received user identification information, determine a type of targeted communication for transmission based on the profile, and generate a targeted communication based on the determination.
- In yet another embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores a program configured to a cause an apparatus to execute a method of generating a targeted communication is provided. The method includes receiving, updating, determining, and generating steps. User identification information is received from a contactless reading unit. A profile corresponding to the user identification information is updated information based on the received user identification information. A type of targeted communication for transmission is determined based on the profile, and the targeted communication is generated based on the determination.
- In yet another embodiment, a method of generating a user account is provided. User identification information is received from a contactless transaction unit, and a user account is generated based on the received user identification information.

- The terms “application”, “applet”, “widget”, and/or the plural form of these terms are used interchangeably herein to refer to an application (functioning independently or in conjunction with other applications) or set or subset of instructions or code, which when executed by one or more processors (e.g., in a mobile device, card reader, terminal, point of sale (POS) system, or server) causes the processor(s) to perform specific tasks. For example, a wallet application can be used to conduct transaction or interface related functions such as storing, processing, accessing or transmitting financial, loyalty, offer, membership, or account data. A wallet application may also incorporate or interact with one or more payment applications, such as ExpressPay from American Express®, Discover® Network ZipSM, MasterCard® PayPass™ and Visa payWave™ payment applets.
- Generally, commerce-related services are made available through a suite of applications available on several different platforms. The first application (or suite of applications) exists onboard a server within a mobile commerce (MoCom)
platform 135. TheMoCom platform 135 is responsible for the management of consumer data, including loyalty accounts and offers. In addition, theMoCom platform 135 serves as a campaign manager for offers, providing a remote data store for offers made available to the consumer via the available merchant portals within a wallet application. - A second application exists onboard a mobile device in the form of a mobile wallet application (also referred to as a mobile wallet). The mobile wallet provides the consumer's primary user interface (UI) and additional commerce application services through which the wallet application may access additional resources onboard a secure element (SE) of a mobile device.
- A third application exists onboard a secure element of a mobile device in the form of a JavaCard applet. This applet stores commerce-related data such as loyalty and offer data and provides an interface through which the data may be managed. The applet is accessible through the use of Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) commands as defined in International Standards Organization (ISO) 7816-4.
- The fourth application exists onboard an NFC-enabled reader (referred to herein simply as a “contactless reader”). The contactless reader can be either a stand-alone device or attached to (and managed by) a point of sale (POS) terminal. This application facilitates or provides access to the interface with a secure element on a mobile device, performing specific tasks that optimize the APDU command/data exchange tasks. For example, it includes the reading of loyalty, offer, and identification information following the placement of a mobile device in proximity of a reader (i.e., a “tap”).
- A fifth application (or suite of applications) exists onboard a merchant POS system, including a POS terminal and any additional merchant-specific hardware/software. These applications manage the data related to payment/loyalty/offers/rewards/identification information received from a secure element on a mobile device via a reader. In most cases, this data will then be forwarded to a
corresponding MoCom 135 or merchant specific platform(s). -
FIG. 1 is a graphical representation of a platform architecture in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. As shown inFIG. 1 ,system 100 includesmobile devices 105 a . . . 105 n (hereinafter referred to as mobile device 105). Themobile device 105 is communicatively coupled to a contactless (e.g., proximity or NFC)reader 250 within amerchant POS system 120 and amobile wallet platform 125.Reader 250 is also communicatively coupled to themerchant POS system 120. Themerchant POS system 120 may be within the same housing as thecontactless reader 250. Alternatively, themerchant POS system 120 andcontactless reader 250 are communicatively coupled with each other but each of these components is housed separately. -
Mobile device 105 may be, for example, a smartphone, tablet, or the like. As illustrated inFIG. 2 , the mobile device may include aprocessor 205,memory 200, a contactless frontend (CLF) 235, abaseband modem 210, and a user interface such as a display (not shown).Baseband modem 210 is a digital modem that is used for mobile network communications.CLF 235 is circuitry which handles the analog aspect of contactless or NFC communications and the communication protocol layers of a contactless transmission link.CLF 235 also is used to exchange data between thecontactless reader 250 and a secure element (or SE) 115 contained inmobile device 105, for example, to execute contactless transactions. -
Secure element 115 may be implemented as a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), embedded SE card, secure micro secure digital (microSD) card, and the like. A secure element may also be implemented outside of the mobile device with which it is associated. For example, a secure element may be implemented in a cloud-based, remote, or virtual storage, and the like.Secure element 115 is generally considered secure because it is a self-contained system, including dedicated memory, and is protected by hardware and software hardening techniques that are verified by independent testing. -
Secure element 115 includes (e.g., stored thereon) one ormore commerce applets 240. Eachcommerce applet 240 is associated with a commerce service and an account issued by a commerce service provider (SP). A service provider is a company, organization, entity, or the like, that provides services to customers or consumers. Examples of service providers include account-issuing entities such as banks, merchants, card associations, marketing companies, and transit authorities. A service may be an activity, capability, functionality, work, or use that is permitted or provided by a service provider, such as a payment service, credit, debit, checking, gift, offer or loyalty service, transit pass service, and the like. - A commerce service provider can provision (or have provisioned) onto
secure element 115 one or moreseparate commerce applets 240. In addition, other independent service providers can provision (or have provisioned) ontosecure element 115 their own commerce applet(s) 240. Generally, acommerce applet 240 stores both loyalty and offers related data, providing an APDU interface through which this data can be managed.Commerce applet 240 operates as a generic storage container, allowing multiple loyalty/offers services to share mechanisms (e.g., secure element, mobile device) for loyalty/offers data management. If memory restrictions and performance requirements limit the amount of loyalty/offers data that can be stored onsecure element 115, additional data can be stored inmobile device memory 200 and managed by the consumer viacommerce widget 215. For example, any graphic images related to an offer can be stored inmemory 200 in order to optimize secure element memory allocation. Loyalty/offers data management can be handled by the corresponding offer platform, loyalty platform, or rewards platform within themobile commerce platform 135. -
Commerce applet 240 includes a cached merchant data table enabling the storage/management of all data related to a given merchant. This allows the commerce data for a given merchant to be pre-loaded insecure element 115 ormobile device 105 by a wallet application. Exemplary commerce elements (and their corresponding tag values used during Tag Length Value (TLV) encoding) that are included in the cached merchant data table are defined below. This data is stored in a record oriented data buffer. In an exemplary embodiment, a merchant identifier (Merchant Identifier) is used as the key field for search/retrieval tasks. Optionally, an index (or hash table) may be created to improve performance. - One or
more commerce applets 240 can be loaded onto thesecure element 115, for example, during manufacture and/or configuration of thesecure element 115 and may be personalized to enable its use to conduct commerce transactions. Acommerce applet 240 interfaces with thecontactless reader 250 via a commerce application programming interface (API) 255. In an exemplary embodiment, acommerce applet 240 is in the form of a JavaCard applet and is accessible through the use of APDU commands as defined in ISO 7816-4. Particularly,commerce applet 240 communicates commerce elements toreader 250 viasecure element 115 using ISO 7816 commands over the NFC ISO 14443 protocol. -
Secure element 115 can also include one ormore payment applets 245 where eachpayment applet 245 is associated with a payment service and an account issued by a payment service provider. One ormore payment applets 245 also can be loaded onto thesecure element 115, for example, during manufacture and/or configuration of thesecure element 115 and may be personalized to enable its use to conduct payment transactions. Apayment applet 245 interfaces with thecontactless reader 250 viapayment API 265. In an exemplary embodiment,payment applet 245 is in the form of a JavaCard applet and is accessible through the use of APDU commands as defined in ISO 7816-4.Payment applet 245 also communicates payment elements to thecontactless reader 250 viasecure element 115 using ISO 7816 commands over the NFC ISO 14443 protocol. - It should be understood that other communications between the aforementioned devices may include communications with or through other intervening systems, hardware, and/or software, and such communications may include receiving, transferring, and/or managing data.
- A
mobile wallet application 110 stored onmobile device 105 includes instructions which, when executed by the processor of themobile device 105, cause themobile device 105 to act as an instrument, for example, for processing transactions such as contactless commerce and/or payment transactions.Mobile wallet 110 communicates, through the use of APDU commands as defined in ISO 7816-4, with thecommerce applet 240 viacommerce API 225 and topayment applet 245 viapayment API 230. -
Commerce widget 215 is a component of themobile wallet 110 that provides an interface for consumers to manage commerce elements (e.g., loyalty card credentials, offers and rewards), for example, through interactions with the display or user interface of amobile device 105.Commerce widget 215 maintains, for example, a master list of commerce elements present on the handset in a memory of the mobile device (e.g., 200). A subset of offers that have been identified as ready to be used are, in turn, moved to secureelement 115 to be communicated tocontactless reader 250 andPOS terminal 120. Sensitive information, such as loyalty account identifiers, can be stored onsecure element 115. Furthermore, eachsecure element 115 is identified by a unique identification number, which may be either numeric or alphanumeric. Moreover, each mobile wallet itself stores a customer ID (CID), which is a unique number associated with the owner of the mobile wallet. While the CID may be stored inmemory 200, since the CID is associated with a unique individual, the CID is preferably stored in thesecure element 115, and provided to thecontactless reader 250 during a contactless transaction. -
Payment widget 220 is a component of themobile wallet 110 that provides an interface for consumers to manage payment elements (e.g., credit or debit card credentials), for example, through interactions with the display or user interface of a mobile device. -
Contactless reader 250 includes a reader commerce application 260 (referred to herein simply as a “reader application”) and aPOS interface 270.Contactless reader 250 manages two interfaces: one interface is with thesecure element 115 in themobile device 105 and the other interface is with themerchant POS system 120 which includes areader interface 285 and a commerce application data handler 280. The functionality of thecontactless reader 250 is the same whether thecontactless reader 250 is standalone and connected tomerchant POS system 120, or is integrated therein. Contactless payment functionality is also contained in thecontactless reader 250 but is not shown. - As shown in
FIG. 1 ,mobile device 105 is further communicatively coupled to amobile wallet platform 125, which in turn is communicatively coupled to themobile commerce platform 135 through the enterprise service bus (ESB) 130. As noted above, the mobile commerce platform includes the offers platform, loyalty platform, and rewards platform. - Also shown in
FIG. 1 is amerchant system 140. Themerchant system 140 may be communicatively coupled to themobile commerce platform 135 and themerchant POS system 120. Themerchant system 140 includes adatabase 145 andanalytic engine 150 which are embodied in a processor and memory (not shown). The functionality of theanalytic engine 150 is provided by interactions between the processor and the control programs stored in the memory. Themerchant system 140 may transmit and receive data from either themobile commerce platform 135 or themerchant POS system 120. Transmissions through themobile commerce platform 135 may be further sent, through theESB 130 andmobile wallet platform 125, to amobile device 105. Transmissions to themerchant POS system 120 may be through one or more wireless or wired communications (including, for example, telephonic, cell, internet, Ethernet, satellite, or radio communications). - In one embodiment, the
mobile device 105 may be used to conduct a contactless transaction at amerchant POS system 120 equipped with thecontactless reader 120. Themobile device 105 is placed within a predetermined required proximity of the contactless reader 250 (i.e., taps) causingCLF 235 of themobile device 105 to communicate with thecontactless reader 250 using, for example, NFC ISO 14443 protocols.Contactless reader 250 also communicates with themobile wallet 110,commerce applet 240, and/or payment applications on themobile device 105 to execute contactless transactions. - A secure element employs a Proximity Payment System Environment (PPSE) that serves as a directory of available credentials currently stored in
secure element 115. Each credential is assigned a corresponding application identifier (AID) associated with a payment application and stored in the PPSE. When an NFC-enabled mobile device containingsecure element 115 is placed in the vicinity of an NFC-enabled contactless reader, the contactless reader reads the credential and completes the transaction. Before doing so, however, the reader is initialized. - On
mobile device 105, PPSE is an application used to maintain a list of payment applications stored onsecure element 115, and provides accessibility to each payment application stored on themobile device 105 by making them visible or not visible (i.e., accessible) to systems or devices. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating some of the components used in a first embodiment. As shown inFIG. 3 , themobile device 105 is capable of communicating with thecontactless reader 250, as described above. Thecontactless reader 250 is part of themerchant POS system 120, which itself is communicatively coupled to themerchant system 140. Themerchant system 140 may, in one embodiment, be within the same physical structure as themerchant POS system 120, or could be physically separate. -
FIG. 4A is a sequence diagram illustrating a method of generating targeted communications according to the first embodiment. In this embodiment, a user taps his or hermobile device 105 to thecontactless reader 250, causingCLF 235 to communicate with thecontactless reader 250. More specifically, if a purchase is being made,payment applet 235 communicates withpayment API 265 to transfer the payment elements. In this embodiment, the CID also is transmitted fromsecure element 115 on themobile device 105 to thecontactless reader 250. Thereader application 260 then transfers the received payment elements and CID to thePOS interface 270 and out to thereader interface 285, which is managed by the commercial application data handler 280, completing a transfer of the payment elements and CID to the merchant POS system 120 (S400). If, however, the contactless transaction was not a payment transaction, but some other type of transaction that relates to an application stored on thecommerce applet 240, then the relevant elements would be transmitted to themerchant POS system 120 from thecommerce applet 240. - In step S405, the
merchant POS system 120 transmits the received CID and payment elements (if applicable) to themerchant system 140. If the contactless transaction includes the purchase of goods, information on the goods purchased may also be transmitted to themerchant system 140 from themerchant POS system 120. Still further, other salient information may be transmitted to themerchant system 140 including information on the physical location of themerchant POS system 120. Information regarding the physical location of themerchant POS system 120 may simply be an identification number formerchant POS system 120 or thecontactless reader 250 to which it is communicatively coupled. The information may also be the mailing address of the location or its GPS coordinates. - As noted above,
merchant system 140 includes ananalytic engine 150 anddatabase 145. In step S410, theanalytic engine 150 compares the received CID to information stored in profiles in thedatabase 145. A profile is a database entry that includes at least one, and typically more than one, field. Each field stores a type of information. For example, one field stores a CID corresponding to the rest of the information stored in the profile and serves as one mechanism for identifying the profile. Other fields may be used to store the payment elements, items purchased, location of themerchant POS system 120, date and time of the contactless transaction, along with any other type of information desired to be catalogued. - If, in S410, the analytic engine determines that no profile contains a field with a matching CID, then a new profile corresponding to the received CID is generated with at least one field containing the received CID. The newly-generated profile is then updated to include additional fields respectively corresponding to the information received from the
merchant POS system 120. If, in S410, the analytic engine determines that a profile contains a field that matches the received CID, then the fields within that profile are updated to include the information received from themerchant POS system 120. - In one example, one of the fields may include a frequency counter representing the number of times that the CID corresponding to the profile, containing that field, has been updated. The analytic engine updates this field by incrementing the counter to indicate that the CID was received (which itself represents that a contactless transaction involving the corresponding
mobile device 105 occurred). A profile is not limited to one counter. Additional counters may be provided to track the frequency of other types of information. For example, a counter corresponding to location information (e.g., GPS coordinates) may be provided, and each time that location information is received from themerchant POS system 120, the counter may be updated. Of course, the location information could be any type of information regarding the location of themerchant POS system 120, like the examples discussed above. - The
analytic engine 150 is constructed to analyze the information stored in the database to generate targeted communications (S415). There may be a variety of kinds of targeted communications including, for example, offers, coupons, reward, advertising, purchase history, sale, or status information, but the targeted communications may be generally classified into two types. The first type of targeted communications is a reward type targeted communication which includes information indicating that item(s) will be free during the next transaction. Coupons and offers (which show price reductions) may also be considered a reward type targeted communications. The second type of targeted communications is non-reward type targeted communications, which includes advertisements, purchase history, sale, or status information. - The
analytic engine 150 may be constructed to generate one or more of these types of messages upon the occurrence of certain events, as determined by an analysis of information within thedatabase 145. For example, if theanalytic engine 150 determines that the received CID corresponds to a particular profile and a corresponding counter for that profile is incremented such that the value of the counter is now equal to or greater than a threshold for issuing a reward type targeted communication, then theanalytic engine 150 may set a flag, indicating that a reward level has been reached, and generate a reward type targeted communication for transmission to the merchant POS system 120 (S420). Upon receipt of the reward type targeted communication from themerchant system 140, themerchant POS system 120 may display (S425) the communication on its display (not shown). Of course, the display may also display the other types of targeted communications as well. - If the threshold for a reward type targeted communication (as measured through the counter or some other metric) has not been reached, then the
analytic engine 150 will generate a status type targeted communication for transmission and display on themerchant POS system 120 in S425. The status type targeted communication indicates the progression to the next reward, and may be accompanied by one or more other types of targeted communications, such as a coupon or offer. For example, an advertising type targeted communication may be displayed concurrently with the status type message on themerchant POS system 120, in order to entice further purchases. In addition to, or in lieu of, the status type message, a transaction receipt may also be included and displayed on themobile device 105. - If the counter or some other metric indicates that a threshold for a reward was reached in the previous transaction, but was not redeemed in that transaction, then that reward may be redeemed in a subsequent transaction. During the subsequent transaction, a reward redemption process can occur, as shown in
FIG. 4B . In S430, the payment information and CID for the subsequent purchase, is transmitted to themerchant POS system 120 through thecontactless reader 250 in the same manner as described above. In S435, the CID is transmitted to the merchant system 140 (along with information on the goods purchased). In S440, theanalytic engine 150 determines whether a flag, indicating that a reward level has been reached, is set in the profile corresponding to the received CID. The analytic engine may also analyze the purchased goods to determine whether an item therein is reward eligible (S440). If one of the purchased items is reward eligible, then themerchant system 140 will generate a reward redemption type targeted communication (S445), and transmit that communication to themerchant POS system 120 for display (S450). If the reward is redeemed, then information indicating that decision is transmitted to the merchant system 140 (S460). The previous payment is refunded (or partially refunded) through communication with themobile commerce platform 135. Theanalytic engine 150 clears the flag in the profile, and sets a new threshold (or simply resets the counter) for a reward type targeted communication in the profile (S470). - The system may also be configured, however, to redeem an earned reward during the same transaction. In this case, if the predetermined threshold for a reward has been reached, a reward type targeted communication is generated and delivered to the
merchant POS system 120. If the reward is redeemed at that time, such redemption information is transmitted back to themerchant system 140 and the payment is refunded (or partially refunded) through themobile commerce platform 135. Theanalytic engine 150 clears the flag and sets a new threshold (or simply resets the counter) for a reward type targeted communication in the profile. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram corresponding to the second embodiment which is directed to a frequency targeted communication system using an unattended point of sale system.FIG. 5 is similar toFIG. 3 , except themerchant POS system 120 has been replaced by anunattended POS system 405. An example of anunattended POS system 405 may be a vending machine. Theunattended POS system 405 operates without the involvement of an operator, and functions in the same manner as themerchant POS system 120 described above. Moreover, the communications and transmissions of data between themobile device 105 and theunattended POS system 405 are substantially the same as described above between themobile device 105 and themerchant POS system 120. Accordingly, discussions of these features are omitted for brevity. -
FIG. 6A is a sequence diagram illustrating a consumer's interaction with theunattended POS system 405. Upon purchase of an item from theunattended POS system 405 via the consumer'smobile device 105, the payment elements and CID are transmitted to the unattended POS system 405 (S600). The unattended POS system then transmits the received CID to the merchant system 140 (S605). In this embodiment, information on the goods purchased may be transmitted to themerchant system 140, but typically is not. This stems from the fact that theunattended POS system 405 likely has relatively few offerings for purchase, and that such units are typically equipped with only basic processing and communications infrastructure out of an effort to keep the costs of theunattended POS system 405 low. Of course, the same type of information transmitted to themerchant POS system 120 in the first embodiment, could also be transmitted to themerchant system 140 in the second embodiment. - As in the first embodiment, upon receipt of the CID information, the
merchant system 140 analyzes the received CID information and updates thedatabase 145. As in the first embodiment, theanalytic engine 150 determines whether a profile exists in thedatabase 145 with a field that contains the same CID value as the CID received from theunattended POS system 405. If so, then a counter value, stored in a field within the profile corresponding to the received CID, is incremented to denote the contactless transaction (e.g., a purchase operation). Theanalytic engine 150, as in the first embodiment, analyzes the updated profile to determine whether the counter is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold for issuing a reward type targeted communication. If the counter does not exceed the threshold, then a status type targeted communication is generated (S615) and transmitted to the unattended POS system 405 (S620). If, however, the threshold has been reached or exceeded, then a flag indicating that a reward level has been reached is set in the profile corresponding to the received CID, and a reward type targeted communication is generated (S615) and transmitted to the unattended POS system 405 (S620). In either event, the targeted communication received from themerchant system 140 is displayed on a display (not shown) connected to the unattended POS system 405 (S625). - As in the first embodiment, as shown in
FIG. 6B , if themerchant system 140, upon receiving the CID from the unattended POS system (S630 & S635), determines that a flag, indicating a reward level has been reached, is set in a profile corresponding to the received CID, thenmerchant system 140 generates (S645) and transmits (S650) a reward redemption type targeted communication to theunattended POS system 405 for display. As noted above, goods information is typically not conveyed from theunattended POS system 405 to themerchant system 140. Nevertheless, in an embodiment where such information is transmitted to themerchant system 140, then theanalytic engine 150 may further analyze the subsequently purchased goods to ensure that the purchased good is reward eligible. Upon receipt of the reward type targeted communication from themerchant system 140, theunattended POS system 405 automatically displays (S655) a reward redemption type targeted communication, indicating that the corresponding purchase has been refunded (or partially refunded). Theunattended POS system 405 then transmits reward redemption information to themerchant system 140 indicating that the reward has been used (S660). Themerchant system 140 updates thedatabase 145 accordingly, by clearing the flag in the corresponding profile and setting a new threshold for a reward (S665) (or simply resetting the value of the counter). -
FIG. 7 is a block diagram corresponding to a system of the third embodiment. As inFIG. 3 , amobile device 150 is communicatively coupled to themerchant POS system 120 through thecontactless reader 250. Themerchant POS system 120 is also communicatively coupled to themerchant system 140. The communications between these elements are substantially the same as discussed above in the first embodiment. Accordingly, a description thereof is omitted for brevity. Themerchant system 140 is in bidirectional communication with aservice provider platform 700. The service provider platform includes themobile wallet platform 125,ESB 130, andmobile commerce platform 135. -
FIG. 8 illustrates one example of a pseudo loyalty type system. When a contactless transaction using amobile device 105 occurs, the CID is transmitted to themerchant POS system 120 through thecontactless reader 250, as described above (S800). Themerchant POS system 120 transmits the CID along with, in one embodiment, any purchase information to the merchant system 140 (S805). Themerchant system 140 analyzes thedatabase 145 to determine whether an account exists that corresponds to the CID. An account in this embodiment is similar to the profile discussed above. Structurally, the account is the same as the profile, in that it represents a database entry that contains one or more fields which may be populated with a variety of information. The account differs from the profile in that the account is assigned an account number which represents membership in a loyalty program. - If the
merchant system 140 determines that an account corresponding to the received CID does not exist in thedatabase 145, then themerchant system 140 creates a new account and assigns the account an account number (S810). As noted above, a merchant system is capable of provisioning onto thesecure element 115 one ormore commerce applets 240. Acommerce applet 240 stores both loyalty and offer related data. Themerchant system 140 effects such provisioning by transmitting the account information to theservice provider platform 700, specifically the mobile commerce platform 135 (S815). The account information includes the account number and may also include any initial point information assigned according to a loyalty program's calculation (as computed by the analytic engine 150) based on the purchases at themerchant POS system 120. The account information may also be transmitted with a targeted communication that contains, for example, an introductory greeting. - As noted above, the
mobile commerce platform 135 includes an offer platform, loyalty platform, and reward platform. In the present embodiment, the account information received by themobile commerce platform 135 is communicated to the loyalty platform, which in turns generates an instruction set for provisioning anew commerce applet 240 on themobile device 105. That instruction set is transmitted (S820) to themobile wallet platform 125 for execution, which results in the provisioning of thenew commerce applet 240 on thesecure element 115 of the mobile device 105 (S825). If the account information included a targeted communication, then that communication is now displayed on the mobile device 105 (5830). - One of the advantages of the system shown in
FIG. 8 , is that no additional interaction from the user is required. Since the CID is transmitted during the contactless transaction, the user is not required to complete any additional steps in order to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program. Moreover, the merchant benefits by receiving purchase information from a user who was not previously enrolled in his/her loyalty program. In previous systems, that user's purchase information would have been unavailable to the merchant. - Once enrolled in the pseudo-loyalty program, a user's account number, which is now contained within the
commerce applet 240 on thesecure element 115, may also be transmitted along with the CID to themerchant POS system 120, and then onto themerchant system 140. The CID and/or account number allow the user to participate in loyalty program savings (such as sales price on certain items) without the need to present a loyalty card or provide any additional information unrelated to the payment process (such as a telephone number or address). Themerchant system 140 may from time to time communicate coupons, offers, and rewards to the merchant'scommerce applet 240 on themobile device 105 through themobile commerce platform 135. These coupons, offers, and rewards may be redeemed during a contactless transaction, as they may be included in the payment elements communicated from thecommerce applet 240 to the contactless reader 250 (as described above). - Furthermore, in one example, the mobile wallet service provider can access the information stored in the
merchant system database 145 by supplying themerchant system 140 with a user's CID or loyalty account information (or both), which acts as a password. Thus, the mobile wallet service provider can also receive information on contactless transactions at any time from themerchant system 140. -
FIG. 9 illustrates a fourth embodiment representing an automated loyalty program enrollment system. The overall system may be structured in the same manner as illustrated inFIG. 7 . However, the automated enrollment process need not occur at a point-of-sale system (such as the merchant POS system 120), but may occur at a separate system designated for, among other functions, enrolling consumers in a loyalty program, without processing sales transactions. - In this embodiment, a user initiates a contactless transaction by tapping his/her
mobile device 105 to acontactless reader 250 of, in this example, amerchant POS system 120. As discussed above, in addition to other processing described above (and omitted here for brevity), the CID is transmitted to the merchant POS system 120 (S900). In addition, the commercial application data handler 280 generates a query asking if the user would like to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program. The query is transmitted through thereader interface 285 to thePOS interface 270 and subsequently transmitted to themobile device 105 through theCLF 235.Processor 205 causes the query to be displayed on the mobile device display (not shown). An election can then be made as to whether to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program. Regardless of the election, the information regarding the same is transmitted to thecontactless reader 250 through theCLF 235 and then transmitted to the commercial application data handler 280, through thePOS interface 270 and thereader interface 285. If the election is to participate in the merchant's loyalty program, then an enrollment request and the CID are transmitted from the merchant POS system to the merchant system 140 (S905). - Upon receipt of the enrollment request and the CID, the
merchant system 140 requests salient user data from the service provider platform 700 (S910), which themerchant system 140 will use to create the loyalty account in thedatabase 145 and populate the fields therein. Prior to transmitting such information, however, the merchant system's 140 credentials are challenged by themobile commerce platform 135 to ensure that themerchant system 140 is authorized to access such information. If the challenges are successful, then theservice provider platform 700 sends the user's data to the merchant system 140 (S915). Themerchant system 140 generates a loyalty account in thedatabase 145 and the analytic engine uses the received user data to populate various fields, such as name, address, telephone number, and the like (S920). Once the account has been generated, themerchant system 140 provides the account information to theservice provider platform 700, specifically the mobile commerce platform 135 (S925). Such information may include, for example, the loyalty account number. - The
mobile commerce platform 135 transmits the account information to the commerce platform, which in turns generates an instruction set for provisioning anew commerce applet 240 on themobile device 105. That instruction set is transmitted (S930) to themobile wallet platform 125 for execution, which results in the provisioning of thenew commerce applet 240 on thesecure element 115 of the mobile device 105 (S935). - The merchant system may also generate a targeted communication for transmission to the mobile wallet 110 (S940). The targeted communication may be an initial greeting and/or another type of targeted communication such as a coupon, offer, or even a reward. The
merchant system 140 transmits the targeted communication to the service provider platform 700 (S945), which in turn transmits the targeted communication to the mobile device 105 (S950). -
FIG. 10A is a sequence diagram illustrating a pseudo loyalty and targeted communication system operation. The overall system may be structured in substantially the same manner as illustrated inFIG. 7 . The operation of this system is similar to the operation of the first embodiment, except, as described below, the targeted communication is transmitted to theservice provider platform 700 rather than themerchant POS system 120. - As shown in
FIG. 10A , payment elements and the CID are transferred to acontactless reader 250 in themerchant POS system 120 during a contactless transaction, as described above (S1000). The CID and the purchase information are transferred to the merchant system 140 (S1005). Themerchant system 140 analyzes the received CID to determine whether a corresponding profile indatabase 145 exists. If not, then themerchant system 140 creates such a profile in thedatabase 145, and populates its fields according the CID and purchase information received from themerchant POS system 120. - As discussed above, the
analytic engine 150 is configured to analyze the information stored within the profile and generate targeted communications in accordance with that analysis. Also as discussed above, one type of targeted communication is a reward type targeted communication. When theanalytic engine 150 determines that a reward level has been reached, as described below, a flag is set in the profile indicating that a reward is available, and a corresponding reward type targeted communication is generated for transmission to theservice provider platform 700, and from there to themobile device 105. - The
analytic engine 150 may employ a variety of different analyses to determine whether a reward level has been reached, depending upon the merchant's intentions. For example, theanalytic engine 150 may employ a simple frequency counter whose value is stored in a field and corresponds to the number of times the CID has been received by themerchant system 140. Theanalytic engine 150 may be configured to generate a reward type targeted communication when the counter value exceeds a predetermined value. - Moreover, the
analytic engine 150 may also be configured to analyze the total value of the goods purchased by summing the price information stored in one of the fields within the profile. Theanalytic engine 150 may be configured to generate a reward type targeted communication when the sum value of the goods purchased exceeds a predetermined threshold. Of course, the use of the total value of the goods purchased may be substituted as a metric for other information stored in a different field within the profile to determine whether a reward threshold has been reached including, for example, the quantity of items purchased, the quantity of any particular item, or the dollar value of any particular items. - Still further, if the
merchant POS system 120 transmits additional information, such as geographical information, that information could also be used to determine whether to generate a reward-type targeted communication. By using geographic information, theanalytic engine 150 may track the user's purchases at several different locations and even generate location-based targeted communications. For example, a user may receive a special reward for conducting contactless transactions at multiple store locations. - Once the
analytic engine 150 has analyzed the updated (or created) profile (S1010 and S1015), theanalytic engine 140 generates a targeted communication (S1020) and transmits that targeted communication to theservice provider platform 700, specifically the mobile commerce platform 135 (S1021). Themobile commerce platform 135 analyzes the contents of the targeted communication to determine whether it is necessary to provision anew commerce applet 240 on the secure element 115 (as described above). If the targeted communication is a reward-type targeted communication, then themobile commerce platform 135 analyzes the reward information, included in the targeted communication, and updates thecommerce applet 240 accordingly (S1025). Doing so allows for such reward information to be available for transmission to themerchant POS system 120 in a subsequent transaction. Finally, if the targeted communication includes a graphical display, then those graphical elements are transmitted to thememory 200 on the mobile device and then caused to be displayed on the display of the mobile device (not shown) (S1030). -
FIG. 10B is a sequence diagram illustrating the process of redeeming a reward-type targeted communication according to the fifth embodiment. As discussed above, themobile commerce platform 135 receives the reward type targeted communication from themerchant system 140, and updates a corresponding commerce application on thesecure element 115 accordingly. - As shown in
FIG. 10B , when a contactless transaction is subsequently initiated with themobile device 105, themobile device 105 transfers to thecontactless reader 250 the CID along with the reward and purchase elements contained in the commerce applet 240 (S1040). Themerchant POS system 120 in turn transfers the CID, the reward and purchase elements, and information on the goods purchased by the user, to the merchant system 140 (S1045). Theanalytic engine 150 proceeds to update the consumer profile based on such information (S1050). Theanalytic engine 150 may also compare the reward elements transmitted from themobile device 105 with the goods purchased to determine whether a qualifying purchase was made. If so, then themerchant system 140 sends a refund request (or a partial refund request as the case may be) to themobile commerce platform 135 for processing. Theanalytic engine 150 then removes the flag indicating that a reward level has been reached and resets the threshold for indicating a reward level to an appropriate value (S1055). Themerchant system 140 then transmits an update to the mobile device 105 (S1060 and S1065), through theservice provider platform 700. Since the update indicates that the reward has been redeemed, themobile commerce platform 135 generates an instruction set for removing the reward elements from thecommerce applet 240, and transfers that instruction set to the mobile wallet platform for execution by the mobile device 105 (S1070). -
FIG. 11 is a sequence diagram illustrating a historically-enriched method of generating targeted communications according to the sixth embodiment. As discussed above, a mobile device may be used to make contactless transactions, without enrolling in a merchant's loyalty program. However, should the user later elect to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program, then the user's historical transaction data may be used to populate a corresponding profile stored indatabase 145 as discussed below. - Assume a
mobile device 105, whose user is not enrolled in a merchant's loyalty program, makes a contactless transaction at themerchant POS system 120. As described above, the CID and purchase elements are transferred from themobile device 105 to thecontactless reader 250 of the merchant POS system 120 (S1100). The CID and purchase information are then transferred to themerchant system 140, along with information on the goods purchased (S1105). Themerchant system 140 compares the received CID to CIDs stored in thedatabase 145 and respectively associated with a plurality of profiles, to determine whether a corresponding profile exists. If a corresponding profile does not exist, then themerchant system 140 creates a corresponding profile and populates that profile with the CID and purchase information (along with the information on the purchased goods) received from themerchant POS system 120. If a corresponding profile does exist, then themerchant system 140 updates the corresponding profile to include the purchase information (along with the information on the purchased goods) received from the merchant POS system 120 (S1110). - Should the user later choose to enroll in the merchant's loyalty program (S1115) through a contactless transaction, then that enrollment request is received by the merchant system 140 (S1115) processed. More specifically, an account is generated in the
database 145 and the fields therein are populated with the information provided by the mobile device 105 (or alternatively the user through another medium). Once the account is generated, an enrollment confirmation is transmitted to themobile device 105, via themobile commerce platform 135 and the mobile wallet platform 125 (S1120 and S1121).Commerce applet 240 is then updated to include corresponding loyalty information, such as a loyalty account number. - Of course, as discussed above, the enrollment request may be received by the
merchant POS system 120, or another merchant system comprising a contactless reader, and then forwarded to themerchant system 140. Alternatively, the user may use his/her data connection on themobile device 105 to enroll in the loyalty program through the Internet. In any event, when themobile device 105 is subsequently presented for a contactless transaction at themerchant POS system 120, the CID, loyalty information, and payment elements are transferred to the merchant POS system 120 (S1125) and then transmitted to the merchant system 140 (S1130). Themerchant system 140 associates the received CID and received loyalty information, and then analyzes thedatabase 145 to determine whether the database contains historical transaction data stored in a profile that corresponds to the received CID. If so, then themerchant system 140 associates the historical transaction data with the loyalty information, and populates the fields within the profile with the loyalty information (S1135). Themerchant system 140 then generates a corresponding targeted communication (S1140). If themerchant system 140 determined that historical data corresponding to the received CID is contained within thedatabase 145 and successfully associated that data with the received loyalty information, then themerchant system 140 generates a targeted communication notifying of the successful association. - Of course, the
merchant system 140 could be configured to generate additional targeted communications as well. For example, if the successful association results in a reward indicator crossing a predetermined threshold for issuing a reward type targeted communication, then such a message may be transmitted along with the notification of successful association in S1140. Regardless of the type of targeted communication generated in S1140, the targeted communication is then relayed to the service provider platform 700 (S1145) which, in turn, relays the targeted communication to the mobile device 105 (S1150). -
