- the software instructions may be read into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 350 , or from another device via communication interface 380 .
- the software instructions contained in memory 330 may cause processing unit 320 to perform processes that will be described later.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary functional block diagram of search engine 225 according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- Search engine 225 may include document locator 410 and ranking component 420 .
- document locator 410 may connect to a document corpus 430 .
- Document corpus 430 may include information associated with documents that were previously crawled, indexed, and stored, for example, in a database accessible by search engine 225 .
- document locator 410 may identify a set of documents in response to a user search query. Document locator 410 may initially locate documents from document corpus 430 by comparing the terms in the user's search query to the documents in corpus 430 .
- Ranking component 420 may assign a ranking score (also called simply a “score” herein) to one or more documents in document corpus 430 .
- Ranking component 420 may assign the ranking scores prior to, independent of, or in connection with a search query.
- search engine 225 may sort the documents based on the ranking score and return the sorted set of documents to the client that submitted the search query.
- the ranking score is a value that attempts to quantify the quality of the documents.
- the score is based, at least in part, on the degree to which documents within corpus 430 are related to one another.
- logical or conceptual organizational structures associated with stored documents may be used by ranking component 420 to generate or modify a score associated with the document.
- organizational structures may include logical directory structures, conceptual or virtual directory structures, or other organizational structures designed to facilitate organization and retrieval of documents.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating one exemplary organizational structure consistent with principles of the invention.
- a global collection of documents 500 may include three sub-collections of documents 510 , 520 , and 530 identified and grouped together in a suitable manner.
- document collection 500 may, in practice, refer to an index or other virtual representation of the documents in collection 500 , thereby enabling manipulation and organization without requiring modification of the original documents themselves.
- one suitable grouping methodology may include the application of document labels or sub-labels to each document in the collection to indicate a relationship between each document in the collection.
- each document in collection 510 may have a “sales pitch” label applied thereto
- each document in collection 520 may have a “presentation” label applied to it
- each document in collection 530 may have a “meeting agenda” label applied to it.
- the labels for each collection may be assigned by the same or different individuals having access to the documents. As shown in FIG. 5 , multiple documents from each of collections 510 , 520 , and 530 have multiple labels attached thereto, thereby resulting in overlapping labels.
- documents in region 540 have both the “sales pitch” and “presentation” labels applied thereto
- documents in region 550 have both the “sales pitch” and “meeting agenda” labels applied thereto
- the documents in region 560 have both the “presentation” and “meeting agenda” labels applied thereto
- the documents in region 570 have each of the “sales pitch”, “presentation”, and “meeting agenda” labels attached.
- the “relationships” between the documents in the collection as established by the various users may be “mined” to provide more relevant search results during subsequent document searches.
- the labeling system may be extended across many documents and users, thereby providing a potential relationship between each document and every other document in the global collection.
- the above-described labeling scheme may be hierarchical in nature, supporting various levels of labeling through the use of sub-labels. In this manner, relationships between documents in collection 500 may be more clearly defined.
- document relationships may also be evidenced by relative positioning in a conventional logical file system. For example, all documents in a particular directory or subdirectory on a hard disk drive or other storage medium may be considered to be related.
- a degree of relatedness between various documents may be identified based on the similarity of their respective logical locations. For example, documents having a common parent directory, but different subdirectories may still be considered to be related, but may have a lesser degree of relatedness than documents sharing a common subdirectory. In this manner, additional information irrespective of document content may be used to index, rank or relate documents in the collection to each other.
- relationships between documents may be evidenced by additional user-specific grouping methodologies, such as bookmarks, shortcuts, or the like.
- users may navigate to various documents (e.g., web pages, etc.) and store bookmarks to the various documents in a specific folders and subfolders on a storage medium.
- bookmarks e.g., web pages, etc.
- additional degrees of relationship between various documents in a collection may be identified and used to enhance search results during subsequent queries.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart of an exemplary process for ranking and presenting documents to a user according to an implementation consistent with principles of the invention.
- the process exemplified by FIG. 6 can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 330 , ROM 340 or storage device 350 of server 220 .
- the process exemplified by FIG. 6 can be implemented in hardwired circuitry, such as combinational logic, within processing unit 320 of server 220 .
- the exemplary process may begin with search engine 225 detecting or otherwise identifying a set of documents from a global collection of documents 400 (act 610 ).
- Organizational structures or other user-defined relationships associated with the documents may then be identified (act 620 ).
- the organizational structures may include a label or sub-label applied to the documents, the documents' logical locations in a file system, or other unique user-specific organizational structures applied to the documents (e.g., bookmark locations). Relationships between documents in collection 400 of documents may be identified based upon the identified organizational structures associated with the documents (act 630 ).
- Search engine 225 may use the relationships between the various documents in the document corpus to generate a ranking or score for each document in the collection 400 (act 640 ). For example, a document in global collection 400 that has not been independently labeled in the manner set forth above may be scored lower than a document that has been independently labeled by one or more users.
- a document's ranking may be based on a number of documents sharing one of the labels attached to the document. In this manner, a document sharing labels with a greater number of documents will have a higher ranking than a document sharing label(s) with fewer documents.
- search engine 225 may use a link-based ranking method, similar to the PageRankTM method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.
- individual documents within global collection 400 may be ranked based upon relationships between the various documents or sub-collections (e.g., 410 - 470 ) within collection 400 . These relationships may include related labeling elements, data structures, or other document grouping methodologies.
- the relationships may be represented as links to the various documents in collection 400 . For example, by grouping all documents in collection 410 together under the label “sales pitch”, each document in collection 410 may be considered to be linked to each other document in collection 410 , regardless of document content or the document's relative position in the logical file system. Additionally, because several documents in collection 440 include labels for both collection 410 and collection 420 , these documents may be considered to be similarly linked to each document in both collection 410 and 420 , thus, increasing their ranking.
- a document's rank may be based on the number of links from different documents that “point to” the document in question. In this manner, documents related to a large number of documents through one or more labels may have a higher ranking than a document having fewer labels and/or fewer related documents.
- document rankings may also be based on the individual rankings of the various related documents such that a relationship with a highly ranked document is considered more important than a relationship with a lowly ranked document. In this manner, it may be possible for a document with only one linked document (from a very highly ranked document) to have a higher rank than another document having many related documents (from very low ranked documents).
- the rank or score of a document may be defined according to:
- r ⁇ ( A ) ⁇ N + ( 1 - ⁇ ) ⁇ ( r ⁇ ( R 1 ) ⁇ R 1 ⁇ + ... + r ⁇ ( R n ) ⁇ R n ⁇ ) , where A is the document being ranked; R 1 , . . . , R n are the documents related to document A; r(R 1 ), . . . , r(R n ) are the ranks of documents R 1 , . . . , R n ;
- are the number of links for documents R 1 , . . . , R n ; ⁇ is a constant in the interval [0,1]; and N is the total number of documents in the collection.
- the ranks form a probability distribution over the documents in the collection, so that the sum of ranks over all web documents is unity.
- the rank of a document can, therefore, be defined as the probability that a user will be at the document after following a large number of links between documents.
- the constant ⁇ in the above equation may be interpreted as the reset probability that the user will jump randomly to any document instead of following a link.
- the rankings may be calculated using an iterative algorithm. By continually determining document rankings over a range of iterations, document rankings may be revised until the rankings are considered to be “sufficiently converged.” “Sufficiently converged” may be determined when the document ranks generally stop changing, within a certain error tolerance, from one pass to the next. In practice, ranking generally becomes sufficiently converged with about 100 iterations.
- document rankings may be based on various criteria associated with other documents related by the organizational structures identified above. For example, documents having a high degree of relatedness (e.g., a shared label, logical sub-directory, or bookmark folder) may contribute more positively to the ranking of a given document than those documents having a lower degree of relatedness (e.g., sibling folder labels, sibling sub-directories, etc.). In this example, even though each document includes a label related to the parent collection, the existence of distinct sibling labels may reduce the relatedness of the documents and may, correspondingly, have a reduced effect on document ranking.
- a high degree of relatedness e.g., a shared label, logical sub-directory, or bookmark folder
- sibling folder labels e.g., sibling folder labels, sibling sub-directories, etc.
- Examples of additional degrees of relatedness may include indirect relationships. For example, consider a document within a collection labeled “A” that shares one or more documents with a collection label “B,” that in turn shares one or more documents with a collection labeled “C.” In this example, documents from the collection labeled “C” may be considered less related to documents from the collection labeled “A” than documents from the collection labeled “B.” Accordingly, documents from the collection labeled “C” may have a reduced effect on the ranking of documents from the collection labeled “A” than those documents from collection labeled “B.”
- the number of discrete labels applied by different users to a particular document may have a positive effect on the documents rank.
- discrete labels applied by different users may indicate an important or valuable document. Accordingly, even if a number of documents related to the document is low, the documents relative importance may be used to bolster the document's ranking.
- search engine 225 may identify a set of documents that match the search query by comparing the search terms in the query to documents in collection 400 (act 660 ).
- search engine 225 may use to identify documents related to a set of search terms. For example, when the set of search terms includes a single search term, search engine 225 might identify documents that contain the search term. When the set of search terms includes multiple search terms, search engine 225 might identify documents that contain the search terms as a phrase. Alternatively or additionally, search engine 225 might identify documents that contain the search terms, but not necessarily together. Alternatively or additionally, search engine 225 might identify documents that contain less than all of the search terms, or synonyms of the search terms.
- search engine 225 may identify documents that have labels that include some or all of the search terms. Further, search engine 225 may identify documents that do not contain all of the search terms, but that are related to documents which include the search terms within a predetermined degree of relatedness. Yet other techniques for identifying relevant documents are known to those skilled in the art.
- search engine 225 may generate an information retrieval (IR) score for the identified documents (act 670 ).
- IR information retrieval
- search engine 225 may use to generate an IR score for a document. For example, search engine 225 may generate an IR score based on the number of occurrences of the search terms in the document. Alternatively or additionally, search engine 225 may generate or modify an IR score based on where the search terms occur within the document (e.g., document label, logical file path, title, content, header, footer, etc.) or characteristics of the search terms (e.g., font, size, color, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, search engine 225 may weight a search term differently from another search term when multiple search terms are present. Alternatively or additionally, search engine 225 may consider the proximity of the search terms when multiple search terms are present. Yet other techniques for generating an IR score for a document are known to those skilled in the art.
- Search engine 225 may generate total scores for the matching documents based on a combination of their IR scores and relationship-based scores or ranks associated with the documents (act 680 ). The matching documents may then be sorted based on the total scores (act 690 ) and an indication of the matching documents may be provided to the user in a suitable manner (act 695 ). In displaying the matching results to the user, search engine 225 may further form references to the documents, where a reference may include a title of the document (which may contain a hypertext link that will direct the user, when selected, to the actual document) and, optionally, a text excerpt from the document. Search engine 225 may then present the references corresponding to a number of top-scoring documents (e.g., a predetermined number of documents, documents with scores above a predetermined threshold, all documents, etc.) to a user who submitted the search query.
- top-scoring documents e.g., a predetermined number of documents, documents with scores above a predetermined threshold, all documents, etc.
- FIG. 7 is an exemplary diagram of a graphical user interface 700 for searching documents and managing or viewing document relationship information according to an implementation consistent with principles of the invention.
- interface 700 may include a search box 705 for receiving user entered search terms.
- interface 700 also includes several “browse by” sections 710 , 715 for facilitating a more conventional “drill down” document search based upon user-assigned labels in section 710 or the existing directories in the logical files system in section 715 .
- each section includes hyperlinks relating the various labels and file system directories.
- An “edit labels” hyperlink 720 may also be included in section 710 for enabling users to edit the labels currently applied to various documents.
- a graphical user interface 800 may be displayed to the user, as illustrated in FIG. 8 .
- Graphical user interface 800 may include various elements for enabling the user to locate documents or groups of documents within having the selected label applied thereto.
- a search box 805 similar to search box 705 may be provided for receiving user entered search terms.
- user-selectable buttons 810 may be provided for enabling the user to indicate whether a query entered in search box 805 is to be searched only in the selected label, within all labeled documents, or within all files in the document collection.
- a sub-labels section 815 may be provided including a hyperlinked listing 820 of sub-labels contained with the selected label. Selection of any hyperlinked sub-label may result in the display of an interface similar to interface 800 relating to the selected sub-label. Additionally, a “new label” hyperlink 825 may be provided to enable users to create a new label within the selected label or sub-label.
- a files section 830 may be provided including a hyperlinked listing 835 of files having the selected label applied thereto.
- each document in the hyperlinked listing 835 may include a “show details” hyperlink. Upon selection of a particular document's “show details” hyperlink, an additional graphical user interface may be displayed for facilitating summary viewing of the document and for enabling modification or supplementation of the document's label(s).
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may perform a search to identify documents based on a search query and use information regarding user-generated relationships between documents to rank the identified documents.
- the categories may be used to further define the search and present a user with results that are relevant to the user's interests.
- exemplary user interfaces have been described with respect to FIGS. 6 and 7 .
- the user interfaces may include more, fewer, or different pieces of information.
- Such a component may include hardware, such as an application specific integrated circuit or a field programmable gate array, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
