Description
- An information retrieval system uses terms and phrases to index, retrieve, organize and describe documents. When a user enters a search query, the terms in the query are identified and used to retrieve documents from the information retrieval system, and then rank them. However, conventional search systems are rarely personalized and provide the same search results to all users. Additionally, in digital content information retrieval systems, such as book, music or other media search engines, there is often not enough data per document to score documents effectively in the context of browse queries. Consequently, searches in such digital content information retrieval systems may result in ambiguous scoring of the documents associated with the search terms and phrases, which leads to non-optimal ranking of the search results.
- Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such approaches with some aspects of the present method and apparatus set forth in the remainder of this disclosure with reference to the drawings.
- A system and/or method is provided for personalized digital content search, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.

FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating example steps of a method for personalizing search results, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. - As utilized herein the terms “circuits” and “circuitry” refer to physical electronic components (i.e. hardware) and any software and/or firmware (“code”) which may configure the hardware, be executed by the hardware, and or otherwise be associated with the hardware. As an example, “x and/or y” means any element of the three-element set {(x), (y), (x, y)}. As another example, “x, y, and/or z” means any element of the seven-element set {(x), (y), (z), (x, y), (x, z), (y, z), (x, y, z)}. As utilized herein, the term “e.g.,” introduces a list of one or more non-limiting examples, instances, or illustrations.
- As used herein, the term “corpus” (plural, “corpora”) means a collection of documents (or data items) of a given type. As used herein, the term “WWW-based search corpora” or “WWW-based corpora” is corpora meant to include all documents available on the Internet (i.e., including, but not limited to, music-related documents, book-related documents, movie-related documents and other media-related documents). The term “non-WWW corpus” or “non WWW-based corpus” means a corpus where the corpus documents (or data items) are not available on the Internet.
- The term “small” corpora may indicate corpora including at least one corpus that is a subset of WWW-based (or web-based) corpora, or at least one corpus that is partially or completely non-overlapping with the web-based corpora. An example of “small” corpora may include corpora associated with an online media search engine. The “small” corpora may include, for example, a movie corpus (associated with a movie search engine), music corpus (associated with a music search engine), etc. Additionally, portions of the music and/or movies database may be available via an Internet search of the WWW-based corpora (i.e., such portions of the respective corpus are a subset of the WWW-based corpora), while other portions of the “small” corpora may not be available on the WWW-based corpora and are, therefore, non-overlapping with the WWW-based corpora. The term “non-overlapping corpus” (e.g., a first corpus is non-overlapping with a second corpus), means that documents that may be found in one corpus, may not be found in the other corpus.
- As used herein the term “media” or “digital media” refers to any type of digital media documents (or items) available for purchase/download and consumption by a user. Non-limiting examples of digital media include videos, movies, TV shows, books, magazines, newspapers, audio recordings, music albums, comics, and other digital media.
- An information retrieval system may use terms and phrases to index, retrieve, organize and describe documents. Terms in a query may be identified and used to retrieve and rank documents. Search queries may be broken into two categories—navigational and browse/informational. Navigational queries are detailed queries that are clear about a user's intent, while browse queries include queries that are discovery oriented. An example navigational query, in the context of a Book Search Engine, may be “Fifty Shades of Grey”. A browse query in this same context may be “romance novel”. In example digital content information retrieval systems, such as Book search engines (or other types of digital media search engines, such as movies, shows, apps, music), there is often insufficient data per document to score documents effectively in the context of browse queries. An example navigational query, in the context of a Mobile Application Search Engine, may be “Spotify.” A browse query in this same context may be “free games.” An example navigational query, in the context of a Music Search Engine, may be “Lady Gaga Bad Romance.” A browse query in this same context may be “dance music.” An example navigational query, in the context of Movie & TV Search Engine, may be “Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban.” A browse query in this same context may be “action movies.”
- The systems and methods described herein may be used to improve the quality of the browse queries in a digital content information retrieval system. For example, retrieved documents may be scored using both query-dependent and query-independent scores. The query-independent scores may include scores that are based on signals within the corresponding document corpus, as well as personalized query-independent scores based on signals associated with the user (e.g., user's demographics, location, prior viewing/purchase history, user reviews, signals from user social circles, etc.).

content search engine 102 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to receive database documents (e.g.,documents 122, D1, . . . , Dn) in response to a user query 120 from user 101, and rank the receiveddocuments 122 based on the documentfinal scores 124, . . . , 126. The digitalcontent search engine 102 may comprise aCPU 103, amemory 105, a query-independent scores module 108, a query-dependent scores module 110, a personalized query-dependent scores module 111, a personalized query-independent scores module 112, and asearch engine ranker 106. - The query-independent scores module 108 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to calculate a query-independent score 114 (e.g., a popularity score) for one or more documents received from the
database 104. The query-independent score 114 may be based on signals in the corpus associated withdatabase 104. For example, the query-independent score 114 may comprise a popularity score based on the number of search queries previously received within thesearch engine 102 about a specific document from thedatabase 104. The query-independent score 114 may also comprise other types of signals, such as query-to-click ratio information and clickthrough ratio (CTR) information for at least one web page search result for the specific document. Additional signals associated with the query-independent scores module 108 are illustrated inFIG. 1B . - The query-
dependent scores module 110 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to generate ascore 116 for one or more of thedocuments 122, based on terms in the user query 120. - The personalized query-

For example, if the user query 120 is “games” and thesearch engine 102 includes user-related information that user 101 likes board games, then the personalized query-dependent score 117 may boost the scoring of results that are relevant to board games. More specific examples of personalized query-dependent scores are illustrated in reference toFIG. 1C . - The personalized query-
independent scores module 112 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to generate a query-independent score 118 based on one or more signals associated with the user 101 (e.g., user's demographics, location, prior viewing/purchase history, user reviews, signals from user social circles, etc.). More specific examples of personalized query-independent scores are illustrated in reference toFIGS. 2-5 . - The
search engine ranker 106 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to receive one or more documents 122 (e.g., documents D1, . . . , Dn) in response to a user query 120. Thesearch engine ranker 106 may then rank the receiveddocuments 122 based on afinal ranking score 124, . . . , 126 calculated for each document using one or more of the query-independent score 114 (received from the query-independent scores module 108), the query-dependent score 116 (received from the query-dependent scores module 110), the personalized query-dependent score 117 (received from the personalized query-dependent scores module 111), and/or one or more personalized query-independent scores (e.g., received from the personalized query-independent scores module 112). - In operation, the digital
content search engine 102 may receive a document query 120 from user 101. After thesearch engine 102 receives the user query 120, thesearch engine 102 may obtain one or more documents 122 (D1, . . . , Dn) that satisfy the user query 120. After thesearch engine 102 receives thedocuments 122, a query-independent score 114 (using signals in the corpus associated with database 104) and a query-dependent score 116 may be calculated for each of the documents. Additionally, thesearch engine 102 may utilize a personalized query-independent scores module 112 and personalized query-dependent scores module 111 (implemented as part of thesearch engine 102 or separately) to receive a personalized query-independent score 118 and a personalized query-dependent score 117, respectively. Thesearch engine ranker 106 may then use thescores documents 122, and output a ranked document search results list back to the user 101. - Even though the
search engine 102 and thedatabase 104 are all illustrated as separate blocks, the present disclosure may not be limited in this regard. More specifically, thedatabase 104 may be part of, and implemented within, thesearch engine 102 with all processing functionalities being controlled by theCPU 103.
