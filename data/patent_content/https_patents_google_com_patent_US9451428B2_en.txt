Definitions
- the field of invention relates generally to wireless data communication, and more particularly, to processing queries initiated by users of mobile devices.
- SMS Short Message Service
- SMS provides for sending messages of up to 160 characters (224 characters if using a 5-bit mode) to mobile phones that use Global System for Mobile communication. SMS is similar to paging. However, SMS messages do not require the mobile phone to be active and within range and will be held for a number of days until the phone becomes active and within range. SMS messages are transmitted within the same cell or to anyone with roaming service capability. They can also be sent to digital phones from a web site equipped with PC Link or from one digital phone to another.
- SMS Typical uses include notifying a mobile phone owner of a voicemail message, notifying a salesperson of an inquiry and contact to call, notifying a doctor of a patient with an emergency problem, notifying a service person of the time and place of their next call, and notifying a driver of the address of the next pickup.
- SMPP short message peer to peer
- the SMPP protocol is an open, industry standard messaging protocol designed to simplify integration of data applications with wireless mobile networks.
- a method for processing queries initiated by users of mobile devices includes receiving an incoming message containing a query initiated by a user of a mobile device, and extracting the query from the received message.
- the message further includes obtaining a result of the query and creating an outgoing message with the result of the query for delivery to the mobile device.

- the message query server 202 includes an incoming message parser 206 , a query result receiver 208 , and an outgoing message creator 210 .
- the incoming message parser 206 is responsible for receiving messages with user-initiated queries and extracting the queries from the messages.
- the messages may be, for example, SMS messages, MMS messages, and email messages.
- the incoming message parser 206 is also responsible for determining the type of each query and forwarding the query to the search engine processing queries of this type.
- the query type may be, for example, the YP type, the driving direction type, the headline news type, the phone book type (e.g., queries about addresses and/or phone numbers of businesses or residences), a product type (e.g., queries about prices of specific products), a calculator type (e.g., queries about specific calculations), a glossary type (e.g., queries about definitions of words or phrases), the stock ticker type (e.g., queries about stock quotations), the map type (e.g., queries about local maps), etc.
- the incoming message parser 206 determines the query type by analyzing the syntax of the query.
- the query may be preceded by a query type indicator (e.g., the letter “n” for headline news queries, the letter “f” for product queries, etc.).
- the incoming message parser 206 determines the query type by analyzing the semantics of the query.
- the query result receiver 208 is responsible for receiving query results from corresponding search servers 204 .
- the outgoing message creator 210 is responsible for creating an outgoing message for each query result.
- the message may be, for example, an SMS message, a MMS message, or an email message.
- the outgoing message matches the type of the corresponding incoming message (e.g., both incoming and outgoing messages are SMS messages).
- the corresponding incoming and outgoing messages may be of different types (e.g., the incoming message may be an SMS message, and the outgoing message may be an MMS message).
- the outgoing message creator 210 determines whether the size of the outgoing message exceeds an allowed size (e.g., 160 bytes for SMS messages). If so, the outgoing message creator 210 splits the message into multiple messages and forwards each of the multiple messages to the corresponding mobile device. In one embodiment, the outgoing message creator 210 adds a sequence indicator to each of the multiple messages to specify the sequence of a relevant query result portion with respect to the other portions of this query result (e.g., the indicator “2 ⁇ 3” may specify that this query result portion is the second portion of the query result consisting of three portions).
- an allowed size e.g. 160 bytes for SMS messages.
- FIG. 3 illustrating an architecture in which one embodiment of the present invention may be implemented.
- This exemplary architecture utilizes SMS messages and the SMPP (Short Message Peer to Peer) protocol.
- SMS messages and the SMPP (Short Message Peer to Peer) protocol.
- SMPP Short Message Peer to Peer
- a mobile phone 302 is coupled to a SMPP server 304 of the wireless carrier via a wireless network 300 .
- the wireless carrier sends the SMS message to the SMPP server 304 , which routes the message to an SMPP gateway 310 of the mobile user query service via a front end server 306 of the mobile user query service.
- the SMPP gateway 310 sends the SMS message to the SMS server 312 , which extracts the query specified by the user of the mobile device 302 , determines the type of the query, and sends the query to a corresponding search server.
- the corresponding search server may be a map server 314 (e.g., responsible for providing driving directions), a YP server 316 , a web server 318 (e.g., responsible for providing web content), a news server 320 , a product server 322 , a help server 324 (e.g., responsible for providing help information), or any other query server not shown in FIG. 3 .
- the relevant search server produces a result for the query and sends it back to the SMS server 312 , which formats the query result and sends the resulting SMS message to the SMPP gateway 310 .
- the SMPP gateway splits the SMS message if needed (e.g., if the size of the SMS message exceeds 160 bytes), and forwards each of the split messages to the SMPP server 306 via a proxy 308 .
- the SMPP server 306 sends the SMS message (or multiple SMS messages) to the wireless network 300 .
- the mobile phone 302 then receives the message and displays the message to the user. If the mobile phone 302 receives multiple messages containing portions of the same query result, the mobile phone 302 displays the first query result portion and allows the user to request the next query result portion (e.g., by providing a link to the next query result portion at the end of the first query result portion).
- the user of the mobile phone 302 initiates a query, the user is provided with the query result in real time.
- a single server is used, combining the SMS server 312 and the SMPP gateway 310 .
- the SMPP gateway 310 may be used to communicate with different wireless carries.
- the SMPP gateway 310 may be configured to communicate with different external servers (e.g., an SMS server, an MMS server, a mail server, etc.) to exchange messages of various types (e.g., SMS messages, MMS messages, email messages, etc.).
- multiple SMPP gateways 310 and SMS servers 312 are provided to handle a large amount of messages.
- FIG. 4 presents a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 400 for processing queries initiated by users of mobile devices.
- the method may be performed by processing logic, which may comprise hardware, software, or a combination of both.
- Processing logic may reside either in a server (e.g., a message query server 202 of FIG. 2 ), or partially or entirely in a separate device and/or system(s).
- processing logic receives an incoming message containing a query initiated by a user of a mobile device.
- the user may initiate a query by entering the query on the mobile device or by providing a voice query to the mobile device.
- the voice query may then be interpretend by a speech recognition module of the mobile device or a speech recognition module at a server (e.g., the message query server 202 ).
- the incoming message containing the user-initiated query may be, for example, an SMS message, a MMS message or an email message.
- processing logic extracts the query from the received incoming message.
- processing logic also extracts from the incoming message an identifier (e.g., a phone number) of the mobile device of the user.
- extracting the query includes processing the voice query using a speech recognition module.
- processing logic obtains a result of the query.
- processing logic obtains the query result by sending the query to a search server, and receiving the query result from the search server.
- processing logic may obtain the query result in a different manner.
- processing logic may format the extracted query into a database query (e.g., an SQL query), submit the database query to a database engine, and receive a response from the database engine.
- a database query e.g., an SQL query
- processing logic creates an outgoing message with the query result for delivery to the mobile device of the user.
- the outgoing message may be, for example, an SMS message, an MMS message, or an email message.
- the outgoing message may include the query result and the identifier of the user's mobile device (e.g., the phone number).
- the outgoing message matches the type of the corresponding incoming message (e.g., both incoming and outgoing messages are SMS messages).
- the corresponding incoming and outgoing messages may be of different types (e.g., the incoming message may be an SMS message, and the outgoing message may be an MMS message).
- processing logic splits the outgoing message into multiple messages if the size of the outgoing message exceeds an allowed size (e.g., 160 bytes for SMS messages).
- processing logic adds a sequence indicator to each of the multiple messages to specify the sequence of a relevant query result portion with respect to the other portions of this query result (e.g., the indicator “2 ⁇ 3” may specify that this query result portion is the second portion of the query result consisting of three portions).
- FIG. 5 presents a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 500 for obtaining a query result.
- the method may be performed by processing logic, which may comprise hardware, software, or a combination of both.
- Processing logic may reside either in a server (e.g., a message query server 202 of FIG. 2 ), or partially or entirely in a separate device and/or system(s).
- processing logic determines the type of a query extracted from a message transmitted by a mobile device of a user.
- the query types may be determined according to methods disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/850,403 titled “Systems and Methods for Providing Map Information” and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/956,875 titled “Systems and Methods for Providing Stock Ticker Information”, each of the disclosures of which is herein incorporated by reference.
- the query type is determined based on the syntax of the query.
- a query may be preceded by a query type indicator specified by the user (e.g., the user may enter “n olympics” to request a first set of headline news on Olympics, and “n.2 olympics” to request a second set of headline news on Olympics).
- the user is provided with a set of available query type indicators via a help query or any other means.
- processing logic assigns a default query type (e.g., the most popular query type such as the YP type) to the query.
- processing logic analyzes the semantics of the query to determine the query type if the query is entered without a query type indicator.
- a query type indicator is not required and a query type is assigned automatically based on the semantics of the query (i.e., the user does not specify a query type indicator). For example, processing logic may assign an YP type to the query if it determines that the query contains a store name and a zip code.
- processing logic may assign several query types to the query if more than one type applies.
- processing logic determines which search engine is responsible for processing the type of this query and forwards the query to this search engine. In one embodiment, processing logic reformats the query into a command recognizable by the search engine and sends the resulting command to the search engine. In one embodiment, processing logic sends the query to multiple search engines if the query is associated with multiple query types.
- processing logic receives the query result from one or more search engines. If several search results are received, and the combination of these search results exceeds an allowed size of an outgoing message, processing logic may split the outgoing message into multiple messages using the boundaries between the search results.
- processing logic if processing logic does not receive any search result, processing logic sends a query to a help search engine, which provides a help message based on the content of the query (e.g., using a keyword scan), and creates an outgoing message including the help message.
- a help search engine which provides a help message based on the content of the query (e.g., using a keyword scan), and creates an outgoing message including the help message.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary query result displayed on a user's mobile phone. This result is produced in response to the user's YP query (e.g., “pizza mountain view ca”, “round table pizza mountain view ca”, “pizza 94040”, etc.).
