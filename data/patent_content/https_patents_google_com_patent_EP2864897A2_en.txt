Definitions
- Video hosting refers to software where users distribute video dips, typically found on the internet.
- Video-hosting websites allow users to discover videos available over the Internet.
- a user discovers videos of interest by submitting a search query to the video-hosting website or browsing in different categories or channels of the video-searching website.
- the video host presents the user with a list of videos from which he or she can choose,
- the video-hosting website allows a user to search and view videos contained within the video- hosting website, or videos located on or sourced from other websites.
- a database stores content.
- a user-interaction analyzer is in communication with the database. The user-interaction analyzer monitors user behavior with respect to media interaction on a device. User behavior is logged into memory, Normal user behavior is determined. The normal user behavior is stored in memory. User behavior is compared with normal user behavior. When user behavior is not normal, the media segment is tagged in memory. User behavior related to tagged media segment is paired and stored in memory. The paired user behavior related to tagged media segment is analyzed to adjust playback functionality.
- a playback adjust requestor is configured such that, when the user interaction analyzer designates a tagged media segment for low-bandwidth stream, the playback adjust requestor requests a low- bandwidth stream,
- Figure 1 displays a screen shot illustrating an example of a user interface displaying videos associated with a user search query
- Figure 2 displays a screen shot illustrating an example of a user interface displaying the target video and its related videos
- Figure 3 displays a high-level block diagram of example computer architecture In which techniques for determining status aware media play can be employed.
- Figure 4 displays a high-level block diagram of an example media-hosting service system architecture in which techniques for determining status aware media play can be employed.

- a video- information box 219 contains information about the video.
- a related-videos box 221 contains links to videos 223 that a video-hosting service has determined to display as related to video 203.
- the video-serving module retrieves the related videos from a video repository for user presentation. If a user selects a link of a related video, the video-hosting service plays the related video,
- a database stores content
- a user-interaction analyzer is In communication with the database.
- the user-interaction analyzer monitors user behavior with respect to media interaction on a device. Users may opt out of having their information collected. If a user does not opt out, the user behavior is logged into memory.
- a baseline of what constitutes normal user behavior is determined.
- the normal user behavior is stored in memory. Actual user behavior is compared with normal user behavior.
- the media segment is tagged in memory, User behavior related to tagged media segment is paired and stored in memory.
- the paired user behavior related to tagged media segment is analyzed to adjust playback functionality.
- a playback adjust requestor is configured such that, when the user interaction analyzer designates a tagged media segment for a low-bandwidth stream, the playback adjust requestor requests a low-bandwidth stream.

- An example of a video codec includes advanced video coding (AVC) standard H.264/MPEG-4, Part 10 developed by the Internationa!
- client software is added in the media player, webpage or as native application on the client device.
- Server software is added to monitor status of media piayer, web page, browser, and even machine status. User status can be monitored and determined or inferred or both, and smart decision can be made on play parameters.
- the techniques described herein monitor the status of the current video play window (for example, visible, size, location).
- User behavior is monitored with respect to media interaction with the content stored on the database. For example, whether there are activities in video piay window (for example, keyboard, mouse, touches) is determined, !f the user is using native application on the machine, the techniques can record applications such as, for example, status of keyboard, mouse, browser windows, phone jack, screen use, and the like as a time sequence. Users may opt out of having their information collected. If a user does not opt out, the user behavior with respect to media interaction is logged in memory.
- Normal user behavior with respect to media interaction is determined. Normal user behavior can be determined, for example, by interleaving how users: search for content
- normal user behavior can be interleaved by browser window size / player size. For example, if a user seems to be watching the content but with the browser minimized, then that user is probably not consuming the video portion of content; if window is inactive and overlapped by other windows, then the user is probably not consuming the video portion. , The normal user behavior is stored in memory as a baseline against which to compare actual user behavior,
- User behavior with respect to interaction with a segment of the media is compared with the baseline normal user behavior with respect to media interaction.
- the media segment is tagged.
- Paired user behavior related to tagged media segment is analyzed with respect to possibly adjusting playback functionality.
- play parameters can be adjusted accordingly. Examples of play parameters include the bitrate/quality of video or audio, the size of player, the presentation of the player (for example, hidden, opaqueness, color), and the like. For example, a visual cue of darkening/lightening up will smooth the change to maintain a good user experience.
- the window is minimized for long period, video bitrate can be reduced to a minimum, the size of the player reduced, the player window can be darkened, and the audio kept playing.
- a signal is sent to the server of the user status, and the server can skip unnecessary requests (for example, stop serving ads and related videos) until next status change,
- the player window can gradually lighten up, the original video player size restores, and the original video play bitrate restores.
- An update signal can be sent to the server of the user status, and the server can respond accordingly (for example, begin serving ads and related videos) until next status change.
- the server collects information about the user and media, and user status changes. This information can be used to predict a most likely next status for the user, based on the current status and media being played.
- the server can treat active/passive users differently during analysis of user behavior. User behavior can be cross-pollinated with other user specific information. Play functionality can be adjusted accordingly.
- the server can safely wait until near the end of play to make play parameter change; if the server detects user B usually leaves one minute after playing starts and comes back after five minutes, the server can handle this accordingly.
- the information between the user and the media can be paired, stored, and analyzed to get finer grain of statistics.
- Figure 5 is a flow chart illustrating operations of the video-hosting service 201 in determining status aware internet media play according to one implementation. Other implementations perform the steps of Figure 5 In different orders. In addition, other implementations include different and/or additional steps than the steps described herein. In one implementation, the steps of Figure 5 are performed by one more executable programs that are part of the video-hosting service 201 in response to the video being uploaded to the video-hosting service 201 for storage. In another implementation, the steps of Figure 5 are performed by the video-hosting service 201 in response to a user request to view the specific video stored on video-hosting service 201,

- User behavior with respect to media interaction is monitored (502).
- a status of user behavior with respect to media interaction is determined (504).
- a status of device usage with respect to the user is determined (506).
- the status of user behavior is compared with status of device usage with respect to the user (508). If the status of user behavior is not consistent with the status of device usage with respect to the media, then play functionaiity is adjusted (510); if the status of user behavior is consistent with the status of device usage with respect to the media, then play functionality is not adjusted (512),
