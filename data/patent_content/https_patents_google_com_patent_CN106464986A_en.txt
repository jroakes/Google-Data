Abstract
A process builds extracts for video programs based on search query spikes during transmission of the video programs. The process is performed at a server system with one or more processors and memory storing programs configured for execution by the one or more processors. The process identifies a plurality of search query spikes from search queries submitted by a plurality of users, and correlates a subset of the search query spikes to a broadcast video program. Each correlated search query spike corresponds to a respective location in the video program. The process constructs a snippet of the video program by stitching together portions of the video program that contain the locations corresponding to the correlated search query spikes. In some implementations, the portions extend to video scene boundaries before and after each location. In some implementations, video program subtitles are used to match search query spikes to video program locations.
Description
Technical field
The disclosure relates generally to create video frequency program extracts, and the search inquiry more particularly, to submitted to based on user
And generate video clip.
Background technology
Due to video frequency program is very long and the limited time of spectators, so have illustrating that the program fragment of some climax parts is
Useful.In order to there be effect, program fragment must be more shorter than actual programs, and preferably comprise from video frequency program some
Most interested scene.However, the interesting scene of identification is probably taking and result can be according to video
The difference of the people that program is estimated and change.
Content of the invention
Disclosed embodiment solves disadvantages described above and takes passages, with generating video frequency program, the other problems being associated.
Setting up the first step taken passages is to be associated user search queries with broadcast video program.This can by by search term,
Phrase, the key word or concept term corresponding with video frequency program, phrase, key word or concept are associated.As following institute
Description, a kind of mode that these are associated is using video frequency program captions.Some embodiments use speech recognition software
To identify the word in video, and these are associated with search term, phrase, key word or concept.This association is also known
The position that search term described in other video frequency program, phrase, key word or concept occur.
Generally, the search inquiry being proposed during TV programme represents interesting side in described TV programme
Face.The video scene comprising the search term corresponding with popular query, phrase, key word or conceptual entity generally represents whole
Program, and therefore these scenes are stitched together and have been created that useful video segment.
In some embodiments, video clip be by find out match with search inquiry term in video content when
Between (for example, by mate captions), and described video scene extended to border (rearwardly and a forwardly) and formed.At some
In embodiment, long scene is limited (30 seconds before and after for example, without departing from each matched position in video).?
In some embodiments, video scene boundary is identified by the suddenly change in audio or video signal.In some embodiment party
In formula, in the case that there is term, key word, phrase or the conceptual entity of identified coupling, for identical term, pass
The additional matches of other examples of keyword, phrase or concept are also identified and are included in the excerpt.For example, if coupling is
Completed using captions, then can identify inclusion identical term, the other of key word, phrase or concept running through content
Position.
In some embodiments, all coupling scenes are spliced together according to time order and function, but some embodiment party
Formula otherwise is ranked up (for example, especially lively or interesting scene being placed on extracts to the fragment taken passages
Start or end).In some embodiments, coupling is to be inquired about (for example, using from multiple use based on the user being polymerized
The inquiry about being proposed near the same time of given video scene at family), this results in higher than normal queries level
Spike.The fragment being generated therefore reflects the general interest in mated scene.
In some embodiments, to be applied to individual query from unique user (or few for identical matching process
Number user, is such as derived from the user of small-sized social networkies).This generates the video segment of personalization.In some embodiments,
Individualized fit is to be obtained using different technologies (for example, as it is known that proposing the given user of given inquiry also in preset time
Given content is watched) at stamp.
Some embodiments more broadly apply identical process to generate video clip for more than single program.Example
As some embodiments generate the video clip being derived from given certain day thus creating " summary of a day ".Such extracts can
To include the video frequency program from all channels or subset of channels (for example, only news channel or only entertainment channel).At some
In embodiment, this create more wide in range extracts, standalone scenario part is likely more limited (for example, each matched position
Before and after 10 or 15 seconds), or some compatible portion may be omitted and (for example, be inquired about by requiring higher user
Threshold frequency).
Some embodiments identify term, phrase or the concept for mating using search inquiry spike.One of which
The inquiry being committed to search engine can be mated with the television content broadcasted to multiple spectators in identical time frame.One
A little embodiments are analyzed to select query candidate by the frequency submitted to inquiry.When the inquiry frequency for given inquiry
When rate increases suddenly (inquiry " spike "), then exist corresponding with specific event (for example, from the field of the film just broadcasted
Scape) splendid likelihood ratio.
Some embodiments pass through to go out the key word in search inquiry, phrase or concept with some time windows simultaneously
Mode that suitable comparison in existing TV subtitling is mated and inquiry is mated with broadcasted content.For example, if art
Language " gobble stopper " is mentioned on some television channels and occurs in captions, then spectators may be to " gobble
The definition of stopper " is interested or wants to understand more details.Within the short time (for example, one minute), some spectators start
Typing inquiry in search engine.Which forms the spike being able to observe that in " gobble stopper " enquiry frequency.Some
Embodiment is passed through the average request frequency (for example, submitted to inquiry per minute and measure) of inquiry and same queries
Ongoing frequency (for example, during one hour of the past, 15 minutes of past or 5 minutes in the past) is compared to identification so
Spike.Some embodiments pass through by the time window moving recently (for example, remove nearest a few minutes beyond nearest one hour or
Halfhour enquiry frequency data) in be compared with the ongoing frequency of same queries for the largest request frequency of described inquiry
To identify such spike.Some embodiments pass through combining largest request frequency and average request frequency and same queries
Ongoing frequency be compared to identify such spike.
In addition to by key word or phrase come matching inquiry, some embodiments also mate to concept, and this has
When be referred to as knowledge graph entity.This allows for different people and describes identical conceptual entity using various words or phrase
Situation.
The candidate's spike (inquiry or entity) being detected for each, some embodiments check word, key word, phrase
Or conceptual entity whether within nearest a few minutes with any monitored television channel (for example, in nearest five minutes or
In nearly 10 minutes) captions in data be associated.In some embodiments, described inspection includes determining most of cargo tracers
Whether word, key word, phrase or entity occur in the Moving Window of the captions of single TV programme.In some embodiments,
The order of the term inquired about from each also allows for mate the preference of the captions occurring with same sequence being assessed.
As an alternative, some embodiments to execute coupling in contrary direction：Check whether the part of captions occurs in the search query.
When in given traveling time window inquiry element and the subtitle elements of TV programme between exist non-NULL occur simultaneously when, then
There is potential coupling.In some embodiments, overlap is estimated calculating fraction, and exceeds threshold value in described fraction
When be regarded as mate.Some embodiments are directed to coupling and are applied with additional constraint, the expected order of such as term.
Some embodiments directly television content application speech recognition algorithm is generated with the word stream that will be mated and
It is not rely on captions.In some embodiments, captions and speech recognition are both used.

Figure 10 is visually illustrated the identification of inquiry spike and is associated spike with video frequency program.Upper in Figure 10
It is the figure illustrating enquiry frequency 1006 relative time 1004 for concrete inquiry group 342A in half part.The shown time
Section is certain sky 8:00PM and 9:Time between 00PM.Curve 1002 shows how enquiry frequency fluctuates, but in major part
Time is maintained near background mean value 344.However, we can see inquiry between time started 902 and end time 904
The spike 348 of frequency.The enquiry frequency having increased during spike includes all inquiries in inquiry group 342A.For base
For the maximum in the recent period enquiry frequency 345 of group to identify the embodiment of spike, the maximum in the recent period enquiry frequency of group exists
It is determined in the window 1012 (defined between dotted line) of the enquiry frequency data before current time.
It is the listing of four channels under described figure.Channel 1 is assuming program A 328- during this hour
1.Channel 2 assumes program B 328-2 during front half an hour and assumes program C 328-3 during rear half an hour.Frequently
Road 3 assumes program D328-4 during this hour, and channel 4 assumes program E 328-5 during this hour.Server system
114 this five channel 328-1 ..., 328-5 dynamically collect their program term (for example, captions while broadcast
The term that data 332 or speech recognition software are identified).
Once spike 348 is detected, query term just started with spike 348 before (for example, 1 point of recent times section
Clock, 5 minutes or 10 minutes) video frequency program term be compared.In this case, detect at position 910 and program D
The coupling of 328-4.In some cases, coupling is detected by the concrete word of coupling in video frequency program term or key word.

Ask tracked based on client application, and therefore generally relate to video frequency program.When for the inquiry of all usertrackings
When, described inquiry not necessarily related with TV it is thus possible to the suitable expense cost of appearance.In some embodiments, only
By the query generation spike result from unique subscriber.In some such embodiments, unique subscriber passes through user
Query set is stored in server memory 314 and subsequently the inquiry that repeats from same subscriber is converted (i.e., not
In spike detection using) and be determined.
Figure 11 illustrates a kind of matching way of the literal coupling not requiring same term.Sometimes people use different arts
Language is expressing identical basic conception.In described example, phrase " life (life on Mars) on Mars " 1104 is basic
Upper expression and " Mars life (Martian life) " 1106 identical concepts, but this two phrases employ different words
And order of words.If this two phrases are submitted to search inquiry module 116 as inquiry, some embodiments will be in list
In individual inquiry group 1102, they are grouped together.Identical concept matching process can be by query term and from video
The video frequency program term of program is employed when being mated.For example, if there is the inquiry of " life on Mars " 1104
Submission in spike, and " Mars life " 1106 occurs in the video frequency program term of institute's broadcast video program, more then
They can be associated by embodiment.
Figure 12 illustrates the another way of matching inquiry term.In this case, in two term set, there is base
Coupling is identified during identical term sequence in basis.In some cases, described sequence is identical, but in other feelings
Then there are some trickle changes, as illustrated in these examples under condition.For example, the difference of sequence 1112 and 1114 only exists
Increased term " river (river) " in sequence 1114 in the end.They are substantially identical.Sequence 1116 also substantially with
Sequence 1112 is identical because only difference be eliminate unconspicuous term " ... upper (on) ".Although sequence 1118 increases
Two terms " Mary Poppins ", but some embodiments can be classified as and First ray 1112 substantially phase
With this is because it includes the obvious sequence with sequence 1112 identical.Last example 1120 illustrates some embodiments also
Can take into account cacography or literal error.Some (for example, American) may it is not apparent how spelling " Thames ", but
It is to have sufficient context to think that it is coupling in sequence 1120.Some embodiments will be this five sequences all
It is grouped together to single group 1110, and surveyed based on the inquiry for whole submitted to the Bulk polymerization in them
Amount enquiry frequency.
In addition to being grouped together by various matching techniques as illustrated in figures 11 and 12, some embodiments
