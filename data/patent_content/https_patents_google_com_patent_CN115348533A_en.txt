Description
The application is a divisional application of an invention patent application with application date of 2017, 10 and 24 months and application number of 201780086964.4 and the name of 'visible network additionally used for synchronizing local search results'.
Cross Reference to Related Applications
This application is a continuation of U.S. application No. 15/455,529, filed on 10/3/2017, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Technical Field
The application relates to a query processing method and a client device.
Background
In order to provide meaningful search results and other information to the user of a mobile wireless device, the location-or at least the approximate location-of the device needs to be identified. The position estimate may be baseline measured using GPS coordinates, but this may be problematic when there are not enough visible GPS satellites or the device is indoors. In addition, this approach may have high latency when the GPS receiver acquires satellite signals, and may also suffer from power loss due to high battery usage. Information about the cellular network and wireless access points may also be employed to obtain a location estimate. Here, resolving the location of the device may include accessing a network-side database storing geo-located wireless network information including cell tower and WiFi access point information. Such a database may be used to geocode scans for visible networks.
Disclosure of Invention
Aspects of the present technology relate to a single, integrated request and response method between a mobile device and a network. This is particularly beneficial when the request is sent shortly after the mobile device has been started, or when the user grants location permission for the device to an application, such as a search application, for the first time. Two usage scenarios are as follows, for example. One is when the cached location in the device is too early to be relied upon (expired) or otherwise unavailable. Another is when the user activates or otherwise authorizes the location-enabled setting of the application on the client device, but the client device does not have time to obtain the location before a search or other query is initiated by the application.
In accordance with aspects of the present technique, a method comprises: determining, by one or more processors of the client device, whether a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met, and upon determining that the threshold condition corresponding to the current location information of the client device has been met, obtaining, by the processor, visible network data from a wireless communication module of the client device. The method also includes generating an integrated request packet including the at least some of the obtained visible network data and the client query, sending the integrated request packet to a server, receiving a location-enabling response to the client query according to a resolution of a location of the at least some of the obtained visible network data, and generating a result including the received location-enabling response for presentation to a user of the client device.
The integrated request and response methods according to various implementations reduce latency and reduce use of network (and client device) resources as compared to existing systems.
In one scenario, the threshold condition is a change in a location permission of an application executable by the client device. Here, the change of location permissions may include using information associated with at least one of a WiFi network and a cellular network for authorization of the location service.
According to one example, the threshold condition is a determination that a network connectivity change has occurred. In another example, the method further comprises: at least one of WiFi access point and cellular base station information for a connected network is pre-computed before determining that a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met. In yet another example, the visible network data includes at least one of an access point ID, a base station ID, and received signal strength information.
In another alternative, obtaining visible network data from a wireless communication module of a client device comprises: the method further includes selecting a subset of visible network elements from among all visible network elements, and obtaining visible network data from the wireless communication module for the subset of visible network elements. According to another example, determining whether a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met includes determining whether the location information stored on the client device is earlier than a predetermined amount of time. And in yet another example, generating the result includes providing the electronic map for presentation on a display of the client device.
In accordance with other aspects of the present technique, there is provided a client device comprising: a user interface module comprising one or more user input devices configured to receive a user query; a processing module comprising one or more processors; a memory module having one or more memories configured to store data and instructions for execution by the processing module; and a communication module comprising a wireless transceiver configured for bidirectional communication with one or more remote devices. The processing module is operatively coupled to the communication module and configured to determine whether a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met. Upon determining that a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met, the processing module is configured to obtain visible network data from the wireless transceiver, generate an integrated request packet including at least some of the obtained visible network data and the client query, and cause the communication module to transmit the integrated request packet to the remote server. The device is further configured to receive a location-enabling response to the client query from the parsing of the location of the at least some of the obtained visible network data, and generate a result including the received location-enabling response for presentation to a user of the client device.
In one example, the threshold condition is a change in a location permission of an application executable by the client device. In another example, the change in location permissions includes authorization of the location service using information associated with at least one of the WiFi network and the cellular network. According to yet another example, the processing module is further configured to pre-compute at least one of WiFi access point and cellular base station information for the connected network prior to determining that a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met. And in another example, the processing module is configured to determine whether a threshold condition corresponding to current location information of the client device has been met by determining whether the location information stored on the client device is earlier than a predetermined amount of time.
In accordance with other aspects of the present technique, there is provided a method comprising: receiving, by one or more processing devices, an integrated request from a client device, the integrated request including location scan information and a query; analyzing the received location scan information from the integrated request; and resolving the location of the client device by comparing the location scan information with the set of stored geographic location data. The method also includes applying the parsed location to the query to obtain a set of location-related search results responsive to the query, and sending the location-related search results to the client device for presentation to a user of the client device.
In one scenario, the method further includes providing the analyzed location scan information to a location service to resolve the location of the client device. Here, the method may further include the location service providing the resolved location to an application service to obtain a set of location-related search results responsive to the query.
In another example, analyzing the received location scan information from the integrated request includes passing the location scan information to the location service and passing the query to the application service in parallel. This may also include the application service initiating the first search phase using only the query to identify a set of possible search results. And, alternatively, applying the resolved location to the query may include using the resolved location in a second stage refined search to obtain a set of location-related search results.
More specifically, embodiments herein disclose a method comprising: receiving, by one or more processing devices, an integrated request from a client device, the integrated request including location scan information and a query; analyzing the received location scan information from the integrated request; resolving, by the one or more processing devices, the location of the client device by comparing the location scan information to a set of stored geographic location data; applying, by the one or more processing devices, the parsed location to the query to obtain a set of location-related search results responsive to the query; and sending the set of location-related search results to the client device for presentation to a user of the client device.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
The integration methods discussed herein include appending network scan information to a query sent to a web server or other entity. In one example, the server provides location identification services and search services, and the received information can be accordingly separated between these elements of the server in an efficient manner that minimizes data transmission and latency. However, from the perspective of the client device, only one query is sent. The client device quickly receives the location-based correlation results. This may not only reduce system latency and power consumption, but may also reduce network overhead by eliminating unnecessary packet transmissions.
This method is in contrast to the conventional query process shown in FIG. 1A. Here, the location information is sent from the client device to the network where it is routed from the interface web server to the location service. The location service calculates the location and returns the results to the client device through the interface web server. Based on this information, the client device can send the parsed location to the web application service along with the query. This information is again passed through the interfacing web server before being received by the application service, which generates search results based on the parsed location. The results are then provided back to the client device through the web server.
For different reasons, delay may be a problem with this approach. As described above, there may be a delay in the client when the on-board GPS receiver acquires the satellite signal. And there may also be transmission delays between the client device and the network, and possible back-end delays between different elements of the network.
An example of an integration method is shown in FIG. 1B. Here, as discussed in more detail below, the obtained visible network data is appended to a query that is subsequently sent to the network. The interface web server provides the visible network data to a location service of the network to resolve the location. This information is passed to the relevant application service that generates the search results relevant to the location. This information is returned to the client device through the interface web server. The integration of information reduces the delay described above and helps to ensure that the response to the query is based on an accurate location.
Example arrangement
Fig. 2 illustrates an example client device 200 that can be used with the techniques disclosed herein. As shown, the device 200 includes a processing module 202 having one or more computer processors (such as a central processing unit 204 and/or a graphics processor 206), and a memory module 208 configured to store instructions 210 and data 212. The processors may or may not operate in parallel, and may include ASICs, controllers, and other types of hardware circuitry. The processor is configured to receive information from a user through the user interface module 214 and present the information to the user on a display device having a display module 216 of the display interface.
The user interface module 214 may receive commands from a user via user input and convert them for submission to a given processor. The user input may include one or more of a touch screen, keypad, mouse, stylus, microphone, or other type of input device. The display module 216 may include appropriate circuitry for driving a display device to present graphical and other information to a user. By way of example, the graphics information may be generated by the graphics processor(s) 206, while the CPU 204 manages the overall operation of the client device 200.
The memory module 208 may be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium, one or more volatile memory units, or a non-volatile memory unit. The memory module 208 may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM, and may be embodied as a hard disk drive or memory card. Alternatively, the memory module 208 may also include DVD, CD-ROM, writeable, and read-only memory. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions (such as instructions 210) that, when executed by one or more processors, perform one or more methods, such as those described herein. The information carrier is a computer-or machine-readable medium, such as the memory module 208. Although fig. 2 functionally shows the processor(s), memory module, and other elements of device 200 as being within the same overall block, these components may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, some or all of the instructions and data may be stored on an information carrier that is a removable storage medium (e.g., an optical disk drive or a USB drive), and others are stored within a read-only computer chip.
The processor may retrieve, store, or modify data 212 in accordance with instructions 210. For example, although claimed subject matter is not limited by any particular data structure, data may be stored in a computing device register, in a relational database, as a table, XML document, or flat file having a number of different fields and records. The data may also be formatted in any computing device readable format.
The instructions 210 may be any set of instructions executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by the processor(s). For example, the instructions may be stored as computing device code on a computing device readable medium. In this regard, the terms "instructions" and "programs" may be used interchangeably herein. The instructions may be stored in an object code format for direct processing by the processor(s), or in any other computing device language, including scripts or collections of separate source code modules that are interpreted or pre-compiled as needed. The function, method and routine of the instructions are explained in more detail below.
As also shown in fig. 2, client device 200 includes a communication module 218 for communicating with other devices and systems. The communication module 218 includes a wireless transceiver; alternatively, the module may include a wired transceiver. Client device 200 may communicate with other remote devices via communication module 218 using various configurations and protocols, including short-range communication protocols (such as near field communication, bluetooth) TM Bluetooth TM Low Energy (LE)), or other ad-hoc network, the internet, an intranet, a virtual private network, a wide area network, a local network, a private network using one or more company-specific communication protocols, ethernet, wiFi, and HTTP, and combinations of the foregoing.
In addition, the client device 200 as shown includes one or more position and orientation sensors 220. The position and orientation sensor 220 is configured to determine the position and orientation of the client computing device 100. For example, these components may include a GPS receiver, as well as an accelerometer, gyroscope, or another direction/velocity detection device, for determining the latitude, longitude, and/or altitude of the device. Client device 200 may also include one or more cameras 222, speaker(s) 224, and power module 226 for capturing still images and recording video streams, as well as actuators (not shown) for providing haptic feedback or other information to the user.
FIG. 3 shows an example arrangement in which different client devices 300 (e.g., 300) 1 ，300 2 ，300 3 And 300 4 ) Content or other information may be requested from server 320 via communication system 310. Client device 300 may include some or all of the components discussed above with respect to client device 200. The client device may comprise a laptop computer (300) 1 ) Tablet computer (300) 2 ) Cellular phone or PDA (300) 3 ) Or desktop PC (300) 4 ). However, other client devices may also be employed, including wearable electronic devices (such as smart watches). Any such client device may send a request and receive a target result from the network based on the resolved location of the client device as shown in fig. 1B.
By way of example only, a request may be analyzed and routed to one or more services on a network. This may include interfacing with server 320 1 Associated location service and associated server 320 2 An associated application service. Although a plurality of separate servers 320 are shown, the functions of the location and application services may be performed by one or more servers or other computer systems (such as a cloud computing network). Requests, data, and corresponding responses may be communicated via bus 330. The service may use one or more databases 340 to resolve the client device location and/or provide relevant results based on the resolved location information.
Example methods and use cases
As described above, the features of the techniques may be implemented in different use cases. Examples of several use cases are discussed below.
In one use case, a user may request information via an application on a client device. For example, the information may be about a point of interest, such as a restaurant, coffee shop, car dealership, museum, and so forth. Other use cases may relate to online shopping or other order arrangements. Nevertheless, the technique is query independent. For example, a user may request information about bus schedules, house rentals, tourist attractions, menus, etc.
An example scenario is illustrated with respect to flowchart 400 of FIG. 4. Here, in block 402, the process pre-computes network information. For example, the communication module 218 (fig. 2) may continuously or intermittently scan for wireless networks. WiFi access point and/or cellular base station information may be collected for remote devices to which the client device is connected via a communication link or other devices that the client device is "visible" when scanning available frequencies and communication bands. This operation occurs automatically at the client device without user interaction. However, to conserve battery life, scanning may be intermittent, for a limited number of remote devices, and/or include other constraints that limit the feasibility of the obtained network information.
Once the user has initiated the query, for example by typing, tapping, or speaking the request via the user interface module 214 of fig. 2, the system may determine whether any location information is available for the client device. For example, in block 404, the system determines whether a change in location settings has been requested or some other threshold condition is met. Here, the location setting change may occur by an application requesting enablement of a location service. Or the system may determine that the obtained network information is not feasible due to its expiration, e.g., too early to provide a useful location within a certain accuracy. For example, if the pre-computed network information exceeds 1 minute, it may be considered to be out of date. The time may alternatively be 30 seconds, 10 minutes, or longer or shorter.
In some scenarios, the default scenario is to not enable the location service on the client device without explicit authorization by the user. Here, the application may prompt the user to grant location permission to the application. This may involve turning on one or more location-specific services, including cellular and WiFi networks. In some cases, the user may be required to indicate which specific location services to activate. In other cases, the user may authorize activation of all applicable location services in order to obtain location-related query results.
The client device may not have obtained a highly accurate location signal when location permission has been granted and location service(s) have been initiated. For example, there may be no device location, or an inaccurate IP geolocation or historical location signal set. In this case, the system may trigger (re) loading of location information immediately upon the user granting location permission. This occurs in block 406 where the system obtains visible network data (e.g., using communication module 218).
Even before a setting change, some of this data may still be available, in which case it will be pre-computed. Unfortunately, it may take some time to obtain useful location information after permission is granted. For example, it may take 5-500ms or more to update the cellular and/or WiFi network data with the current information.
Visible network data may include some or all of the following. For a WiFi network, the BSSID, SSID, and signal strength of the access point may be collected. And for a cell network (e.g., CDMA, GSM, LTE, WCDMA), the information may include a cell ID, a location area code, a mobile country code, a mobile network code, and a primary scrambling code. Other types of data may also be collected, such as information about ad-hoc or near-field connections, as well as other types of wireless scanning information.
At the client device, it is beneficial to track the visible network in a passive manner to minimize the impact on battery drain. Even if device location is not enabled, the system will have some information about the actively connected network. Updating information about such connected networks may be much faster than obtaining information about all visible access points and cell sites. In one example, computing a visible network will not trigger a WiFi scan; alternatively, the system may read the latest WiFi scan information available from the device.
Also, while the location may be resolved at the client device, this may be computationally intensive and time consuming. It may also increase battery drain. Thus, the approach discussed herein relieves the client device of the burden and allows the network to resolve the location in an efficient manner.
Due to delays and/or power limitations on the client device side, additional WiFi and full scanning of cell data may not be possible. In one example, only data for an actively connected WiFi access point and/or cell base station may be provided. In another example, data for a subset of visible but unconnected WiFi access points and/or cell base stations may be provided separately or together with data for actively connected devices. The subset of visible devices may be on the order of 2-5 devices. Alternatively, the system may attempt to collect scan data for any device within communication range.
To avoid returning results based on expired or outdated locations, when location permissions are granted, the system is configured to generate integrated location scans and requests (queries) that are sent to the network. The location scan desirably includes WiFi and cell scan information, but as noted above, may include various types of network information. An integrated location scan and request data packet(s) is generated at block 408. For example only, a processor such as the CPU 204 may combine the network location scan information with a search or other query received via the user interface module 214 to create an integrated request. At block 410, the request for integration is sent to the network. In response, one or more location-related results responsive to the query are then received from the network at block 412.
FIG. 5 illustrates an example process 500 in which a network receives and processes an integrated request. As shown at block 502, an integrated location scan and request packet(s) are received from a client device. According to aspects of the present disclosure, scan data received by the network will not be recorded. On the network side, a server such as an interface web server or equivalent receives the integrated information. The server identifies the received packet(s) that include the query and scan data, parses out the scan data and sends it to the location service to parse the location at block 504. For example, the scan data may be provided to server 320 of FIG. 3 1 The location service of (2). At block 506, the location service may resolve the client device location by accessing a geo-location database, such as database 340. This may involve matching WiFi and/or cellular signal information with corresponding information in a geolocation database. In one implementation, the parsed location information will be added to the requested location context in the server and recorded as the usual device location.
After parsing, the network uses the parsed location in responding to the request. Here, at block 508, the parsed location is applied to the received queryOr other request to obtain search results. By way of example, server 320 of FIG. 3 2 The associated application service may use the parsed location to identify a subset of possible search results or otherwise rank the results relative to the location. Once the location-related results have been obtained, they are returned to the client device at block 510.
Returning to step 504, once the system determines that the received request is an integrated request, the interface web server may first pass the scan data to the location service and wait for the result, and then pass this information to the application service. Alternatively, the interface web server may simultaneously pass the scan data to the location service and the query to the application service. This further minimizes delays due to communication within the network. Here, the application service may begin the first phase of the search to obtain a first set of results. And when it receives the parsed location, it can use the location information to conduct a second stage refined search to produce a final result. These results are then returned to the client device.
The logic and process flows depicted in the figures and described herein are not limited to a particular order or sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise. In addition, other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed from, the described systems.
Although the technology herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present technology. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present technology as defined by the appended claims.
The present technology enjoys wide industrial applicability including, but not limited to, personal computing devices and systems, including systems that provide location-based services.
