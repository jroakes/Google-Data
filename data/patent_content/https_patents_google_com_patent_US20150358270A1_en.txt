- the conversation system can provide at least two different views including a conversation list view and a conversation view, both as mentioned briefly above.
- a conversation list view a plurality of conversations can be displayed, where each conversation can be displayed in a summary form.
- each conversation can be represented by a number of conversation elements.
- the conversation elements can include one or more of: a number indicating the number of messages in the conversation, a list of one or more of the identifiers or names of the senders of messages in the conversation, a conversation description (e.g., the text of a subject line of one of the messages in a conversation), a date/time value of the conversation (e.g., a date/time value of the last received message in the conversation), and a snippet from one or more of the messages in the conversation.
- each conversation can be represented in a single row in a list of conversations.
- one or more messages from a conversation can be displayed.
- Each message can be displayed in one of a number of various modes, for example an expanded mode, a compacted mode, or a compressed mode.
- an expanded mode the body of the message can be displayed along with, for example, header information including the names or other identifiers of the sender and the recipients of the message, a date/time of the message, routing information, and other properties of the message.
- An expanded mode can be used, for example, for messages which are new.
- a compacted mode the body can be hidden and a snippet from the message provided in its place. The snippet can be chosen to occupy less space than the body. For example, snippets can be chosen to occupy one line in a display window.
- the compacted mode can be used for messages which have been read.
- the compacted mode can allow messages to be displayed in a window more densely than if the expanded mode were used.
- a message can be represented with a small bar.
- the small bar can contain no message information.
- the visual effect of such a mode can be that multiple compressed messages appear like the edges of cards in a deck of cards.
- a user can toggle between the various display modes by selecting a message or using various controls in the display window.
- additional information can be displayed.
- information items For example, one or more advertisements relevant to, or related to, one or more of the conversations in the conversation list can be displayed.
- one or more other types of information can be displayed.
- Such other information can include, but is not limited to news items, map links, product reviews, phone numbers, web page links, dictionary entries, images, RSS feeds, blog (web log) events, user polls, links to files or other content on the client 102 , and other types of information.
- the relevant information displayed to the user can depend on information about the user stored in the user information database 126 .
- RSS feeds 114 can be content distributed from various sources on a network (e.g., the Internet).
- RDF Site Summary (RSS) (and sometimes, Real Simple Syndication) is an XML-based lightweight multipurpose extensible metadata description and syndication format. RSS is typically used for distributing various types of content to a number of receivers simultaneously.

- Blog events can be events generated from one or more web logs (blogs).
- User polls can be polls that the user may participate in which may come from a variety of sources.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a process by which information can be generated for a list of conversations and then displayed along with the list of conversations according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a list of conversations is identified ( 202 ).
- a list of conversations can be generated as a result of a number of different actions.
- a search query can be applied against a database of messages.
- One or more relevant conversations can be returned in response to the search query.
- a conversation is relevant to a search query when one or more parts of the conversation are relevant to the search query (e.g., the conversation contains one or more messages whose contents are relevant to the search query).
- the relevancy of a particular content to a search query can be determined by any number of well known techniques. Search queries can be explicit or implicit.
- An explicit search query can include accepting one or more search terms affirmatively entered by the user.
- An implicit search query can include searches based on a particular message view (e.g., an Inbox view), a label, or other information.
- Labels can be applied to conversations and/or messages. A user can choose to search for a particular label by selecting that label from a list of labels. Labels can be user created and/or system created. In some embodiments, a user's inbox can be thought of an implicit search for conversations and/or messages having an “inbox” label.
- content components for each conversation in the list can be identified ( 204 ).
- Content components can be identified for a subset of conversations in the list.
- a subset can comprise those conversations which are in a current display window provided to the user.
- a content component can be any portion of a conversation.
- the content components for a conversation can comprise a snippet of the conversation and/or the conversation description.
- the content components can also comprise one or more portions of one or more of the messages in the conversation and/or the conversation itself.
- One or more portions of a message can include header information or other information associated with a message or a conversation (e.g., a date/time value of when a message was viewed or the subject line of the message).
- One or more conversations can then be selected ( 206 ) according to various criteria based on the identified content components.
- a single conversation can be selected by being a top most conversation in the list (e.g., a conversation having a most recently received message).
- a single conversation can be selected based on which conversation was most recently viewed.
- a single conversation can be selected by having a most recently received message which has been viewed.
- a single conversation can be selected by being a most recently viewed conversation for which at least one advertisement had been presented.
- a single conversation can be selected by being a most recently viewed conversation for which no advertisement has been presented, or for which the number of presented advertisements is equal to or less than the number of advertisements presented with other recently viewed conversations.
- a single conversation can be selected at random from those conversations which have already been viewed.
- random when used in this document to refer to selecting or choosing one or more items from a set or list, encompasses both random and pseudorandom selection methodologies. For instance, “randomly” selecting a term from a set of terms (or a conversation from a set of conversations) may be accomplished by randomly or pseudo-randomly generating a value in a predefined range (e.g., between 0 and 1) and then using that value to select a term (or conversation) from the set.
- a predefined range e.g., between 0 and 1
- a single conversation having a highest number of words and/or word phrases from a list of words and/or word phrases can be selected.
- the number can be based on the number of distinct words and/or word phrases from the list which are present in the content components of the conversation.
- a list of words or word phrases can be created, for example, from keywords and/or word phrases associated with advertisements, where the advertisements have been frequently selected by a community of users over a period of time. Users can select an advertisement by, for example, clicking on the advertisement when the advertisement is presented to the user. Advertisements can be chosen for presentation to a user by being associated with a particular keyword or word phrase.
- Advertisers can bid on keywords and/or word phrases such that when the bid-upon keyword and/or word phrase is present in a content (e.g., in a search query or a web page), the advertisement from the advertiser having the highest bid for that keyword or word phrase can be presented.
- a content e.g., in a search query or a web page
- advertisements can be selected, at least in part, in accordance with a user's profile, in accordance with a calculated score indicating how relevant the advertisements are to the content, and/or in accordance with the respective click-through rates of the advertisements).
- a list of keywords and/or word phrases used for selecting a conversation and/or conversations can be those keywords and/or word phrases having selection rates (e.g., advertisements being selected based on the keywords and/or word phrases) greater than a threshold.
- the list can be a number of keywords or word phrases (e.g., 1000) having the highest selection rates, for example.
- a single conversation can be selected from among conversations having a number of distinct keywords and/or word phrases from the list present in their identified content components greater than threshold.
- the conversation selected can be randomly selected from among those conversations.
- a conversation can be selected based on an advertising metric determined using the conversation's content components.
- the advertising metric can be determined based on various factors such as a predicted click-though metric which represents a predicted probability of a user selecting co-displayed advertising based on the content.
- the advertising metric can be based on a user's actual advertising selections in the past.
- more than one conversation can be selected. For example, those conversations having a number of distinct keywords and/or word phrases from the list present in their identified content components greater than threshold can be selected.
- the first N conversations e.g., 5
- the first U conversations having unread messages in the conversation list can be selected, where U is an integer up to the number of conversations displayed to the user.
- all of the conversations in the list can be selected.
- a conversation's elements can include one or more of: a number indicating the number of messages in the conversation, a list of one or more sender identifiers or names of senders of messages in the conversation, a conversation description (e.g., the text of one of the messages in the conversations), a date/time value of the conversation (e.g., a date/time value of the last received message in the conversation), a snippet from one or more of the messages in the conversation, and one or more portions of one or more of the messages in the conversation.
- the one or more message portions can include header information or other information associated with a message (e.g., a date/time value of when a message was viewed).
- the identified content can be the conversation description and the snippet of the selected conversation(s) displayed in a conversation list presented to the user.
- one or more of the conversation elements from the identified conversation(s) can be examined to identify those keywords from a list of keywords and or word phrases (e.g., names of products, brands or businesses) that are present.
- the content identified at 206 can be one or more of the identified keywords and/or word phrases chosen at random.
- the identified content can be all of the descriptions of the conversations along with their respective snippets.
- the identified content can be one or more portions of one of the conversations selected at random.
- the identified content from 208 can be modified by adjusting an importance factor associated with one or more content elements in the identified content.
- an importance factor associated with one or more content elements in the identified content. This can be useful because some information servers (e.g., ad server 128 or information server 130 ) can accept information relating to an importance of one or more portions of the input relative to the other portions. Accordingly, based on various criteria, it can be determined that one or more portions of the identified content from 208 to be provided as an input to an information server should be treated differently from other portions. Adding this importance factor information can cause the output of the information server to be weighted toward those portions deemed important and/or down-weighted for portions deemed unimportant.
- one or more elements associated with a particular part of a pattern identified in a conversation can be accorded importance factors different from others parts of the pattern. For example, an element associated with a product name can be accorded more weight than other elements (e.g., the text of an indicated shipping method such as “air freight”). In another example, an element identified as a destination shipping address in a receipt for an online purchase can be down-weighted in importance.
- the content identified at 208 can be examined to identify which keywords and/or word phrases from a list of keywords and/or word phrases are present in the content. From the keywords and/or word phrases identified in the content, one or more of these keywords and/or word phrases can be selected and their importance factors modified.
- the keywords and/or word phrases can be selected in any number of ways. For example, one or more of the keywords or word phrases can be selected at random from the identified keywords and/or word phrases present in the content. In another example, one or more of the keywords or word phrases having advertising metrics (e.g., a selection rate) greater than other keywords or word phrases can be selected. In yet another example, one or more of the keywords or word phrases having profile similarity scores greater than other keywords or word phrases can be selected.
- a profile similarity score for each keyword or word phrase can be determined by, for example, comparing the keyword or word phrase to the user's profile according to various criteria. The more closely aligned a keyword or word phrase is to the user's profile, the higher the profile similarity score will be. Those content elements corresponding to the selected keywords or word phrases can have their respective importance factor increased.
- keywords and/or word phrases can be added to the content identified at 208 .
- These keywords and/or word phrases can be related to the identified content, and can be known to result in information items (e.g., advertisements) with a higher selection rate.
- the additional keywords and/or word phrases are selected from keywords and/or word phrases known to be correlated with words and/or word phrases in the identified content. For example, an abbreviation of a product name can be correlated with the full name of the product. Therefore, when the abbreviation is identified in the content, the full product name can be added to the content (and vice versa).
- the targeted information processor 124 can return information (hereinafter called the targeted information) to the conversation engine 110 relevant to the identified content.
- the targeted information can include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: advertisements, product reviews, news items, map links, phone numbers, web page links, dictionary entries, images, RSS feeds, blog (web log) events, user polls, and other types of information.
- the targeted information obtained for the user can depend on information about the user (e.g., a user profile) stored in the user information database 126 .
- the information in the user profile can be used by the targeted information processor 124 to enhance a likelihood that the targeted information is consistent with the preferences indicated in the user profile.
- the targeted information can be displayed along with the list of conversations ( 214 ).
- the conversation engine 110 can receive the information from the targeted information processor 124 and determine formatting information which can be used, for example, by a client application (e.g., client application 132 ) to display the list of conversations and the targeted information.
- the conversation engine can send the formatting information, the targeted information, and list of conversations to the client 102 in one or more transmissions.
- FIG. 3A provides an exemplary screenshot of a display with a conversation list and targeted information items in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 3A provides one exemplary display organization for illustration purposes only and does not serve to limit the ways conversation lists and targeted information items can be displayed.
- the display area 300 can include three major display portions: a navigation and control portion 302 , a message list portion 304 , and a targeted information items portion 306 .
- the navigation and control portion 302 can include one or more navigation and/or control items (e.g., “compose email”).

Abstract
Description
- This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/914,035, filed Aug. 6, 2004, entitled “Displaying Conversations in a Conversation-Based Email System” which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This application is also related to U.S. Patent Application No. _____, filed Apr. 20, 2005, entitled “System and Method for Targeting Information Based on Message Content” which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- The disclosed embodiments relate generally to providing information to computer users.
- As with traditional advertising, online advertising seeks to provide advertising to individuals likely to respond to the advertisement in some way, for example, by increasing a user's awareness of the brand or by ultimately stimulating a user to purchase a product or service. One way advertisers target a user is to provide advertisements that are related to the content of a web page that the user is viewing. Some advertising systems are designed to receive an input of content and return advertisements based on that content.
- According to some embodiments, a method of presenting information includes identifying a set of content components, where each content component comprises at least a subset of a respective source content. A determination is made as to whether one or more in the set satisfies a condition. Content is identified in accordance with the determination and information is obtained relevant to the identified content.
- For a better understanding of the nature and embodiments of the invention, reference should be made to the Description of Embodiments below, in conjunction with the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of asystem 100 for implementing some embodiments of the invention. One ormore clients 102 can be connected to acommunication network 104. Thecommunication network 104 can be connected to aninformation service 106. Theinformation service 106 can include aconversation engine 110, anupdater engine 112, amessage index 114, aquery engine 116, amessage database 118, one or moreauxiliary services servers 120, anSMTP gateway 122, a targetedinformation processor 124, and auser information database 126. The targetedinformation processor 124 can be connected to anad server 128 and/or aninformation item server 130. - The
client 102 can be any of a number of devices (e.g., a computer, an internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a cell phone, a gaming device, a desktop computer, or a laptop computer) and can include aclient application 132, aclient assistant 134, and other applications or data stored inclient memory 136. Theclient application 132 can be a software application that permits a user to interact with theclient 102 and/or network resources to perform one or more tasks. For example, theclient application 132 can be a browser (e.g., Firefox) or other type of application that permits a user to search for, browse, and/or use resources (e.g., web pages and web services) on theclient 102 and/or accessible via thecommunication network 104. Theclient assistant 134 can perform one or more tasks related to monitoring a user's activities with respect to theclient application 132 and/or other applications, searching or browsing for resources (e.g., files) on theclient 102, and processing information received from or being sent toinformation service 106. Theclient assistant 134 can be part of theclient application 132, for instance a plug-in to the client application 132 (provided, for example, from various online sources), or provided as a stand-alone program. Theclient assistant 134 can be a web-based messaging application such as the client executable portion of the Google Gmail product. In particular, theclient assistant 134 may be embedded in one or more web pages downloaded to theclient 102 from a remote server. Theclient assistant 134 can include JavaScript instructions embedded in the one or more web pages, and those JavaScript instructions can be executed by theclient 102 in an environment (e.g., a virtual machine environment or program interpreter) provided by theclient application 132.Client memory 136 can store system information and information about a user, among other things. - The
communication network 104 can be any local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, or the Internet. It is sufficient that thecommunication network 104 provide communication capability between theclients 102 and theinformation service 106. In some embodiments, thecommunication network 104 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). HTTP permits client computers to access various resources available via thecommunication network 104. The various embodiments of the invention, however, are not limited to the use of any particular protocol. The term “resource” as used throughout this specification refers to any piece of information or service that is accessible via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and can be, for example, a web page, a document, a database, an image, or a computational object. - The
conversation engine 110 can respond to a variety of requests from theclient assistant 134 related to messages and return conversation-based responses via its connection with thecommunication network 104. A conversation can include one or more relevant messages relating to a conversation topic. Various criteria can be used to determine which messages are part of each distinct conversation. For example, an analysis can be made of the contents of a user's message and messages whose contents are found to be related can be grouped together. In another example, a thread identifier found in a message header can be used to identify related messages. In yet another example, a subject line in the message header can be used to identify related messages. The senders and recipients of the messages are considered participants in the conversation. All messages directed to a user of theinformation service 106 can be grouped into a plurality of conversations and presented to the user in a conversation-based format, individually or jointly. In a conversation list view, a user can see a listing of the user's conversations in summary form. In a conversation view, the user can see one or more of the conversation messages in an expanded form. - The
information service 106 can create a snippet of a conversation and/or a message. A snippet provides a user with a preview of the contents of the conversation or message without the user having to open the conversation or the message. In a list of conversations, a snippet can be generated from the most recent message in the conversation. A snippet can also be extracted from the first message (e.g., an oldest message) in the conversation. A snippet can also be extracted from all the messages in the conversation according to predefined heuristic rules, e.g., listing a set of keywords appearing most frequently in the conversation. If theinformation service 106 is preparing a list of conversations in response to a search submitted by a user, theinformation service 106 can create a snippet including a highlighted portion that matches user-submitted query terms, which may be similar in one or more respects to snippets included in search results returned by a search engine, such as the Google search engine. In a conversation view, a snippet can be generated for one or more messages in the conversation. Snippets can be generated based on a user profile. A user profile can contain information about a user such as the user's preferences with respect to certain types or categories of information and/or terms. One or more user profiles can be stored in theuser information database 126. Alternatively, or in addition to, a user profile can be stored in a cookie stored on a user's computer. The user profile can be provided to theinformation service 106 as part of a search request. User profiles can be created in a variety of ways, such as by receiving information from a user, and/or by inferring information about a user from the user's computing activities such as browsing, searching, messaging, and use of various software applications (e.g., a word processing application). - The
SMTP gateway 122 is also connected to thecommunication network 104. TheSMTP gateway 122 can be directly involved in receiving and sending messages. In some embodiments, theSMTP gateway 122, for example, transmits and receives messages using the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). TheSMTP gateway 122 can receive a new message from thecommunication network 104 and send the message toconversation engine 110 for additional processing. Additionally, theSMTP gateway 122 can receive messages from theconversation engine 110 and then transmit (via the communication network 104) those messages to recipient addresses specified in the messages. - The one or more
auxiliary services servers 120 can provide additional services to theconversation engine 110. Theauxiliary services servers 120 can, for example, include a spam detection module for detecting and processing spam and/or an attachment management module for managing the storage and retrieval of files attached to messages. - As mentioned above, the
conversation engine 110 can be connected to a targetedinformation processor 124. The targetedinformation processor 124 can provide information items for display to a user at theclient 102. The targetedinformation processor 124 can provide, for example, advertisements and/or other information items related to content (e.g., messages or conversations) being provided to theclient assistant 134. The targetedinformation processor 124 can be connected to theuser information database 126 to use information about a user (e.g., a user profile) to affect the targeted information provided to the user. -
FIG. 1 is exemplary. In some embodiments, theinformation service 106 contains a subset or superset of those elements illustrated in the figure. AlthoughFIG. 1 shows theinformation service 106 as a number of discrete items, the figure is intended more as a functional description of the various features which may be present in theinformation service 106 rather than a structural schematic of the various embodiments. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. Some items shown separately in the figure could be implemented by a single server and some single items could be implemented by one or more servers. For example, themessage database 118 can be implemented using a plurality of servers. In another example, one or more of the capabilities of the targetedinformation processor 124 can be included in theconversation engine 110. The actual number of servers in theinformation service 106 and how features are allocated among the various servers will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods. - As mentioned above, the
client 102 can include aclient application 132 and aclient assistant 134. Theclient application 132 can provide a window used for displaying. conversations. The conversations and messages in the conversations can be encoded using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), or any other appropriate markup language or encoding, and then rendered by theclient application 132. When a user submits a request through theclient application 132 to theinformation service 106 to access messages stored in the user's account, theinformation service 106 identifies conversations in the user's account in accordance with the user's request and transfers one or more portions of them as well as a set of display instructions back to theclient 102. Theclient assistant 134 can, in response, generate one or more forms in accordance with the display instructions, where each form can include information of some of the conversations. The forms can then be submitted to and rendered by theapplication 132. In one embodiment, theclient assistant 134 may alternatively exist and operate in theinformation service 106. - The
information service 106 and theclient assistant 134 can work together to allow a user to view and/or search messages in a user's message account and to present the search results in a highly intuitive fashion. Theinformation service 106 can extract information from a user's message account (e.g., an e-mail account) or process a message being composed by the user, while theclient assistant 134 can assist in rendering the information prepared by theinformation service 106. In other embodiments, a different division of duties between theinformation service 106 and theclient assistant 134 can be used. Because many of the tasks can be performed by either theinformation service 106 or theclient assistant 134 or by the two working together, these two components are sometimes referred to jointly in this specification as the “conversation system”. - The conversation system can provide at least two different views including a conversation list view and a conversation view, both as mentioned briefly above. In a conversation list view, a plurality of conversations can be displayed, where each conversation can be displayed in a summary form. For example, each conversation can be represented by a number of conversation elements. The conversation elements can include one or more of: a number indicating the number of messages in the conversation, a list of one or more of the identifiers or names of the senders of messages in the conversation, a conversation description (e.g., the text of a subject line of one of the messages in a conversation), a date/time value of the conversation (e.g., a date/time value of the last received message in the conversation), and a snippet from one or more of the messages in the conversation. In some embodiments, each conversation can be represented in a single row in a list of conversations.
- In a conversation view, one or more messages from a conversation can be displayed. Each message can be displayed in one of a number of various modes, for example an expanded mode, a compacted mode, or a compressed mode. In an expanded mode, the body of the message can be displayed along with, for example, header information including the names or other identifiers of the sender and the recipients of the message, a date/time of the message, routing information, and other properties of the message. An expanded mode can be used, for example, for messages which are new. In a compacted mode, the body can be hidden and a snippet from the message provided in its place. The snippet can be chosen to occupy less space than the body. For example, snippets can be chosen to occupy one line in a display window. The compacted mode can be used for messages which have been read. The compacted mode can allow messages to be displayed in a window more densely than if the expanded mode were used. In a compressed mode, a message can be represented with a small bar. The small bar can contain no message information. The visual effect of such a mode can be that multiple compressed messages appear like the edges of cards in a deck of cards. A user can toggle between the various display modes by selecting a message or using various controls in the display window. It should be understood that the techniques described in this specification with reference to a conversation (as might be found in the Google Gmail product) can be equally used with any message system (e.g., Outlook or Thunderbird) where messages can be displayed in various views (and can include portions of messages) such as a message view or a thread view where related messages can be displayed.
- When a list of conversations is being displayed, additional information (sometimes referred to in this specification as “information items”) can be displayed. For example, one or more advertisements relevant to, or related to, one or more of the conversations in the conversation list can be displayed. In another example, one or more other types of information can be displayed. Such other information can include, but is not limited to news items, map links, product reviews, phone numbers, web page links, dictionary entries, images, RSS feeds, blog (web log) events, user polls, links to files or other content on the
client 102, and other types of information. In some embodiments, the relevant information displayed to the user can depend on information about the user stored in theuser information database 126. - RSS feeds 114 can be content distributed from various sources on a network (e.g., the Internet). RDF Site Summary (RSS) (and sometimes, Real Simple Syndication) is an XML-based lightweight multipurpose extensible metadata description and syndication format. RSS is typically used for distributing various types of content to a number of receivers simultaneously. News items can be news items from one or more sources. Blog events can be events generated from one or more web logs (blogs). User polls can be polls that the user may participate in which may come from a variety of sources.
- When a user is viewing a list of conversations and possibly associated snippets, it can be useful to display advertising or other information which may be of interest to the user. However, determining what information to display to the user can sometimes be difficult.
-
FIG. 2 illustrates a process by which information can be generated for a list of conversations and then displayed along with the list of conversations according to some embodiments of the invention. Initially, a list of conversations is identified (202). A list of conversations can be generated as a result of a number of different actions. For example, a search query can be applied against a database of messages. One or more relevant conversations can be returned in response to the search query. Generally speaking, a conversation is relevant to a search query when one or more parts of the conversation are relevant to the search query (e.g., the conversation contains one or more messages whose contents are relevant to the search query). The relevancy of a particular content to a search query can be determined by any number of well known techniques. Search queries can be explicit or implicit. An explicit search query can include accepting one or more search terms affirmatively entered by the user. An implicit search query can include searches based on a particular message view (e.g., an Inbox view), a label, or other information. Labels can be applied to conversations and/or messages. A user can choose to search for a particular label by selecting that label from a list of labels. Labels can be user created and/or system created. In some embodiments, a user's inbox can be thought of an implicit search for conversations and/or messages having an “inbox” label. - Once the list of conversations has been identified (202), content components for each conversation in the list can be identified (204). Content components can be identified for a subset of conversations in the list. For example, a subset can comprise those conversations which are in a current display window provided to the user. A content component can be any portion of a conversation. For example, the content components for a conversation can comprise a snippet of the conversation and/or the conversation description. The content components can also comprise one or more portions of one or more of the messages in the conversation and/or the conversation itself. One or more portions of a message can include header information or other information associated with a message or a conversation (e.g., a date/time value of when a message was viewed or the subject line of the message).
- One or more conversations can then be selected (206) according to various criteria based on the identified content components. A single conversation can be selected by being a top most conversation in the list (e.g., a conversation having a most recently received message). A single conversation can be selected based on which conversation was most recently viewed. A single conversation can be selected by having a most recently received message which has been viewed. A single conversation can be selected by being a most recently viewed conversation for which at least one advertisement had been presented. A single conversation can be selected by being a most recently viewed conversation for which no advertisement has been presented, or for which the number of presented advertisements is equal to or less than the number of advertisements presented with other recently viewed conversations. A single conversation can be selected at random from those conversations which have already been viewed. It may be noted that the term “random”, when used in this document to refer to selecting or choosing one or more items from a set or list, encompasses both random and pseudorandom selection methodologies. For instance, “randomly” selecting a term from a set of terms (or a conversation from a set of conversations) may be accomplished by randomly or pseudo-randomly generating a value in a predefined range (e.g., between 0 and 1) and then using that value to select a term (or conversation) from the set.
- A single conversation having a highest number of words and/or word phrases from a list of words and/or word phrases can be selected. In some embodiments, the number can be based on the number of distinct words and/or word phrases from the list which are present in the content components of the conversation. A list of words or word phrases can be created, for example, from keywords and/or word phrases associated with advertisements, where the advertisements have been frequently selected by a community of users over a period of time. Users can select an advertisement by, for example, clicking on the advertisement when the advertisement is presented to the user. Advertisements can be chosen for presentation to a user by being associated with a particular keyword or word phrase. Advertisers can bid on keywords and/or word phrases such that when the bid-upon keyword and/or word phrase is present in a content (e.g., in a search query or a web page), the advertisement from the advertiser having the highest bid for that keyword or word phrase can be presented. Of course, other factors can affect which advertisements are presented (e.g., advertisements can be selected, at least in part, in accordance with a user's profile, in accordance with a calculated score indicating how relevant the advertisements are to the content, and/or in accordance with the respective click-through rates of the advertisements). A list of keywords and/or word phrases used for selecting a conversation and/or conversations can be those keywords and/or word phrases having selection rates (e.g., advertisements being selected based on the keywords and/or word phrases) greater than a threshold. The list can be a number of keywords or word phrases (e.g., 1000) having the highest selection rates, for example. A single conversation can be selected from among conversations having a number of distinct keywords and/or word phrases from the list present in their identified content components greater than threshold. The conversation selected can be randomly selected from among those conversations.
- In some embodiments, a conversation can be selected based on an advertising metric determined using the conversation's content components. The advertising metric can be determined based on various factors such as a predicted click-though metric which represents a predicted probability of a user selecting co-displayed advertising based on the content. The advertising metric can be based on a user's actual advertising selections in the past.
- In some embodiments, more than one conversation can be selected. For example, those conversations having a number of distinct keywords and/or word phrases from the list present in their identified content components greater than threshold can be selected. In another example, the first N conversations (e.g., 5) in the conversation list can be selected where N is an integer from 0 to the number of conversations displayed to the user. In yet another example, the first U conversations having unread messages in the conversation list can be selected, where U is an integer up to the number of conversations displayed to the user. In still yet another example, all of the conversations in the list can be selected.
- Once a conversation (or conversations) is selected at 206, content can be identified (208) that will be used to obtain relevant information at a later step. The identified content can include one or more of the elements of a conversation. A conversation's elements can include one or more of: a number indicating the number of messages in the conversation, a list of one or more sender identifiers or names of senders of messages in the conversation, a conversation description (e.g., the text of one of the messages in the conversations), a date/time value of the conversation (e.g., a date/time value of the last received message in the conversation), a snippet from one or more of the messages in the conversation, and one or more portions of one or more of the messages in the conversation. The one or more message portions can include header information or other information associated with a message (e.g., a date/time value of when a message was viewed). In one embodiment, the identified content can be the conversation description and the snippet of the selected conversation(s) displayed in a conversation list presented to the user. In another embodiment, one or more of the conversation elements from the identified conversation(s) can be examined to identify those keywords from a list of keywords and or word phrases (e.g., names of products, brands or businesses) that are present. The content identified at 206 can be one or more of the identified keywords and/or word phrases chosen at random.
- It may be that no conversation is selected at 206. In this instance, one or more portions of any (or all) of the conversations can be used as the identified content. For example, the identified content can be all of the descriptions of the conversations along with their respective snippets. In another example, the identified content can be one or more portions of one of the conversations selected at random.
- In some embodiments, the identified content from 208 can be modified by adjusting an importance factor associated with one or more content elements in the identified content. This can be useful because some information servers (e.g.,
ad server 128 or information server 130) can accept information relating to an importance of one or more portions of the input relative to the other portions. Accordingly, based on various criteria, it can be determined that one or more portions of the identified content from 208 to be provided as an input to an information server should be treated differently from other portions. Adding this importance factor information can cause the output of the information server to be weighted toward those portions deemed important and/or down-weighted for portions deemed unimportant. In some embodiments, one or more elements associated with a particular part of a pattern identified in a conversation can be accorded importance factors different from others parts of the pattern. For example, an element associated with a product name can be accorded more weight than other elements (e.g., the text of an indicated shipping method such as “air freight”). In another example, an element identified as a destination shipping address in a receipt for an online purchase can be down-weighted in importance. - In another example of modifying importance factors, the content identified at 208 can be examined to identify which keywords and/or word phrases from a list of keywords and/or word phrases are present in the content. From the keywords and/or word phrases identified in the content, one or more of these keywords and/or word phrases can be selected and their importance factors modified. The keywords and/or word phrases can be selected in any number of ways. For example, one or more of the keywords or word phrases can be selected at random from the identified keywords and/or word phrases present in the content. In another example, one or more of the keywords or word phrases having advertising metrics (e.g., a selection rate) greater than other keywords or word phrases can be selected. In yet another example, one or more of the keywords or word phrases having profile similarity scores greater than other keywords or word phrases can be selected. A profile similarity score for each keyword or word phrase can be determined by, for example, comparing the keyword or word phrase to the user's profile according to various criteria. The more closely aligned a keyword or word phrase is to the user's profile, the higher the profile similarity score will be. Those content elements corresponding to the selected keywords or word phrases can have their respective importance factor increased.
- Furthermore, keywords and/or word phrases can be added to the content identified at 208. These keywords and/or word phrases can be related to the identified content, and can be known to result in information items (e.g., advertisements) with a higher selection rate. In some embodiments, the additional keywords and/or word phrases are selected from keywords and/or word phrases known to be correlated with words and/or word phrases in the identified content. For example, an abbreviation of a product name can be correlated with the full name of the product. Therefore, when the abbreviation is identified in the content, the full product name can be added to the content (and vice versa).
- Once the content is identified at 208 and, if desired, certain importance factors modified at 210, the identified content can be used to obtain information relevant to it (212). In response to receiving the identified content, the targeted
information processor 124, for example, can return information (hereinafter called the targeted information) to theconversation engine 110 relevant to the identified content. As mentioned above, the targeted information can include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: advertisements, product reviews, news items, map links, phone numbers, web page links, dictionary entries, images, RSS feeds, blog (web log) events, user polls, and other types of information. The targeted information obtained for the user can depend on information about the user (e.g., a user profile) stored in theuser information database 126. The information in the user profile can be used by the targetedinformation processor 124 to enhance a likelihood that the targeted information is consistent with the preferences indicated in the user profile. - The targeted information can be displayed along with the list of conversations (214). The
conversation engine 110 can receive the information from the targetedinformation processor 124 and determine formatting information which can be used, for example, by a client application (e.g., client application 132) to display the list of conversations and the targeted information. The conversation engine can send the formatting information, the targeted information, and list of conversations to theclient 102 in one or more transmissions. -
FIG. 3A provides an exemplary screenshot of a display with a conversation list and targeted information items in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.FIG. 3A provides one exemplary display organization for illustration purposes only and does not serve to limit the ways conversation lists and targeted information items can be displayed. Thedisplay area 300 can include three major display portions: a navigation andcontrol portion 302, amessage list portion 304, and a targetedinformation items portion 306. The navigation andcontrol portion 302 can include one or more navigation and/or control items (e.g., “compose email”). Themessage list portion 304 can include one or more conversations in summary form. The summary form of a conversation can include a conversation description and a snippet from the conversation. The targetedinformation items portion 306 can include one or more information items which have been obtained as a result of the techniques described above. For example, the information items can be obtained from anad server 128 and/or an information item server 130 (FIG. 1 ). AlthoughFIG. 3A shows two information items, the number of information items may be smaller or larger, and may vary from one conversation list view to another.FIG. 3A illustrates only one exemplary layout configuration and other layouts are possible. For example, the relative positions of the display areas to each other can change (e.g., the targetedinformation 306 can be displayed to the left, right, bottom, or top relative to the conversation list portion 304). For example,FIG. 3B provides exemplary screenshot of a display with a conversation list and a targeted information item in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Adisplay area 308, like thedisplay area 300, can include a navigation andcontrol portion 302 and amessage list portion 304. However, inFIG. 3B a targetedinformation items portion 310 can be positioned above themessage list portion 304.Navigation buttons 312 can optionally be provided to navigate forward and backward through a list of targeted information items. -
