Abstract
Systems and methods for automatically resizing a creative based on dimensions of a content slot. A processor receives a creative including visual content items and having a first set of dimensions. The processor determines a content slot in which to insert the creative. The content slot has a second set of dimensions. The processor determines an aspect ratio of the creative and the content slot. The processor applies edge detection to identify edges of the visual content items included in the creative. The processor applies a bounding box around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items. The bounding box is sized to have an aspect ratio that corresponds to a smaller of the aspect ratio of the creative and the aspect ratio of the content slot. The processor resizes the bounding box to fit within the second set of dimensions corresponding to the content slot.
Description
- In a computer networked environment such as the internet, entities such as people or companies provide information for public display on web pages or other online documents. The documents can include information provided by the entities via a computing device for display on the internet. Content can also be provided by third parties for display on the documents together with the information provided by the entities. Thus, a person viewing a document can access the information that is the subject of the document, as well as third party content that may or may not be related to the subject matter of the document.
- At least one aspect is directed to a computer implemented method of predicting a conversion rate of a content publisher-third-party content provider pair. A processor identifies, from log data, a plurality of content publisher-provider pairs. Each content publisher-provider pair corresponds to a third-party content provider associated with at least one creative receiving at least one conversion when served on one or more information resources of the content publisher.

In a direct content placement campaign that allows for direct placement of creatives, a content provider can reserve a content slot of an information resource of a content publisher such that each time the information resource is served, a creative of the content provider is provided for display within the content slot of the information resource. In particular, the present disclosure relates to methods, apparatuses and systems relating to predicting a conversion rate of a provider-publisher pair, reserving content slots within an information resource of a content publisher, providing actionable objects within a content slot of an information resource of a content publisher and automatically resizing a creative based on dimensions of a content slot. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation.
- Section A relates to methods, apparatuses and systems relating to predicting a conversion rate of a content publisher-third-party content provider pair.
- Section B relates to methods, apparatuses and systems relating to reserving content slots within an information resource of a content publisher.
- Section C relates to methods, apparatuses and systems relating to providing actionable objects within a content slot of an information resource of a content publisher.
- Section D relates to methods, apparatuses and systems relating to automatically resizing a creative based on dimensions of a content slot.
- Online content publishers that publish primary content on information resources, such as webpages and other documents, often generate revenues by selling space on the information resources to third-party content providers. The space, often referred to as content slots, can be configured to include third-party content (for instance, ads) provided by the creatives that purchased the space. Some content publishers utilize a third-party content placement management entity to manage the selling or utilization of the content slot when the information resource associated with the content slot is served. Typically, the management entity holds an auction to insert a creative in the content slot on an impression by impression basis. Via the auction, the management entity selects a creative of the highest bidder (for instance, a third-party content provider) and inserts the creative in the content slot for the given impression. Although the use of auctions is an efficient way for small content publishers to generate revenues via their information resources, larger, more established content publishers that receive a very large number of impressions may use a direct content placement campaign approach to increase revenues via their information resources.
- In some implementations, the larger, more established content publishers may sell space on their information resources directly to third-party content providers at a premium instead of providing creatives that are selected via an auction. In this way, the most expensive, premium inventory which can result in the highest return on investment for a third-party content provider (for instance, an advertiser) is often sold on a direct basis, that is, as a result of an agreement on the price between the content publisher and the third-party content provider, as opposed to an online auction.

data processing system 110 can be configured to identify pairings of third-party content providers and content publishers to establish a relationship in which the third-party content provider can provide content to insert within content slots of information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, thedata processing system 110 can identify the pairings using log data associated with content items of third-party content providers that have been served on information resources of content publishers In some implementations, thedata processing system 110 may identify the pairings by generating a conversion rate prediction model that can predict a conversion rate of creatives provided by the third-party content provider when served on information resources of the content publisher. In this way, thedata processing system 110 can generate a list of candidate content publishers to a third-party content provider seeking information resources on which to serve creatives. Conversely, thedata processing system 110 can generate a list of candidate third-party content providers to a content publisher seeking creative to serve within content slots of information resources of the content publisher. - The content

In some implementations, the contentplacement management module 130 can provide the creative to the content publisher along with one or more rules indicating when to serve the creative. In some such implementations, the contentplacement management module 130 can be configured to determine how many times a particular creative has been served along with other information that can be used to create entries for the log data. - The log data can include activity information relating to one or more creatives when served on one or more information resources. In some implementations, serving a creative on an information resource can entail inserting the creative in a content slot of the information resource and providing the information resource including the creative for display at an end user computing device, such as the end user computing device 125. Activity information can correspond to the serving of a creative, a conversion of a creative, and so forth. A creative can receive an impression when the creative is served on an information resource. A creative can receive a conversion when a predefined action is taken on the creative when the creative is served on the information resource. A predefined action can include a click, an actuation of the creative, a purchase made through the creative, providing information through the creative, signing up for an account through the creative, amongst others.
- The log data can include a plurality of entries, each of which corresponds to activity information related to a single impression of a creative. In some implementations, an entry can include information identifying the information resource (for instance, the webpage) and the website associated with the information resource. The entry can also include information identifying a particular third-party content slot of the information resource in which the creative was inserted. In some implementations, the entry can identify a type of third-party content slot, for instance, if the content slot was a leaderboard, skyscraper, or bottom of page content slot. The entry can also include information identifying the third-party content provider, for instance, by a domain name of the landing page associated with the creative. In some implementations, the third-party content provider can be identified based on the content of the creative. In some implementations, the entry can also include a cost for receiving an impression. In some implementations, the cost can be cost per thousand impressions (CPM), cost per click, amongst others.
- In some implementations, the entry can also include information relating to any activity taken on the creative. For instance, the entry can include information indicating whether the creative was actuated (clicked on, hover over, etc.). In some implementations, the entry can include information relating to a conversion of the creative. For instance, the entry can include information indicating a transaction has been performed, an amount of the transaction, signing up for an account, providing information, amongst others.
- In some implementations, the content
placement management module 130 can only aggregate and maintain log data for creatives served on content publishers that have voluntarily opted to allow the content placement management module to aggregate the log data. Moreover, the contentplacement management module 130 can only aggregate and maintain log data for creatives inserted in content slots of information resources of content publishers that the content publishers have voluntarily opted to allow the content placement management module to aggregate the log data. - The content
placement management module 130 can be configured to identify, from the log data, a plurality of content publisher-provider pairs. In some implementations, each of the plurality of content publisher-provider pairs can correspond to a third-party content provider associated with at least one creative receiving at least one conversion when served on one or more information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, each of the plurality of content publisher-provider pairs can correspond to a third-party content provider associated with at least one creative receiving at least one impression when served on one or more information resources of the content publisher. - In some implementations, the content
placement management module 130 can be configured to identify a plurality of content publisher-provider pairs from a portion of the log data. In some implementations, the portion of log data used for the analysis can be filtered by one or more content publishers, one or more third-party content providers, or a combination of content publishers, third-party content providers. In some implementations, the portion of log data used for the analysis can be limited by geography, time, type of device of the end user computing device on which the information resources are served, amongst others. In some implementations, the contentplacement management module 130 can only identify content publisher-provider pairs associated with creative that received a conversion within a predetermined time frame, for instance, a day, a week, a month or a year, amongst others. In some implementations, the contentplacement management module 130 may only analyze log data corresponding to creative receiving impressions within a predetermined time frame, for instance, a day, a week, a month, a year, amongst others. - The content
placement management module 130 can identify the plurality of content publisher-provider pairs by analyzing the log data. In some implementations, the contentplacement management module 130 can identify a first entry of the log data in which a creative associated with the first entry received a conversion. The contentplacement management module 130 can identify a content publisher of the information resource including the content slot in which the creative was inserted. The contentplacement management module 130 can also identify a third-party content provider associated with the creative. The contentplacement management module 130 can then identify, for the content publisher-provider pair, other entries within the log data in which any creative of the identified third-party content provider received an impression when served on any information resource associated with the identified content publisher. The contentplacement management module 130 can then determine, from the identified entries, a total number of impressions received by the creatives of the third-party content provider when served on the one or more information resources of the identified content publisher. The contentplacement management module 130 can then determine, from the identified entries, a total number of conversions associated with the creatives that received impressions. The contentplacement management module 130 can determine the total number of conversions by identifying, from the identified entries of the data log, the number of entries that resulted in a conversion. The contentplacement management module 130 can then determine a conversion rate corresponding to the content publisher-provider pair by determining a ratio of the total number of conversions associated with the creatives that received impressions to the total number of impressions received by the creatives of the provider when served on the one or more information resources of the content publisher. - In some implementations, the content
placement management module 130 can recursively identify, from the log data, a plurality of content publisher-provider pairs. In some implementations, the contentplacement management module 130 can identify a second entry of the log data that corresponds to a creative associated with a second content publisher-provider pair that is different from the first content publisher-provider pair and also corresponds to receiving a conversion. The contentplacement management module 130 can then identify all entries in the log data that correspond to the second content publisher-provider pair and determine the conversion rate corresponding to the second content publisher-provider pair. In this manner, the contentplacement management module 130 can identify a plurality of different content publisher-provider pairs, each of which having at least one creative that received a conversion when served on an information resource - The conversion rate
model generation module 132 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. The conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can be part of the same or a different server as the contentplacement management module 130 in thedata processing system 110.

To do so, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can be configured to determine the conversion rates corresponding to each of the content publisher-provider pairs identified by the contentplacement management module 130. - In some implementations, the conversion rate for a content publisher-provider pair can be a click through rate. In some implementations, the conversion rate
model generation module 132 can determine the click-through rate by calculating a ratio of a number of clicks on one or more creatives of the third-party content provider that received an impression when served on one or more information resources of the content publisher to a total number of impressions received by the creatives of the third-party content provider when served on the information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, to determine the conversion rate, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can determine, from the log data, a total number of impressions received by a plurality of creatives of the third-party content provider on a plurality of information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can first identify all entries included in the log data in which any creative of the third-party content provider received an impression when served on any information resource of the content publisher. The conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can then determine a total number of conversions received by the creatives of the third-party content provider that received an impression when served on any information resources of the content publisher. The conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can then determine a ratio of the total number of conversions to the total number of impressions. In some implementations, a conversion can be identified as a purchase, subscribing to an email list, or taking a specified action, amongst others. - The conversion rate
model generation module 132 can be configured to determine, for each identified content publisher-provider pair, feature data for the content publisher of the content publisher-provider pair. The feature data for the content publisher can be based on one or more features, including content included in the information resources of the content publisher, the language in which the content included in the information resources is published, the geo-locality associated with the content included in the information resources, amongst others. In some implementations, the feature data can be represented as a feature vector in a multi-dimensional space. In some implementations, each dimension of the feature vector can correspond to one or more of topics associated with content included in the information resources, the language in which the content is published, the geo-locality associated with the content and the content publisher, amongst others. In some implementations, the feature vector can be weighted such that topics associated with content in information resources that included creatives that received a lot of conversions receive a greater weight than topics that are associated with content included in information resources that included creative that received fewer conversions. In some implementations, clustering can be used to determine topics of content included in the information resources of a content publisher. These topics can be used to determine feature data. - The conversion rate
model generation module 132 can also be configured to determine, for each content publisher-provider pair, feature data for the third-party content provider of the content publisher-provider pair. The feature data for the provider can be based on one or more features, including content included in the creative of the third-party content provider and the content included in information resources of the third-party content provider. In some implementations, the information resources of the third-party content provider include the landing pages of the creative. In some implementations, the information resources of the third-party content provider include other web pages associated with the website of the third-party content provider. The feature data can also be based on the language in which the content included in the creatives and information resources of the provider are published, the geo-locality associated with the content included in the information resources of the provider, amongst others. In some implementations, the feature data of the provider can also be represented as a feature vector in a multi-dimensional space. In some implementations, each dimension of the feature vector can correspond to one or more of topics associated with content included in the information resources, the language in which the content is published, the geo-locality associated with the content and the content publisher, amongst others. - The conversion rate
model generation module 132 can be configured to transform the aggregate feature data of the content publishers, the feature data of the third-party content providers and the determined conversion rates of the content publisher-provider pairs to a conversion rate prediction model. The conversion rate prediction model is a model to predict a conversion rate of a creative of a third-party content when served on an information resource of a content publisher. The conversion rate prediction model can also be used to assess a quality of a particular content publisher-provider pair, rank existing content publisher-provider pairs according to their associated conversion rates, and identify new content publisher-provider pairs likely to be successful based on their predicted conversion rates. - In some implementations, the conversion rate
model generation module 132, for each content publisher-provider pair, can determine a linear relationship between a content publisher g and the third-party content provider a. In some implementations, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can determine a feature vector ω=Φ(g) of the content publisher g and a feature vector δ=Φ(a) of the third-party content provider a. In some implementations, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 may assume that a relationship between the third-party content provider a and the content publisher g can be represented as a linear relationship between corresponding features. In some implementations, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can rely on the Bayesian assumption, that is, the presence or absence of any j-th feature will not affect presence or absence of i-th feature of the feature vector. The cumulative differences between specific features of the third-party content provider a and the content publisher g can correspond to a quality of the placement p(g, a), as well as a quality score E(g, a) of the placement p(g, a) indicating a measure of quality. The quality score can be loosely expressed according to the following: -
E(g,a)˜E′(g,a)=Σa i[δi−ωi] - Here, the difference between specific features δi−ωi can be the explanatory variables and E′ can be a dependent variable of the multiple linear regression. Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Since E˜E′, for scoring purposes, the content
placement management module 130 can use E′ as a substitute for unknown E. For the purpose of regression, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can consider all pairwise combinations of content publisher-provider pairs (g, a) as a single explanatory variable Xg,a expressed as follows: -
- The goal of linear regression is to find a coefficient β that E′(g, a)=Xg,aβ. To achieve this, the conversion rate
model generation module 132 can be configured to calculate features for every content publisher g and third-party content provider a, and produce pairwise linear regressions for every content publisher-provider pair that corresponds to a creative of the third-party content provider receiving a conversion when served on an information resource of the content publisher. As described above, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 can further be configured to determine the existing conversion rates for each content publisher-provider pair and use the determined conversion rates to train the linear regression. With the linear regression fully trained, the conversion rate prediction model can be used to predict conversion rates and identify potential pairings of content publishers and third-party content providers. - In some implementations, the conversion rate
model generation module 132 can be configured to generate a conversion rate prediction model that relies on a nonlinear regression. Nonlinear regression is a form of regression analysis in which observational data are modeled by a function which is a nonlinear combination of the model parameters and depends on one or more independent variables. The data are fitted by a method of successive approximations. - The conversion
rate prediction module 134 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. The conversionrate prediction module 134 can be part of the same or a different server as the contentplacement management module 130 and the conversion ratemodel generation module 132 in thedata processing system 110. The conversionrate prediction module 134 can be configured to score existing content publisher-provider pairs based on their predicted conversion rates. In addition, the contentplacement management module 130 can use the predicted conversion rates to provide, to a third-party content provider, an evaluation of the third-party content provider's existing pairings with content publishers as well as to identify new content publishers with whom the third-party content provider has not yet established a pairing. - In some implementations, the conversion
rate prediction model 134 can be used for predicting a conversion rate of a given content publisher-provider pair different from the identified plurality of content publisher-provider pairs. In some implementations, the conversionrate prediction model 134 can be configured to receive, from a third-party content provider, a request for a list of content publishers having at least one information resource on which to serve creatives. In some implementations, the conversionrate prediction model 134 can determine the feature data of the third-party content provider requesting the list of content publishers. The conversionrate prediction model 134 can then identify a plurality of candidate content publishers on which creatives of the third-party content provider can be served. In some implementations, the conversionrate prediction model 134 can identify a plurality of candidate content publishers on which creatives of the third-party content provider can be served from a list of content publishers that have authorized thedata processing system 110 to facilitate the placement of creatives in content slots on behalf of the content publisher. In some implementations, the conversionrate prediction model 134 can first identify all of the content publishers for which conversion rate data is available. The conversionrate prediction model 134 then determines the feature data of each of the identified content publishers. The conversion rate prediction model then provides the feature data of the identified content publishers and the content provider requesting the list to the conversion rate prediction model to determine the predicted conversion rates of each of the identified content publishers. The conversionrate prediction model 134 can then rank the content publisher-provider pairings according to their conversion rate predictions and provide a subset of the content publisher-provider pairings to the content provider. In some implementations, the subset can include a predetermined number of content publisher-provider pairings. In some implementations, the predetermined number can range anywhere from 1-50 content publisher-provider pairings. In some implementations, the subset can include any number of content publisher-provider pairings that have a predicted conversion rate above a particular threshold. The threshold value can range anywhere from at least 1% up to 70%. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram depicting an method 200 of predicting a conversion rate of a content publisher-third-party content provider pair. The method 200, via a processor of a data processing system, such as thedata processing system 100 shown inFIG. 1 , can identify, from log data, a plurality of content publisher-third-party content provider pairs, each corresponding to a third-party content provider associated with at least one creative receiving at least one conversion when served on one or more information resources of the content publisher (Block 205). The method can determine, for each content publisher-provider pair, from the log data, a conversion rate corresponding to a ratio of a number of conversions associated with the at least one creative to a number of impressions received by the at least one creative when served on the one or more information resources of the content publisher (Block 210). The method can determine, for each content publisher-provider pair, feature data of the content publisher and feature data of the third-party content provider (Block 215). The method can also transforming the determined feature data of the content publishers and third-party content providers and the conversion rates of the plurality of content publisher-provider pairs into a model useful for predicting a conversion rate of a given content publisher-provider pair different from the identified plurality of content publisher-provider pairs (Block 220). - In further detail, the method 200 can identify, from log data, a plurality of content publisher-third-party content provider pairs (Block 205). In some implementations, each of the plurality of content publisher-provider pairs can correspond to a third-party content provider associated with at least one creative receiving at least one conversion when served on one or more information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, the log data includes activity information relating to one or more creatives provided for display along with primary content on an information resource. The log data can include a plurality of entries, each of which corresponds to activity information related to a single impression of a creative. In some implementations, an entry can include information identifying the information resource (for instance, the webpage) and the website associated with the information resource. The entry can also include information identifying a particular third-party content slot in which the creative was inserted. In some implementations, the entry can identify a type of third-party content slot, for instance, if the content slot was a leaderboard, skyscraper, or bottom of page content slot. The entry can also including information identifying the third-party content provider, for instance, by a domain name of the landing page associated with the creative. In some implementations, the third-party content provider can be identified based on the content of the creative. In some implementations, the entry can also include a cost for receiving an impression. In some implementations, the cost can be cost per thousand impressions (CPM), cost per click, amongst others. In some implementations, the entry can also include information relating to any activity taken on the creative. For instance, the entry can include information indicating whether the creative was actuated (clicked on, opened, etc.).
- In some implementations, the method can maintain the log data of all creatives served on an information resource of a participating content publisher. In some implementations, the method can identify a list of content publishers that participate in direct content placement via a content placement management system, such as the
data processing system 110 shown inFIG. 1 . The data processing system can facilitate the placement or insertion of creatives in content slots of information resources of a content publisher on behalf of the content publisher. In some implementations, the data processing system may obtain permission or consent from the content publisher to manage the inventory of content slots included in information resources of the content publisher. The inventory of content slots that can be managed by the data processing system can be identified by a tag, or other identification mechanism. In this way, the content publisher can utilize the data processing system to facilitate the placement of creatives in content slots tagged or identified as content slots configured to be managed by the data processing system. Other content slots that may be included in one or more information resources of the content publisher that are not tagged or otherwise identified may be configured to receive creatives using other content placement methods. Instances of other content placement methods include content placement auctions or inserting content through an existing contractual relationship formed between the content provider and the content publisher, amongst others. - In some implementations, the data processing system can monitor activity at one or more information resources of the content publisher. The data processing system can monitor visits to each information resource. In some implementations, the data processing system can create entries in response to the information resource being provided for display to an end user computing device. Each entry can include information relating to an end user computing device, such as a location of the computing device, a time of access, an amount of time spent on the information resource, a resource (for instance, webpage, direct visit, creative, search result) through which the end user computing device arrived at the information resource, and a resource through which the end user computing device exited the information resource, amongst others.
- The method can determine, from the log data, a conversion rate for each content publisher-third-party content provider pair (Block 210). In some implementations, the conversion rate for a content publisher-third-party content provider pair can be a click through rate. In some implementations, the click-through rate can be determined by calculating a ratio of a number of clicks on one or more creatives of the third-party content provider provided for display on an information resource of the content publisher to a total number of impressions received by the one or more creatives of the third-party content provider provided for display on the resource of the content publisher. In some implementations, to determine the conversion rate, the method can determine, from the log data, a total number of impressions received by creatives of the third-party content provider served on one or more information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, the method can first identify all entries included in the log data in which any creative of the third-party content provider received an impression when served on any information resource of the content publisher. The method can determine a total number of conversions received by the creative of the third-party content provider when served on any information resource of the content publisher. The method can then determine a ratio of the total number of conversions to the total number of impressions. In some implementations, the conversions can be identified as click throughs. In some implementations, a conversion can be identified as a purchase, subscribing to an email list, or taking a specified action, amongst others.
- The method can determine, for each content publisher-third-party content provider pair, feature data of the content publisher and feature data of the third-party content provider (Block 215). In some implementations, the method includes determining feature data of the content publisher and the third-party content provider based on one or more of topics of content included in the information resources of the content publisher and resources of the third-party content provider. In some implementations, the method can determine the feature data of an information resource of the content publisher using the content included in the information resource. In some implementations, the method can determine the feature data using clustering. In some implementations, the method can determine the feature data using other well-known methods for feature data determination. For instance, the feature data can be based on the geo-locality of the end user computing devices accessing the information resource In some implementations, the feature data can be based on a language in which h the content of the information resource is published.
- In some implementations, the method can determine the feature data of the content publisher by determining one or more feature vectors for the content publisher having multiple dimensions. In some implementations, each of the dimensions can correspond to different features of the content publisher. Similarly, in some implementations, the method can determine the feature data of the third-party content provider by determining one or more feature vectors for the third-party content provider having multiple dimensions. In some implementations, each of the dimensions can correspond to different features of the third-party content provider.
- The method can also generate a model for predicting a conversion rate of a given content publisher-third-party content provider pair using the determined feature data of the content publisher, the determined feature data of the third-party content provider and the determined conversion rates of the plurality of content publisher-third-party content provider pairs (Block 220).
- In some implementations, the method can identify a candidate content publisher-third-party content provider pair different from the identified plurality of content publisher-third-party content provider pairs. The method can identify a candidate content publisher-third-party content provider pair responsive to a request from a third-party content provider to identify potential content publishers on whose information resources the third-party content provider can provide creatives to serve. Conversely, The method can identify a candidate content publisher-third-party content provider pair responsive to a request from a content publisher to identify potential third-party content providers having a predicted conversion rate above a threshold predicted conversion rate.

FIG. 3 illustrates ansystem 300 for reserving a content slot of an information resource of a content provider via at least one computer network, such as thenetwork 105. Thesystem 300 can include one or more components of thesystem 100 shown inFIG. 1 . Thesystem 300 includes thedata processing system 110 shown inFIG. 1 , but includes additional modules configured to reserve a content slot of an information resource of a content provider. - The
data processing system 110 can include asolicitation module 330, areservation interface module 332 and acreative placement module 334. Thedata processing system 110 can be configured to receive, in response to an action taken on an actionable solicitation object (for instance, a link, icon, button, creative) included within an information resource of a content publisher, a request to receive information for inserting a creative within one or more third-party content slots available on the information resource in accordance with a direct content placement campaign. In a direct content placement campaign, a third-party content provider can reserve at least one content slot of an information resource of a content publisher to insert a creative according to a reservation policy. The reservation policy can include one or more rules outlining a schedule according to which the creative can be inserted in the content slot. Thedata processing system 110 can be configured to provide, for display, an interface that includes the information regarding reserving at least one content slot. Stated in another way, the information can be related to inserting the creative within one or more third-party content slots on the information resource of the content publisher. Thedata processing system 110 can be configured to receive, via the interface, a request to insert, according to a reservation policy, a creative within a particular third-party content slot of the plurality of third-party content slots when the information resource on which the particular third-party content slot is located is served. Thedata processing system 110 can be configured to store data associated with the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot. The stored data can be useful to provide, for display, the creative within the particular third-party content slot of the information resource when the information resource is served in accordance with the reservation policy. - The
solicitation module 330 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can be configured to solicit third-party content providers to reserve one or more content slots of an information resource to insert creatives when the information resource is served. Thesolicitation module 330 can be configured to identify a content publisher that has indicated an interest in utilizing thedata processing system 110 to provide creatives for insertion in one or more content slots of the information resources of the content publisher via a direct content placement campaign of a content provider. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can identify a content publisher in response to receiving a request from the content publisher to utilize one or more content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can identify a content publisher based on an analysis of traffic related information associated with the content publisher. For instance, content publishers that satisfy a minimum traffic metric threshold may be identified as candidate content publishers that may be eligible or willing to participate in providing content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. Instances of traffic metrics include an average daily number of visits, an average number of unique visitors, or any other metric that provides an indication of a popularity of an information resource. In addition, thesolicitation module 330 can receive information relating to creatives served in content slots of the information resources, including but not limited to the identity of the creatives served, the third-party content providers associated with the creatives, the number of clicks received by the creatives, the number of conversions received by the creatives, amongst others. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can be configured to allow content publishers participating in a content placement service to opt-in to participate in providing content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. - The
solicitation module 330 can be configured to provide, on an information resource of a content publisher, a solicitation object through which a potential third-party content provider accessing the information resource, can actuate the solicitation object to participate in a direct content placement campaign that involves serving creatives on the information resource on which the solicitation object was provided. The solicitation object can be an actionable object, such as a link, an icon, a button, or any other object that a potential content provider can actuate. - In some implementations, the
solicitation module 330 can provide the solicitation object within a solicitation creative that is served within a content slot of the information resource. In some implementations, the solicitation creative can be generated using traffic metrics associated with the information resource. In some implementations, the solicitation object can be provided for display within an area of the information resource where primary content is displayed. - The
solicitation module 330 can provide the solicitation object on an information resource of a content publisher that has opted in to participate in providing content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, for the information resource to be able to display the solicitation object, thesolicitation module 330 can be configured to embed a script in the information resource of the content publisher. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can provide the script to the content publisher, who can insert the script in the information resource. In some implementations, the script can be configured to enable thedata processing system 110 to retrieve information related to the one or more information resources of the content publisher. For instance, the script can be configured to allow thesolicitation module 330 to receive traffic related statistics of the content publisher. In some implementations, the solicitation module can be configured to maintain log data relating to each visit to the information resources of the content publisher. In this way, thesolicitation module 330 can be configured to create a data log based on visits to the information resources by end user computing devices and determine traffic metrics, such as an average daily number of visits, an average number of daily unique visitors, types of visitors visiting the site, amongst others. In some implementations, the script can be a snippet of code. In some implementations, the snippet of code is a JavaScript object. - In some implementations, the script of the
solicitation module 330 can be configured to allow thesolicitation module 330 to manage reservations for one or more content slots of the information resource. In some implementations, the solicitation module can, via the execution of the script, identify one or more content slots. Thesolicitation module 330 can identify content slots by parsing the contents or source code of the information resource. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can receive a request from the content publisher identifying particular content slots included in the information resources of the content publisher that the content publisher would like thesolicitation module 330 to manage reservations. In some implementations, the request can include a request to manage the reservations of all of the content slots of all the information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, the request can include a request to manage the reservations of all of the content slots of a particular information resource of the content publisher. In some implementations, the request can identify the content slots that the content publisher would like thedata processing system 110 to manage. In some implementations, the content publisher can submit the request via a content slot management interface. In some implementations, the content publisher can select, via the user interface, one or more content slots to be managed by thedata processing system 110. - The
solicitation module 330 can, via the execution of the script, identify one or more of the identified content slots to be managed by thesolicitation module 330. The solicitation module can identify the one or more of the identified content slots to be managed by thesolicitation module 330 in response to receiving a request from the content publisher indicating the content slots to manage. In some implementations, the content publisher can identify one or more content slots by identifying any tags associated with the content slots. In some implementations, the content publisher may request thesolicitation module 330 to manage all content slots that are tagged to request creatives from thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 may be configured to tag or otherwise identify content slots for which the content publisher would like thesolicitation module 330 to manage reservations. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can tag or otherwise mark or identify the content slots to be managed by thesolicitation module 330. - The
solicitation module 330 can, via the execution of the script, then create reservation schedules for each of the content slots identify as content slots to be managed by thesolicitation module 330. The reservation schedule of a content slot is a schedule indicating the availability of the content slot. When a content slot is reserved for a given period of time, the reservation schedule is updated to indicate that the content slot is reserved for the given period of time. In this way, third-party content providers interested in reserving the content slot are only able to reserve time slots during which the reservation schedule of the content slot indicates that the content slot is available. - In some implementations, the
solicitation module 330 can be configured to analyze the information resources of the content publisher and identify all content slots configured to serve third-party content items. Thesolicitation module 330 can further be configured to tag, label, or otherwise modify the identified content slots such that thesolicitation module 330 can be configured to manage the reservation of the content slots, while also being able to manage the content capable of being inserted in the identified content slots. In some implementations, thesolicitation module 330 can modify the content slots such that only thedata processing system 110 can provide content for insertion in the content slots when rendered on an end user computing device, such as the end user computing device 125. - Referring briefly to
FIG. 4 ,FIG. 4 is a display depicting an information resource, according to an illustrative implementation. Theinformation resource 400 can be associated with or hosted by the contentpublisher computing device 120 and displayed by the contentprovider computing device 115 or by the end user computing device 125. For instance, the contentpublisher computing device 120 can include a web server that hosts the information resource 400 (e.g., a web page). Theinformation resource 400 can include first party content in at least one contentpublisher content area 405. Subject matter created by or associated with the host (or content publisher) of the web page can be displayed in thecontent area 405. For instance, theinformation resource 400 may include a video hosted by the contentpublisher computing device 120. A primary content provider (e.g., the entity who provided the video) can provide primary content for display as content in the contentpublisher content area 405. - The
information resource 400 can also include at least onecontent slot 410A-410C (generally content slot 410). The content slots 410 can include areas of theinformation resource 400 configured for display of third party content, such as content items orcreatives 412A-412C (generally creatives 412). In some implementations, one or more of the content slots 410 can be configured to include a creative that serves as a solicitation creative 412C. The solicitation creative 412C can solicit offers for third party content providers to advertise on theinformation resource 400. For instance, the solicitation creative 412C can include a display to the effect of “advertise here” or “your ad here” to alert content providers of the opportunity to provide their content items for display in the content item slots 410 of theinformation resource 400. As shown inFIG. 4 , the solicitation creative 412C can be inserted within a content slot, such as thecontent item slot 410C. For instance, thedata processing system 110 can provide the solicitation creative 412C for display in a content item slot 410. The solicitation creative 412C can include asolicitation object 416. Thesolicitation object 416 can be an actionable object on which an action can be taken. Instances of actions can include clicks, hover over, amongst others. Thesolicitation object 416 can be configured such that when an action is taken on thesolicitation object 416, the data processing system receives a request to provide information for serving creatives in the one or more content slots 410. - The
solicitation object 416 can include a button, link or other interface that, when actuated by a click or other input into the contentprovider computing device 115 where theinformation resource 400 is displayed causes transmission of a communication via thenetwork 105 to thedata processing system 110. This communication can indicate a request from the contentprovider computing device 115 to initiate a direct content item placement campaign to provide associated creatives for display in one or more content slots 410 of theinformation resource 400, or a request to preview what creatives associated with the contentprovider computing device 115 look like when displayed in the content slots 410 of thatinformation resource 400. Thus, the contentprovider computing device 115 can browseinformation resources 400 available via thenetwork 105 and can selectspecific information resources 400 as candidates for a direct content item placement campaign. This rendering or impression of theinformation resource 400 at the contentprovider computing device 115 can include creatives such as ads displayed in the content slots 410. - The layout, look, feel, or configuration of the
information resources 400 can vary, and the information resource can include web pages, application displays, or other online documents configured for display on various end user computing devices 125 such as desktop computers, smartphones, or tablet computers. Theinformation resource 400, contentpublisher content areas 405, content slots 410, andsolicitation creatives 416 need not have the number, shape, layout or configuration as inFIG. 4 . For instance, the content slots 410 can appear within the contentpublisher content area 405, or in the top, bottom, or side margins of theinformation resource 400, and the content slots 410 need not be square or quadrilateral. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 , thedata processing system 110 includes thereservation interface module 332. Thereservation interface module 332 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to provide, for display, a reservation interface through which a third-party content provider can reserve one or more content slots of information resources of a content publisher. Thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to provide the reservation interface for display responsive to receiving a request to receive information for inserting a creative within one or more third-party content slots available on the information resource. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to provide the reservation interface to a third-party content provider in response to the third-party content provider taking an action on an solicitation object provided for display on an information resource of the content publisher. For instance, thereservation interface module 332 may provide the reservation interface to a third-party content provider in response to the third-party content provider clicking on thesolicitation object 416 provided for display on theinformation resource 400 shown inFIG. 4 . - In some implementations, the reservation interface can be provided on or as an information resource of the
data processing system 110. The reservation interface can be configured to allow a third-party content provider to reserve one or more content slots of one or more information resources of a content publisher. The reservation interface can be configured to provide information that a third-party content provider can benefit from when determining whether to reserve one or more content slots of an information resource. - The information can identify a plurality of third-party content slots of one or more information resources of the content publisher. In addition, the information can include visitor traffic-related information that may be useful to the third-party content provider when deciding whether to reserve one or more third-party content slots on one or more information resources of the content publisher. This visitor traffic-related information can include information about the number of visitors visiting one or more information resources of the content publisher, the types of visitors, the various types of content slots on the one or more information resources available to be reserved, the cost to reserve one or more of the content slots, amongst others. In some implementations, the
reservation interface module 332 can receive the traffic-related information from the activity log data maintained by thedata processing system 110 for the information resource of the content publisher. As described above, a script provided by thesolicitation module 330 and included within the information resources of the content publisher may enable thedata processing system 110 to receive activity data associated with visitor activity at the information resource and maintain logs of the activity data. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to determine traffic-related information or statistics from the traffic related information and provide the information for display on the reservation interface. - In addition to the visitor traffic-related information, the reservation interface can include a visual representation of the information resource. The visual representation of the information resource can include one or more visual indicators identifying the content slots on the information resource. In this way, the third-party content provider can be made aware of where a creative will appear when served on the information resource. In some implementations, the interface can be configured such that when an object on the interface is hovered over, a visual indicator located on, near or around the content slot on the visual representation of the information resource corresponding to the object is actuated.
- In some implementations, the
reservation interface module 332 can also be configured to determine the cost for reserving each of the content slots associated with the content publisher that are available for reservation. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can receive the cost for reserving a content slot from the content publisher. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can determine the cost for reserving a content slot based on the traffic-related information associated with the information resources and the content slots themselves, including the size of the content slot, the daily number of impressions and a number of conversions, amongst others. In some implementations, the cost can be based on supply and demand. For instance, based on a number of available dates, thereservation interface module 332 can determine a level of demand for the content slot and set a cost accordingly. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can look at historical reservations to determine how much content providers are willing to pay. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can identify the cost of other content publishers having similar traffic related statistics or include content related to similar topics to determine a cost for the content slots. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 may be configured to determine a cost based on the available inventory of content slots of similar sites. - The
reservation interface module 332 can be configured to determine separate costs for reserving each of the content slots. The cost of a content slot can be dictated in part by location of the content slot, the size of the content slot, the type of creative being inserted (for instance, creatives including video, creatives including audio, creative with content extensions) in addition to the content publisher associated with the information resource on which the content slot is inserted. - In some implementations, the
reservation interface module 332 can also be configured to determine the cost to reserve a content slot based on an availability of the content slot. For instance, a content slot that is available for one day can be priced differently than a content slot that is available for a longer period of time. Moreover, the cost to reserve a content slot can vary based on the day of the week, the time of the year, the season, amongst others. Generally, thereservation interface module 332 can determine the cost to reserve a content slot based on an anticipated number of views to be received during a particular reservation period. - The
reservation interface module 332 can be configured to receive, from a third-party content provider, a request to reserve a particular content slot identified on the reservation interface. Stated in another way, the request to reserve a particular content slot can be a request to insert one or more creatives within a particular third-party content slot of the plurality of third-party content slots when serving an information resource on which the content slot according to a reservation policy. The request can identify the one or more creatives to insert within the content slot being reserved. The reservation policy can identify one or more rules according to which the one or more creatives are to be provided for display within the third-party content slot of the information resource when the information resource is served. For instance, the reservation policy can include a reservation schedule that identifies a time period over which to reserve the particular content slot. In some implementations, the third-party content provider can select the time period via a calendar object. In some implementations, the granularity of the reservation schedule can range from a minute, an hour, a day, a week, or even longer. In addition, the third-party content provider can include one or more creatives in the request to reserve a particular content slot. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to allow the third-party content provider to identify a percentage of impressions that each of the creatives should receive. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to allow the third-party content provider to indicate in the request that a first creative is to receive 50% of the impressions, the second creative is to receive 30% of the impressions and the third creative is to receive 20% of the impressions. Thereservation interface module 332 can receive such requests, identify one or more content serving restrictions and create one or more rules which form the reservation policy according to which the creatives are inserted in the content slot. - The
reservation interface module 332, in response to receiving the request to reserve a particular content slot, can provide a payment form to the third-party content publisher. In some implementations, the third-party content publisher can have an account with thedata processing system 110 and therefore, payments may be automatically processed once a request to reserve a particular content slot is received. Thereservation interface module 332 can receive payment details from the third-party content provider and process the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot according to the reservation policy associated with the request. - The
reservation interface module 332 can be configured to store data associated with the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot. The stored data can be useful to provide, for display, the creative within the particular third-party content slot of the information resource according to the reservation policy. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can store the data in a database, such as thedatabase 140. - Referring briefly to
FIG. 5A ,FIG. 5A is a screenshot of an interface for reserving a content slot of the information resource shown inFIG. 4 . The screenshot depicts areservation interface 500 that can be rendered for display by the contentprovider computing device 115 during creation of a direct content item placement campaign. Thereservation interface 500 can be a part of an information resource and can be configured to enable the reservation of content slots on information resources of a content publisher, such as the content publisher example.org. In some implementations, the reservation interface can be provided for display responsive to an action being taken on a solicitation object, such as thesolicitation object 416 shown inFIG. 4 . - The
reservation interface 500 can include a list of content slot objects 530A-530C providing information corresponding to content slots available to be reserved on the information resource on which the solicitation object on which an action was taken was displayed, a list of the top performing content slots that are a part of any information resource of the content publisher, and a preview of the information resource on which the solicitation object on which an action was taken. Thepreview 505 is a preview of theuser interface 400 shown inFIG. 4 but is modified to includeactionable objects 512A-512C inserted as overlays within thecontent slots 510A-510C. Thecontent slot 510C, which previously contained a solicitation creative 412C shown inFIG. 4 can also be reserved via theactionable object 512C. - The list of content slot objects 530A-530C correspond to the
content slots 510A-510C shown in thepreview 505. Each of the content slot objects 530A-530C can include an average number of page views per day, a content slot size, a daily cost for reserving the content slot, as well as an actionable object through which the content slot can be reserved. The list of content slot objects 540A-540C correspond to the top performing content slots of information resources of the content publisher. - Referring now also to
FIG. 5B ,FIG. 5B is a screenshot of the reservation interface for reserving a content slot of the information resource shown inFIG. 4 . The scresnshot of thereservation interface 550 can be provided for display responsive to a request, from the content publisher, to reserve a content slot. In some implementations, thereservation interface 550 can be provided for display upon a third-party content provider taking an action on an actionable object, such as theactionable objects 512A-512C or the actionable objects included in the content slot objects 530A-530C and 540A-540C. As shown inFIG. 5B , thereservation interface 550 provides avisual indication 552 indicating that the content slot being reserved is the “leaderboard” content slot, which corresponds to thecontent slot 510A. - The
reservation interface 550 includes acalendar object 560 that is configured to indicate the dates the content slot is available to be reserved as well as the dates on which the content slot is unavailable to be reserved. In addition, the reservation interface indicates acost 572 for reserving the content slot, a range ofdaily impressions 574, acontent slot size 576 and one ormore topics 578 with which the information resource of which the content slot is a part. In addition, thereservation interface 550 includes achart 580 indicating a percentage of visitors arranged by information associated with visitors. A third-party content provider can select one or more dates over which to reserve the content slot by selecting dates within thecalendar object 560. Once the dates are selected, the third-party content provider can select anactionable object 582, which causes the reservation interface to proceed with reserving the content slot based on the selected dates. In some implementations, a payment interface or a confirmation of the reservation is provided for display responsive to theactionable object 582 being selected by the third-party content provider. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 , thecreative placement module 334 of thedata processing system 110 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thecreative placement module 334 can be configured to provide, for display, the creative within the particular third-party content slot of the information resource according to the reservation policy. In some implementations, thecreative placement module 334 can be configured to receive a request to serve a creative for a content slot of an information resource. The request to serve an information resource can be generated in response to an end-user computing device requesting to view the information resource. In some implementations, the indication received by thecreative placement module 334 can identify the content slot for which to serve a creative. In some implementations, thecreative placement module 334 can perform a lookup in the database for the content slot and identify a reservation associated with the content slot for the time at which the request to serve a creative for a content slot of an information resource is received by thecreative placement module 334. Thecreative placement module 334 can be configured to identify a reservation policy associated with the identified reservation. Thecreative placement module 334 can then provide a creative to insert in the content slot when the information resource is served. The creative that is provided for insertion can be a creative provided by the third-party content provider that requested the reservation of the content slot. -
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an method of reserving a particular third-party content slot of an information resource of a content publisher, according to an illustrative implementation. The method 600, via a processor of a data processing system, such as thedata processing system 300 shown inFIG. 3 , can receive a request to receive information for inserting a creative within one or more third-party content slots available on the information resource (Block 605). The method can provide, for display, an interface that includes the information regarding inserting the creative within one or more third-party content slots on the information resource of the content publisher (Block 610). The method can then receive, via the interface, a request to insert a creative within a particular third-party content slot of the plurality of third-party content slots according to a reservation policy (Block 615). The method can store data associated with the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot (Block 620). - In further detail, the method can receive a request to receive information for inserting a creative within one or more third-party content slots available on an information resource of a content publisher (Block 605). In some implementations, the method can receive the request in response to an action taken on an object included within an information resource of a content publisher. In some implementations, the action can be taken on a solicitation object located on an information resource of a content publisher. In some implementations, the action can be taken by a potential third-party content provider that may have an interest in inserting creatives in content slots when the information resource is served to end user computing devices. The request can identify the information resource associated with the content slots within which to insert creatives. In some implementations, the request can also identify the content provider seeking the information for inserting a creative.
- In some implementations, the method can identify a content publisher that has indicated an interest in utilizing a content placement system to provide creatives for insertion in one or more content slots of the information resources of the content publisher. In some implementations, the method can identify a content publisher in response to receiving a request from the content publisher to utilize one or more content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, the method can identify a content publisher based on an analysis of traffic related information associated with the content publisher. For instance, content publishers that satisfy a minimum traffic metric threshold may be identified as candidate content publishers that may be eligible or willing to participate in providing content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, the method can allow content publishers participating in a content placement service to opt-in to participate in providing content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, the method can receive, from a content publisher, a request to manage third-party content slot reservations. In some implementations, the method can then provide, to the content publisher, an object for insertion into a source code of the information resource of the content publisher.
- The method can provide, on an information resource of a content publisher, a solicitation object through which a potential third-party content provider accessing the information resource, can actuate the solicitation object to participate in a direct content placement campaign that involves serving creatives on the information resource on which the solicitation object was provided. The solicitation object can be an actionable object, such as a link, an icon, a button, or any other object that a potential content provider can actuate. In some implementations, the solicitation object can be provided within a solicitation creative that is served within a content slot of the information resource. In some implementations, the solicitation creative can be generated using traffic metrics associated with the information resource. In some implementations, the solicitation object can be provided for display within an area of the information resource where primary content is displayed.
- The method can provide the solicitation object on an information resource of a content publisher that has opted in to participate in providing content slots for serving creatives of content providers participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, for the information resource to be able to display the solicitation object, the method can be configured to embed or insert a script in the information resource of the content publisher. In some implementations, the method can provide the script to the content publisher, who can insert the script in the information resource. In some implementations, the script can be configured to enable the retrieval of information related to the one or more information resources of the content publisher. For instance, the script can be configured to allow for receiving traffic related statistics of the content publisher.
- In some implementations, the method can maintain log data relating to each visit to the information resources of the content publisher. In this way, the method can create a data log based on visits to the information resources by end user computing devices and determine traffic metrics, such as an average daily number of visits, an average number of daily unique visitors, types of visitors visiting the site, amongst others. In some implementations, the method can receive or determine, from log data, statistics pertaining to the information resource. The statistics can include one or more of an average number of daily impressions, one of a size of the third-party content slot and a size of a creative that can be inserted within the third-party content slot, and one or more topics with which the information resource is associated.
- The method can provide, for display, a reservation interface that includes the information regarding inserting the creative within one or more third-party content slots on the information resource of the content publisher (Block 610). In some implementations, the information can identify a plurality of third-party content slots associated with the content publisher and costs associated with reserving the content slots for inserting the creative within each of the plurality of third-party content slots. In some implementations, the reservation interface can include information pertaining to third-party content slots included within the information resource of the content publisher as well as information pertaining to third-party content slots included within any information resource associated with the information resource of the content publisher. In some implementations, the reservation interface can include a preview of the information resource of the content publisher. In some implementations, the preview of the information resource can insert actionable objects within the third-party content slots in which creatives can be inserted. In some implementations, each of the actionable objects within the third-party content slots can be linked with a reservation page through which the third-party content slot within which the actionable object is inserted can be reserved.
- In some implementations, the method can determine a cost associated with inserting the creative within the third-party content slot according to the reservation policy. The method can then provide, for display, the determined cost associated with inserting the creative within the third-party content slot according to the reservation policy. In some implementations, the determined cost can be provided for display as a cost to reserve the content slot for a predetermined time period, for instance, an hour, a day, a week, amongst others. In some implementations, the method can provide a plurality of costs for display corresponding to various lengths of time.
- The method can then receive, via the interface, a request to insert one or more creatives within a particular third-party content slot of the plurality of third-party content slots according to a reservation policy (Block 615). In some implementations, the request can identify the one or more creatives to insert in the particular third-party content slot. In some implementations, the reservation policy can identify one or more rules according to which the creatives are to be provided for display within the third-party content slot of the information resource when the information resource is served.
- In some implementations, the method can, via the execution of the script, create reservation schedules for each of the content slots identify as content slots to be managed by the solicitation module. The reservation schedule of a content slot is a schedule indicating the availability of the content slot. When a content slot is reserved for a given period of time, the reservation schedule is updated to indicate that the content slot is reserved for the given period of time. In this way, third-party content providers interested in reserving the content slot are only able to reserve time slots during which the reservation schedule of the content slot indicates that the content slot is available.
- In some implementations, the method can analyze the information resources of the content publisher and identify all content slots configured to serve third-party content items. The method can tag, label, or otherwise modify the identified content slots such that the solicitation module can be configured to manage the reservation of the content slots, while also being able to manage the content capable of being inserted in the identified content slots. In some implementations, the method can modify the content slots such that only the data processing system can provide content for insertion in the content slots when rendered on an end user computing device, such as the end user computing device.
- The method can store data associated with the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot (Block 620). The stored data can be used to provide, for display, the creative within the particular third-party content slot of the information resource according to the reservation policy.
- In some implementations, the method can provide, for display, the creative within the particular third-party content slot of the information resource according to the reservation policy. In some implementations, the method can receive a request to serve a creative for a content slot of an information resource. The request to serve an information resource can be generated in response to an end-user computing device requesting to view the information resource. In some implementations, the indication received by the method can identify the content slot for which to serve a creative. In some implementations, the method can perform a lookup in the database for the content slot and identify a reservation associated with the content slot for the time at which the request to serve a creative for a content slot of an information resource is received by the method. The method can identify a reservation policy associated with the identified reservation. The method can then provide a creative to insert in the content slot when the information resource is served.
- The creative that is provided for insertion can be a creative provided by the third-party content provider that requested the reservation of the content slot.
- C. Providing Actionable Reservation Objects within a Content Slot of an Information Resource of a Content Publisher
-
FIG. 7 illustrates ansystem 700 for providing an actionable reservation object within a third-party content slot of an information resource of a publisher via at least one computer network, such as thenetwork 105. Thesystem 700 can include one or more components of thesystem 100 shown inFIG. 1 and thesystem 300 shown inFIG. 3 . Thesystem 700 includes thedata processing system 110 shown inFIG. 1 , but includes additional modules configured to provide an actionable object within a third-party content slot of an information resource of a publisher. - The
data processing system 110 can include an actionable object module 730, a contentslot insertion module 732 and the reservation interface module 332 (described above with respect toFIG. 3 and Section B in general). Thedata processing system 110 can be configured to receive an indication of interest in providing, for display, a creative within at least one third-party content slot of an information resource of a content publisher. The information resource includes one or more third-party content slots available to be reserved to serve creatives. The data processor can identify at least one third-party content slot included in the information resource available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives. The data processor can insert an actionable object within the identified third-party content slot. The actionable object can be configured to generate a request to provide an interface for reserving the identified third-party content slot to display the creative responsive to an action being taken on the actionable object. The data processor can then render the information resource including the inserted actionable object within the identified third-party content slot. - The actionable object module 730 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in the
data processing system 110. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can be configured to identify one or more content publishers that may be interested in participating in direct content placement campaigns. As described above, in a direct content placement campaign, a content provider can reserve a content slot of an information resource of a content publisher such that each time the information resource is served, a creative of the content provider is provided for display within the content slot of the information resource. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can identify such content providers by crawling the Internet to identify websites that meet threshold traffic-related metrics. The traffic-related metrics can be average daily visitors, average daily impressions, average daily revenue through content placement, amongst others. In some implementations, the traffic-related metrics of content publishers and of particular information resources (for instance, web pages) of content publishers can be determined from existing applications that monitor and publish traffic at various content publishers. - In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can be configured to identify one or more content publishers that may be interested in participating in direct content placement campaigns by identifying content publishers that are currently serving creatives on their information resources. In some implementations, the content publishers may serve creatives via an advertising auction system or via some other direct content placement campaign. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can be configured to identify content publishers that have information resources that are currently receiving creatives from the
data processing system 110, for instance, via an advertising auction system. - The actionable object module 730 can be configured to provide content publishers that may be interested in participating in direct content placement campaigns information for participating in direct content placement campaigns. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can do so by direct marketing to content publishers, for instance, via email, banner ads, or other forms of marketing.
- The actionable object module 730 can be configured to receive an indication of interest in providing, for display, a creative within at least one third-party content slot of an information resource of a content publisher. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 may receive the request to receive an indication of interest from a content publisher. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 may receive the request to receive an indication of interest from a content publisher the via an interface through which a content provider can communicate with the
data processing system 110. In some implementations, the content provider can have an existing relationship with thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, the content provider can include information resources that have content slots configured to receive creatives from one or more modules of thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, the content slots can be configured to receive creatives that are selected by an advertising auction system. In some implementations, the content publisher, may, via the interface, provide an indication of interest by selecting a user input object provided on the interface. In some implementations, the content publisher may provide the indication of interest responsive to a marketing effort of the actionable object module 730 or thedata processing system 110 in general. - The actionable object module 730 can be configured to configure one or more information resources of a content publisher to include an actionable view-changing object. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can provide, to a content publisher, a software construct, such as a script, code, or other software instructions, that when inserted in an information resource of the content publisher, can cause an actionable view-changing object to appear on the information resource when the information resource is served. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 can automatically configure one or more information resources of a content publisher to include an actionable object by providing a creative that includes the actionable view-changing object for insertion into a content slot of the information resources. In some implementations, the content slot in which the creative that includes the actionable view-changing object is inserted can be configured to receive creatives provided by the actionable object module 730 or the
data processing system 110. In some implementations in which the actionable view-changing object is provided for display on an area of the information resource that is outside a content slot, source code of the information resource may be modified to include the software construct. In some implementations, the actionable object module 730 may modify the source code of the information resource or the content publisher may modify the source code. In some implementations, the view-changing actionable object can be configured to cause thedata processing system 110 to render the information resource such that actionable reservation objects are inserted within the identified third-party content slot. Additional details regarding reservation objects are provided below.FIG. 8A shows a screenshot of an information resource with an actionable view-changing object to identify content slots of the information resource that are available to be reserved. - The content
slot insertion module 732 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. The contentslot insertion module 732 can be configured to identify, on an information resource, at least one third-party content slot available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives. In some implementations, the contentslot insertion module 732 can be configured to first identify all of the content slots on the information resource. The contentslot insertion module 732 can then identify, from all of the identified content slots, one or more content slots that are available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives. In some implementations, the contentslot insertion module 732 can identify content slots available to be reserved by identifying content slots that are tagged or otherwise marked as being available to be reserved. In some implementations, an information resource can include a first third-party content slot configured to be available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives via a direct content placement campaign and a second third-party content slot configured to display creatives selected for insertion via an content placement auction. In some implementations, the content publisher can identify the content slots that the content publisher would like to participate in a direct content placement campaign. In some implementations, the content publisher can tag the content slot via a source code of the information resource. In some implementations, the contentslot insertion module 732 can configure one or more of the content slots of the information resource to be reserved. This can be possible by configuring the content slot to only receive creatives from thedata processing system 110. - The content
slot insertion module 732 can be configured to insert at least one actionable reservation object within one or more third-party content slots available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives. The actionable reservation object can be configured to provide information for reserving the identified third-party content slot to display the creative responsive to an action being taken on the actionable reservation object. In some implementations, the actionable reservation object can be configured to cause thedata processing system 110 to provide a reservation interface through which a content provider can reserve the content slot in which the reservation object was inserted in response to an action being taken on the actionable reservation object. The actionable reservation object can include one or more of a link, a creative, a button, an icon, or any other actionable object on which an action can be taken via an input device or mechanism. - In some implementations, the content
slot insertion module 732 can be configured to insert an content slot occupying object within the content slot in which the actionable reservation object is inserted or placed. The content slot occupying object can be configured to occupy the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can be translucent such that the content slot occupying object partially obscures an underlying creative previously inserted in the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can be opaque such that it completely obscures an underlying creative. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can partially occupy the content object. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can match the dimensions of the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object be of a particular color that stands out against a background color of the information resource. In this way, the content slot occupying object can help a content provider view the area where a creative of the content provider will appear if the content provider reserves the content slot. In some implementations, the contentslot insertion module 732 can select a shape, size, color, translucency, opacity, or other characteristics of the content slot occupying object. - The content
slot insertion module 732 can be configured to render the information resource including the inserted actionable reservation object within the identified third-party content slot. In some implementations, the contentslot insertion module 732 can be configured to render the information resource including the inserted actionable reservation object within the identified third-party content slot in response to an action being taken on the view-changing object.FIG. 8B illustrates a screenshot of an information resource including actionable reservation objects object within the identified third-party content slot. - Referring now to
FIG. 8A , a display depicting an information resource with an actionable view-changing object to identify content slots of the information resource that are available to be reserved is shown. The display shows aninformation resource 800 that includes aprimary content area 802 in whichprimary content 804 is displayed. The information resource also includes a plurality ofcontent slots 810A-810C (generally content slot 810). The plurality of content slots can be configured to holdcreatives 812A-812C (generally creative 812) that are inserted within the content slots 810 when theinformation resource 800 is served. Thecontent slots 810A-810C have designated locations on the information resource and have a predetermined content slot size. The location and size of the content slots can factor into the cost for reserving one of these slots. As such, for a content provider interested in reserving one of the content slots, the content provider may be interested in visually identifying the content slot the content provider is interested in reserving. - The
information resource 800 further includes an actionable view-changingobject 830. The actionable view-changingobject 830 can be configured to generate a request to provide an interface for reserving one or more identified third-party content slots in which to insert the creative responsive to an action being taken on the actionable object. The actionable view-changing object can be a link, an icon, a banner, a creative, or any other content item upon which an action can be taken. As shown inFIG. 8A , the actionable view-changing object is a link that contains the text “enable advertise here.” Instances of actions can include a click, a hover over, a tap, or some other way of actuating the actionable object. By taking an action on the actionable view-changingobject 830, the actionable object module 730 or thedata processing system 110 can render a second information resource. -
FIG. 8B is a display depicting thesame information resource 800 having actionable reservation objects 816A-816C (generally actionable reservation object 816) positioned within thecontent slots 810A-810C of theinformation resource 800. The actionable reservation objects can be configured to reserve the content slots 810 of theinformation resource 800. Theinformation resource 800 further includes contentslot occupying objects 814A-814C positioned over the creatives 812 shown inFIG. 8A . In some implementations, the content slot occupying objects 814 can be opaque, translucent or transparent. In some implementations, the content slot occupying objects 814 can be configured to cover any creatives inserted in the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying objects 814 can be inserted in the content slots 810 to attract the attention of a content provider. In some implementations, the content slot occupying objects 814 can be inserted to demonstrate, to a content provider, an area of the information resource where a creative will appear if the corresponding content slot is reserved. - The actionable reservation objects 816 can be inserted within the content slots 810 responsive to an action taken on the actionable view-changing
object 830 shown inFIG. 8A . The actionable reservation objects 816 can be a link, an icon, a banner, a creative, or any other content item on which an action can be taken. In some implementations, the reservation objects 816 can be configured to provide, for display, a reservation interface, such as the reservation interface shown inFIG. 5B , through which a content provider can reserve a content slot corresponding to the reservation object on which the action was taken. As such, each of the reservation objects corresponds to a reservation interface for reserving the content slot that holds or contains the reservation object on which the action was taken. For instance, if a content provider clicked on thereservation object 816A, thedata processing system 110 can be configured to provide a reservation interface for reserving thecontent slot 810A. Conversely, if the content provider clicked on thereservation object 816B, thedata processing system 110 can be configured to provide a reservation interface for reserving thecontent slot 810B. In this way, by providing the reservation object within the actual content slot the content provider intends to reserve, errors relating to reserving a content slot that the content provider did not intend to reserve can be reduced, if not eliminated. - Responsive to an action taken on one of the reservation objects 816A-816C, the
data processing system 110 can provide a reservation interface for reserving the content slot associated with the reservation object on which the action was taken. An screenshot of the reservation interface is shown inFIG. 5B . - The
reservation interface module 332 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. A discussion of thereservation interface module 332 and its functionality have previously been described above in Section B. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to provide, for display, a reservation interface through which a third-party content provider can reserve one or more content slots of information resources of a content publisher. Thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to provide the reservation interface for display responsive to receiving a request to receive information for inserting a creative within one or more third-party content slots available on the information resource. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to provide the reservation interface to a third-party content provider in response to the third-party content provider taking an action on an reservation object, such as the reservation object 816, provided for display on an information resource of the content publisher. For instance, thereservation interface module 332 may provide thereservation interface 550 shown inFIG. 5B to a third-party content provider in response to the third-party content provider clicking on the reservation object 816 provided for display on theinformation resource 800 shown inFIG. 8B . - In some implementations, the reservation interface can be provided on or as an information resource of the
data processing system 110. The reservation interface can be configured to allow a third-party content provider to reserve one or more content slots of one or more information resources of a content publisher. The reservation interface can be configured to provide information that a third-party content provider can benefit from when determining whether to reserve one or more content slots of an information resource. - The information can identify a plurality of third-party content slots of one or more information resources of the content publisher. In addition, the information can include visitor traffic-related information that may be useful to the third-party content provider when deciding whether to reserve one or more third-party content slots on one or more information resources of the content publisher. This visitor traffic-related information can include information about the number of visitors visiting one or more information resources of the content publisher, the types of visitors, the various types of content slots on the one or more information resources available to be reserved, the cost to reserve one or more of the content slots, amongst others. In some implementations, the
reservation interface module 332 can receive the traffic-related information from the activity log data maintained by thedata processing system 110 for the information resource of the content publisher. As described above, a script provided by thesolicitation module 330 and included within the information resources of the content publisher may enable thedata processing system 110 to receive activity data associated with visitor activity at the information resource and maintain logs of the activity data. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to determine traffic-related information or statistics from the traffic related information and provide the information for display on the reservation interface. - In addition to the visitor traffic-related information, the reservation interface can include a visual representation of the information resource. The visual representation of the information resource can include one or more visual indicators identifying the content slots on the information resource. In this way, the third-party content provider can be made aware of where a creative will appear when served on the information resource. In some implementations, the interface can be configured such that when an object on the interface is hovered over, a visual indicator located on, near or around the content slot on the visual representation of the information resource corresponding to the object is actuated.
- In some implementations, the
reservation interface module 332 can also be configured to determine the cost for reserving each of the content slots associated with the content publisher that are available for reservation. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can receive the cost for reserving a content slot from the content publisher. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can determine the cost for reserving a content slot based on the traffic-related information associated with the information resources and the content slots themselves, including the size of the content slot, the daily number of impressions and a number of conversions, amongst others. In some implementations, the cost can be based on supply and demand. For instance, based on a number of available dates, thereservation interface module 332 can determine a level of demand for the content slot and set a cost accordingly. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can look at historical reservations to determine how much content providers are willing to pay. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can identify the cost of other content publishers having similar traffic related statistics or include content related to similar topics to determine a cost for the content slots. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 may be configured to determine a cost based on the available inventory of content slots of similar sites. - The
reservation interface module 332 can be configured to determine separate costs for reserving each of the content slots. The cost of a content slot can be dictated in part by location of the content slot, the size of the content slot, the type of creative being inserted (for instance, creatives including video, creatives including audio, creative with content extensions) in addition to the content publisher associated with the information resource on which the content slot is inserted. - In some implementations, the
reservation interface module 332 can also be configured to determine the cost to reserve a content slot based on an availability of the content slot. For instance, a content slot that is available for one day can be priced differently than a content slot that is available for a longer period of time. Moreover, the cost to reserve a content slot can vary based on the day of the week, the time of the year, the season, amongst others. Generally, thereservation interface module 332 can determine the cost to reserve a content slot based on an anticipated number of views to be received during a particular reservation period. - The
reservation interface module 332 can be configured to receive, from a third-party content provider, a request to reserve a particular content slot identified on the reservation interface. Stated in another way, the request to reserve a particular content slot can be a request to insert one or more creatives within a particular third-party content slot of the plurality of third-party content slots when serving an information resource on which the content slot according to a reservation policy. The request can identify the one or more creatives to insert within the content slot being reserved. The reservation policy can identify one or more rules according to which the one or more creatives are to be provided for display within the third-party content slot of the information resource when the information resource is served. For instance, the reservation policy can include a reservation schedule that identifies a time period over which to reserve the particular content slot. In some implementations, the third-party content provider can select the time period via a calendar object. In some implementations, the granularity of the reservation schedule can range from a minute, an hour, a day, a week, or even longer. In addition, the third-party content provider can include one or more creatives in the request to reserve a particular content slot. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to allow the third-party content provider to identify a percentage of impressions that each of the creatives should receive. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can be configured to allow the third-party content provider to indicate in the request that a first creative is to receive 50% of the impressions, the second creative is to receive 30% of the impressions and the third creative is to receive 20% of the impressions. Thereservation interface module 332 can receive such requests, identify one or more content serving restrictions and create one or more rules which form the reservation policy according to which the creatives are inserted in the content slot. - The
reservation interface module 332, in response to receiving the request to reserve a particular content slot, can provide a payment form to the third-party content publisher. In some implementations, the third-party content publisher can have an account with thedata processing system 110 and therefore, payments may be automatically processed once a request to reserve a particular content slot is received. Thereservation interface module 332 can receive payment details from the third-party content provider and process the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot according to the reservation policy associated with the request. - The
reservation interface module 332 can be configured to store data associated with the request to insert the creative within the particular third-party content slot. The stored data can be useful to provide, for display, the creative within the particular third-party content slot of the information resource according to the reservation policy. In some implementations, thereservation interface module 332 can store the data in a database, such as thedatabase 140. -
FIG. 9 is a flow diagram depicting an method of providing an actionable object within a third-party content slot of an information resource of a content publisher. In brief overview, the method can receive an indication of interest in providing, for display, a creative within at least one third-party content slot of an information resource of a content publisher (Block 905). The method can identify at least one third-party content slot included in the information resource available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives (Block 910). The method can insert an actionable object within the identified third-party content slot (Block 915). The method can then render the information resource including the inserted actionable object within the identified third-party content slot (Block 920). - In further detail, the method can receive a request to receive an indication of interest in providing, for display, a creative within at least one third-party content slot of an information resource of a content publisher (Block 905). The information resource includes one or more third-party content slots available to be reserved to serve creatives. In some implementations, the method may receive the request to receive an indication of interest from a content publisher. In some implementations, the method may receive the request to receive an indication of interest from a content publisher the via an interface through which a content provider can communicate with a data processing system. In some implementations, the content slots can be configured to receive creatives that are selected by an advertising auction system. In some implementations, the content publisher, may, via the interface, provide an indication of interest by selecting a user input object provided on the interface. In some implementations, the content publisher may provide the indication of interest responsive to a marketing effort organized or performed by the method.
- The method can configure one or more information resources of a content publisher to include an actionable view-changing object. In some implementations, the method can provide, to a content publisher, a software construct, such as a script, code, or other software instructions, that when inserted in an information resource of the content publisher, can cause an actionable view-changing object to appear on the information resource when the information resource is served. In some implementations, the method can automatically configure one or more information resources of a content publisher to include an actionable object by providing a creative that includes the actionable view-changing object for insertion into a content slot of the information resources. In some implementations, the content slot in which the creative that includes the actionable view-changing object is inserted can be configured to receive creatives provided by the method. In some implementations in which the actionable view-changing object is provided for display on an area of the information resource that is outside a content slot, source code of the information resource may be modified to include the software construct. In some implementations, the method may modify the source code of the information resource or the content publisher may modify the source code. In some implementations, the view-changing actionable object can be configured to cause the method to render the information resource such that actionable reservation objects are inserted within the identified third-party content slot.
- The method can identify at least one third-party content slot included in the information resource available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives (Block 910). In some implementations, the method can first identify all of the content slots on the information resource. The method can then identify, from all of the identified content slots, one or more content slots that are available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives. In some implementations, the method can identify content slots available to be reserved by identifying content slots that are tagged or otherwise marked as being available to be reserved. In some implementations, an information resource can include a first third-party content slot configured to be available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives via a direct content placement campaign and a second third-party content slot configured to display creatives selected for insertion via an content placement auction. In some implementations, the content publisher can identify the content slots that the content publisher would like to participate in a direct content placement campaign. In some implementations, the content publisher can tag the content slot via a source code of the information resource. In some implementations, the method can configure one or more of the content slots of the information resource to be reserved. This can be possible by configuring the content slot to only receive creatives from the method.
- The method can insert an actionable object within the identified third-party content slot available to be reserved to serve one or more creatives (Block 915). The actionable object can be configured to generate a request to provide an interface for reserving the identified third-party content slot to display the creative responsive to an action being taken on the actionable object. In some implementations, the actionable reservation object can be configured to cause the method to provide a reservation interface through which a content provider can reserve the content slot in which the reservation object was inserted in response to an action being taken on the actionable reservation object. The actionable reservation object can include one or more of a link, a creative, a button, an icon, or any other actionable object on which an action can be taken via an input device or mechanism.
- In some implementations, the method can insert an content slot occupying object within the content slot in which the actionable reservation object is inserted or placed. The content slot occupying object can be configured to occupy the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can be translucent such that the content slot occupying object partially obscures an underlying creative previously inserted in the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can be opaque such that it completely obscures an underlying creative. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can partially occupy the content object. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object can match the dimensions of the content slot. In some implementations, the content slot occupying object be of a particular color that stands out against a background color of the information resource. In this way, the content slot occupying object can help a content provider view the area where a creative of the content provider will appear if the content provider reserves the content slot. In some implementations, the method can select a shape, size, color, translucency, opacity, or other characteristics of the content slot occupying object.
- The method can render the information resource including the inserted actionable reservation object within the identified third-party content slot (Block 920). In some implementations, the content
slot insertion module 732 can render the information resource including the inserted actionable reservation object within the identified third-party content slot in response to an action being taken on the view-changing object. -
FIG. 11 illustrates an system 1100 for automatically resizing a creative based on dimensions of a content slot via at least one computer network, such as thenetwork 105. The system 1100 can include one or more components of thesystem 100 shown inFIG. 1 , thesystem 300 shown inFIG. 3 and thesystem 700 shown inFIG. 7 . The system 1100 includes thedata processing system 110 shown inFIGS. 1 , 3 and 7, but includes additional modules configured to automatically resize a creative based on dimensions of a content slot. - The
data processing system 110 can include acreative analysis module 1030 and acreative processing module 1032. The data processing system can receive a content object, such as a creative (for instance, an ad) including one or more visual content items. The creative can have a first set of dimensions. The data processor can determine a content slot having a second set of dimensions in which to insert the creative. The data processor can determine an aspect ratio of the creative and an aspect ratio of the content slot. The data processor can apply edge detection to identify edges of the visual content items included in the creative. The data processor can then apply a bounding box around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items. The bounding box can be sized to have an aspect ratio that corresponds to a smaller of the aspect ratio of the creative and the aspect ratio of the content slot. The data processor can then can resize the bounding box to fit within the second set of dimensions corresponding to the content slot. -
FIGS. 11A-11E depict various stages of a process of automatically resizing a creative based on dimensions of a content slot. A creative 1102 is shown inFIG. 11A . The creative 1102 is a rectangle having a corresponding length and width and a corresponding aspect ratio. The creative 1102 includes multiple content items, such as the letters that spell out “GET STARTED”, “DRUPAL”, “TM” and the number “7”. In addition, the creative includes content items that form the background design of the creative. The creative 1102 is then processed over a series of stages, the result of each stage shown in theFIGS. 11B-11E . The description of thecreative analysis module 1030 and thecreative processing module 1032 shown inFIG. 10 are described herein with the aid of the visual representations shown inFIGS. 11B-11E . - The
creative analysis module 1030 of thedata processing system 110 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thecreative analysis module 1030 can be configured to receive a content object, such as a creative 1102 (for instance, an ad) including one or more visual content items. In some implementations, thecreative analysis module 1030 can receive the creative from a third-party content publisher seeking to participate in a content placement campaign. In some implementations, thecreative analysis module 1030 can receive a request to create one or more creatives suitable for insertion into one or more content slots. In some implementations, the content slots may correspond to standard content slot sizes. In some implementations, the content slots may have dimensions that are different from the standard content slot sizes. - The
creative analysis module 1030 can be configured to determine the dimensions of the creative 1102. In some implementations, thecreative analysis module 1030 can determine the dimensions of the creative 1102 by analyzing the locations between the pixels that define the corners of the creative 1102. In some implementations, thecreative analysis module 1030 can determine the dimensions of the creative 1102 through other known techniques for determining dimensions of images. - The
creative analysis module 1030 can be configured to identify one or more content slots in which a resized version of the creative 1102 can be inserted.FIG. 11E shows a resized creative 1114. In some implementations, the request identifying the creative 1102 can include a request to create a plurality of creatives that correspond to one or more standard content slots. In some implementations, thecreative analysis module 1030 can determine or identify dimensions of the content slots in which a resized creative 1114 derived from the original creative 1102 can be inserted. - The
creative analysis module 1030 can be configured to determine an aspect ratio of the content slot in which the resized creative 1114 can be inserted. Thecreative analysis module 1030 can determine the aspect ratio based on the dimensions of the content slot. The aspect ratio of a rectangle is a ratio of the length to a width of the rectangle. The aspect ratio of a square is 1. Thecreative analysis module 1030 also can be configured to determine an aspect ratio of the original creative 1102. Thecreative analysis module 1030 can determine the aspect ratio based on the dimensions of the creative 1102. Thecreative analysis module 1030 can be configured to compare the aspect ratios of the content slot and the aspect ratio of the creative and determine which of the aspect ratio of the content slot or the creative has the smaller aspect ratio. - The
creative processing module 1032 of thedata processing system 110 can be part of, or can include scripts executed by, one or more servers in thedata processing system 110. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can be configured to apply edge detection to identify edges of the visual content items included in the creative. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can apply laplacian edge detection to the original creative 1102 to form a processed creative 1104. In some such implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can apply laplacian edge detection with further thresholding of a predetermined threshold level. In some implementations, the predetermined threshold level can be around 0.5-0.9, or more specifically, around 0.6-0.8, or more specifically, around 0.7. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can apply gradient edge detection to the original creative 1102 or the processed creative 1104. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can apply differential edge detection to detect sub-pixels. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can apply edge thinning to the original creative 1102 or the processed creative 1104 to filter out any artifacts that have dimensions that are below a certain threshold. - The
creative processing module 1032 can be configured to apply abounding box 1108 around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items of the processed creative 1104. Thebounding box 1108 can be sized to have an aspect ratio that corresponds to a smaller of the aspect ratio of the original creative and the aspect ratio of the content slot in which to insert the resized creative 1114. In some implementations, applying abounding box 1108 around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items of the creative 1104 can include applying abounding box 1108 around all of the content items. In some implementations, applying abounding box 1108 around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items of the processed creative 1104 can include applying the smallest possible bounding box that encompasses substantially all of the content items within the creative, for instance, about 95% or more (in some implementations, about 99%) of the content items included in the creative. In some implementations, the bounding box can be applied such that pixels that are part of content items deemed important to the original creative 1104 are included within thebounding box 1108. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can identify content items, such as letters or numbers, as important to the creative 1102. As such, thecreative processing module 1032 can apply abounding box 1108 such that none of the pixels that form part of the content items identified as important lie outside thebounding box 1108. - The
creative processing module 1032 can also be configured to determine whether a particular creative can be resized to fit within a particular content slot without compromising on the quality of the creative. In some implementations, the creative processing module can determine that the particular creative cannot be resized to fit within a particular content slot in response to determining that a bounding box cannot be sized to include substantially all portions of all of the visual content items deemed important to the creative. For instance, thecreative processing module 1032 can determine that the original creative 1102 cannot be resized to fit within a particular content slot in response to determining that a bounding box cannot be sized to include more than 98% of the pixels of the content items deemed important to the creative. In some implementations, the boundary box may be small enough such that no portion of the boundary box can extend beyond the boundary of the creative to be resized. In some implementations, the boundary box may be small enough such that only a predetermined threshold, for instance, 10% of the area defined by the boundary box can extend beyond the boundary of the creative to be resized. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can generate a notification indicating that the creative cannot be automatically resized to fit within the dimensions of the content slot in response to determining that the bounding box cannot be sized to include substantially all portions of all of the visual content items deemed important to the creative. - In some implementations, the
creative processing module 1032 can be configured to increase the size of thebounding box 1108 to include a margin. The margin can be a predetermined amount, for instance, adding a predetermined number of pixels to each dimension. In some implementations, the number of pixels can range from about 10-200 pixels. In some implementations, size of the margin can be determined heuristically. In some implementations, the size of the margin can be provided by the third-party content provider. In some implementations, the size of the margin can be based on a percentage of the dimensions of the bounding box. In some implementations, the margins can be applied such that the aspect ratio of thebounding box 1108 remains the same.FIG. 11D shows a cropped creative 1112 corresponding to the cropped portion of the processed creative 1104. The cropped portion corresponds to the portion encompassed by thebounding box 1108. Once the processed creative 1104 is cropped, the edge detection filter can be removed. - The
creative processing module 1032 can then can resize the cropped creative 1112 to form the resized creative 1114 that is sized to fit within the second set of dimensions corresponding to the content slot. The cropped creative 1112 can be scaled to a size that can fit within the content slot. Thecreative processing module 1032 can scale the cropped creative by matching a length of the cropped creative 1112 to a length of the content slot and matching the width of the cropped creative 1112 to a width of the content slot. As the cropped creative has an aspect ratio that corresponds to the aspect ratio of the content slot, the aspect ratio of the cropped creative 1112 remains the same as the aspect ratio of the resized creative 1114. - In some implementations, the
creative processing module 1032 can store the resized creative in a data store, such as the database 1040. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can provide the resized creative, for display, to the third-party content provider. Thecreative processing module 1032 can provide an interface through which the third-party content provider can approve or reject the resized creative for use in content placement campaigns. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can provide an interface to the third-party content provider or to any other entity through which the bounding box can be repositioned or resized. In this way, the third-party content provider or other entity can influence the appearance of the resized creative. In some implementations, thecreative processing module 1032 can further allow the third-party content provider or other entity to modify the resized creative using a graphics interface. The graphics interface, can for instance, be used to change colors, add lines or other visual content, modify or remove existing visual content, amongst others. - In some implementations, the
creative processing module 1032 can compare a resized creative that was rejected for use in content placement campaigns with a resized creative of the same size and derived from the same original creative that was approved to better understand why the resized creative was rejected. In this way, thecreative processing module 1032 can identify particular characteristics that may cause a resized image to be rejected and thereby, improve the process of automatically resizing creatives to avoid such characteristics in the future. In this way, thecreative processing module 1032 can be self-learning or self-improving. In some implementations, as part of the creative processing module's ability to self-learn, thecreative processing module 1032 can also be configured to analyze existing creatives that have been approved for a particular content slot size to identify characteristics of such creatives. - In some implementations, the
creative processing module 1032 can, alone or in conjunction with other modules ofdata processing system 110, receive requests to provide creatives corresponding to a particular content slot size and in response to the requests, retrieve or generate resized creatives and provide such resized creatives. -

In some implementations, the method can receive the creative (original creative) from a third-party content publisher seeking to participate in a content placement campaign. In some implementations, the method can receive a request to create one or more resized creatives suitable for insertion into one or more content slots based on the original creative. In some implementations, the content slots may correspond to standard content slot sizes. Instances of standard slot sizes include 728×90, 468×60, 320×50, 50×50, amongst others. In some implementations, the content slots may have dimensions that are different from the standard content slot sizes. - The method can be configured to determine the dimensions of the original creative.

In some implementations, the method can be configured to automatically generate a request to resize the original creative into one or more resized creatives that can fit within or match one or more content slot sizes, and in particular, standard content slot sizes.
- The method can determine an aspect ratio of the original creative and an aspect ratio of the content slot in which to insert a resized creative derived from the original creative (Block 1215).

The method can determine the aspect ratio based on the dimensions of the content slot. The method can determine an aspect ratio of the original creative. The method can determine the aspect ratio based on the dimensions of the creative. The method can compare the aspect ratios of the content slot and the aspect ratio of the creative and determine which of the aspect ratio of the content slot or the creative has the smaller aspect ratio.
- The method can apply edge detection (Block 1220). In some implementations, the method can apply edge detection to identify edges of the visual content items included in the original creative. In some implementations, the method can apply laplacian edge detection to the original creative to form or generate a processed creative. In some such implementations, the method can apply laplacian edge detection with further thresholding of a predetermined threshold level. In some implementations, the predetermined threshold level can be around 0.5-0.9, or more specifically, around 0.6-0.8, or more specifically, around 0.7. In some implementations, the method can apply gradient edge detection to the original creative or the processed creative. In some implementations, the method can apply differential edge detection to detect sub-pixels. In some implementations, the method can apply edge thinning to the original creative or the processed creative to filter out any artifacts that have dimensions that are below a certain threshold.
- The method can apply a bounding box around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items (Block 1225). In some implementations, the bounding box can be sized to have an aspect ratio that corresponds to a smaller of the aspect ratio of the original creative and the aspect ratio of the content slot in which to insert the resized creative. In some implementations, applying a
bounding box 1108 around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items of the processed creative can include applying a bounding box around all of the content items. In some implementations, applying a bounding box around a substantial portion of the identified edges of the content items of the processed creative can include applying the smallest possible bounding box that encompasses substantially all of the content items within the creative, for instance, about 95% or more (in some implementations, about 99%) of the content items included in the creative. In some implementations, the bounding box can be applied such that pixels that are part of content items deemed important to the original creative 1104 are included within thebounding box 1108. In some implementations, the method can identify content items, such as letters or numbers, as important to the original creative. As such, the method can apply a bounding box such that none of the pixels that form part of the content items identified as important lie outside the bounding box. - In some implementations, the method can determine whether a particular original creative can be resized to fit within a particular content slot without compromising on the quality of the visual aspects of the original creative. In some implementations, the method can determine that the particular creative cannot be resized to fit within a particular content slot in response to determining that a bounding box cannot be sized to include substantially all portions of all of the visual content items deemed important to the creative. For instance, the method can determine that the original creative cannot be resized to fit within a particular content slot in response to determining that a bounding box cannot be sized to include more than 98% of the pixels of the content items deemed important to the creative. In some implementations, the boundary box may be small enough such that no portion of the boundary box can extend beyond the boundary of the creative to be resized. In some implementations, the boundary box may be small enough such that only a predetermined threshold, for instance, 10% of the area defined by the boundary box can extend beyond the boundary of the creative to be resized. In some implementations, the method can generate a notification indicating that the creative cannot be automatically resized to fit within the dimensions of the content slot in response to determining that the bounding box cannot be sized to include substantially all portions of all of the visual content items deemed important to the creative.
- In some implementations, the method can increase the size of the bounding box to include a margin. The margin can be a predetermined amount, for instance, adding a predetermined number of pixels to each dimension. In some implementations, the number of pixels can range from about 10-200 pixels. In some implementations, size of the margin can be determined heuristically. In some implementations, the size of the margin can be provided by the third-party content provider. In some implementations, the size of the margin can be based on a percentage of the dimensions of the bounding box. In some implementations, the margins can be applied such that the aspect ratio of the bounding box remains the same. The cropped portion corresponds to the portion encompassed by the bounding box. In some implementations, once the processed creative 1104 is cropped, the method can remove the edge detection filter from the cropped creative.
- The method can resize the bounding box to fit within the second set of dimensions corresponding to the content slot (Block 1230). In some implementations, the method can scale the cropped creative to a size that can fit within the content slot. The method can scale the cropped creative by matching a length of the cropped creative to a length of the content slot and matching the width of the cropped creative to a width of the content slot. As the cropped creative has an aspect ratio that corresponds to the aspect ratio of the content slot, the aspect ratio of the cropped creative remains the same as the aspect ratio of the resized creative.
- The method can further include a process of providing a resized creative for display. In some implementations, the method can receive a request to serve a creative that corresponds to a particular content slot. In some implementations, the request can identify a size of the content slot. In some implementations, the method can identify the resized creative that corresponds to the identified size of the content slot and provide the resized creative. In some implementations, the method can begin the process of resizing an original creative to fit within the identified size of the content slot responsive to receiving a request to serve a creative. In some implementations, the method can retrieve a resized creative stored in a data store responsive to receiving the request.

- For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's location), or to control whether or how to receive content from a content server or other data processing system that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters. For instance, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, postal code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content server.
- The term “data processing system” or “computing device” “module” “engine” “component” or “computing device” encompasses apparatuses, devices, and machines for processing data, including a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or multiple ones, or combinations, of the foregoing, amongst others. The apparatuses can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination thereof. The apparatus and execution environment can realize various different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures. The content
placement management module 130, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132, the or the conversionrate prediction module 134 can include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, systems, computing devices, or processors. - A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, app, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs (e.g., components of the data processing system 110) to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatuses can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- The subject matter described herein can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or a combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Communication networks can include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks), amongst others.
- The computing system such as
system 100 orsystem 1300 can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network (e.g., the network 105). The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server (e.g., received by thedata processing system 110 from the content provider computing device 115). - While operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, such operations are not required to be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and all illustrated operations are not required to be performed. Actions described herein can be performed in a different order.
- The separation of various system components does not require separation in all implementations, and the described program components can be included in a single hardware or software product. For instance, the content
placement management module 130, the conversion ratemodel generation module 132, the conversionrate prediction module 134, thesolicitation module 330, thereservation interface module 332, thecreative placement module 334, the actionable object module 730, the contentslot insertion module 732, thecreative analysis module 1030 and thecreative processing module 1032 can be a single module, a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or part of an online content item placement system. - Having now described some illustrative implementations, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting. In particular, although many of the implementations presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, those acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to accomplish the same objectives. Acts, elements and features discussed in connection with one implementation are not intended to be excluded from a similar role in other implementations or implementations.
- The phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including” “comprising” “having” “containing” “involving” “characterized by” “characterized in that” and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter, equivalents thereof, and additional items, as well as alternate implementations consisting of the items listed thereafter exclusively. In one implementation, the systems and methods described herein consist of one, each combination of more than one, or all of the described elements, acts, or components.
- Any references to implementations or elements or acts of the systems and methods herein referred to in the singular may also embrace implementations including a plurality of these elements, and any references in plural to any implementation or element or act herein may also embrace implementations including only a single element. References in the singular or plural form are not intended to limit the presently disclosed systems or methods, their components, acts, or elements to single or plural configurations. References to any act or element being based on any information, act or element may include implementations where the act or element is based at least in part on any information, act, or element.
- Any implementation disclosed herein may be combined with any other implementation, and references to “an implementation,” “some implementation,” “an alternate implementation,” “various implementation,” “one implementation” or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation may be included in at least one implementation. Such terms as used herein are not necessarily all referring to the same implementation. Any implementation may be combined with any other implementation, inclusively or exclusively, in any manner consistent with the aspects and implementations disclosed herein.
- References to “or” may be construed as inclusive so that any terms described using “or” may indicate any of a single, more than one, and all of the described terms.
- Where technical features in the drawings, detailed description or any claim are followed by reference signs, the reference signs have been included to increase the intelligibility of the drawings, detailed description, and claims. Accordingly, neither the reference signs nor their absence have any limiting effect on the scope of any claim elements.
- The systems and methods described herein may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the characteristics thereof. The foregoing implementations are illustrative rather than limiting of the described systems and methods. Scope of the systems and methods described herein is thus indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are embraced therein.
