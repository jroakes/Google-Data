When user property designated equipment type is mobile device, the geographic position of subscriber equipment in five miles of the business position of advertiser and user property specifies this user for the male sex time, adaptation function MF2 specifies the row 2 of data feed 124 will be used to establishment customized advertising.
When meeting adaptation function M3, the row 3 of data feed is used to create customized advertising.Be similar to adaptation function MF1 and MF2, adaptation function MF3 require device type be mobile device and geographic position in five miles of the business position of advertiser.But adaptation function MF3 requires that user property shows that user is that women is so that the row 3 of data feed will be used.
The user context data 204 received compares to determine whether user context data meets the one or more adaptation functions in adaptation function with adaptation function by content item modifier 122.Such as, content item modifier can determine that user context data 204 comprises the user property required by adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2, makes user context data 204 can be regarded as meeting the requirement of adaptation function MF1 and the requirement of adaptation function MF2.User context data 204 meets the requirement of adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2, because the geographic position of user context data 204 designated user equipment is in five miles of the business position of advertiser and this subscriber equipment is mobile device, these are by required by each adaptation function in adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2.Further, the sex of user context data 204 designated user is the male sex, and this is in addition to the foregoing required by adaptation function MF2.But user context data 204 does not meet the requirement of adaptation function MF3, adaptation function MF3 requires that the sex of user is women.Therefore, in this example, the row 1 of data feed 124 or row 2 can be used to create customized advertising.
When user context data 204 meets more than one adaptation function, content item modifier 122 can select one of adaptation function, which part (such as, proper subclass) controlling data feed 124 will be used to create customized advertising by this adaptation function.In some embodiments, selecting can based on the characteristic of adaptation function.The characteristic of adaptation function increases along with the quantity of the user property of being specified by adaptation function usually.Such as, require that the first adaptation function of three particular user attributes of being specified by user context data is by more concrete for the second adaptation function be usually considered to than only two the particular user attributes in three the particular user attributes requiring to be specified by user context data.Therefore, when user context data comprises each user property in the user property required by the first adaptation function and the second adaptation function, first adaptation function can be used to which part controlling to use data feed, because the first adaptation function is considered to more concrete.
In the examples described above, adaptation function MF2 is more concrete than adaptation function MF1, because adaptation function MF2 requires that user context data 204 comprises user property (such as, sex=M) additional compared with those user properties required by adaptation function MF1.Therefore, if select adaptation function based on characteristic, then adaptation function MF2 will be selected to the part of specifying being used to the data feed creating advertisement.Therefore, in this example, the row 2 of data feed 124 will be used to create customized advertising.
In some embodiments, from the adaptation function that user context data meets, select adaptation function to be historical performance (such as, independent of the characteristic of matched rule) based on the advertisement using matched rule to create.Such as, suppose that the advertisement using adaptation function MF1 to create has the conversion higher than the advertisement using adaptation function MF2 to create.Equally, suppose that adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2 is both met by user context data 204.In this example, content item modifier 122 can select adaptation function MF1 as the adaptation function being used to which part controlling data feed to create advertisement, because the performance of adaptation function MF1 is higher than the performance of adaptation function MF2.Therefore, in this example, the row 1 of data feed 124 will be used to create advertisement.
Content item modifier 122 uses the part of the data feed 124 of being specified by adaptation function (such as, adaptation function MF2) with reference to the content of (such as, storing) to create the self-defined advertisement being used for advertisement request 202.In some embodiments, replace the one or more variablees be included in customized advertising to create self-defined advertisement by inserting by the content of the part reference of data feed, thus amendment customized advertising is to create self-defined advertisement.By data feed part reference be called as Update Table for the content creating self-defined advertisement.
As mentioned above, when content item modifier 122 selects adaptation function MF2 as adaptation function for creating customized advertising, the row 2 of data feed 124 is selected for use in the Update Table of self-defined advertisement.Such as, suppose that customizable advertisement 206 has been selected as use Update Table and has been modified.Customizable advertisement 206 comprises two customizable portion 208 and 210 and immobilized substance 212.No matter immobilized substance 212 is the part how contents being used for the data feed 124 revising customizable advertisement 206 by presenting in customizable advertisement 206.Such as, immobilized substance can be the standardized messages included by each advertisement in the advertisement of advertiser.The selection of customizable advertisement is discussed with reference to Fig. 3.
Customizable portion 208 and 210 is parts of customizable advertisement 206, and data feed 124 can be inserted into this part to customize customizable advertisement 206.In some embodiments, each customizable portion in customizable advertisement is associated (such as, comprising) with the variable (or another placeholder) using data feed 124 to resolve.Such as, as shown in Figure 2 A, customizable portion 208 comprises the variables A of specifying the Update Table corresponding to variables A to be inserted in customizable portion 208.Similarly, customizable portion 210 comprises specifying and corresponds to the Update Table of variable B and will be inserted into the variable B in customizable portion 210.
Content item modifier 122 revises customizable advertisement 206 by being inserted in customizable portion 208 and 210 by the Update Table from data feed.Such as, when revising customizable advertisement according to adaptation function MF2, the Update Table being used for resolving variables A of row 2 that content item modifier 122 will insert from data feed 124 in customizable portion 208.In this particular example, be that text " does not preengage preferential any necktie 5 folding ", the row 2 that the text is arranged in " variables A " arranges especially for resolving the Update Table of variables A.Therefore, this Update Table is inserted in customizable portion 208 by content item modifier 122.Similarly, " direction link (directions link) " is inserted in customizable portion 210 by content item modifier 122, because the referenced and variable B of the row 2 that arranged by " the variable B " in data feed 124 of this content is associated with customizable portion 210.
Once use Update Table to have modified customizable advertisement 206, customizable advertisement has just been considered to customized advertising 214, and customized advertising 214 (or specifying the data of the position of customized advertising 214) is provided to subscriber equipment 106.
Data feed 124 can be created by advertiser and safeguard, makes the Update Table for creating self-defined advertisement can by renewal of more newly arriving to data feed 124.Because multiple different customizable advertisement can use data feed to fill, so advertiser can upgrade the content for creating multiple different self-defined advertisement and not be required to upgrade each independent advertisement.Such as, suppose that two customizable advertisements comprise variable B separately, and advertiser wishes in its advertisement, present its business telephone number instead of direction link.Here, be replaced in and be required to upgrade each customized advertising in two customized advertisings individually, advertiser can upgrade data feed 124 simply and come globally (or optionally) and change the variable B will be associated with the business telephone number of advertiser.When order present two customizable advertisements time, the feeds of renewal will be inserted in advertisement, make the business telephone number of advertiser but not direction link replacement variable B is presented.
Data feed manually can be inputted by advertiser, or automatically upgrades from other sources.Such as, suppose that hotel advertiser creates data feed, this data feed specifies in the quantity of often kind of room type available in their hotel and the lowest price of often kind of room type.Further, suppose that data feed uses the stock managing system being used for hotel advertiser to fill.In this example, content item modifier 122 periodically can access stock managing system to obtain availability and the pricing information of renewal, and uses the data obtained to upgrade data feed 124.If user puts the advertisement received for this hotel advertiser in the very first time, then advertisement can specify the room of specific quantity available in specific price.But if user's (or different user) receives the advertisement for this hotel advertiser after a while, then advertisement can indicate less room to use, and price may be different relative to price specified in the more early example of advertisement.
Data feed 124 can obtain from each provenance, comprises the login page for advertisement.Such as, use the network site of the login page be redirected in response to the interactive user with advertisement, content item modifier can be asked login page and be obtained data, the business adress of such as advertiser or business telephone number.These data can be inserted in data feed 124 and to be available to the user for and be inserted in the customizable advertisement of advertiser.If advertiser has multiple position, then can comprise the list of position and corresponding relationship information at data feed 124.Advertiser can specify adaptation function, and this adaptation function makes the information closest to the position of user be inserted in customizable advertisement.
Fig. 2 B be a diagram that the block diagram 250 of another technology for selecting data feed based on adaptation function.As described in more detail below, block diagram 250 illustrates and content is inserted in customizable advertisement 206.The content be inserted in customizable advertisement 206 is selected from multiple different sets (being called as feeding 252 and 254) of data feed 124.Can in response to ad-request 202 chosen content from feeding 252 and 254, as mentioned above, ad-request 202 can comprise user context data 204.
In some embodiments, the therefrom feeding of chosen content for inserting can be specified based on the variable be included in the customizable portion 208 and 210 of advertisement.Such as, variables A can comprise the reference of feeding 1252 or be mapped to feeding 1252, and variable B can comprise the reference of feeding 2254 or be mapped to feeding 2254.In this example, when content item modifier 122 detects variables A at customizable portion 208 place, the content that will be present in customizable portion 208 selected by content item modifier 122 with reference to feeding 1252.Similarly, when content item modifier 122 detects variable B at customizable portion 210 place, the content that will be present in customizable portion 208 selected by content item modifier 122 with reference to feeding 2254.
Each different feeding can have different adaptation functions, and content item modifier 122 can use the adaptation function for each feeding to carry out chosen content from this feeding.Such as, as shown in Figure 2 B, feeding 1252 is associated with adaptation function " MF (being fed to 1) ", and this adaptation function " MF (feeding 1) " is defined as: OK. sex=user. and sex & is capable. geographic position < user. geographic position.In this example, adaptation function given content project modifier 122 should identify row from feeding 252, and wherein, the sex of specifying and the sex of being specified by user context data match and geographic value is less than the geographic value of being specified by user context data.
Continue the example user context data from Fig. 2 A, content item modifier 122 can determine that user's sex is the male sex and postcode directory is shown in the position in five miles of the geographic position of advertiser.Use this information, content item modifier 122 can determine that row 256 comprises the sex that matches with user's sex and the distance of customer location (such as, in five miles) is less than the geographic value of specifying for this row.Therefore, content item modifier 122 can select the content in row 256 to fill customizable portion 208.
Feeding 2254 is associated with adaptation function " MF (being fed to 2) ", and this adaptation function " MF (feeding 2) " is defined as: OK. device type=user. and device type.In this example, adaptation function given content project modifier 122 should identify row from feeding 254, and wherein, device type matches with the device type of being specified by user context data.In this example, suppose that user device type can be the one in table top device/laptop devices, tablet device or telephone plant, and user context data designated equipment type is phone.Use this information, content item modifier can determine that row 258 comprises the device type matched with the device type of being specified by user context data.Therefore, content item modifier can fill customizable portion 210 by chosen content from row 258.In this example, for filling the telephone number that the content of customizable portion 210 is clothes shops.If user device type has been tablet device, the link of the map of this store locations is then provided to be inserted in customizable portion 210, if and device type has been desktop PC or laptop computer, then the link of going to shop website has been inserted in customizable portion 210.In some embodiments, adaptation function can be used to determine whether advertisement will comprise web site url and/or which link will be included in web site url similarly.
Be used in adaptation function selecting can comprise for the feeding parameter being inserted into the content in customizable advertisement 206 any data that can be used for content item modifier.Such as, advertiser can create the feeding which specify Current Temperatures or other atmospheric conditions, and adaptation function can specify the row of therefrom chosen content to specify the temperature value (or another atmospheric conditions) being greater than, being less than or mating with Current Temperatures.In some embodiments, Current Temperatures (or another atmospheric conditions) can be obtained from Weather information source (such as, the webpage of the Current Temperatures condition for one or more position is provided).
Other feeding parameters and/or other information sources can be used to create adaptation function and determine data feed 124 which should be used to fill customizable advertisement.Such as, the time parameter in a day can be used to specify when qualified being selected for of content be associated with the particular row of data feed 124 to be inserted in customizable advertisement.Other information can also be provided by other online resources, and are used to fill data feed or which determining data feed to meet adaptation function as context data for.This information can be provided by advertiser, from the website acquisition of being specified by advertiser or by crawling resource to identify from the place making this Information Availability in the public.When by crawling resource and obtaining data feed, periodically can perform the data feed crawling to keep upgrading.
If two row of particular feed meet adaptation function, then can select the particular row being selected as filling advertisement in a variety of ways.Such as, if advertiser can specify two provisional capitals qualified, which has right of priority.Advertiser can also refer to fixed wheel and changes, such as wherein each provisional capital by by the 50%-50% burst of the equal part of service time (or another kind of burst).In addition, if advertiser can ask, multiple different provisional capital is qualified provides content, in the context of Current ad request (such as, based on user context data and any other context available information) select the row providing peak performance (such as, clicking rate, conversion ratio or another kind of performance measurement).
In some embodiments, content item modifier 122 or another data processing equipment can perform the quality of data and close rule operation, to verify that data feed meets the clause of service and promotes the mark of misdata.Such as, the quality of data and the operation of conjunction rule can comprise the assessment of the price of specifying in feeding to guarantee not comprised negative price, spell check and/or syntax check to guarantee that data feed does not comprise typing error or grammar mistake.Quality and close rule operation and can also assess data feed to guarantee do not comprise the content (such as, specified by the clause of the service of the use by organize content project modifier) of forbidding by being fed to the content of specifying and/or meeting style/layout restrictions by being fed to the content of specifying.Such as, do not exceed with the content guaranteeing in every a line can at the maximum quantity of the character will presented in the customizable portion by the fills in this row for content item modifier 122 content that can analyze feeding 124.Content item modifier 122 can provide summary data quality for advertiser and close the report of the result that rule operate, and advertiser can be taken action based on this report.
Quantity-quality and conjunction rule operate the assessment that can also comprise for the adaptation function be fed to.In some embodiments, evaluate matches function can comprise determines that whether adaptation function is not corresponding with the data in any row, and this is not used to fill customizable advertisement from the content of data feed by causing.Such as, suppose that the adaptation function for being fed to 252 is defined as: OK. sex=user. sex & is capable. geographic position < user. geographic position & is capable. device type=user. device type.In this example, adaptation function requires that the device type of specifying in the row of user device type and feeding 252 matches.But feeding 252 does not comprise the data of designated equipment type.Therefore, in this example, the mark of row that will not cause being used to the feeding 252 of filling customizable advertisement 206 of adaptation function.When the row that content item modifier 122 is determined in feeding 252 does not use adaptation function and is identified, content item modifier 122 can provide warning to advertiser, this warning notice advertiser adaptation function is invalid, and points out the reason that adaptation function is invalid.Similarly, if adaptation function will mate with two row or multirow simultaneously, then content item modifier can make advertiser can specify single being about to by the mode selected.
In some embodiments, follow customizable portion and be fed data stuffing, to customizable advertisement execution quality and rule operation can also be closed.The assessment of following the customizable advertisement of the filling of customizable portion can promote quality and close the mark of rule problem, and these quality and conjunction rule problem may not detect based on the assessment of data feed itself.Such as, following situation is possible: before use data feed fills customizable advertisement, based on quality and the operation of conjunction rule, customizable advertisement and data feed are considered as effectively separately, but after use data feed fills customizable advertisement, the advertisement obtained does not conform to rule or invalid (such as, do not meet the clause of service or comprise grammar mistake).
If content item modifier 122 determines that the particular combination of data feed is when being used for causing when filling specific customizable advertisement not conforming to rule or invalid advertisement, then for advertiser provides, content item modifier 122 can point out that obtained advertisement has been regarded as not conforming to rule or invalid reason and/or advertisement and can be adjusted to the information of closing rule or effective mode.
Content item modifier 122 can take action to the distribution of the customizable advertisement preventing from not conforming to rule.In some embodiments, content item modifier 122 can fill customizable advertisement to prevent distribution by preventing a part for particular feed or feeding to be used to.Such as, suppose that specific customizable advertisement is regarded as not conforming to rule when using from the content of the particular row of data feed to fill.In this example, content item modifier 122 can prevent this particular row of data feed to be used to fill this specific customizable advertisement.As an alternative, content item modifier 122 can use default content (content such as, used when not having adaptation function to be satisfied) to replace the content of this particular row from data feed.
If the specific part of feeding to be advised or the quantity (or part) of specifying of invalid advertisement is associated with not conforming to, then can forbid this specific part of data feed, thus prevent this specific part of data feed to be used to any customizable advertisement of filling.Similarly, if particular feed to be advised or the quantity (or part) of specifying of invalid advertisement is associated with not conforming to, then can forbid this particular feed, thus prevent these data to be used to fill customizable advertisement.
If there is the specific content combinations from feeding causing not conforming to rule or invalid advertisement, then content item modifier 122 can safeguard the index of those content combinations of mark.In some embodiments, content item modifier 122 assesses based on the content combinations of index the customizable advertisement using feeding to fill.Such as, suppose that the advertisement of the previous evaluation using particular feed to create is regarded as not conforming to rule owing to comprising phrase " clause _ A clause _ B ".In this example, content item modifier 122 or another data processing equipment can assess each customizable advertisement using particular feed to fill, to determine whether customizable advertisement comprises phrase " clause _ A clause _ B ".If identify this phrase in customizable advertisement, then can prevent the distribution of customizable advertisement.
The assessment advertisement caused due to the filling of customizable portion and promotion of taking action based on this assessment do not conform to the mark of rule or invalid advertisement, and need not assess each content combinations based on the content provided by each available feeds.Therefore, be selected as those content combinations of filling customizable advertisement by means of only assessment is actual, decrease (such as, relative to each possible combination of assessment) mark and do not conform to the computational resource of advising or required by invalid resource.

Mark has the customizable advertisement (304) of the distribution parameters matched with user context data.Customizable advertisement is the advertisement comprising one or more variable, and this one or more variable is resolved based on user context data.Such as, as above with reference to Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B discuss, customizable advertisement can comprise the variable as the placeholder for content, and this content is based on user context data and specified the assessment of the adaptation function for customizable advertisement to be inserted in advertisement.
In some embodiments, customizable advertisement is selected based on the search inquiry determining to be identified by user context data with matching for the distribution keyword of customizable advertisement.Such as, the specific customizable advertisement supposing to be used for hotel chains uses distribution keyword " hotel " to control the distribution of customizable advertisement.In this example, when user context data comprise equipment for indicating user have submitted the data of search inquiry " hotel " time, customizable advertisement is distributed qualified.As above with reference to described by claim 1, existence can be regarded as and other search inquiries distributed keyword " hotel " and match.
Additionally or alternatively, customizable advertisement can be selected based on determining that one or more user property matches with the distribution parameters for customizable advertisement.Such as, suppose when subscriber equipment is positioned at the specific range of business position of advertiser, except the distribution keyword matched with search inquiry, the specific collection that advertiser has requested advertisement is distributed.In this example, if the distance to a declared goal that subscriber equipment is not positioned at the business position of advertiser or the search inquiry submitted to by user and the crucial word mismatch of distribution for the specific collection of advertisement, then this specific collection of advertisement will not have qualification to distribute.Therefore, based on user context data, different customizable advertisements can by selection towards different user's groups.
In some embodiments, the distribution parameters (306) for customizable advertisement is adjusted alternatively based on user context data.The adjustment of distribution parameters can comprise and adjusts bid for customizable advertisement based on user context data.The adjustment of bid can be satisfied based on bid change condition.Bid change condition can specify one or more attribute, and this one or more attribute will trigger the change being used for the bid of customizable advertisement when being included in user context data.
Such as, suppose that advertiser specifies when user context data designated user is arranged in the city identical with the business position of advertiser, the bid for customizable advertisement should be doubled.Further hypothesis advertiser specifies when user context data designated user is not arranged in the city identical with the business position of advertiser, and bid should not be adjusted.In this example, when user context data indicating user is arranged in the city identical with the business position of advertiser, the bid for advertisement will be doubled (that is, being set to the value of specifying).
Other bid change conditions can also be specified for customizable advertisement.In some embodiments, advertiser can specify variable bid, this variable bid based on the business position of user distance advertiser distance and change.Such as, advertiser can specify best bid, and instruction bid should reduce pro rata with the distance of the business position of user distance advertiser.In this example, advertiser is by for being positioned at the business position of advertiser (such as, geodata based on being included in user context data) the distance of specifying in (such as, in its 5 miles or with it, being positioned at same city) user pay up to maximum bid.But, in order to the price paid to user's distributing advertisement reduces based on user to the distance of business position.
Specify the data of bid change condition to be included in data feed, and the adaptation function similar with the adaptation function described above with reference to Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B can be used to identify in data feed and should be used to revise the part of bidding.Therefore, advertiser can specify variable bid standard for multiple different advertisement by creating the data feed that comprises bid change condition and making data feed can be used for content item modifier 122 and/or content delivering system.In addition, advertiser can change condition by making a change the bid adjusted for multiple different advertisement to data feed, instead of must change bid change condition individually for using data feed to evaluate the price-reform each advertisement become in the advertisement of condition.
Update Table is selected for the variable (308) of resolving and being included in customizable advertisement.As above with reference to described by Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B, Update Table can be selected according to the adaptation function for customizable advertisement creation.Each adaptation function can specify particular community, and the specific part be selected as the Update Table of customizable advertisement must be designated (or can obtain based on user context data) in data feed by this particular community in user context data.Such as, suppose that specific matching function is specified when user is in 20 miles of the business position of advertiser, the specific part of data feed will be used to resolve variable.In this example, when user context data equipment for indicating user is at 50 miles per hours of the business position of distance advertiser, the specific part of data feed will not be used to resolve variable.
In some embodiments, adaptation function (or other Update Tables select attribute) can specify the adaptation function effective time period.Such as, if the online customer service of advertiser is chatted as the morning 8 of MONDAY to FRIDAY is available to evening 8, then the adaptation function making chat initiation link be inserted in advertisement can be only effective to evening 8 in the morning 8 of MONDAY to FRIDAY.Especially, adaptation function can specify current time (such as, receiving the time of ad-request) at adaptation function by time period of specifying of being satisfied.Alternatively, can with make be fed to part can only during the time period of specifying can mode to construct data feed.
Additionally or alternatively, the part be selected as in data feed for the Update Table of customizable advertisement can based on the performance measurement of each several part for data feed, and each several part of data feed had previously been used to resolve the variable for customizable advertisement.In some embodiments, can based on presenting for specific customizable advertisement the performance measurement that summary data determines specific customizable advertisement.For independent the presenting of customizable advertisement, summary data specifies user context data for previous advertisement request in response to presenting which customizable advertisement.Present for each, summary data is specified performance data also, and whether this performance data designated user occurs with the mutual of the advertisement presented.Such as, whether performance data can be clicked in presented advertisement and/or is hovered over above presented advertisement by pointer and continue at least minimum fixed time section by designated user.In some embodiments, performance data or alternatively can also specify in user and whether performs with the mutual user afterwards of the advertisement presented the action forming and change.
Summary data may further include variable resolution data, the Update Table that this variable resolution data is specified the variable of the customizable advertisement of replacement and is inserted into.Such as, variable resolution data can specify row and/or the row of the data feed for resolving each variable.Alternatively or additionally, because data feed can change in time, so variable resolution data designated identification can be inserted into the data of the actual content in customizable advertisement.
In some embodiments, for the Update Table collection of each uniqueness of the variable being used to resolve customizable advertisement to determine performance measurement.Such as, suppose that two different Update Table collection are used to resolve the variable for customizable advertisement.In this example, can determine independent performance measurement based on presenting corresponding performance data with those of advertisement for the Update Table collection of each uniqueness, unique Update Table collection is used to the variable of resolving customizable advertisement.
Performance measurement can be used to select Update Table, such as, when user context data meets multiple different adaptation function.Such as, the candidate modifications data for resolving variable can be identified as by each proper subclass in the different proper subclass of the data feed of adaptation function reference.In this example, the candidate modifications data being selected as Update Table can be have the candidate modifications data set that peak performance measures (or at least having threshold performance measure).The performance measurement of Update Table can be clicking rate, another performance measurement of conversion ratio or the advertisement when using Update Table filling to utilize it to select.
Performance measurement can be specified further on every user's context basis.In some embodiments, the appointment based on every user's context of performance measurement can comprise and determines that specific unique Update Table collection is used to resolve variable in response to the ad-request of the user context data collection of the different uniqueness of appointment two.Such as, the device type of will be specified by user context data for selecting the adaptation function of Update Table not specify requirement is supposed.Further, suppose that the identical Update Table collection of being specified by adaptation function is used in response to the ad-request from mobile device and table top device to resolve variable.In this example, can present to mobile device the first performance measurement determining Update Table collection for advertisement, and present to table top device (such as, not being designated the equipment of mobile device) the second performance measurement determining Update Table collection for advertisement.Therefore, performance measurement can be determined on every user's context basis.
Such as, these performance measurements can be used to select for the Update Table of customizable advertisement or provide to advertiser with the form of the operable report of advertiser, to determine whether they want to revise their advertising campaign.In some embodiments, when user context data meets two adaptation functions, every user's context performance measurement can be used to determine which Update Table collection will be selected to revise customizable advertisement.Such as, suppose that specific user context data collection meets two adaptation functions, but user context data comprises the adeditive attribute not required by any one in these two adaptation functions.In this example, except those attributes required by adaptation function, the attribute not required by two adaptation functions can be used to identify the every user's context performance measurement for Update Table.Conversely, the Update Table collection with the highest every user's context performance measurement can be selected as the Update Table that will it is utilized to resolve variable.
Update Table is used to revise customizable advertisement (310).As above with reference to described by Fig. 2, Update Table can be inserted into the variable replacing in customizable advertisement being included in advertisement.
Customized advertising (312) is provided in response to ad-request.The subscriber equipment that customized advertising can be provided to request advertisement or the content delivering system managed to subscriber equipment distributing contents.
