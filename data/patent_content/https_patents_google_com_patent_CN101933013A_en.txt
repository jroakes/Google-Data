Some current systems allow the user that file is moved on to synchronization folder, and it can be used to transmit file between two or more clients.Yet in order to make this synchronous generation, these systems may need clear and definite user action.In this case, even the user has visited file recently, can not make this document synchronous, unless the user moves on to synchronization folder with this document yet.In addition, when file and external client are synchronous, may be difficult to externally locate this document on the client.In some cases, this document may be arranged in synchronization folder on the external client with a plurality of other files.Even the user can remember synchronization folder and where be positioned at that it also may be difficult externally navigating to the file that is transmitted on the client concerning the user.
Summary of the invention
This document discloses the user who helps calculation element and has joined the method and system of sharing and seek data on these devices.
In one aspect, a kind of method has been described.This method comprise use first client receive the indication user that carried out with the incident first file associated action.This action is with that first file is sent to another client is uncorrelated.This method also comprises: use first client to extract the metadata that content and generation are associated with described content automatically from first file in response to described incident, if and peer client and first client current moving and on network mutually as seen, then use first client that content and metadata are sent to peer client.After the reception incident, determine the time of transmitting automatically.
In one example, can be that file access or file are preserved with transmitting the incoherent action of file, and can be the copy of the content of the copy of file or file from the content that first file is extracted.This method also can comprise: be configured to content is sent to the indication of the client of the request of sending from the server reception server; And if it is current not and the networking of first client to have received indication and peer client, then content and metadata is sent to server.In some implementations, this method further comprises from server receive to require, this requirement is satisfied in the location metadata and selects and this metadata associated content is used to be sent to peer client.Requirement can comprise timestamp value or data bit value.In addition, this method can comprise in response to a plurality of incidents that take place on first client uses first client to extract additional content from a plurality of files, and based on one or more priority algorithms of the order of specifying additional content to be transmitted additional content is sent to peer client.
In another example, content and metadata are sent to peer client can be comprised: content and metadata are sent to server; First client is configured to content and metadata are sent to the indication of peer client from the server reception server.Content and metadata are sent to peer client can be comprised content and metadata are sent to second client.First client receives the indication that second client is configured to content and metadata are sent to peer client from second client.This method may further include: before content is sent to peer client it is carried out index, so that the one or more symbols that are included in the content are formatted as the key that can be used for discerning this content; And the generation that is independent of incident is extracted content from second file; Content from second file is carried out index; And the content of institute's index is sent to peer client.
In another example, extract content from first file and can comprise that the content with first file is converted to HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) or text.In addition, the content of extracting first file can comprise the copy of first file that generates the source document form that keeps first file.This method can also comprise: if the network that receives between first client and peer client in first client connects the indication that has above the bandwidth of bandwidth value, then increase the handling capacity threshold value, this handling capacity threshold value is used to be limited in content transmitted amount between first client and the peer client.In some implementations, this method is included in content is sent to and the expiration day is associated with this content before the peer client.In other realization, this method comprises: if deleted content from first client, then transmission is used for deleting this requests for content from peer client.
In aspect second, a kind of computer system with one or more servers has been described.This system comprises: the table manager module is used for receiving the user to the indication of file execution with the incoherent action of transmission of this document from first client.This indication comprises from this document content of extracting and the metadata values of distributing to this content.This system also comprises: tables of data is used to store content and the metadata values of extracting from the file on first client; Interface, be used for from second client receive to the request of one or more metadata values associated content in the metadata values scope of appointment; And the selection module, if be used for the metadata values that is associated with content in the metadata values scope of appointment then initiate the transmission of content to second client.
In one example, metadata values can comprise the timestamp when action that indication is carried out file takes place, and the metadata values scope comprises the successive range of the timestamp value of indicating a period of time.This system also can comprise movable client side list, and it comprises the identifier of client, and wherein interface receives requests for content from described client in the preset time section.The table manager module send be used for removing the delete command of content from tables of data before, the table manager module use the client side list of described activity to determine whether content to be sent to the client of all activities of listing.This system can comprise the space quota, and this space quota comprises the quantitative limitation of the storage space of the content that receives being used for, and when exceeding quota, this space quota is used to trigger from the described content of tables of data deletion at least a portion.
In another example, this system can comprise the tabulation of source identifier, an appointment in the described source identifier has received first client of content from it, if before content is sent to second client, content is deleted from tables of data, then use the tabulation of this source identifier to initiate from the first client-requested content.This system can comprise certificate manager, the user identifier that is used for being used for the client identifier of first and second clients and is associated with first and second clients is sent to external server, if be used for being stored in become inaccessible then use of the content of tables of data in the reconstruct content.
In some implementations, this system can comprise the handling capacity threshold value, and it comprises the data quantitative limitation that is received by interface in the preset time section.If the data volume that is received surpasses this threshold value, then interface utilizes this handling capacity threshold value rejection extra content.
In one aspect of the method, a kind of system that is used for shared data on a plurality of clients has been described.This system is included in the event sniffer of first client, is used to receive Client-initiated action associated with the file.This action is with to transfer the file to second client uncorrelated.This system also comprises: at the extraction apparatus of first client, is used for extracting content from described file in response to described incident, and the metadata that is associated with described content of generation; And the device that is used for content and metadata are sent to from first client second client.

Embodiment
Fig. 1 shows and is used on a plurality of client terminal devices sharing and the synoptic diagram of the system 100 of synchronizing content.System 100 can allow the user to use the visit of second computer installation to reside on the copy (or copy of the content of file) of the file on first computer installation.The exchange of the content between computer installation can take place automatically, and this content should be sent to another computer installation without user's appointment.For example, the user can edit the word document files on its home computer.When the user preserves the document, extract the content of the document automatically and send it at work user's computer.When user's document that search has been revised on its working computer after a while, represent this content to the user, even previous not with this word document storage on user's working computer.This can have extra advantage: only transmit user's document of visit recently between user's various computing machines.
In one implementation, when the user in customer end A 102 has carried out file preservation or opening operation, extract customer end A content 108 and send it to server 106 from this document, indicated as arrow 110.For example, the user can preserve text on its home computer.The customer end A content 108 of copy that can comprise user's file automatically sends to server 106.Similarly, when the user uses customer end B 104 to preserve or open the file that is stored on the customer end B 104, extract customer end B content 112 and send it to server 106 from the file that is stored on the customer end B 104, indicated as arrow 114.For example, customer end B 104 can be user's a working computer.Because will be sent to user's working computer from the content of customer end A 102 (for example user's home computer), so the user can visit the file that does not before reside on its working computer.Similarly, user's home computer has the file on the working computer that before only resides on the user now.In the realization shown in Fig. 1, server 106 is used from the effect of the pipeline (conduit) of shared file content on user's working computer and home computer.
In another example, customer end A 102 and B104 can exchange web and check history.The user can use the web browser that is installed on the customer end B 104 (for example user's working computer) to check the website.When accessed web page, this visit can trigger the extraction of the content (such as the copy of HTML code) of webpage.The information of being extracted can be sent to server 106 from customer end B 104 then.Customer end B content 112 can be retained in server 106, upgrades up to customer end A 102 contact server 106.After customer end A 102 was connected to server 106, server 106 can be sent to the content of webpage customer end A 102 (for example user's home computer).
After a while, the user can use such as Google
TMThe search that WDS is used should be used for the content of locating web-pages.The text in the website of checking at work from him that the user can import that he remembers is (such as " Google expands its desktop role for example! (Google Expands ItsDesktop Role! ) ").Research tool can use the web page contents of the original location of this article from user's Work machine transmission.
Fig. 2 show according to the realization shown in Fig. 1 be used on a plurality of client terminal devices share and the sequence chart of the illustrative method 200 of synchronizing content.When incident took place, processing can begin in step 202.Incident can be sent the signal that has moved, preserves file or document, accessed web page or opens file such as the user.For example with reference to figure 1, can on its home computer, edit and preserve its resume the user of customer end A 102.This action can generate the incident that is detected by event sniffer.
In step 204, utilize the content update index.For example, after the incident that detects by action triggers, can extract content from the file that is associated with this action.The content of being extracted can be included in be saved, text or image in the accessed or file that is modified.In some implementations, extraction can comprise format conversion.For example, extraction apparatus can be the text of plain text or HTML (HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)) form with the text-converted of the file of PDF.Can use the content of being extracted to upgrade with this content and metadata or from the keyword of content then is linked or associated index.In some implementations, metadata is to specify the timestamp that when detects action.For example, timestamp can reflect the time of preserving file, and extraction apparatus can be received this time chain the content that is extracted when preserving file.In some implementations, use is included in Google
TMIndex during WDS is used generates index.This search is used and can be used this index to be positioned at content on the user's computer.
In step 206, will deliver (post) to server by the content that client is extracted.Content is to treat Sharing Information on other computing machine of user.For example, the content of being extracted can be the customer end A content 108 that customer end A is sent to server 106.Customer end A content 108 can be the text version of the resume preserved on its home computer of user.The resume text is sent to server 106.In addition, also the metadata (such as the time of preserving resume) of describing content can be sent to server 106.In step 208, will be from initiating content stores that client receives on server.
In step 210, will upgrade reception at the table of server maintenance with instruction content.For example, in Fig. 1, server 106 utilizes it to upgrade database table from customer end A 102 the customer end A content 108 that receives and any corresponding metadata of describing content 108.Step 210 can be finished and be used to make the easier processing for the treatment of with other client shared content of interim storage.
Can execution in step 202 arrive step 210, so that the interim storage of the content that is derived from any client to be provided.For example, with reference to figure 1, can come execution in step 202 to arrive step 210 to the transmission of server 106 about the customer end B content on customer end B 104 112 and this content.
In step 212, second clients poll is illustrated in the renewal of the content that other client generates.For example, with reference to figure 1, customer end B 104 can be to the new content of server 106 polls.At this, new content can be to be stored on the server 106 but the customer end A content 108 that is not also received by customer end B 104 (for example resume text).
In step 214, receive polling request by server.For example, in Fig. 1, server 106 can receive polling request from customer end B 104.
In step 216, it is obtainable that server upgrades to poll client instruction content.For example, in Fig. 1, server 106 is not downloaded the resume text as yet to customer end B 104 notice customer end B 104.Server 106 should be based upon on the basis that is stored in the timestamp in the table in cognition (knowledge).Timestamp is corresponding from the content (for example resume text) that customer end A 102 receives previously with server 106.The timestamp that server 106 can specify this content when to be sent to server 106 is compared with the time range that does not receive the time period of new content from server 106 as yet corresponding to customer end B 104.In other words, server can be determined to check at last from customer end B whether another client of back has generated new content.If server 106 is the timestamp in the time range of discovery in appointment in its table, then server B 106 can notify it to have new content to customer end B 104.
In step 218, its content of having upgraded that needs of client-requested.For example, in Fig. 1, customer end B 104 sends request for the customer end A content 108 of omitting to server 106.This request can be based on time range as discussed above.
In step 220, server sends the corresponding content of having upgraded of time range of asking with server.For example, in Fig. 1, server 206 sends to customer end B 104 with customer end A content 108, and wherein the content from customer end A is to generate during the time range by the customer end B appointment.
In step 222, client terminal local ground memory contents.For example, in Fig. 1, customer end B 104 is stored in customer end A content 108 on the local memory storage such as the hard disk in personal computer.
In step 224, client is upgraded its index, with the content that reflects that it receives from another client via server.For example, in Fig. 1, customer end B 104 is upgraded index (such as by Google
TMThe index that desktop uses), to reflect the customer end A content 108 of its reception.
Fig. 3 is the block diagram that illustrates in greater detail the system 100 in Fig. 1.System 100 comprises customer end A 102, customer end B 104 and server 106.The employed computing machine of customer end A 102 and customer end B 104 each expression user comprises the personal computer of for example staying at home, computing machine at work and such as laptop computer, PDA and cellular portable computer.Server 106 can work to make the synchronous easier interim memory location between user client.After being changed on the customer end A 102, customer end A 102 is shipped to server 106 with customer end A content 108 in content.For example, when the user preserves file or document or when it checks webpage, the delivery of the content 108 of customer end A takes place.Delivery can take place with set time interval, and for example per two minutes, and delivery rate and strategy can be configurable.In some implementations, deliver in the relevant time generation of incident that generates with action by the user.For example, delivery can take place in the schedule time after preserving document.
Be stored in the server 106 by server 106 reception customer end A contents 108 and with it.In order to keep it in content of this locality storage and content synchronization from other client, customer end B 104 is periodically sent requests for content 310 to omitting to server 106.Request 310 comprises time range 312 parameters of identification about the scope of the timestamp of the content of omission.In order to make customer end B 104 obtain the customer end A content 108 that server 106 does not send to customer end B 104 as yet, the request of sending 310.In order to satisfy this request, server 106 uses the copy (if existence) of the content of specified time range 312 location omissions.Server 106 can come locating content by the timestamp that inspection is stored in the table.This timestamp is corresponding from the content that customer end A 102 receives previously with server 106.For example, timestamp can indicate this content when to be sent to server 106 or when this content is generated by client.Server 106 is compared this timestamp with the time range 312 that does not receive the time period of new content from server 106 as yet corresponding to customer end B 104.If server 106 is the timestamp in the time range 312 of discovery in appointment in its table, then server 106 will send to customer end B 104 in the content 314 of the omission in the time range of appointment.The content 314 of omitting comprises that timestamp falls within the content in the time range 312.
The handling capacity threshold value 344 of can using Sync Manager 332 limits the quantity of the byte that client receives or transmit in the time period of appointment.For example, Sync Manager 332 can be to the reception of the maximum throughput rate that exceeds appointment (for example 2Mb in 8 hours) or the client of the request of perhaps internally holding in transmitting transmit error message.The maximum throughput rate threshold value can be configurable.Certificate manager 334 can provide and stop undelegated client to use server 106 to store security feature with request content.Authentication can be based on the system that for example is used to verify user ID and password.Certificate manager 334 can be checked the certificate of client when client is connected to server 106.If client provides invalid certificate, then certificate manager can transmit error message to client.
Customer end A and B102,104 boths can comprise similar assembly, and can accept and transmit content in a similar fashion.For example, two clients can comprise that file 346, html file 348, index 350, event sniffer 352, file are to text/HTML converter 354 and HTTPS client/server 356.HTTPS client/server 356 comprises timestamp 358, and this timestamp can be used for the web page contents of being checked is enclosed it by the label of time of being checked.In addition, timestamp 358 can be attached to each in the content that has generated that is sent to server, thereby the transmission time that is associated with this content is provided.
Fig. 4 shows the peer-to-peer network that is used to use mixing and client/server architecture is shared and the synoptic diagram of the system 400 of synchronizing content.In system 400, still can use method customer end A 102, customer end B 104 and client C406 between the content shared of server 106 with the method 200 that is similar to Fig. 2.The peer-to-peer network aspect of system 400 is condiment of direct content shared between client 102,104 and 406, thereby walks around server 106.Direct content sharing between peer client can be utilized the available resources ability in client, thereby reduces the bandwidth traffic at server 106.Server 106 still can be used from provisionally the effect that (or for good and all) stores the dropbox of the client X content 410 that is derived from any client 102,104 or 406.For example, if this specific client is an off-line when carrying out attempting for the first time that new content is delivered to specific client, then can use the dropbox of server 106 or storer, capacity.Though Fig. 4 does not illustrate clear and definite arrow between client C406 and server 106, client C406 can communicate with mode and the server 106 that is similar to customer end A or the employed method of B.
Fig. 5 shows the peer-to-peer network of the mixing that is used to use Fig. 4 and server architecture is shared and the sequence chart of the illustrative method of synchronizing content.When the incident of generation, handle and in step 502, to begin.This step 502 can be similar with the step 202 of Fig. 2, the wherein action of carrying out in response to the user (such as preserving file or document, accessed web page or opening file or use) and generation incident.For example, with reference to figure 4, can on its working computer, edit and preserve document the user of customer end A 102.
In step 504, with index upgrade, to be reflected in event in the step 502.For example, with index upgrade, with the version of preserving recently of reflection user's document.Such as Google
TMThe search of desktop is used and can be made index of reference be positioned at the copy of the content of file on the client or file.
In step 506, the content that will initiate on client is shipped to server.Content can comprise the copy of the document (or content of document) that the user preserves and descriptor (such as the type of data, Qi Yuan, its when be saved with and when be posted to server) metadata.For example, with reference to figure 4, the HTTPS client/server 326 of customer end A 102 can be delivered the HTTP that comprises client X content 410 order and be sent to server 106.
In step 508, server stores is from initiating the content that client receives, and with this content propagation to second client.For example, in Fig. 4, server 106 is stored in client X content 410 on the memory storage, then client X content 410 is sent to customer end B 104.
In step 510, the content stores that will receive from server is on the local memory storage of second client.For example, with reference to figure 4, its client X content 410 that receives from server 106 of customer end B 104 storages.
But in the embodiment of alternative, step 506 can be shipped to content peer client rather than server, shown in the dotted arrow that points to step 510 from step 506.This embodiment can back-up system 400 architectures by content directly is shipped to peer client the peer-to-peer network aspect.For example, with reference to figure 4, client X content 410 directly can be sent to customer end B 104 from customer end A 102, thereby walk around server 106.In " daisy chain (the daisy chain) " of peer-to-peer network client, second client can be initiated and be sent straight to content on first client, the latter and then with content propagation to the three clients or the like.And, in some implementations, content can be sent to second client from first client, and be sent to the server that distribution of content can be arrived other client then.A possible advantage using " daisy chain " technology of being somebody's turn to do is to upload data by entrusting between a plurality of clients or server, rather than require single client that content uploading is sent the client or the server of request to all, save user's upstream bandwidth.
System 400 can use multiple algorithm or the regular use of optimizing for synchronizing content resource needed between various peer client.Because may be limited on the server 106 and the bandwidth on client 102 and 104, and user action may once transmit or ask lot of data, so content sharing may lag behind requirement.For example, the user may be stored in very large document (for example service manual) on the customer end A 102, and after the short time, same user empties digital camera on customer end B 104.On the same day, the user may go work and upgrade little office p.m.entry on client C406.Though server 106 can receive the content of all three data item by its order of user capture, server 106 also can be by distributing priority to come the deal with data item for it.Server 106 can at first be handled the data item of higher priority, and the data item of preserving lower priority after a while.In one implementation, priority based on such as its size, type or the time age (age) attribute, its each all be associated with score value.Can distribute higher priority to lower combination score value.For example, little document (p.m.entry of for example handling official business) will receive lower score value based on size, thereby have higher priority.Similarly, big document (for example service manual) and digital photograph will receive higher score value (and lower priority).Data item the time also will influence its priority age, give the data updated item with higher priority.The type of data item also can be used to calculate its priority, because for example working environment can place higher priority the relevant data item of work (such as by Microsoft Word
TMThe document that generates) on.In some implementations, each in the client all uses priority algorithm to determine when content from this client transmissions to server or another client.
A kind of priority formula of realizing can be expressed as 1000*log
N(s) sqrt (t/K)/B_{ type }, it is explained as follows: will distribute 1000 basic priority to data item.This basis priority multiply by the square root of the Measuring Time (scaled time) when it is generated.This is used for improving significantly the priority of very new data item.This priority multiply by log
N(s) (is the logarithm of the S at the end with N), wherein N is that constant and s are that file is the size of unit with kilobyte.By this way, little file will obtain to have precedence over the priority of big file, yet big file can not be pulled to the rear portion that is positioned at after too the leaning on of priority list, because this factor is not linear.At last, can use constant " increment factor (boostfactor) " B based on the type of data item.Increment factor is defaulted as 1, but it can be different (for example B_{ms-office}=2) for the data of different types item, and wherein ms-office represents MicrosoftOffice
TMDocument.
Fig. 6 shows that the client that is used at off-line becomes the peer-to-peer network of the mixing of using Fig. 4 when online and server architecture is shared and another sequence chart of the illustrative method of synchronizing content.In this case, automatically to detect concrete client be off-line in system 400.In one implementation, can be by to make client by the client monitors poll be online or the determining of off-line.If do not receive request, suppose that then client is an off-line from client.Similarly, server 106 can maintain customer end ID and each client be online or the table of off-line.When client becomes when online, it can notify it to server 106 is online, and server 106 can upgrade the table of its client with presence.
When the incident of generation, handle and in step 602, to begin.This step 602 can be similar to the step 202 of Fig. 2, the wherein action of carrying out in response to the user (such as preserving file or document, accessed web page or opening file or use) and generation incident.For example, with reference to figure 4, can on its working computer, edit and preserve document the user of customer end A 102.
In step 604, upgrade index, to be reflected in event in the step 602.For example,, upgrade index, with the version of preserving recently of reflection user's document with reference to figure 4.Index can be located file at an easy rate on client.
In step 606, the content that will initiate on first client is shipped to second client, thereby initiates peer-to-peer network content stream.Content can comprise the copy of the document that the user preserves and data of description type, generate the client and the metadata of last reformed time of data of data.For example, with reference to figure 4, customer end A 102 sends to customer end B 104 with client X content 410, wherein with content 410 with the source that comprises content (customer end A 102) with and the metadata of time of being generated transmit.
In step 608, second client stores is from initiating the content that client receives, and the user who makes in second client can check the document of creating in first client.In this step, second client also arrives server with content propagation.In some implementations, if the 3rd client (for example client C) is online, then second client directly propagates into the 3rd client with data, but under this situation, the 3rd client is an off-line, and therefore content is sent to server is used for interim storage.For example, in Fig. 4, customer end B 104 is stored in client X content 410 on its local memory storage, then client X content 410 is sent to server 106.If client C is online, then customer end B 104 can directly propagate into client C406 with content; Yet client C406 is an off-line, and therefore alternatively customer end B 104 arrives server 106 with data dissemination.
In step 610, the content stores that will receive from second client is on the memory storage of server.For example, with reference to figure 4, server 106 is stored in it memory storage 330 from the client X content 410 that customer end B 104 receives.
But the embodiment of the alternative of step 606 walks around second client and data is directly sent to server, shown in the dotted line that points to step 610 from step 606.For example, with reference to figure 4, client X content 410 directly can be sent to server 106, thereby walk around customer end B 104.Server 106 can be sent to content the peer client such as the remainder of customer end B and C then.
Step 612 can become in the 3rd client and takes place after online, and second client and server were initiated and be transmitted to the 3rd client in content on first client time durations is an off-line.In step 612, the tabulation of the content that the 3rd user end to server request is omitted.For example, when client C406 is connected to network such as the linked server of the Internet and other client, the tabulation of the content that client C406 omits to server 106 requests.
In step 614, server is determined the content of omitting in the 3rd client.Can based on the content that has timestamp that is stored in server and expression the 3rd client be off-line and not the time range of the time period of received content make this and determine.For example, with reference to figure 4, server 106 is by determining which content is uploaded to the content that server is determined omission in client 406 after client 406 last contact server.Server can be made this by TS338 was compared with the time of the tabulation of the content of client C current request omission and be determined.Any content of TS between the time of time of the last login of client C and its current login be assumed to be in client C, omit.
Alternatively, the time range by the client appointment can be arbitrarily.For example, beginning and end point that client C can the fixed time scope, described time range be based on not stored content as yet, and do not consider the time of the last login of client C.This can be used in combination with the above-mentioned priority formula of discussing.For example, client can sign in to server, but owing to its given lower priority does not have to download the content of section sometime.After a while, client can be specified this time range that is used to download content, even client has been downloaded and the time range associated content that takes place after the time range of lower priority content.
In some implementations, server 106 can not comprise actual content, but can be included in the tabulation that client C is the content that generates of the time durations of off-line.For example, customer end A may be that the time durations of off-line is visited very large file at client C.The execution of (as previous discussion) because priority algorithm can be not be sent to server 106 with the content of this document.Alternatively, the metadata of description document and its accessed time can be sent to server.It is in the tabulation of the content that generates of the time durations of off-line at client C that this metadata can be included in tracking, is not stored on the server 106 even content is current.
In step 616, server is the 3rd client (for example client C) of off-line before the tabulation of the content of omitting is delivered to.The tabulation of the content that identification is omitted comprises the metadata of client source of the content of type, the time range that is associated with the visit or the transmission of data and the omission of describing the data of omitting.For example, with reference to figure 4, server 106 sends it to client C406 can be from the tabulation of the content of server or the omission that directly obtains from the source client.
In step 618, the 3rd client uses its tabulation that receives from server to determine that it can be from the content that where obtains to omit.The content of omitting may reside on other the peer client, this content can be stored in server or this content can be stored in client and server both.For example, with reference to figure 4, client C406 can determine that it can be by making its content synchronization from customer end A 102 requesting client X contents 410 (it is the content of customer end A in this case).Be used for the current example of Fig. 6, content is to initiate on the customer end A 102 by chance, but client can be from any client-requested content of the copy of content with omission, and does not consider where content is from initiating.
In step 620, the content that the 3rd client is omitted from first client-requested supposes that this moment, first client was online.For example, with reference to figure 4, if the current client C that is networked to of customer end A, then client C406 is from customer end A 102 requesting client X contents 410.The content of being asked is based on and resides on the customer end A 102 rather than resides on the corresponding time range of timestamp of the content on the client C406.
In step 622, first client offers the 3rd client with the content of omitting.For example, with reference to figure 4, customer end A 102 sends to client C406 with client X content 410.
But in the embodiment of the alternative of step 620, first client can be an off-line when the content that the 3rd client-requested is omitted.In this was realized, the 3rd client can obtain the content of omission from another online client.For example, client C406 is to the content 410 of customer end B 102 requesting client A.Certainly, customer end A must be before be sent to customer end B with the content of being asked when customer end A and customer end B are all online, as indicated in step 608.
In step 624, second client sends to the 3rd client with the content of omitting.For example, with reference to figure 4, customer end B 104 sends to client C406 with customer end A content 410.
But in the embodiment of another alternative of step 620, both can be off-lines when the content that the 3rd client-requested is omitted for first and second clients.In this case, the 3rd client can obtain the content of omission from server.For example, client C406 is to server 106 requesting client X contents 410.In addition, client C406 can be to the server requests content, even one or more other client is online.For example, if other client has less available bandwidth with respect to server, then client C can be to the server requests content.
In step 626, server sends to the 3rd client with the content of omitting.For example, with reference to figure 4, server 106 sends to client C406 with client X content 410.
In step 628, the content stores that the 3rd client is received is on the local memory storage of client.For example, with reference to figure 4, the client X content 410 that client C406 is received is stored on the local memory storage of client.
In step 630, with the index upgrade of client, to incorporate into and the corresponding information of searching for of content that is received by the 3rd client.For example, with reference to figure 4, utilize the index that is stored in client C406 with the client X content 410 corresponding information updatings of searching for that receive by the 3rd client C406.With content with after index is associated, be input to when being used for searching for the user interface of application when the user will be present in keyword in the content, such as Google
TMThe search of desktop is used can locating content.
Fig. 7 is the block diagram that illustrates in greater detail in the specific components of the system shown in Fig. 4.As discussed above, system 400 comprises customer end A 102, customer end B 104 and server 106, wherein customer end A 102 and customer end B 104 expression users' various computing machines.Server 106 plays to help the synchronous interim memory location between user client.
When content was changed on customer end A 102, customer end A 102 was shipped to server 106 with customer end A content 108.For example, when the user preserves file or document or when it checks webpage, the delivery of customer end A content 108 takes place.Delivery can take place with set time interval, and for example per two minutes, and delivery rate and strategy can be configurable.Alternatively, then can deliver as long as generate incident such as the action of preserving file.For example, client can be kept with the connection of server and be connected and the just delivery of one-tenth incident in all one's life.In this connection-oriented architecture (no matter connect peer-to-peer network or client to server), each client can be pushed to new data other client rather than wait by the time other client sends the request to the information of omission.
Be stored in the server 106 by server 106 reception customer end A contents 108 and with it.In order to keep it in content of this locality storage and content synchronization from other client, customer end B 104 is periodically sent requests for content 710 to omitting to server 106.Request 710 comprises time range 712 parameters of the scope of the timestamp of discerning the content that is used to omit.In order to make customer end B 104 obtain the customer end A content 108 that server 106 does not send to customer end B 104 as yet, the request of sending 710.In order to satisfy this request, server 106 uses specified time range 712 to locate the copy of the content of its omission, and it will send to customer end B 104 in the content 714 of the omission in the time range of appointment.
Similarly, use the peer-to-peer network architecture, customer end B 104 can be to the content of another client-requested omission.For example, customer end B 104 can be sent requests for content 710 to omitting to customer end A 102.Customer end A 102 can be positioned at the data on its memory storage and send it to customer end B 104 with the content 714 of the omission in the scope at the appointed time.
Customer end A 102 comprises the tabulation 716 of the time range that is associated with content in this locality storage, the tabulation 718 and the renewal timer 720 of the time range that is associated with the content of needs.Time range tabulation 716 and 718 help the content on the customer end A 102 and client that is stored in other and the content on the server synchronously.For example, the content on the customer end A is created, still is stored in to the tabulation 716 of the time range that is associated with the content of storing in this locality corresponding to adding on such as other client of customer end B 106 in the customer end A 102 local contents of creating.Similarly, the tabulation 718 of the time range that is associated with the content of needs and customer end A 102 need the content that obtains corresponding.In the architecture of peer-to-peer network and client/server mixing, can obtain the content of omitting from server 106 or from another peer client such as customer end B 104.When customer end A 102 receives this content, corresponding time range is moved on to the tabulation 716 of storing in this locality from needs tabulation 718.Upgrade timer 720 be used to follow the trail of client when need to be connected to server or other client with the new tabulation of the information that obtains to omit, the tabulation (or content self) of the content of creating recently be provided and connect to download the content that it does not receive as yet.
In some implementations, certificate manager 724 is not included in all elements shown in Fig. 7.For example, manager 724 can not comprise the tabulation of subscription client ID734, because do not use these ID in the authentication in these are realized.Alternatively, subscription client ID734 can be mainly used in which subscriber set of indication and transmit the content that is received.
Fig. 8 show according to the realization shown in Fig. 4 be used on a plurality of client terminal devices share and the process flow diagram of the illustrative method 800 of synchronizing content.For example, can carry out this method by system 400.When a client during to the content in the time range of second client query in appointment, method 800 can begin in step 802.For example, with reference to figure 7, customer end A 102 can be to customer end B 104 inquiries in the content of expression in the time range of at last synchronous time.This time range information can be the subclass of the tabulation 718 of the time range that is associated with contents needs in customer end A 102.
In step 804, determine whether second client is online.For example, with reference to figure 7, system determines whether customer end B 104 is online.If then can be directly obtain the content that needs from customer end B 104.
If the answer in step 804 is for being that then second client provides the content of being asked in step 806.The content that is provided is corresponding with the time range of appointment in step 802.For example, with reference to figure 7, customer end B 104 sends to customer end A 102 with the content of being asked, and wherein customer end A 102 is in local memory contents.
In step 808, the client of received content is upgraded itself and its corresponding time range tabulation of the content that had and is upgraded the tabulation of the content that identify customer end still needs.The time range tabulation is specific for each client in the source of playing content.When from the client received content, from need removing, and this time range added this time range to from this source the tabulation in the content of this locality storage from the tabulation of the content in this source.For example, with reference to figure 7, the tabulation 718 of the time range that is associated with the content of needs has been reduced this time range, and the tabulation 716 of the time range that is associated with the content of storing in this locality has been increased this time range.After step 808 is finished, finish sending to requests for content and content.
If determining of step 804 is that customer end B is not the online content of being asked by the inquiry of first client that maybe can not provide, then execution in step 810.In this case, the content of the first client query server need to obtain.For example, with reference to figure 7, the content that customer end B 104 needs to server 106 inquiries.
In step 812, determine whether server has the content of appointment.If content deleted (for example, because the retention discipline of data, storage quota or unforeseen loss), then it can no longer be present on the server.For example, with reference to figure 7, server 106 is attempted the content that the location needs in storer 722.Use is searched for corresponding to the time range of needed content.For example, server 106 is compared the time range of request with the time stamp T S728 of content in storer 722.If timestamp is in the time range of appointment, then server 106 can satisfy the request of customer end A 102.If content is not in storer 722, then server 106 can be from this content of client-requested of initiating this content.After the content that the server reception is asked, server can be sent to this content customer end A 102.
In-house retention discipline can be stated and can document be kept the limited time (for example 2 years) before document must be destroyed.Last moment between specified retention period, can on client, (may be automatically) delete the document.Each client of system 800 or server can send order with the deletion content corresponding to other client or server.In addition, the metadata that is associated with this content can comprise expiration day or other retention discipline.This metadata can be sent to the client that all send request with content.By this way, the client of received content and metadata can be deleted and rule or expiration day associated content, is not connected to network (and therefore never receiving the order of deleting this content) even receive client behind received content.
Storage quota on the server can the limited subscriber data quantity stored.For example, server 106 can have configurable storage quota for each client of its service.Customer end A 102 (for example user's working computer) can be sent to content server 106, exceeds its storage quota until client.In some implementations, server 106 can have the FIFO system, is used for handling with respect to the quota of client the content that is transmitted of client.If exceed the quota of client, then can accept new content, but can delete the most outmoded content.If can delete content before the received content in another client (for example the user household computing machine of off-line several months), then can force client to obtain content elsewhere.In this example, client (for example user's home computer) can directly obtain content from its working computer.Alternatively, server can and be sent to content the client of the request of sending to the client-requested content that generates content.
Because optimize deletion strategy, server 106 may have been deleted content.Server 106 can comprise the tabulation of all movable clients that are associated with specific user ID.Movable client can be defined in such as the client of contact server in the trimestral preset time section.After server determined the content that is received to be sent to the client that is included in the activity in the tabulation, server can be deleted the content that is received.If inactive client (within the predetermined time not the client of contact server) has transmitted deleted requests for content, the client that server can ask to transmit this content at first retransmits this content.Server can provide this content to previous inactive client then.
If the answer in step 812 is for being, then server provides the content that needs in step 814.The content that is provided is corresponding with the time range of appointment in step 810.For example, with reference to figure 7, server 106 sends to customer end A 102 with the content of needs, and customer end A 102 is in local memory contents and upgrade corresponding to its content that needs with in the tabulation of its time scope of the content of this locality storage.
If the answer in step 812 is not for, then server can send signal with at time request content after a while to first client.
In step 818, server requests second client provides the content of its omission that needs, to satisfy the initial request that receives from first client.In one implementation, server can wait for that it is online detecting second client up to it, sends request then.In another was realized, server can be waited for up to becoming at second server and just send request sometime after online, at first finish the task of higher priority to allow second client.For example, with reference to figure 7, it is online that server 106 waits for that customer end B 104 becomes, and the content of omitting from the customer end B request at last.
In any case server can be located the copy of the content of being asked.For example, with reference to figure 7, system determines whether customer end B 104 is online.If then it may directly obtain the content of needs from customer end B 104.
