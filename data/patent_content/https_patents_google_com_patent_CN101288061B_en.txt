Abstract
Messages of a user are ranked based on metrics derived from user actions with regard to the messages. Groupings of messages, such as conversations or a set of messages that are determined to be similar, may also be ranked. When new messages are received, their interest to the user is estimated based on rankings of messages and message groupings to which the new message is related. The new messages may be made more or less prominent based on the estimated interest to the user.

Fig. 1 illustrates exemplary network environment according to some embodiments of the invention.Network environment comprises one or more clients 102 and message server 104.Client 102 comprises the client application 103 such as web browser or electronic information transmission program.Client 102 can also comprise client assistant 105.Client assistant 105 can be client application 103 or a part that is coupled to the different application of described client application 103.For example, client assistant 105 can be the executable code that is embedded in the webpage, and described executable code is carried out by the client 102 in the environment that provides in client application 103 then.Network environment also comprises the one or more communication networks (one or more) 106 for these assemblies of interconnection.
Client application 103 provides the interface that is used for electronic information (or " message ") interaction to the user of client 102.In certain embodiments, electronic information can comprise email message and/or news group messages.Client application 103 can comprise that web browser or electronic information send program.The example of web browser comprises Internet Explorer and Firefox.The example that electronic information sends program comprises Outlook, Outlook Express, Thunderbird and Eudora.
In certain embodiments, client application 103 is that electronic information sends program.Can send program 103 and/or client assistant 105 in the operation of client executing to message at server end or by electronic information by message server 104.The user is by sending interface and the message interaction that program 103 provides by electronic information.Alternatively, after the message of server 104 storages is copied to client 102, can be from the described message of message server 104 deletions.
In certain embodiments, client application 103 is web browsers.Message remains on the message server 104 and carries out operation to described message by message server 104.The user of client 102 uses the interface (being known as " web mail " sometimes) and message interaction based on web, described message is at described user and be stored on the message server 104, and wherein said user is by web browser 103 and/or the described interface of client assistant 1 05 visits.Simple in order to explain, client application 103 as described below is web browsers, thereby and following embodiment suppose the web mail interface, the wherein operation of carrying out electronic information at message server 104.
Fig. 2 illustrates for the example process of coming the new reception message (or " new information ") of issuing the user is distributed rank value according to the synthetic rank value of session or one group of similar message according to some embodiments of the present invention.In certain embodiments, the message that receives can be email message.When new information is received by message server 104, in order to sort and/or the mark purpose, can distribute rank value to it.Rank value according to the rank value of session under the new information or the one group message similar to described new information is distributed rank value to described new information.Yet should be appreciated that this rank value of distributing to new information can describe further details with respect to Fig. 4 below by how definite rank value replaces with the new information interaction according to the user.
The rank value of distributing makes and can sort according to estimated user interest and/or the described new information of mark as the initial estimation of user to the interest of new information.Message server 104 uses the rank value of distributing to determine whether and should show this new information more highlightedly with respect to other message, or be marked as the user may be to its interested message.Yet, because the user as yet not with the new information interaction, so do not have (about new information) interaction metric with the basis of the rank value that is formed for determining new information.Thereby, distribute the synthetic rank value of session under this new information or the synthetic rank value of one group of similar message to new information; This given rank value is served as the user to the estimation of the interest of new information, up to determining rank value according to the user action about described message.In alternative embodiment, the rank value of the new information that distributes can be between each message that belongs to same session under this new information and/or minimum rank value or the highest rank value between each message similar to described new information, rather than synthetic rank value.
Message at the user can be grouped in the session.Session comprises one or more related news (for example, covering the common theme that belongs to same thought).In a sense, described session is the exchange of the one or more related news between one or more users.In certain embodiments, various piece (such as subject line) that can be by analyzing message and determine to relate to which message and message is grouped in the session.For example, first message with subject line " ABC " can be grouped in the same session with second message with subject line " Re:ABC ", wherein " Re: " shows that described second message is the response of described first message, this is because second message is replying of first message, thereby these two message are relevant.
If new information is not to be a part (204-not) at user's existing session, the set that message server 104 signs constitute at described user's one or more existing message, described message similar to this new information (210).In certain embodiments, this similar massage set can also comprise in advance the message that is sent by the user and the session that is associated with those message.Be identified for the synthetic rank value (218) of this similar message set according to the rank value of the message in this similar message set.The synthetic rank value (214) of distributing this similar message set to new information.
This similar message set comprises the existing message similar to new information.In certain embodiments, according to the content of two message, existing message can be similar in appearance to new information.In certain embodiments, have identical transmit leg according to two message, existing message also can be similar in appearance to new information.In certain embodiments, if similarity is based on content (or content-based at least in part), if so by the represented similarity of similarity mark (similarity score) more than predefined similarity score threshold, so existing message is considered to similar in appearance to new information.Can be according to being that similarity or similarity mark determined in one or more themes that new information and existing message identify after analyzing message, described similarity or similarity mark are content-based at least in part.Those of ordinary skills know, can use for the technology of sign content topic and analyze message.The example of this technology comprises keyword extraction and frequency analysis.Yet the criterion that should be appreciated that above-mentioned similarity only is exemplary and can comprises other criterion for similarity.
If the coupling of the transmit leg e-mail address in two message, new information can be considered to have identical transmit leg with existing message so.In certain embodiments, if in two message the e-mail address (even if different) of transmit leg be mapped to the identical contact person in the user contact lists and the e-mail address that is associated (for example, address book), so described two message also can be considered to have identical transmit leg.
Should be appreciated that the not necessarily part of same session of " similar " message in addition; Message in the session can belong to the single exchange about one or more message of common theme, and but " similar " message may have the similarity (it can be content-based at least in part) more than the predefine threshold value needn't belong to single exchange.If do not find similar message 214, can distribute the acquiescence rank value to new information 214 so.
This synthetic rank value of organizing similar message can be the average rank value of the message in this organizes similar message, is the rank value that weighted mean is come the described message of weighting according to some modes wherein.In certain embodiments, can be according to same weighting in this rank value of organizing each message in the similar message.In certain embodiments, the rank value of message in differently weighting should be organized.For example, than the rank value according to the content message similar to described new information, can be according to higher weighting according to the rank value of the same sender message similar to new information.In addition, for the message similar to new information according to content, can make the rank value standardization of this message according to similarity or similarity mark.Further, can come weighting to be used for the rank value of similar message according to the date and time of message, make to give more to add power to message more recently.Yet should be appreciated that above-mentioned weighting scheme only is exemplary and can uses alternative.
After the synthetic rank value of new information assign sessions or one group of similar message, if there are more new informations (216-is), so described new information is received (202) and is assigned with rank value as mentioned above.If more new informations (216-is not) can not sort according to the rank value that they distribute and/or the described new information of mark so.In certain embodiments, can show that new information comes mark new information (and/or the session under the described new information) by mark, coloud coding or high brightness.In addition in certain embodiments, rank value those new informations more than predefine rank threshold value of distributing of a mark.
In certain embodiments, according to carrying out in the certain operations shown in Fig. 3 with above-mentioned different order.For example, can before any processing shown in the execution graph 3, receive a plurality of message.Similarly, in certain embodiments, can sort existing message and new information together and orderization.In certain embodiments, with existing message branch come the ordering and the order new information.In addition, if new information belongs to session, so can be according to the described session of resequencing of the order of described new information.For example, in session list, the session meeting with new information of high rank value shows more highlightedly than the session of the new information with low rank value or sorts.
In certain embodiments, the transmit leg of message can arrange importance or the priority of message.When new information be received, be assigned with rank value and be sorted/during mark, message server 104 can be considered by the set importance information of transmit leg or ignore these indications fully.Be to consider or ignoring importance information can be the option that this reception user can select.For example, if consideration importance information, importance information (for example can be converted into a value so, high importance value of being converted into 1, normal importance is converted into 0, and low importance is converted into-1), and this value can be used as the plus or minus coefficient about rank value that new information distributes.
Fig. 3 illustrates for according to coming to the exemplary embodiment of distributing rank value at user's new information at user's existing session and at the synthetic rank value of one group of message of described user according to some embodiments of the present invention, wherein said new information belongs to described session, and described one group of message is similar to described new information.In certain embodiments, if new information belongs to session, and the message that existence is similar to described new information can use the synthetic rank value of described session and this similar massage set to determine to distribute to the rank value of described new information in order to sort with the mark purpose so together.
The new information (302) that message server 104 receives at the user.Session under the sign new information, (304) if present.The synthetic rank value of the session under the sign new information, (306) if present.Identify similar to new information, at user's message set (308).In certain embodiments, this similar message set can also comprise in advance the message that is sent by the user and the session that is associated with these message.Describe with respect to Fig. 2 as top, according to content and/or common transmit leg, message can be " similar ".Be identified for the synthetic rank value (310) of this similar message set according to the rank value of the message in this similar message set.Should be appreciated that step 306 is similar in appearance to the step 206 of aforesaid Fig. 2. Step 308 and 310 is respectively similar in appearance to the step 210 and 212 of aforesaid Fig. 2.
In the synthetic rank value that identifies session and after determining the synthetic rank value of this similar message set, determine to distribute to the rank value (312) of new information according to the synthetic rank value of described session and this similar message set.The rank value of distributing to new information can be the weighted mean of the synthetic rank value of described session and this similar message set.Be assigned to new information (314) according to two determined rank value of synthetic rank value.If there is more new information (316-is), they are received (302) and are assigned rank value so as mentioned above.If more new informations (316-is not) can not sort according to the rank value that they distribute and/or the described new information of mark (318) so.With respect to the described process of Fig. 2, should be appreciated that the rank value of distributing for new information can describe further details with respect to Fig. 4 below by determining that according to the user's operation about described new information rank value replaces just as top.
In the process of Fig. 2 and 3, can come to distribute rank value to new information according to the rank value of existing session and/or the rank value of one group of similar message.Yet, may exist do not belong to any existing session part, at user's new information, do not exist (perhaps in certain embodiments, enough similar) similar to new information to have message now yet.In this case, in certain embodiments, in order to sort and the mark purpose, message server 104 can distribute the acquiescence rank value to new information.
The example process that Fig. 4 A and 4B illustrate for the interaction metric of determining message and are used for determining the rank value of message and session according to some embodiments of the present invention.Determine the rank value of message according to one or more interaction metric.Interaction metric is a kind of based on user's measuring the performed predefine action of message.Rank value is the user to the measuring of existing message interest, and this based on the user what action is message carried out and when described user carries out described action.In certain embodiments, can be after about the user of message operation the rank value of definite or updating message.In certain embodiments, can be termly or determine aperiodically or the rank value of updating message.Carry out termly therein among the embodiment that upgrades, message server 104 can be accumulated about the user operation records of message and utilize described the be recorded in time of dispatching or the rank value of upgrading described message at interval.In addition, can still need such as the user and it be taked the message of any action to the periodically updating of other messages application rank value.
In Fig. 4 A, the user carries out action (402) to the message at the user.Described action can be any one in one or more predefine actions.In the illustrated example process, predefined action is opened message to read (or reading described message), and described message is responded, and described message is forwarded to other user, and deletes described message in Fig. 4 A.
If user action is to open message in order to read (404-reads), if opening of being used for so reading is this action first, determine read time (406) so.Read time (read time) is the time interval between the moment that receives message and the user opens described message in order to read moment.In other words, read time is in the time of receiving message and opens described message poor with between the time of reading.Open identical message in order to do not calculate read time reading for follow-up.Read time is stored in (408) in the data structure.
In certain embodiments, in fact do not open under the situation of message the user, user interface for example can be at least a portion content of described message shown in the preview window.Depend on environment, in order to determine read time and the purpose of reading to count, message server 104 can be used as message preview or not be used as is to open described message in order to read.
If user action is deletion message (404-deletion), determine the deletion time (410) so.The deletion time is when receiving message and the time interval of user between when deleting described message.In other words, the deletion time is in the time of receiving message and deletes poor between time of described message.The deletion time is stored in (412) in the data structure.
In certain embodiments, deletion message can be the process of two steps; First " deletion " of message moves on to the warehouse of undesired message to message, for example " refuse depot ", and second " deletion " of message, namely described message from " refuse depot " deletion, for good and all delete described message.In addition, before permanent delet, can recover described message by message is shifted out from " refuse depot ".Thereby message server 104 can be determined the deletion time according to one in above-mentioned two deletion events or another.In addition, do not reflect because from the refuse depot, recover can be used as deletion and be unscheduled event that the user loses interest in to described message or after first deletion described user again to the interested indication of described message, if so recover described message from " refuse depot ", message server 104 deletion time that can reset so.
If user action is that message is forwarded to other user (404-forwarding), if so described forwarding is this action first (414), determine forwarding time so.Forwarding time is when the user receives message and the time interval of user between when transmitting described message.In other words, forwarding time is in the time of receiving message and transmits poor between time of described message.In certain embodiments, for concerning the forwarding subsequently of identical information, do not calculate forwarding time, and when repeatedly transmitting message, determine a plurality of forwarding times in other embodiments.One or more forwarding times are stored in (416) in the data structure.
If user action responds to described message, for example by replying described message (404-response), if so described response is this action first, determine the response time (418) so.Response time is when the user receives message and the time interval of user between when described message is responded.In other words, the response time is in the time of receiving message and is used for poor between the time that described message is responded.In certain embodiments, for subsequently concerning the response subsequently of identical information, calculated response time not, and when the user repeatedly responds message, determine a plurality of response times in other embodiments.One or more response times are stored in (420) in the data structure.
In certain embodiments, can store interaction metric with the message that described interaction metric is associated.In certain embodiments, can be independent of message itself to interaction metric and in separate data structure the identifier of message store.Even if after deleting the message that is associated, can also keep the identifier of message and the interaction metric that is associated at certain hour.
After determining suitable interaction metric, calculate the rank value (422) of message.Can come the calculated for rank value by the whole bag of tricks, described method utilizes interaction metric as input, for example is neural network, support vector machine, decision tree and other statistical learning process.Be used for using above-mentioned interaction metric to determine that an illustrative methods of rank value is linear combination.The example that uses the linear combination of above-mentioned interaction metric can be " (a
*Read time)+(b
*The deletion time)+(c
*Forwarding time)+(d
*Response time) ", wherein a, b, c and d are predefined coefficient (being also referred to as constant).In this example, a, c and d can be negative constants and b is positive constant.In another example, rank value is the contrary linear combination of interaction metric: " (a/ read time)+(b/ deletes the time)+(c/ forwarding time)+(d/ response time) ", wherein a, b, c and d are predefined coefficient or constant.In this second example, a, c and d can be that positive constant and b are negative constants.In general, can be that positive interaction or negative interaction define described constant to the rank value of described message according to each interaction metric.Can also define described constant according to giving how many weightings to each interaction metric.In certain embodiments, bigger rank value is associated with higher interest in the message.
As mentioned above in certain embodiments, the transmit leg of message can arrange the importance information of message.When calculating the rank value of message, can consider the specified importance information of transmit leg (" SSIL (sender specified importance level) " in the following shown formula).For example, can be according to the predefine scheme the importance information value of being converted to, and picture any other interaction metric (metric in determining rank value
i) utilize this value like that, as shown in the following exemplary equation
α wherein
iWith β be predefined coefficient.Consider that when calculating the rank value of message it can be the option (for example, being set to zero or nonzero value by the β in the above equation) that the user can be switched that importance information is still ignored described importance information fully.
After the rank value of determining message, if described message belongs to existing session, can determine or upgrade the synthetic rank value of described session so.In certain embodiments, the synthetic rank value of described session can be the weighted mean of rank value that belongs to the message of described session, comprises the rank value of the message of just having determined.For example, can be according to the rank value of the described message of time weighting of message separately.Being used for based on a time-weighted exemplary arrangement can be how long in the past according to reception message is come exponential damping ground weighting rank value.In alternative embodiment, the synthetic rank value of session can be the simple average (arithmetic mean) of rank value that belongs to the message of described session.That is, each message rank value has equal weighting.
Should be appreciated that the synthetic rank value of determining session is similar to the synthetic rank value of determining one group of similar message, describes with respect to Fig. 2 as top; They all relate to uses the rank value that belongs to the predefine message set to determine combination, wherein can the described combination of weighting.Should be appreciated that in addition above-mentioned weighting scheme only is exemplary and can uses the weighting scheme of replacement.
Should be appreciated that in certain embodiments with respect to the described process of Fig. 4 A, at first user action that is associated with interaction metric separately, some interaction metric, particularly time-based measuring only need to determine once such as top.For example, only need open message first the user and determine read time when reading.In alternative embodiment, the more than one interaction metric value about the same type of action of described message can be determined and store to message server 104.For example, message server 104 can determine to open the read time of identical message at every turn.In another example, message server 104 can determine that read time and user have first read time quantum counting or the number of times of identical message.
Fig. 4 B illustrates the process that wherein can calculate an above interaction metric to the action of same type.The user takes action (432) to message.If described action is to open message to read (434-reads), determine read time (436) so, described read time is stored in (438) in the data structure, and makes and read counting and add 1 (440), it is used for tracking and has opened the number of times of described message to read.If described action is deletion message (434-deletion), determines the deletion time (442) so and it is stored in (444) in the data structure.If described action is to transmit message in order to transmit (434-forwarding), determine forwarding time (446) so, described forwarding time is stored in (448) in the data structure, and makes the forwarding counting add 1 (450), it is used for following the tracks of the number of times of having transmitted described message.If described action is to message respond (434-response), determine the response time (452) so, the described response time is stored in (454) in the data structure, and makes response count add 1 (456), it is used for following the tracks of the number of times that described message has been responded.The rank value of updating message and/or session (458).Can calculate the rank value of message and/or the synthetic rank value of session according to the mode of the step 422 that is similar to above-mentioned Fig. 4 A.The counting multiplication by constants can be top with respect to the additive term in the described linear combination of Fig. 4 A.Can be used for one or more time values of particular type action to obtain be used to a value that is input to above-mentioned linear combination mathematics combination (for example simple average etc.).In the process of Fig. 4 B, for the action of particular type or in the polytype action (for example, reading action and forwarding behavior) each, may there be more than one time-based measurement value.Should be appreciated that in certain embodiments, can determine a time measurement value and a plurality of times are determined in other action some actions.For example, for message, may only exist a read time still to have many response times and forwarding time.
Above-mentioned interaction metric is based on the predefine action, and described predefine action has provided the user to determining other indication of level interested of message.In other words, the user action about message serves as the user to the indication of the interest of described message.For example, very short read time, namely the user just opens message soon to read after receiving, can be that the user is interested in and/or to the interested indication of all message from message sender the content of described message.For example, the very short deletion time, namely the user just deletes message soon after sending, and can be that the user loses interest in to the content of this message and/or to the uninterested indications of all message from described message sender.Yet should be appreciated that above-mentioned predefined action and the interaction metric that is associated only are exemplary and can use predefined action and any combination of the interaction metric that is associated.For example, the tabulation of predefine action can be from by selected one or more actions the following group of forming: open message to read, transmit described message, described message is responded, delete described message, the described message of filing moves to file to message, the described message of mark and manually identify described message.If described action is to open message to read, measure so can comprise one or more read times, when opening message process one or more times (can or can not come standardization according to message-length) and read the counting.If described action be the deletion message, so described measure can be included in receive and delete between (deletion time) time and open first message and the deletion between time.If described action is that message is responded, measure so can comprise one or more response times (measuring from the time of receiving message), response count and open message with read and described message responded between one or more times.If described action is to transmit message, measures so and can comprise one or more forwarding times (measuring from the time of receiving message), transmit counting, transmit the number of users of described message and opening described message and transmitting one or more times between the described message to it.In other embodiments, measuring of these actions can comprise and abovely identify the subclass of measuring and can comprise other measuring.
Can also the refinement interaction metric so that being described, the user never visit the fact of its electronic information.Can also in fact can improve the time accessed by the user and/or that can see based on for example interaction metric of read time, deletion time equal time according to described message therein.For example, can regulate read time so as only counting to be when the user logins, when opening electronic information and send program and/or when described message in client application 103 as seen time institute's elapsed time.Regulate the described time and can not the accessed by the user and/or visible time force the situation of " punishment (penalty) " to the rank value of message to prevent from appearing at message wherein.
When determining the rank value of message, because the user does not carry out specific action as yet, so one or more interaction metric may be disabled.For example, if message is not deleted as yet, so described message may not have the deletion time.In this case, message server 104 can use this default value of measuring.For example, measure for time-based, default value can be to receive message and the time interval between the current time, i.e. poor between time of receipt (T of R) and current time.In other words, the time-based value of measuring be exactly since receiving message T.T. of process.For based on the counting measure, the default value of counting can be 0.In certain embodiments, if the user does not carry out any action to message as yet and need the rank value of described message to determine the synthetic rank value of session or one group of similar message, message server 104 can use the acquiescence rank value of message or rank value that use distributes when receiving message to be used as substituting so.
