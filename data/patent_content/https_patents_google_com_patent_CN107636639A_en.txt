Approximate KNN (ANN) searching method.Therefore the disclosure solves the problems, such as the search of complexity with the more preferably degree of accuracy, while only need
Want significantly less time and internal memory.
Fig. 4 is the example mistake for performing search inquiry to the search space strengthened according at least one aspect of the disclosure
The flow chart of journey 400.
Process 400 may begin at 410：Computer, for example, server 120 or client 310 receive object search.
The object search can include inquiry, the inquiry include one or more keywords, image, video segment, via stylus or

Associated other data.After object search is received, server 120 or client 310 can analyze object search
To extract the one or more features or characteristic associated with the object search received in 420.
Process 400 can continue in 430, in 430, based on the object search feature extracted in 420, generation with
The associated one or more object search characteristic vectors of object search.In 440, server 120 or client 310 can be with
For be stored in the search space storage region 128 or 318 strengthened before generation the search space strengthened come
Handle object search characteristic vector.This can include, for example, in view of the linear projection of structured matrix is special to analyze object search
Vector is levied to be identified as the subset that object search characteristic vector provides the high dimensional feature vector of arest neighbors matching.Alternately,
Or in addition, the stage 440 can include identification represent fall object search characteristic vector predetermined threshold distance in feature to
Multiple matchings of the subset of amount.In at least one aspect of the disclosure, in object search vector with being searched via what is strengthened
The distance between characteristic vector of structured matrix linear projection in rope space can be Euclidean distance.Finally, 460
In, the process can retrieve the spy matched enough with object search characteristic vector with being recognized in the search space strengthened
Levy one or more content items of vector correlation connection.Alternately, or furthermore it is possible to by the content item that refer to retrieve
One or more link is supplied to the computer for submitting object search.
As described above, say at least in part, extensive search and retrieval with the associated data of sophisticated computers application
At least one stage in method can utilize linear projection.For given vector, such as, for example,And projection
MatrixLinear projection can be as following in equation (1)Shown in：
H (x)=Rx (1)
It can carry out after this linear projection, among other, for example, quantifying, high dimensional feature is converted to
Using the compact code of smaller internal memory, such as, for example, binary system insertion or product code.The compact code can be binary code
Or non-binary code.This compact code can be used for efficiently performing the search execution time and reduce and various complicated calculations
The associated storage demand of machine application, such as, for example, image retrieval, characteristic matching, Attribute Recognition and object classification etc..Example
Such as, can be used for being converted to by input data for local sensitive hash (LSH) technology of extensive approximate KNN search
Input data is linearly projected before compact code.For example, k- bit-binaries code can meet following equation (2)：
H (x)=sign (Rx) (2)
However, with input dimension d increases, this linear projection operation becomes costly in terms of calculating.In order to examine
Higher recall ratio is realized in rope task, big k long code can be used to cause k=O (d).In this case, the sky of projection
Between and computation complexity be O (d2), and so high projection cost would generally become bottleneck in terms of learning with predicted time.
For example, work as k=d=50, when 000, projection matrix itself may need 10GB (single precision) and project one on single code
Individual vector may require that 800ms.
In at least one aspect of the disclosure, projection matrix can be orthogonal.It is orthogonal transformation be probably it is beneficial, this
It is because among other, it can be with the Euclidean distance between retention point, and it is also known that this orthogonal transformation
Variance can be distributed more uniformly across in dimension.These attributes are good to real world data for making a variety of widely-known techniques
Good perform is important.
Other benefit can be provided using rectangular projection for specific application.For example, orthogonality can meet learning
Farthest learn a kind of means of the target of irrelevant bit when practising the binary code dependent on data.On one kind is realized
The mode for stating this target is by applying orthogonal or nearly orthogonal limitation to projection.Equally, it is embedded in binary system
In, improved result can be realized when performing approximate KNN search by applying orthogonality limitation to projection.
In order to efficiently perform the linear projection of high dimensional data, present disclose provides for according to will be with original unit matrix phase
A series of small cell matrixes are changed into structure by the mode that the relation of association is left the existing relation before matrix transformation
Change method, system and the non-transitory computer-readable medium of matrix.Structured matrix caused by because of transformation can be example
Such as, big single matrix.Alternatively, however, structured matrix can conceptually represent flexible orthohormbic structure matrix
Race.In at least one aspect of the disclosure, the relation of reservation can be and each matrix in this series unit matrix
Associated orthogonality.Alternately, or in addition, the relation retained can be in the character pair vector joined with matrix correlation
The distance between.The distance can be, for example, the Euclidean distance between the character pair vector that matrix correlation joins.
The transformation of cell matrix can be realized by using the Kronecker product of small cell matrix so that space and computation complexity
Generally reduce.The flexibility associated with transformation can promote the change of free parameter quantity in a matrix to adapt to give
The demand of application.
Therefore, at least one aspect of the disclosure can form big structure square by changing a series of small orthogonal matrixes
Battle array constructs orthohormbic structure matrix race.At least one aspect of the disclosure by using a series of small orthogonal cells matrixes gram
Kronecker product promotes above-mentioned transformation.Kronecker projection matrix can meet equation (3)：
In equation (3), Aj, j=1 ..., M is small orthogonal matrix.Small orthogonal matrix Aj, j=1 ..., M can be referred to as
Cell matrix.Big matrix can be associated with least four major advantages according to caused by above-mentioned transformation.First, big matrix meets
Orthogonality limits, and therefore big matrix can retain the Euclidean distance in luv space.Second, similar fast Fourier
The calculating of conversion can be used for calculating projection, and its time complexity is O (dlogd).3rd, by changing the big of cell matrix
Small, caused big matrix can be associated with the change (degrees of freedom) of number of parameters, hence in so that easily control performance with
Speed is traded off.4th, the space complexity of big matrix is O (logd), and the spatial complex of most of other structures matrixes
Degree is O (d).In addition, in various different settings (including for example, binary system insertion and vector quantization), the Kronecker of proposition
It is projected in approximate KNN search aspect and provides the advantage that.
Original vector can be mapped in k- bit-binary vectors by binary system embedding grammar causes h (x) ∈ {+1, -1
}k.This mapping can be denoted as binary code using data point, so as to substantially reduce carrying cost, even if working as k=O
(d) it is also such when.Approximate KNN can be retrieved by using the Hamming distance in binary code space, can be according to
Various modes efficiently calculate the Hamming distance, and the various modes include, for example, using table lookup or in modern computing
POPCNT instructions in frame structure.
LSH can be used for generating the side of binary code according to reservation COS distance and usually using randomization projection
Formula generates binary code.However, it may abandon learning to rely on by optimizing projection matrix R using this randomization projection
The advantages of binary code of data.For example, being shown using the method for iterative quantization (ITQ), project and then make by using PCA
With the rectangular projection of study, caused binary system insertion may surpass non-orthogonal projection or randomized orthogonal projection.Can be with
By replacing between data for projection point and solving projection via SVD to learn to project.However, high dimensional feature is directed to, it is this
Method is probably infeasible, unless dimension is fundamentally reduced, and this damages performance.Utilize promotion Kronecker
The various aspects of the disclosure of the projection of product study can produce the performance capability similar to ITQ, while generally more efficient.
Quantization method can represent data point via the set of quantizing factor, and the set of the quantizing factor can generally lead to
Vector quantization algorithm (such as, for example, k- mean algorithms) is crossed to obtain., can in order to search for given query vector q arest neighbors
To calculate the Euclidean distance between all data points in q and database.The distance of quantizing factor can be arrived by vector
Estimate Euclidean distance.Alternately, or in addition, when data are higher-dimensions, can independently be performed in subspace
Quantify.Chunk can be carried out by quantifying the vector of (PQ) to may result in product, to identify conventional subspace.
The distance between query vector q and data point x can be stated relative to equation (4)：
In equation (4), wherein m is the sum of subspace, x(i)And q(i)It is subvector and μi(x(i)) it is in subspace
Quantization function on i.Because its asymmetric essence, it is only capable of quantized data point, it is impossible to quantify query vector.For raising property
Can, for given data, different subspaces has similar variance.A kind of mode for realizing this effect is by will just
Transformation R is handed over to be applied in data, as stated in equation (5)：
Because projection matrix R is orthogonal, so projection matrix R can retain Euclidean distance.It is not using random
Projection matrix, but projection matrix can be learnt from given data, this is improved retrieval result.However, it is present in this
The method of promotion projection operation before open can with source cost higher in higher dimensional space (for example, processor use, it is interior
Deposit use, perform time etc.) it is associated.
Consequently, because at least the above reason, for binary system insertion and quantifies, it is necessary to be both that orthogonal and can efficiently learns
Fast projection.As described below, these purposes can be by using the relation retained with each corresponding units matrix correlation connection
Transformation algorithm a series of cell matrixs are changed into big structured matrix to realize.The transformation algorithm can include, except
Outside other, projected for example, being generated using Kronecker product.
Kronecker product can be associated with promoting some attributes of above-mentioned transformation.For example, it is assumed thatAnd
AndA1And A2Kronecker product be Meet equation (6)：
In equation (6), wherein, a1(i, j) is A1The i-th row and jth row unit.Kronecker product can also be claimed
For tensor product or direct product.D dimensional vectors can be become dimension as a × b matrixes (ab=d) by operating mat (x, a, b), and vec ()
Can be by the way that matrix " stretching " be formed into vector, and vec (mat (x, a, b))=x into vector.
The multiple characteristics for the advantages of Kronecker product can be with promoting to enumerate herein are associated.For example, retain with
While the relation of original unit matrix correlation connection, at least one subset of these characteristics helps to generate fast orthogonal projection.Promote
Entering two particular characteristics of the Kronecker product of above-mentioned advantage includes
And Kronecker product stick unit matrix orthogonality the fact.That is, if A1And A2All be it is orthogonal, then
It is orthogonal.
According at least one aspect of the disclosure, Kronecker projection matrixMultiple units can be included
The Kronecker product of matrix, such as the following statement in equation (7)：
Wherein, in equation (7),And
A benefit for forming larger matrix in this way is that calculating for Kronecker projection can utilize reduction
Computation complexity.In order to simplify discuss, it will be assumed that R is square, i.e. k=d, and all cell matrixs be also it is square,
With identical rank de.Floating-point operation (FLOP) accurately have estimated the calculating cost of distinct methods.Tieed up assuming that being calculated with FLOP in d
Kronecker on vector is projected as f (d, de), the rank of cell matrix is de.Below Kronecker product is shown in equation (8)
An attribute.
PerformNeed d (2de- 1) individual FLOP (ddeSecondary multiplication and dde- d sub-additions).This
After calculateIt is changed into deMore small-scale problem, each personal characteristic dimension d/deAnd rank
deUnit matrix come calculate Kronecker projection, as in equation (9) reflection.
F (d, de)=d (2de-1)+def(d/de, de). (9)
Based on equation (9), performing the FLOP of the Kronecker projection of d dimensional vectors is
Another the attracting characteristic for helping to promote the Kronecker of the advantages of described herein to project is the spirit of its structure
Activity.For example, by controlling Aj, j=1, M size, can easily balance model number of parameters (accordingly, it is capable to
Power) and calculating cost.In the presence ofIndividual cell matrix, each cell matrix haveIndividual parameter.In Kronecker projection
Number of parameters can beScope is d2(work as deDuring=d) arrive 4log2D (works as deWhen=2).
Hereinbefore, the disclosure is described with reference to example, in these examples, Kronecker projection R and all lists
Variable matrix is all square.However, the disclosure need not be limited so.On the contrary, for example, the disclosure extends also to non-square
Kronecker projects and/or non-square cell matrix.For example, by factorization d and k come the size of selecting unit matrix.Can
Alternatively, either additionally, it is possible to occur that d or k can not be factorized as the situation of the product compared with decimal.It is for example, relative
In input feature vector, dimension can be changed by double sampling or zero padding.Individually say, for example, relative to output, can make
With longer code and then double sampling.The back of the body in square projection matrix R and non-square projection matrix is discussed further below
The generation that Kronecker projects under scape.
According to it is unstructured projection, circulation projection, and/or bilinearity projection etc. similar mode, can also give birth at random
Projected into Kronecker.However, the Kronecker projection generated at random improves above-mentioned projection list, because it is suitable for height
Dimension data.
The Kronecker projection generated at random can apply to binary system insertion and quantify.These of Kronecker projection should
With unstructured projection matrix can be replaced (in equation (1) and equation (5) by using the Kronecker projection matrix of randomization
R) realize.
For example, being projected relative to Kronecker, method, system and computer program described herein can generate M
(small) orthogonal cells matrix., can be by creating small random Gaussian matrix and then performing at least one aspect of the disclosure
QR factorization generates cell matrix.For the cell matrix that size is 2 × 2, for example, the Crow of the d ranks of generation randomization
The time complexity of interior gram of projection is only O (logd).This is significant benefit, because, for example, the orthogonal matrix of generation d ranks
The time complexity of unstructured projection is O (d3).Therefore, the Kronecker of randomization is projected as generating the random of high dimensional data
Change projection and provide practicable solution.
According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a kind of system and method for optimizing Kronecker projective parameter are disclosed.It is as follows
What face was explained in more detail, optimized algorithm will be discussed for binary system insertion, quantization, and then can show that binary system will be embedded, quantifies
It can be formulated out and solve the orthogonal general Roc of each cell matrix your this this (procrustes) problem of making a mistake.In order to
Carry out the discussion, it will be assumed that training data X=[x1,x2,...,xN]∈Rd×N.Following discussing first individually solves k=d's
It is assumed that then the situation for expanding to k ≠ d is discussed.
First, solves the problems, such as the binarization loss reduction for being embedded in binary system.Can be as shown in equation (10)
Express optimization problem.
In equation (10), wherein, binary matrix B=[b1,b2,...,bN]∈{-1,1}d×N, and biIt is xiTwo
Carry system code, i.e. bi=sign (Rxi).In addition, Kronecker structure is utilized to R.Equation can be found by alternating minimization
(3) local solution.In the case where R is fixed, based on definition, B is calculated by straight binary.Alternately, it is in B
(we can be discussed below k to fixed and k=d<D situation) in the case of, it is orthogonal general by what is stated in equation (11)
Roc you make a mistake this problem to find R.
Next, for quantifying, it is contemplated that Descartes k averages (ck averages) method.For ck averages, input sample x
It is divided into m sub-spaces, x=[x(1)；x(2)；...；x(m)], and can be quantized to h subcenter per sub-spaces.According to
Example discussed below, it is contemplated that all subcenters have a case that identical fixed basic number.However, the disclosure need not be such
Limit.For example, the disclosure can also be applied to the subcenter set with shifting base in a comparable manner.
Assuming that p=[p(1)；p(2)；...；p(m)], wherein p(j)∈ { 0,1 }h, | | p(j)| | 1=1.In other words, p(j)It is ion
Center x(j)Nearest designator.Assuming thatIt is j-th of subcenter matrix and C ∈ Rd×mhIt is by all sons
The center matrix that (diagonal) cascade of the heart is formed, as stated in equation (12)：
In ck averages, pass through orthogonal matrixAnd block diagonal matrix In parameterizing
Heart Matrix C.The optimization problem of ck averages can be write as equation (13)：
Kronecker structure is applied on orthogonal matrix R using similar alternation procedure.In the case where R is fixed,
Renewal D and P can carry out vector quantization equivalent in every sub-spaces with k averages.The above method be it is efficient, this be because
For because the quantity of the cluster of every sub-spaces is arranged to less number (for example, h=256) all the time, so the quantity at center
It is typically small.R can will be updated as your this this problem of making a mistake of orthogonal general Roc with fixed D and P, such as in equation (1)
Reflection.
Therefore, for methods discussed above, orthogonal general Roc you this make a mistake this problem it is possible that.For utilizing Crow
Interior gram of product and/or the various aspects of the disclosure of projection, the problem can be referred to as the general Roc of Kronecker, and you make a mistake this.Will be
Showing the general Roc of Kronecker below in relation to equation (15), you make a mistake this：
In order to solve optimization above, each cell matrix can be updated using alternative manner so as to find local solution.
It can be rewritten by such as equation 16To start this method.
Second equation is set up, because Kronecker product can retain orthogonality.Therefore, next step can be maximizedBy using the attribute of trace, it can be expressed as equation (17)：
In equation (17), wherein, bi and xi are matrix B and matrix X the i-th row respectively.Can be by once updating one
Individual cell matrix keeps all other cell matrix constant to solve this problem simultaneously.Without loss of generality, renewal Aj is considered,
As shown in equation (18)：
In equation (18), wherein,AndIt is false
If Apre、AnextAnd AjDimension be k respectivelypre×dpre、knext×dnextAnd kj×dj.Moreover, dpredjdnext=d and
kprekjknext=k.
According to the characteristic associated with Kronecker product, the object function Aj in equation (18) can meet：
Assuming thatAnd
Then, equation (19) can be expressed as：
When updating a cell matrix, calculate cost and may be from three different sources.First source, is claimed herein
For S1, the Kronecker product of data is calculated come the cell matrix for fixation of using by oneself.Second source, referred to herein as S2, from meter
Calculate the product of data for projection and code.3rd source, referred to herein as S3, from performing SVD to obtain optimal unit square
Battle array.For the possible larger situation of cell matrix, optimization bottleneck is probably SVD.Alternately, may be smaller for cell matrix
The situation of (such as, for example, 2 × 2), SVD is performed in approximate constant time.Therefore, the main sheet that is calculated as comes from S1 (O
) and S2 (O (Nd)) (Ndlogd).Due to a total ofIndividual cell matrix, so the computation complexity entirely optimized is O
(Ndlog2d)。
In above-mentioned optimization, the Kronecker projection of randomization is used as initializing.For binary system insertion and quantify,
Process of the target based on proposition may be reduced quickly.Gratifying solution can be found in tens iteration.
The above method is discussed based on the situation as k=d.However, various aspects of the disclosure can be used for working as k ≠ d
When situation.For k ≠ d situation, projection can be formed by the Kronecker product of non-square row/column orthogonal cells matrix
Matrix R.In this case, Kronecker product can be with reservation line/orthogonality of columns.For example, work as k>During d, orthogonal general Roc you make a mistake
This optimization problem can be similar to and is equally resolved as k=d.Alternately, for example, working as k<During d, RTR≠I.Therefore, etc.
Second equation in formula (16) is invalid.Therefore,It is changed into：
Can be with by assuming that tr (XTRTRX) be on R it is independent, it is identical with the case of k >=d, to relax the problem.
