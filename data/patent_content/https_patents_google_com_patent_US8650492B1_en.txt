Definitions
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of content. For instance, images, audio, video, and web pages for many different topics are accessible through the Internet. Website owners that provide access to content want to gain insight regarding the performance of various web pages within their website. However, due to growing complexity, a single website can have hundreds or thousands of web pages.
- the amount of traffic information available regarding even a basic Internet transaction can be cumbersome to process for the interested parties.
- Users may visit numerous, different uniform resource locators (URLs), to complete substantially the same types of transactions.
- URLs uniform resource locators
- the website owners may wish to know more about the number of users that actually add a product to an online shopping cart.
- a unique URL may be generated each time a user adds a product to a shopping cart.
- various parties may be interested in how users arrive or depart from certain webpages. For example, one user may perform an Internet search for a specific product, while another user may follow an advertisement link, to arrive at the same product description page. Therefore, the number of traffic paths that users may follow may also be large. For these and other reasons, generating visualizations of the flow of Internet or network traffic is challenging and difficult.
- the method includes systems and methods for generating a navigation flow visualization of network traffic.
- the system and method if configured to receive user input that identifies a node that is a grouping of one or more network resources.
- the method includes generating a visualization data of network traffic flowing into the identified node from the incoming nodes and displaying the network traffic flowing out of the identified node to the outgoing nodes.
- the method includes connecting the incoming nodes with the identified node using one or more connectors, the connectors having a width dimension that is representative of a number of visits from the incoming nodes to the identified node.
- the method includes connecting the identified node with the outgoing nodes using the connectors that have a width dimension that is representative of a number of visits from the identified node to the outgoing nodes.
- a further implementation is one or more computer-readable media having instructions stored therein.
- the instructions are executable by one or more processors to cause the one or more processors to perform operations.
- the operations include receiving user input that identifies a node that is a grouping of one or more network resources.
- the operation includes generating a visualization data of network traffic flowing into the identified node from one or more incoming nodes and displaying the network traffic flowing out of the identified node to one or more outgoing nodes.
- one or more incoming nodes may be connected with the identified node using one or more connectors, the one or more connectors having a width dimension that is representative of a number of visits from the one or more incoming nodes to the identified node.
- the identified node may be connected to the one or more outgoing nodes using one or more connectors that has a width dimension that indicates a number of visits from the identified node to the one or more outgoing nodes.
- the user may be allowed to add incoming nodes with network traffic flowing to the incoming nodes and allowing the user to add additional outgoing nodes with network traffic flowing out of the outgoing nodes.

- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example of a computer system consistent with an illustrative embodiment.
- Navigation visualization provides a graphical representation of Internet or network traffic going into and out of a user chosen node.
- Each node represents one or more web pages that have been grouped together.
- a connector may be used to connect two nodes.
- the relative size of each connector that connects two nodes represents the relative amount of the traffic that traveled from one node to the other node or one webpage to another.
- the connectors may represent the amount of Internet or network traffic and/or other metrics.
- the navigation visualization allows the website owner to choose the starting or ending node and visualize the traffic going into or out of the chosen node. Moreover, the website owner may add certain webpages to the node manually. A website owner may specify whether they wanted to add webpages to the node or remove webpages from the node. A user may further add more nodes to each side of the navigation visualization. Thus, the user may add nodes that have traffic to and from the user identified node. On many occasions, a user may want to see traffic that goes into a node and the traffic that comes out of a node and which other nodes or websites the users that are represented by the traffic visit after passing through the node.
- traffic data may include information as to how a user arrives at a website (e.g., by starting their web browsing at the website, by following a hyperlink from another website, etc.), how a user navigates within the website (e.g., by traversing from a product information page to a shopping cart page, by traversing from a shopping cart page to a purchase page, etc.), and where users go after visiting the website (e.g., by clicking on advertisements, by navigating to other websites, etc.).
- Interested parties can use traffic information to make changes to the website, tailor an advertising campaign a certain way, and perform other functions.
- Interested parties may access various reports and visualizations that convey information regarding user interactions with the content and the flow of traffic through certain websites.
- a traffic analysis tool may aggregate and display traffic data, to assist an interested party in discerning how users interact with various webpages. For example, an advertiser may wish to know the percentage of users that actually click on an advertisement or how many users actually complete a purchase of the advertised product. The analysis and reporting of the traffic data can enable an advertiser to make advertising budget allocation decisions.
- a website administrator may make changes to the website that lead to a greater number of users reaching certain pages or goal of a website.
- the analysis tool may operate to simplify the presentation of information to an interested party about the flow of traffic.
- the analysis tool may aggregate and group certain types of information into “nodes” in the visualization.
- displayed nodes may be “clusters” of URLs and the data relating to the URLs may be aggregated.
- URLs associated with viewing a shopping cart may be aggregated into a single cluster for display on a traffic flow visualization.
- other types of URLs within a particular website may be clustered (e.g., a main page, a search page, etc.) and the traffic or the number of visits between these URLs may also be aggregated.
- nodes may be grouped by determining the uniform resource locator prefix based on a portion of the uniform resource locator item common to the plurality of flow paths representing web page visits.
- the analysis tool may also automatically determine which nodes and flows of traffic are displayed in a visualization, according to various implementations. Aggregated flows of traffic among nodes may still be difficult to follow for a user of the visualization. In some implementations, the analysis tool may use a scoring function to determine whether or not certain paths of traffic are displayed in a traffic flow visualization.

- Performance analysis apparatus 120 may also determine which nodes and traffic paths are displayed in a traffic flow visualization.
- performance analysis apparatus 120 may utilize one or more scoring functions based on the amount of traffic between nodes to determine which traffic paths are displayed. The scoring function may also be based on level weights. For example, each of the traffic paths going from nodes A to B to C may have a level weight of 1, whereas a path that traverses directly from A to C may have a level weight of 2.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration 200 of an example menu 202 that may be displayed for a user.
- the illustration 200 shows controls such as but not limited to, menu 202 , allowing the user to choose the flow direction using inbound button 208 and outbound button 210 , the menu 202 displays a drop box 204 and a text box 206 .
- Flow direction includes choosing between showing the traffic that goes into the selected node selected using an inbound button 208 or showing outbound traffic using outbound button 210 .
- the drop box 212 allows the user to enter a date range or allows the user to select a date range from a visual monthly and/or yearly calendar.
- the user may choose from various filters from drop box 204 . Some of the choices include, but are not limited to, a URL, begins with, ends with, equals, or matches regular expression or “reg exp”.
- the filters may work in different ways such as the “begins with” and “ends with” filters may allow a user to search for URLs or resources that begins with or end with the text typed in the text box 206 .
- the user may choose a regular expression filter and type a Boolean expression to search for resources or webpages.
- the text box 206 may include an auto-complete feature.
- the auto-complete list may be determined based on searching all URLs associated with the user's account, or historic searches performed by the user.
- the auto-complete list may be stored on the user's computer or on a server computer.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example visualization 300 showing network traffic from the user selected URL from the menu from FIG. 2 .
- a user may have entered a URL or other regular expression and selected a webpage or cluster of webpages (node).
- the user may have selected the outbound button 210 to display web traffic that is coming out of the selected webpage(s) or node.
- a user may select any node that is displayed on the screen and choose to see a visualization that is centered around that node, as discussed in greater detail below. Accordingly, there are at least two ways of accessing a single node centric visualization, first by typing in the URL in a menu as shown in FIG. 2 , second by selecting a node and requesting that the node is used as the center node for a visualization.
- Visualization 300 is a sankey or sankey type diagram as shown in FIG. 3 .
- Sankey diagrams are the types of diagrams where the size and shape of the nodes and the connectors represents one or more data values.
- the user selected node is displayed in the center of the visualization under the heading step 0.
- home 301 is displayed at step 0.
- Within the node information regarding the node is displayed such as the number of visits the node had incoming and the number of visits where the users dropped off.
- the size of home 301 in the visualization reflects the amount of the traffic that came into home 301 and the amount of the traffic that went out of home 301 .
- the amount of traffic going into a node should be equal to the amount of traffic that is going out of a node.
- Visualization 300 also displays traffic flow information between nodes.
- connector 303 represents the flow of traffic from node 304 to home 301 .
- visualization 300 may also provide indicia of the amount of traffic between nodes (e.g., by varying the appearance of traffic flows by traffic volume, by providing icons or text indicative of traffic volume, or by other ways of conveying the amount of traffic between nodes).
- connectors 303 305 and 307 are shown to vary in size in visualization 300 , thereby representing their different traffic volumes.
- traffic paths 303 , 305 , and 307 represent the flow of traffic from node 304 , 306 , and 308 to home 301 .
- Visualization 300 may also show drop-off traffic flows.
- a drop-off traffic flow is one in which a user exits the process (e.g., by stopping their web browsing session, by leaving to visit a different retailer's website, or by leaving to visit a website with a different top level domain, etc.).
- drop-off traffic paths 302 a , 302 b , 302 c and 302 d are attached to various nodes, to denote the flow of traffic away from each of these steps (e.g., that do not return to another node associated with a goal in visualization 200 ).
- drop-off traffic flows may include indicia that distinguishes them from other traffic flows (e.g., by applying a coloration, text or icon, etc.).
- drop-off traffic path 302 a may be colored red to denote the flow of traffic away from the home 301 (e.g., by going to a competitor's website, by stopping the shopping process, navigating away from the domain name of the visualization etc.).
- the length dimension of the drop-off traffic paths represents the amount of traffic that dropped off. For example, the length of drop-off 302 a is larger than the length of drop-off 302 d , accordingly, a larger amount of traffic dropped off from home 301 than node 315 .
- Time input 212 is configured to receive a selection of a time or date range for which visualization 300 is to be generated.
- time input 212 may receive a selection of a date range that can be used to filter traffic information provided by visualization 300 .
- an advertiser may wish to view website traffic information around a certain holiday, to tailor an advertising campaign.
- time input 212 may be preset (e.g., the previous week, the previous month, a time period defined in a user's profile, etc.).
- Visualization 300 may also include zoom input 371 , which receives a selection of a zoom level. For example, a user of visualization 300 may use zoom input 371 to zoom out, thereby showing more nodes. Zoom input 371 may also be used to zoom in, thereby focusing the display of visualization 300 on only a subset of nodes. Zoom input 371 may be one or more icons, a sliding bar, or other selectable area of visualization 300 . The zoom input 371 may allow a user to enlarge the size of each node and connector that is shown in visualization 300 .
- Visualization 300 may include a scroll input 370 which receives a selection of a scroll left or right inputs. For example, a user of visualization 300 may wish to scroll to a right or left portion of the visualization.
- visualization 300 may include a connection selector 380 .
- Connection selector 380 receives a selection of an amount of traffic flows to be displayed on visualization 300 . As shown, connection selector 380 is set to display only a minimal amount of traffic flows on visualization 300 .
- Connection selector 380 may be an input field that receives a number of flows to display, one or more icons (e.g., an up and down arrow), a slide bar, or any other selectable area for receiving a selection on visualization 300 .
- Visualization 300 also shows home 301 in one column that is labeled step 0 and the set of nodes ( 311 , 313 and 315 ) that receive traffic from home 301 in a column labeled step 1.
- the nodes e.g. 304 , 306 and 308
- the nodes have traffic going to home 301 are in another column labeled step ⁇ 1.
- in any column there can be only a limited number of nodes. For example, in the column labeled step ⁇ 1, there are a total of 6 nodes.
- the last node 308 is an aggregate of all websites that were not included in the 5 nodes above node 308 .
- the nodes with the largest amount of traffic are shown and the nodes with smaller amount of traffic are consolidated in node 308 . Accordingly, this feature allows the user to see the most significant nodes and connectors.
- Visualization 300 allows the user to interact with each node and connector that is displayed in the visualization. For example, if a user input device hovers over the area occupied by the connector 310 , the user may be shown a connector display 320 that states which nodes are being connected by the connector. The user pointing device hovering over connector 310 would display, home 301 to node 311 (i.e. the two nodes being connected by the connector). The connector display 320 also shows the number of visits that are represented by the connector (i.e. x visits) and the percent of total traffic that is represented by the connector 310 . The total traffic for connector 310 would be the sum of the traffic from 301 .
- node hover display 321 may be generated.
- the node hover display 321 may include the number of visits that dropped off and the percentage to the number of visits that dropped off. Also the number of visits and related percentage that went on to other nodes. For example, in visualization 300 , 25% of the visit dropped off and 75% of the visits went to other nodes.
- a graphical representation of the visits data may be a pie chart, line graph or the like. A user may be provided with an option to modify the node hover display 321 .
- the visualization highlights various connectors with traffic that traveled through the selected connector. For example, when a user selects connector 310 , all other connectors that have traffic that passed through connector 310 may be highlighted. (See. FIG. 4 )
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example visualization 400 of a selected connector 310 from FIG. 3 .
- the user had selected connector 310 , causing a change in color in the selected connector.
- the color of the highlighted connector may be changed.
- the color may be darker or lighter than previously displayed.
- the color of the unselected connector may be made lighter or darker.
- Various other connectors that had portions of their traffic go through connector 310 are also highlighted. If the visualization 400 had more columns such as step 2 (as shown in FIG. 5 ), then all network traffic coming to connector 310 and traffic going away from connector 310 would be highlighted as well. In some embodiments, all traffic that generated or came from the selected connector may be highlighted. All traffic includes nodes and connectors that are more than one column away from the selected connector or node.
- traffic 305 h is highlighted.
- the traffic 305 h is a portion of the traffic from connector 305 .
- Traffic 305 h came from node 306 traveled through home 301 and then a portion of it went to node 311 .
- hovering over traffic 305 h will display the percentage and the number of visits out of the total visits from connector 305 that went through connector 311 .
