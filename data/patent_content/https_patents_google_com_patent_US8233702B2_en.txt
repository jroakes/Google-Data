- kNN k-nearest neighbor
- kNN can be applied even in scenarios where not all categories are given at the time of training, such as, for example, in face verification applications where the subjects to be recognized are not known in advance.
- the distance metric used to define the neighbors of a query point plays a fundamental role in the accuracy of kNN classification.
- Euclidean distance is used as a similarity measure. This choice is logical when it is not possible to study the statistics of the data prior to classification or when it is fair to assume that all features are equally scaled and equally relevant. However, in most cases the data is distributed in a way so that distance analysis along some specific directions of the features space can be more informative than along others. In such cases and when training data is available in advance, distance metric learning has been shown to yield significant improvement in kNN classification.
- the key idea of these methods is to apply transformations to the data in order to emphasize the most discriminative directions in the input space. For example, when a face is detected, the algorithm is executed in a direction where facial features are contained. Euclidean distance computation in the transformed space is then equivalent to a non-uniform metric analysis in the original input space.
- Embodiments described herein enhance conventional approaches which learn distance metrics attempting to first reducing the dimensionality of the input space followed by a classification task. What embodiments described herein enable is:
- FIG. 1A illustrates an image analysis system that is configured in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

- system 100 may be implemented in a networked environment, and use input received or delivered over a network.
- system 100 may be implemented as a standalone machine, or on a work station. Numerous other implementation environments are also contemplated.
- image analysis system 100 performs operations on high-dimensional input 102 .
- the input 102 may correspond to images, where pixel count, for example, defines the dimensionality of the input.
- the image analysis system 100 learns, detects, or receives as input, one or more metrics 104 .
- the image analysis system 100 implements processes (using a module or component) to reduce dimensionality of the input 102 while optimizing metrics 104 .
- the dimensional reduction and optimization may be implemented at one time, such as by way of one equation or interrelated equations.
- the resulting dimensionality of an output 106 is less than that of the input 102 .
- LMNN Large Margin Nearest Neighbor
- kNN One characteristic of kNN is that its performance does not depend on linear separability of classes in input space: in order to achieve accurate kNN classification it is sufficient that the majority of the k-nearest points of each test example have correct label. Previous work has exploited this property by learning a linear transformation of the input space that aims at creating consistently labeled k-nearest neighborhoods, i.e. clusters where each training example and its k-nearest points have same label and where points differently labeled are distanced by an additional safety margin. Specifically, given n input examples x1, . . . , x n in R D and corresponding class labels y1, . . . , y n , they propose to learn the D ⁇ D transformation matrix L that optimizes the following objective function:
- ⁇ ⁇ ( L ) ⁇ ij ⁇ ⁇ ij ⁇ ⁇ L ⁇ ( x i - x j ) ⁇ 2 + c ⁇ ⁇ ijl ⁇ ⁇ ij ⁇ ( 1 - y il ) ⁇ h ⁇ ( ⁇ L ⁇ ( x i - x j ) ⁇ 2 - ⁇ L ⁇ ( x i - x l ) ⁇ 2 + 1 ) ( 1 )
- ⁇ 0,1 ⁇ is a binary variable indicating whether example xj is one the k-closest points of xi that share the same label yi
- c is a positive constant
- h(s) max(s, 0) is the hinge function.
- the objective ⁇ (L) consists of two contrasting terms.
- the first aims at pulling closer together points sharing the same label and that were neighbors in the original space.
- the second term encourages distancing each example x i from differently labeled points by an amount equal to 1 plus the distance from x i to any of its k similarly-labeled closest points.
- This term corresponds to a margin condition similar to that of SVMs and it is used to improve generalization.
- the constant c controls the relative importance of these two competing terms and it is chosen via cross validation.
- Embodiments provide an alternative approach that solves jointly for dimensionality reduction and metric learning.
- the key idea for such embodiments is to choose the transformation L in Equation 1 to be a nonsquare matrix of size d ⁇ D, with d ⁇ D.
- Embodiments propose an approach for minimizing the objective that differs from the one previously used. The idea is to optimize Equation 1 directly with respect to the nonsquare matrix L. By minimizing the objective with respect to L rather than with respect to the rank-deficient D ⁇ D matrix M, several benefits are achieved. First, embodiments provide that optimization involves only d ⁇ D rather than D 2 unknowns, which considerably reduces the risk of overfitting. Second, the optimal rectangular matrix L computed with the method described herein automatically satisfies the rank constraints on M without requiring the solution of difficult constraint minimization problems. Although the objective optimized by such a method is also not convex, such converges consistently to better metrics than those computed via the application of PCA followed by subspace distance learning (see Section 4).
- Embodiments minimize ⁇ (L) using gradient-based optimizers, such as conjugate gradient methods. Differentiating ⁇ (L) with respect to the transformation matrix L gives the following gradient for the update rule:
- an algorithm is described that jointly solves for linear dimensionality reduction and metric learning.
- an embodiment describes how to “kernelize” this method in order to compute non-linear features of the inputs that optimize a distance learning objective.
- One approach learns a low-rank Mahalanobis distance metric in a high dimensional feature space F, related to the inputs by a nonlinear map ⁇ : R D ⁇ F.
- Embodiments modify the objective ⁇ (L) by substituting inputs Xi with features 0(Xi) into Equation 1.
- L is now a transformation from the space F into a low-dimensional space R d .
- What is sought is the transformation L minimizing the modified objective function ⁇ (L)
- This form of nonlinear map is analogous to that used in kernel-PCA and it parameterizes the transformation L in terms of only d ⁇ n parameters, the entries of the matrix ⁇ .
- Lemma is introduced in order to derive an iterative update rule for L.

- KLMCA kernel-LMCA
- LMCA kernel-LMCA
- KLMCA kernel-LMCA
- LMCA the transformation computed by kernel-PCA as initial guess.
- the objectives of LMCA and KLMCA were optimized using the steepest descent algorithm. With more sophisticated minimization algorithms no substantial improvement in performance or speed of convergence was achieved.
- the KLMCA algorithm was implemented using a Gaussian RBF kernel. The number of nearest neighbors, the weight c in Equation 1, and the variance of the RBF kernel, were all automatically tuned using cross-validation.
- the first part of the experimental evaluation focuses on classification results on datasets with high-dimensionality, Isolet, AT&T Faces, and StarPlus fMRI:
- LMCA and KLMCA give considerably better classification accuracy than LMNN on all datasets, with the kernelized version of the algorithm always outperforming the linear version.
- the difference in accuracy between the algorithms such as described here and LMNN is particularly dramatic when a small number of projection dimensions is used. In such cases, LMNN is unable to find good metrics in the low-dimensional subspace computed by PCA.
- LMCA and KLMCA solve for the low-dimensional subspace that optimizes the classification-related objective of Equation 1, and therefore achieve good performance even when projecting to very low dimensions.
- FIG. 2 shows comparative reconstructions of images obtained from PCA and LMCA features by inverting their linear mappings.
- LMCA learns invariance to effects that are irrelevant for classification: non-uniform illumination, facial expressions, and glasses (training data contains images with and without glasses for same individuals).
- PCA has the property of computing the linear transformation minimizing the reconstruction error under the L2 norm.
- the PCA face reconstructions are extremely faithful reproductions of the original images.
- PCA accurately reconstructs also visual effects, such as lighting variations and changes in facial expressions, that are unimportant for the task of face verification and that might potentially hamper recognition.
- LMCA seeks a subspace where neighboring examples belong to the same class and points differently labeled are separated by a large margin.
- LMCA does not encode effects that are found to be insignificant for classification or that vary largely among examples of the same class.
- LMCA de-emphasizes changes in illumination, presence or absence of glasses and smiling expressions ( FIG. 2 ).
- KLMCA can be used in lieu of LMNN in order to extract nonlinear features from the inputs.
- This use of KLMCA has been evaluated on the following low-dimensional datasets from the UCI repository: Bal, Wine, his, and Ionosphere. The dimensionality of the data in these sets ranges from 4 to 34.
- KLMCA was restricted to compute a number of features equal to the input dimensionality, although using additional nonlinear features often results in better classification performance.
- FIG. 3 summarizes the results of this comparison. More specifically, kNN classification accuracy on low-dimensional datasets: Bal, Wine, Iris, and Ionosphere.
- embodiments described herein simultaneously optimize the objectives of dimensionality reduction and metric learning.
- One embodiment seeks, among all possible low-dimensional projections, the one that best satisfies a large margin metric objective.
- Such an approach contrasts favorably to conventional techniques that are unable to learn metrics in high-dimensions and that must rely on dimensionality reduction methods to be first applied to the data.
- the optimization described herein is not convex, it can be demonstrated that the metrics learned by this solution are consistently superior to those computed by globally-optimal methods forced to search in a low-dimensional subspace.
Abstract
Description
-
- 1. A Large Margin Component Analysis (LMCA) algorithm, a technique that solves directly for a low-dimensional embedding of the data such that Euclidean distance in this space minimizes a metric objective. Under an embodiment, one approach solves for only D·d unknowns, where D is the dimensionality of the inputs and d is the dimensionality of the target space. By contrast, conventional algorithm learn a Mahalanobis distance of the inputs by solving for a D×D matrix, using iterative methods. This optimization is unfeasible for large values of D.
- 2. An embodiment includes a computer implemented technique that learns Mahalanobis distance metrics in nonlinear feature spaces, for data under analysis. Such an approach combines the goal of dimensionality reduction with a novel “kernelized” version of a metric learning objective. An embodiment optimizes this combined objective directly. We demonstrate that, even when data is low-dimensional and dimensionality reduction is not needed, this technique can be used to learn nonlinear metrics leading to significant improvement in kNN classification accuracy over previous conventional methods.
where ηε{0,1} is a binary variable indicating whether example xj is one the k-closest points of xi that share the same label yi, c is a positive constant, yilε{0,1} is 1 if (yi=yl), and h(s)=max(s, 0) is the hinge function. The objective ε(L) consists of two contrasting terms. The first aims at pulling closer together points sharing the same label and that were neighbors in the original space. The second term encourages distancing each example xi from differently labeled points by an amount equal to 1 plus the distance from xi to any of its k similarly-labeled closest points. This term corresponds to a margin condition similar to that of SVMs and it is used to improve generalization. The constant c controls the relative importance of these two competing terms and it is chosen via cross validation.
Embodiments described herein handle the non-differentiability of h(s) at s=0, by adopting a smooth hinge function.
where sijl=(∥L(φi−φj)∥2−∥L(φi−φl)∥2+1).
Let Φ=[φl, . . . , φn]T.
- Lemma 5.1 The gradient in feature space can be computed as ∂ε(
Proof Defining ki=Φφi=[k(xl, xi), . . . , k(xn, xi)]T, non-linear feature projections can be computed as Lφi=ΩΦφi=Ωki. From this the following equations can be derived:
where Ev i[0, . . . , v, 0, . . . 0] is the n×n matrix having vector v in the i-th column and all 0 in the other columns. Setting
proves the Lemma.
where λ is the learning rate. This optimization is carried out by iterating the update Ω←(Ω−λΓ) until convergence. For classification, points are projected onto the learned low-dimensional space by exploiting the kernel trick: Lφq=Ωkq.

- Isolet is a dataset of speech features from the UC Irvine repository, consisting of 6238 training examples and 1559 testing examples with 617 attributes. There are 26 classes corresponding to the spoken letters to be recognized.
- The AT&T Faces2 database contains 10 grayscale face images of each of 40 distinct sub-jects. The images were taken at different times, with varying illumination, facial expressions and poses. The images were downsampled from the original size 112×92 to size 38×31, corresponding to 1178 input dimensions.
- The StarPlus fMRI dataset contains fMRI sequences acquired in the context of a cognitive experiment. In these trials the subject is shown for a few seconds either a picture or a sentence describing a picture. The goal is to recognize the viewing activity of the subject from the fMRI images. The size of the data may be reduced by considering only voxels corresponding to relevant areas of the brain cortex and by averaging the activity in each voxel over the period of the stimulus. This yields data of size 1715 for subject “04847,” on which the analysis was restricted. A total number of 80 trials are available for this subject.
