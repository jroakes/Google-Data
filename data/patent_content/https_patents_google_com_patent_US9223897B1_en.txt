- the user may select a document from the list and request the document.
- the browser retrieves the requested document and displays the document to the user in a browser window.
- the search engine uses one or more ranking algorithms to rank search results.
- the one or more ranking algorithms, used by the search engine may provide imperfect results, meaning that a more optimal rank order may be determined by adjusting the rank positions of the documents in the ranked list of documents. Determining how to adjust the rank positions of the documents may prove to be particularly challenging.

- FIG. 9A is a flowchart of an example process of applying a correction factor to an indexing process according to an implementation described herein.
- FIG. 9B is a flowchart of an example process of applying a correction factor to a crawling process according to an implementation described herein.
- An implementation described herein may relate to adjusting a score, such as, for example, a rank score of a document in a set of ranked documents returned as search results matching a search query.
- the search results may be presented to a user as a ranked list of links to the search result documents.
- the rank score of a document may be adjusted based on a correction factor computed using an average expected utility of a document and an average actual utility of the document.
- the utility of a document may be based by keeping track of the search events and the utilization events associated with the document.
- a “search event” may correspond to an occasion where the document is included in a set of search results, provided to a client device, in response to a search query received from the client device.
- a “utilization event” may correspond to a selection the document, a selection of a selection object associated with the document, or a different user action, or multiple different user actions, associated with the document.
- the expected utility rate of a document may be determined by keeping track of the number of search events associated with the document at each particular rank position during a particular time period and an expected utility rate associated with each particular rank position.
- Each rank position may be associated with a particular expected utility rate.
- the expected utility rate may be computed based on the expected selection rate, such as, for example, a click rate, associated with each rank position and the number of times the document appeared in a set of search results at each particular rank position during the particular time period.
- the actual utility rate of the document may be based on the actual number of good utilization events during the particular time period.
- the actual utility rate may be based on the number of selections of the document during the particular time period.
- a selection of a document may correspond to a click on a link to the document.
- a utilization event may be identified as a good utilization event if the utilization event meets one or more criteria.
- a selection may be identified as a good selection if a user, after entering a search query, selects the document from received search results, spends at least a particular amount of time viewing the document, and proceeds to an activity that is not directly related to search query, such as, for example, entering an unrelated search query, accessing a document not related to the search results, and/or closing or minimizing a browser application.
- the expected utility rate of a document and the actual utility rate of the document may be biased so that recent events count more than older events.
- an average expected utility rate and an average actual utility rate may be based on a decaying average, using previously calculated values for the actual utility rate and the expected utility rate, and a decay constant.
- a correction factor for a document may be computed based on a ratio of the average actual utility rate of the document and the average expected utility rate of the document.
- the correction factor may be adjusted based on a confidence value that indicates the reliability of the correction factor. For example, if a document has been stored in a document index for a short period of time, or if a document is associated with relatively few search/utilization events, the correction factor may not accurately reflect how much the rank score of a document should be adjusted.
- the correction factor may be used to adjust a rank score of the document in a set of search results. For example, if the correction factor for a document is greater than one, it may indicate that the document has performed at a better rate than the expected rate, and the rank score of the document may be increased. If the correction factor for a document is less than one, it may indicate that the document has performed at less than the expected rate, and the rank score of the document may be decreased.
- Adjusting a rank score of a document based on a correction factor, based on a ratio of average actual utility and average expected utility, may provide a benefit of ranking documents more correctly to reflect actual performance of document with respect to user behavior.
- An implementation described herein may further relate to calculating an aggregated correction factor for a set of related documents.
- Documents may be grouped into a set of related documents based on, for example, the fact that the documents are associated with a same web domain or web site, are associated with a same category or topic classification, are associated with a same content type classification, are associated with a same author, are associated with a same date range, etc.
- An aggregated correction factor may be useful in cases where individual documents may have an associated individual correction factor with a low confidence level.
- An implementation described herein may further relate to using a correction factor, associated with a document, or an aggregated correction factor, associated with a set of related documents, for uses other than adjusting a ranking score.
- the correction factor, associated with a document, or the aggregated correction factor, associated with a set of documents may be used to select which documents to include in a document index.
- the correction factor, associated with a document, or the aggregated correction factor, associated with a set of documents may be used to determine how to use crawl capacity.
- Crawl capacity may refer to an available bandwidth for crawling documents.
- a document may be crawled, for example, to determine whether content of the document has changed since the document was indexed or whether a URL associated with the document is still valid.
- a “document,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web page or a web site, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a news article, a blog, a business listing, an electronic version of printed text, a web advertisement, etc.
- a common document is a web page.
- Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as, for example, meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript, Cascading Style Sheets, etc.
- a “link,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document.
- a “query,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any string of characters, such as words, phrases, and/or structured data, which may be used to retrieve one or more documents relevant to the query. Additionally or alternatively, a query may include audio input, such as spoken language, images, Global Position System (GPS) coordinates, and/or automated query data generated from a user's location, preferences, and/or actions.

In one example, crawler 390 may obtain a URL from document index 365 . In another example, crawler 390 may obtain a URL from a link included in a document that was accessed by crawler 390 . Crawler 390 may compute a crawl score for a document based on one or more factor and may use the crawl score to determine whether to crawl a document. Score adjustment mechanism 360 may adjust crawl scores associated with documents based on correction factors received from correction factor calculator 330 . Crawler 390 may determine whether to crawl a document based on an adjusted crawl score associated with the document.
- search engine server 130 may contain fewer functional components, different functional components, additional functional components, or differently arranged functional components than depicted in FIG. 3B .

Additionally or alternatively, document indexing date field 410 may store information about how long the document has been in the document index.
- Last crawl date field 412 may store information identifying a last time that the document has been crawled, in order to, for example, facilitate a determination of whether content associated with the document has changed since the document has been indexed and/or since the last time that the document has been crawled.
- Rank adjustment field 415 may store one or more fields that store information used to adjust a rank score of the particular document.

- good utilization events field 430 may store information about all utilization events, such as, for example, by including utilization events external to the particular time period.
- Decay constant field 440 may store a decay constant associated with the particular document.
- the decay constant may be used to calculate a decaying average for an actual utility rate and an expected utility rate of the particular document.
- a single decay constant may be used for all documents.
- different decay constants may be used for different types of documents and/or different decay constants may be used for individual documents.
- a news document may be more time sensitive and may, therefore, have a faster decay constant than, for example, a document associated with a product.
- time sensitivity of a document, or a type of document may be determined based on, for example, how often the document, or type of document, is updated.
- time sensitivity of a document, or a type of document may be determined based on how often the document, or a type of document, is accessed over a period of time. For example, the number of times a news article is accessed may decay exponentially from the date when the article was first published, indicating a higher time sensitivity than a document with a more constant access rate.
- Average expected utility field 450 may store a previously computed average expected utility rate based on data gathered during previous time periods.

- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an example process for adjusting a rank position of a document according to an implementation described herein.
- the process of FIG. 6 may be performed by search engine server 130 in combination with rank correction server 140 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 6 may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate and/or possibly remote from or including search engine server 130 and/or rank correction server 140 .
- the process of FIG. 6 may include receiving a search query (block 610 ).
- a user may activate a browser application and enter a search query using the browser application.
- Client device 110 may send the search query to search engine server 130 .
- Documents matching the search query may be identified (block 620 ).
- search engine server 130 may search one or more document indexes to identify documents that match the search query.
- Search engine server 130 may identify one or more documents that match the search query from each of the one or more document indexes.
- the identified documents may be ranked (block 630 ).
- search engine server 130 may rank the identified document using one or more conventional ranking algorithms.
- a correction factor may be determined for a particular document (block 640 ).
- correction factor calculator 330 may calculate an average actual utility rate and an average expected utility rate for the particular document, and may calculate a correction factor based on the ratio of the average actual utility rate and the average expected utility rate.
- the correction factor may be determined offline, meaning that the correction factor may be computed prior to processing the search query.
- the correction factor may be determine online, meaning that the correction factor may be computed in response to receiving the search query.
- a confidence level may be determined for the correction factor of the particular document (block 650 ).
- confidence level calculator 350 may calculate a confidence level associated with the correction factor for the particular document.
- the confidence level may measure how reliable the correction factor is and may be based on a length of time that the particular document has been included in a document index and/or based on a quantity of search events associated with the document.
- a document that has been indexed relatively recently, or a document with relatively few search events may not have enough associated data to determine how the document's actual utility rate compares with the document's expected utility rate. Thus, a document with such sparse statistics may exhibit a low confidence level.
- the confidence level associated with the document may increase the longer the document is stored in the index.
- the confidence level may be calculated assuming a Poisson distribution and normalizing the confidence level to a value between 0 and 1.
- the confidence level may be determined using other techniques.
- the correction factor may be adjusted based on the confidence level (block 660 ). For example, score adjustment mechanism 360 may multiply the correction factor with a normalized confidence level value, with a value between 0 and 1, to determine an adjusted correction factor.
- a rank score of the particular document may be adjusted based on the adjusted correction factor (block 670 ).
- score adjustment mechanism 360 may adjust a rank score of the particular document based on the adjusted correction factor. If the correction factor is greater than one, indicating that the average actual utility rate of the document is greater than the average expected utility rate of the document, the rank score of the document may be increased. If the correction factor is less than one, indicating that the average actual utility rate of the document is less than the average expected utility rate of the document, the rank score of the document may be decreased. If the correction factor equals one, indicating that the average actual utility rate of the document equals the average expected utility rate of the document, the rank score of the document may not be adjusted.
- Increases of rank scores based on a correction factor and decreases of rank scores based on a correction factor may be applied independently.
- the rank score of a document may be decreased and if the correction factor is not less than one, the rank score of the document may not be adjusted.
- the rank score of a document may be increased, and if the correction factor is not greater than one, the rank score of the document may not be adjusted.
- the rank score of a document may be decreased and if the correction factor is not less than one, the rank score of a document may be increased.
- the rank score of the particular document may be multiplied by the adjusted correction factor.
- the rank score may be increased or decreased by a particular amount in proportion to the correction factor.
- the rank score of the particular document may be adjusted using another technique. For example, rather than changing the rank score of the document, on which the rank position of the document is based, the rank position of the document in the set of selected documents may be changed directly. For example, the rank position of the particular document may be moved up or down based on the correction factor.
- blocks 640 through 670 may be performed offline, meaning prior to, and independently of, receiving a search query. This may allow processing at query time to be performed faster. In another implementation, blocks 640 through 670 may be performed in response to receiving a search query.
- score adjustment mechanism 360 may analyze the identified documents to determine whether correction factors need to be computed for other documents of the identified documents.
- the process may return to block 640 . If it is determined that there are more documents to be processed (block 675 —YES), the process may return to block 640 . If it is determined that there are no more documents to be processed (block 675 —NO), the identified documents may be re-ranked based on the adjusted rank scores (block 680 ). For example, score adjustment mechanism 360 may re-arrange the rank positions of the identified documents based on the adjusted rank scores. Thus, in relation to an original rank position arrangement of the ranked documents, some documents may be moved up in rank position, and some documents may be moved down in rank position.
- a list of the re-ranked documents may be provided (block 690 ).
- rank correction server 140 may provide the list of re-ranked documents to a browser application running on client device 110 or may provide the list of re-ranked documents to search engine server 130 .
- Search engine server 130 may perform additional processing and provide the list of re-ranked documents to the browser application running on client device 110 .
- search engine server 130 may form a document, such as an HTML document, that includes a list of links to the re-ranked documents, where the links are arranged in rank positions based on the re-ranked documents.

- the process of FIG. 7 may be performed offline, meaning prior to, and independently of, receiving a search query. This may allow processing at query time to be performed faster. In another implementation, the process of FIG. 7 may be performed in response to receiving a search query.
- the process of FIG. 7 may include recording a quantity of search events at each rank position during a particular time period (block 710 ).

- the search results, corresponding to the search events associated with the particular document, may be presented to a user as a ranked list of links that include a link to the particular document.
- a link to the particular document may include anchor text, which may correspond to a title of the particular document or a URL of the particular document.
- the links may include additional information associated with each search result, such as thumbnail and/or an image associated with the document, a rating associated with the document, a snippet of text extracted from the document, and additional links to search for related content, to access similar documents, or to access news document and/or blog documents related to the particular document.

- rank correction factor calculator 330 may obtain a rank position map corresponding to a language associated with the particular document, a language associated with a query associated with the particular document, a document type associated with the particular document, and/or a query type associated with a query associated with the particular document. For example, if a query associated with a product name is received, such as “digital camera for sale,” a rank position map associated with a product name query type may be retrieved.
- Correction factor calculator 330 may determine, for each rank position, how many search events for the particular rank position occurred during the particular time period, and may multiply the quantity of search events by the expected utility rate for that rank position, retrieved from the obtained rank position map record, to determine a quantity of expected utilization events for that rank position. Correction factor calculator 330 may perform this calculation for each rank position and add up the quantity of expected utilization events for each rank position to determine the total number of expected utilization events during the particular time period, and may divide the total number of expected utilization events by the total number of search events to determine the expected utility rate. For example, correction factor calculator 330 may determine the expected selection rate by determining the total number of expected selections for the particular document and dividing by the total number of search events. The process of determining the average expected utility rate may be represented by equation (1):
- a decaying average of the expected utility rate may be determined (block 730 ).
- correction factor calculator 330 may determine a decaying average for the expected utility rate.
- Recent search events for the particular document may be more important that older search events.
- a decaying average may take into account past performance of the particular document while giving more emphasis to more recent performance.
- a decaying average may be computed using equation (2):
- UR DECAY UR AVG D + D - 1 D * UR AVG - 1 , ( 2 )
- correction factor calculator 330 may retrieve decay constant from decay constant field 440 , and may retrieve a previously computed average expected utility rate from average expected utility field 450 of document record 400 associated with the particular document.
- the decay constant may be configured based on empirical determinations of how far back a document's performance may be relevant. In one implementation, the decay constant may set to reflect a period of one month. In another implementation, the decay constant may be set to reflect a different length of time. Different types of documents may be associated with different decay constants. For example, news documents may be associated with a shorter decay constant than other types of documents, such as, for example, documents associated with products.
- the total number of utilization events during the particular time period may be recorded (block 740 ).
- data collector 310 may record the quantity of selection events associated with the particular document during the particular time period.
- utilization events may correspond to clicks on a link to the particular document in a set of search results, in other implementations, utilization events may correspond to different, or additional, user actions.
- a utilization event may correspond to a selection of a selection object associated with the particular document.
- Examples of selections of a selection object associated with the particular document may include a right click on a document or a mouse-over event (which may bring up additional information about the particular document); a click on a link associated with the particular document (e.g., a click on a link to search for related documents, a click on a “more like this” link, a click on a link to request more documents from a same web site as the particular document, a click on a link to view news articles or blogs related to the particular document, a click to access a cached version of the particular document, a request to translate the particular document into another language, etc.); a request to bookmark the particular document; a request to view comments associated with the particular document; a request to write a comment about the particular document; or any other user action that may associated with the particular document.
- a click on a link associated with the particular document e.g., a click on a link to search for related documents, a click on a “more like this” link, a click
- Good utilization events may be selected (block 750 ).
- data collector 310 may only select good utilization events for determining the actual utility rate.
- a utilization event may be determined to be a “good” utilization event based on one or more configurable criteria. For example, a click may be determined to be a good click if the user, after clicking on a link to access the particular document, spends at least a particular amount of time accessing the particular document, and proceeds to perform an action that is unrelated to the original search query which resulted in the link to the particular document being presented to the user.
- Examples of actions unrelated to the original search query may include the user entering an unrelated search query, accessing a document that is not in the set of returned search results for the search query, bookmarking the document, and/or not performing any actions for a particular period of time after accessing the document.
- a user clicks on a link to the particular document accesses the particular document for a short time and returns to the set of search results to select another document, the click may not be determined to be a good click.
- An actual utility rate may be determined based on the good utilization events (block 760 ).
- correction factor calculator 330 may calculate the average actual utility rate by dividing the quantity of good utilization events by the quantity of search events for the particular time period.
