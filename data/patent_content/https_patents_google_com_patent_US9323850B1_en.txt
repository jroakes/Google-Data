Definitions
- Embodiments of the present invention relate to data processing, and more specifically, to ranking users of a social network.
- a social network is a social structure made up of individuals (referred to as “nodes”) who are connected to one another via one or more relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, and so forth.
- a social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that enables users to participate in a social network and build connections with other users.
- connections are directional; for example, a first user may be a “follower” of a second user, while the second user may or may not be a follower of the first user.
- connections are always bi-directional; for example, if a first user is a “friend” of a second user, then the second user is also a friend of the first user (i.e., both the first user and second user are “friends”).
- Users of a bi-directionally-connected social networking service can be thought of as being directionally connected; for example, if Alice and Bob are friends in a bi-directionally-connected social networking service, one could also say that Alice is a follower of Bob and Bob is a follower of Alice.
- Social networking services are playing an increasing role in the distribution of content (e.g., web pages, pictures, video clips, etc.) among users.
- content e.g., web pages, pictures, video clips, etc.
- a user may share a particular content item with some or all of his connections, each of whom may in turn share the content item with some or all of their connections, and so forth.
- the content item may be said to have great “virality,” or in popular usage, “to have gone viral.”
- a computer system receives an indication that a first user of a social network wishes to share a content item (e.g., a webpage, a photo, a video clip, an audio clip, etc.) with one or more followers of the first user in the social network.
- the computer system determines a “viral score” for a second user of the social network who is a follower of the first user, where the viral score estimates a potential contribution of the second user to the virality of the content item if the content item is shared with the second user via the social network.
- the computer system determines whether the second user is to be included in a list of potential recipients for the content item based on the second user's viral score, and presents the list to the first user.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary system architecture, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a content distribution manager.
- FIG. 3 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for presenting an ordered list of potential recipients in a social network with whom to share a content item.
- FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for computing viral scores for followers of a user in a social network.
- FIG. 5 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative computer system operating in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
- Methods and systems are described for managing how content items (e.g., web pages, photos, video clips, audio clips, etc.) are shared among users of a social network.
- content items e.g., web pages, photos, video clips, audio clips, etc.
- Any user data that is collected with regards to the embodiments described herein would typically be anonymized, and users would have the option of opting-out of such data collection activities.
- a computer system determines a “viral score” for each of his or her followers, where the viral score estimates a potential contribution of the follower to the virality of the content item if the content item is shared with the follower.
- the computer system then presents to the user an ordered list of followers as potential recipients for the content item, where the list is ordered by viral score.
- John and Mary are two followers of a user, and John has a higher viral score than Mary, then John will appear earlier in the list than Mary—the rationale being that by sharing the content item with John, John is more likely to contribute to the virality of the content item (i.e., by sharing the content item with followers that, in turn, have high viral scores) than Mary.
- John has three hundred followers and Mary has ten followers, then, all other things being equal, one would expect John to have a higher viral score than Mary.
- the viral score of a follower may also be based on the content item to be shared. For example, if the content item is a New York Times article about the New York Giants, then, all other things being equal, a follower who lives in New York may be assigned a higher viral score than a follower who lives in Chicago. Similarly, a follower who is a fan of the New York Giants, as indicated by the follower's profile in the social network (e.g., by the follower “Like”ing the New York Giants, etc.), may be assigned a higher viral score than another follower for whom there is no indication of liking the New York Giants, or of liking sports in general.
- the follower's profile in the social network e.g., by the follower “Like”ing the New York Giants, etc.
- Embodiments of the present invention thus encourage content items to “go viral” via propagation through a social network. Moreover, by ordering a list of potential recipients in an intelligent fashion, embodiments of the present invention can make it more convenient for a user to identify followers with whom to share content, and thereby improve the user experience.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system architecture 100 , in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the system architecture 100 includes a server machine 115 , a social network repository 120 and client machines 102 A- 102 N connected to a network 104 .
- Network 104 may be a public network (e.g., the Internet), a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN)), or a combination thereof.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the client machines 102 A- 102 N may be wireless terminals (e.g., smartphones, etc.), personal computers (PC), laptops, tablet computers, or any other computing or communication devices.
- the client machines 102 A- 102 N may run an operating system (OS) that manages hardware and software of the client machines 102 A- 102 N.
- OS operating system
- a browser (not shown) may run on the client machines (e.g., on the OS of the client machines).
- the browser may be a web browser that can access content served by a web server.
- the browser may issue image and/or video search queries to the web server or may browse images and/or videos that have previously been classified.
- the client machines 102 A- 102 N may also upload images and/or video to the web server for storage and/or classification.
- Server machine 115 may be a rackmount server, a router computer, a personal computer, a portable digital assistant, a mobile phone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a camera, a video camera, a netbook, a desktop computer, a media center, or any combination of the above.
- Server machine 115 includes a web server 140 and a content distribution manager 125 . In alternative embodiments, the web server 140 and content distribution manager 125 may run on different machines.
- Social network repository 120 is a persistent storage that is capable of storing information concerning a social network, such as user profile information, links among users (e.g., undirected edges between users who are friends, directed edges between users and their followers, etc.), user actions (e.g., status updates, sharing a content item, “Like”ing another user's status update, etc.), content items uploaded by users (e.g., photos, video clips, audio clips, etc.), and so forth, as well as data structures to tag, organize, and index this information.
- a social network such as user profile information, links among users (e.g., undirected edges between users who are friends, directed edges between users and their followers, etc.), user actions (e.g., status updates, sharing a content item, “Like”ing another user's status update, etc.), content items uploaded by users (e.g., photos, video clips, audio clips, etc.), and so forth, as well as data structures to tag, organize, and index this information.
- social network repository 120 might be a network-attached file server, while in other embodiments social network repository 120 might be some other type of network-based or local persistent storage in the form of an object-oriented database, a relational database, a collection of files, and so forth.
- Social network repository 120 may be hosted by the server machine 115 or one or more different machines coupled to the server machine 115 via the network 104 .
- the photos, video clips, and audio clips stored in the social network repository 120 may include user-generated content that is uploaded by client machines 102 .
- the photos, video clips, and audio clips may additionally or alternatively include content provided by service providers such as news organizations, publishers, libraries and so on.
- Web server 140 may serve web pages and data from social network repository 120 to clients 102 A- 102 N whose users are members of the social network. In addition, web server 140 may receive data from clients 102 A- 102 N (e.g., status updates, profile changes, content, etc.) and store the data in social network repository 120 .
- data e.g., status updates, profile changes, content, etc.
- content distribution manager 125 is capable of monitoring the behavior of users in the social network, of determining one or more measures of how “valuable” users of the social network are, of determining a “viral score” for users of the social network, of receiving user requests to share content, and of presenting an ordered list of potential recipients for a shared content item, where the potential recipients are followers of the user and are ordered by their viral scores.
- An embodiment of content distribution manager 125 is described in detail below and with respect to FIGS. 3 through 5 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a content distribution manager 200 .
- the content distribution manager 200 may be the same as the content distribution manager 125 of FIG. 1 and may include a user action monitor 202 , a user value scorer 204 , a user virality scorer 206 , a content sharing input/output handler 208 , and a data store 210 .
- the components can be combined together or separated in further components, according to a particular embodiment.
- the data store 210 may include one or more temporary buffers and/or one or more permanent data stores to hold data pertaining to one or more users of the social network (e.g., user profile data, user actions, etc.), content (e.g., photos, audio clips, video clips, etc.), data structures for organizing and indexing data in social network repository 120 , web pages that are served to users of the social network, scores associated with users of the social network (e.g., user value scores, user viral scores, etc.), ordered lists of users, or some combination of these data.
- Data store 210 may be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage based disks, tapes or hard drives, NAS, SAN, and so forth.
- the content distribution manager 200 notifies users of the types of information that are stored in the data store 210 , and provides the users the opportunity to opt-out of having such information collected and/or shared with the content distribution manager 200 .
- the user action monitor 202 collects data concerning the actions of users in the social network, such as how much time users spend on the social network, how often users share and redistribute content, what kinds of content users share, how often users interact with content item shared with them (e.g., viewing a video clip shared with them, clicking on a link shared with them, etc.), how often users “Like” other users' status updates, and so forth.
- the user value scorer 204 determines value scores for users of the social network based on the collected data. In one embodiment, user value scorer 204 determines two types of value scores:
- the user virality scorer 206 determines viral scores for users of the social network using value scores of corresponding users. In one embodiment, the viral score for a user is based on one or more of the following factors:
- the content sharing input/output handler 208 receives commands to share content from users of the social network, generates ordered lists of potential recipients of shared content, based on the viral scores of users' followers, and presents the ordered lists to users, along with one or more mechanisms to conveniently select followers from the lists (e.g., checkboxes in a graphical user interface [GUI], etc.).
- GUI graphical user interface
- FIGS. 3 and 4 depict flow diagrams of some embodiments of methods for providing lists of potential recipients of a content item.
- the methods are performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both.
- the methods are performed by the server machine 115 of FIG. 1 , while in some other embodiments, one or more operations of the method might be performed by another machine.
- various components of content distribution manager 200 may run on separate machines.
- FIG. 3 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 300 for presenting an ordered list of potential recipients in a social network with whom to share a content item.
- an indication that a particular user U wishes to share a particular content item C with one or more followers is received.
- the indication received at block 301 may also specify a particular mechanism for sharing content item C (e.g., via email, via a private message in a messaging system provided by the social network, via a public entry in a follower's “stream” [sometimes referred to alternatively as a follower's “news feed”], etc.).
- block 301 is performed by content sharing input/output handler 208 .
- viral scores are determined for one or more followers of user U.
- An embodiment of a method for determining viral scores for user followers is described in more detail below and with respect to FIG. 4 .
- user U is presented with a list of N followers with the highest viral scores, ordered by viral score (e.g., in descending order), for selecting recipients of content item C, where N is a positive integer that is no greater than the number of followers of user U.
- N is a positive integer that is no greater than the number of followers of user U.
- the ordered list is presented as a scroll-list in a graphical user interface (GUI) with checkboxes next to each follower, thereby enabling user U to conveniently select followers with whom to share content item C.
- GUI graphical user interface
- block 303 is performed by content sharing input/output handler 208 .
- FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for computing viral scores for followers of a user in a social network.
- a set S is initialized to contain the followers of user U.
- a follower F is selected from set S.
- follower F is removed from set S.
- an inherent value score for follower F is determined.
- inherent(F) is intended to estimate, quantitatively, how valuable follower F is, based on criteria such as profile information for follower F (e.g., age, current city of residence, college degrees, how many followers F has, etc.), follower F's behavior in the social network (e.g., how much time follower F spends on the social network, how often follower F redistributes content received from any followee, how often follower F redistributes content received from user U, how often follower F interacts with content shared with them by any followee, how often follower F interacts with content shared with them by user U, etc.), and so forth.
- the inherent value score may also be useful for other applications, such as advertising in the social network.
- a content-dependent value score for follower F is determined.
- value(F, C) is intended to estimate, quantitatively, how valuable follower F is with respect to content item C (e.g., how pertinent content item C is to follower F, based on the follower F's profile information, content that follower F has shared in the past, and so forth.)
- viral scores for F's followers are determined, by recursively executing the method of FIG. 4 for each follower. It should be noted that for reasons of practicality, this recursion needs to be cut off at some point, or otherwise, except in the smallest of social networks, it will be too time-intensive to determine viral scores for all users of the social network at block 406 .
- the recursion of block 406 is cut off at a depth of four, so that when fourth-generation followers are reached in the recursion, block 406 is skipped, in which case the determination of the viral score for a fourth-generation follower at block 407 , described below, is not based on his or her followers' viral scores, but rather, based solely on his or her inherent value score and/or content-dependent value score.
- a viral score is determined for follower F based on one or more of: inherent(F), determined at block 404 ; value(F, C), determined at block 405 ; and the viral scores of F's followers, determined recursively at block 406 ; as well as, optionally, on one or more of the following:
- the viral score for follower F is computed according to the following equation:
- viral ⁇ ( F ) inherent ⁇ ( F ) + value ⁇ ( F , C ) + ⁇ G ⁇ followers ⁇ ⁇ ( F ) ⁇ [ p notice ⁇ ( G , F ) ⁇ p int ⁇ ⁇ eract ⁇ ( G , F ) ] ⁇ viral ⁇ ( G ) ( Eq . ⁇ 1 )
- n notice (G,F) denotes the estimated probability that G, a follower of F, notices content that F shares with G
- p interact (G,F) denotes the estimated probability that G interacts with content that F shares with G and that G notices.
- p notice (G,F) may be based on the particular mechanism by which F intends to share content item C. For example, if F intends to share content item C via email, then p notice (G,F) might have a value close to or equal to 1, while if F intends to share content item C publicly, then p notice (G,F) might be computed as a function of one or more of the following:
- Equation 1 it should be noted that in some embodiments one or more additional probabilities listed above may be incorporated into the formula of Equation 1, while in yet other embodiments some other type of function may be used, rather than the weighted summation of Equation 1.
