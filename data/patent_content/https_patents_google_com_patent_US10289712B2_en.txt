- the system 100 may include one or more client computers 102 .
- Client computers 102 can be any of a number of computing devices (e.g., Internet kiosk, personal digital assistant, cell phone, gaming device, desktop computer, laptop computer, handheld computer, or combinations thereof) used to enable the activities described below.
- Client 102 includes graphical user interface (GUI) 111 .
- Clients 102 are connected to a communications network 106 .
- the communications network 106 connects the clients 102 to a search engine system 112 .
- Search engine 112 includes a query server 114 connected to the communications network 106 , a user information database 116 , a query processing controller 118 , and optionally other databases 117 .
- Search engine 112 generates search results in response to search queries from one or more clients 102 and also provides alerts to new results for some prior searches. It should be appreciated that the layout of the search engine system 112 is merely exemplary and may take on any other suitable layout or configuration.
- the search engine system 112 is used to search an index of documents, such as billions of web pages or other documents indexed by modern search engines.
- search engine system 112 can be used as an Internet search engine, for locating documents on the WWW and/or as an intranet search engine, for locating documents stored on servers or other hosts within an intranet.
- the methodology described herein is applicable to implementations where only portions of documents, such as titles and abstracts, are stored in a database (e.g., 132 ) of the search engine system 112 .
- the search engine system 112 may include multiple data centers, each housing a backend.
- the data centers are generally widely dispersed from one another, such as across the continental United States. Search queries submitted by users at one of the clients 102 to the search engine system 112 are routed to an appropriate backend as part of the Domain Name System (DNS), based on current load, geographic locality and/or whether that data center is operating.
- DNS Domain Name System
- Each backend preferably includes multiple query servers, such as query server 114 , coupled to a communications network 106 via a network communication module 120 .
- the communications network 106 may be the Internet, but may also be any local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN).
- each query server 114 is a Web server that receives search query requests and delivers search results and alerts to new results for some prior searches in the form of web pages or feeds via HTTP, XML, RSS or similar protocols.
- the query server 114 is used within an intranet, it may be an intranet server.
- the query servers, such as query server 114 are configured to control the search and alert processes, including searching a document index, analyzing and formatting the search results.
- the query server 114 typically includes a network communications module 120 , a query receipt, processing and response module 122 , a user information processing module 124 , and a history module 128 , all interconnected.
- the network communications module 120 connects the query server 114 to the communication network 106 and enables the receipt of communications from the communication network 106 and the provision of communications to the communication network 106 bound for the client 102 or other destinations.
- the query receipt, processing and response module 122 is primarily responsible for receiving search queries, processing them and returning responses and alerts to the client 102 via the network communications module 120 .
- the history module 128 maintains a record of queries submitted by users.
- the history module maintains a record of search results sent to the users, independent of whether the users selected the results for viewing or downloading. In some embodiments, the history module also maintains a record of search results selected by the users for viewing or downloading, sometimes called click through information.
- the click through information may include statistical information, including the number of times that each search result was clicked through and/or the number of times each search result was viewed by users for more than a threshold period of time (i.e., the number of times the users clicked through each search result without navigating away from the resulting page or document in less than the threshold period of time).
- the user information processing module 124 assists in accessing, updating and modifying the user information database 116 .
- the user information database 116 stores various information about the user's activities in a user record (described below).
- the user information database 116 may store derived information about the user based on the user's activities.
- the user information database 116 stores user profiles, a portion of which are the derived information.
- the other databases 117 optionally include other databases with which the various modules in query server 114 may interact, such as a message database (electronic or otherwise), and user-created document databases (e.g., documents created from word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, or other various applications).
- the query processing controller 118 is connected to an inverse document index 130 , a document database 132 and a query cache 134 .
- the cache 134 is used to temporarily store search queries and search results, and is used to serve search results for queries submitted multiple times (e.g., by multiple users).
- the inverse document index 130 and document database 132 are sometimes collectively called the document database.
- “searching the document database” means searching the inverse document index 130 to identify documents matching a specified search query or term.
- Search rank values for the documents in the search results are conveyed to the query processing controller 118 and/or the query server 114 , and are used to construct various lists, such as a list of ordered search results, a personalized list of recommended web pages, or a list of new results for one or more prior searches by a user.
- the query processing controller 118 may transmit to the document database 132 a request for snippets of an appropriate subset of the documents in the list. For example, the query processing controller 118 may request snippets for the first fifteen or so of the documents in the list.
- the document database 132 constructs snippets based on the search query, and returns the snippets to the query processing controller 118 .
- the query processing controller 118 then returns a list of located documents with their associated links (i.e., hyperlinks) and snippets back to the query server 114 .
- the snippets are stored in the cache server 134 along with the search results.
- the query processing controller 118 may only request snippets for documents, if any, for which it is unable to obtain valid cached snippets from the cache server 134 .
- fewer and/or additional modules, functions or databases are included in the search engine 112 .
- the modules shown in FIG. 1 as being part of search engine 112 represent functions performed in an exemplary embodiment.

- the actual number of servers in search engine 112 and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary user record 400 from the user information database 116 ( FIG. 1 ) in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
- user record 400 contains a subset or a superset of the elements depicted in FIG. 4 .
- User record 400 contains a user identifier 402 that associates the information in user record 400 to a particular user or user identifier.
- the user identifier 402 is associated with a particular instance of a client application 320 .
- the user identifier is associated with a computer user (e.g., when the user logs in with a username and password).
- Event-based data 404 includes one or more events, each of which has a data type associated with it.
- event-based data includes: one or more queries 410 ; one or more result clicks 412 (i.e., the results presented in a set of search results on which the user has clicked); and one or more browsing data 416 (e.g., URLs visited, URL visit duration data, etc.).
- Event-based data 404 includes one or more elements relevant to the event. For example, in some embodiments the events in the event-based data 404 includes either or both an eventID 418 and a timestamp 420 .
- the eventID 418 is a unique identifier associated with the particular event which may be assigned by the search system in some embodiments (e.g., a 64-bit binary number).
- the timestamp 420 is a value (e.g., a 64-bit binary number) representing the date and/or time at which the particular event record in event-based data 404 was created or at which the particular event occurred.
- one or more of the query events 410 , and one or more of the result clicks 412 include a query portion 421 which includes zero or more query terms associated with the recorded event.
- the query portion indicates the query string to which the event is associated (e.g., what query produced the results that the user clicked-though).
- the query portion 421 includes a pointer or identifier to the query event 410 associated with the result click (e.g., an eventID).
- the query portion 421 may additionally identify a “related query”.
- the related query may be a query related to an initial query that contains a misspelling. In some instances is it more desirable to associate the event with the corrected query rather than the query containing the spelling mistake.
- the search system 112 may generate “related queries” automatically based on the user's entered query.
- one or more of the queries 410 , result clicks 412 , and/or browsing data 416 include one or more contentIDs 422 that identify content associated with the particular event.
- the contentIDs 422 can represent the URLs or URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier) of search results that have been sent to the user.
- the contentID 422 can represent the URL or URI that has been clicked on by the user.
- the contentID 422 can be the content identifier used to identify the location of the browse event (e.g., URL, data location, or other similar identifier).
- the contentID 422 may be a document identifier that identifies a document in a document repository.
- the event-based data has a history score 425 .
- An event's history score 425 may be calculated in any of a number of different ways or combinations of ways.
- the history score 425 may be a time-based ranking value that may be periodically modified based on a length of time that has passed since the event was recorded. In some embodiments, the value of the history score decreases as the time from the recordation increases.
- event data having a time-based ranking value below a threshold may be deleted. The values can be determined and re-determined periodically at various points in time. In some cases, removal of one or more events triggers a re-determination of one or more derived values as described above.
- the history score 425 is determined in response to a request instead of being determined during batch or off-line processing.
- a browsing event 416 indicates a particular browsing event not associated with a query, but instead, with some other user activity (e.g., user selection of a link in a web page, or an email message, or a word processing document).
- This other user activity can be identified in an information field 426 .
- the information field 426 stores ranking values associated with the event. Such ranking values can be system generated, user created, or user modified (e.g., PageRank for URLs, or a value assigned to the event by the user).
- Other examples of user activity include, but are not limited to web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, word processing, participation in chat rooms, software application execution and Internet telephone calls.
- derived data 406 includes one or more information fields 428 containing information derived from the event-based data 404 .
- the information field 428 represents a user profile which is generated from one or more of the user's query events 410 , results click events 412 , and browsing events 416 .
- a user profile may be created indicating levels of interest in various topic categories (e.g., a weighted set of Open Directory Project (“http://dmoz.org) topics”).
- the derived data 406 includes one or more pairs of a score 432 associated with particular contentID 434 .
- the score 432 represents a derived score assigned to the content associated with the contentID 434 (e.g., a web page).
- the score 432 can be based on one or more of a number of different factors.
- the score 432 incorporates the number of times that a user has clicked on the contentID over a period of time (which may include click throughs as a result of search queries and/or browsing activities).
- the score 432 incorporates a time duration that the user is estimated to have been looking at the content (a stay-time).
- the score 432 incorporates a time since the user last viewed the content.
- the score 432 may be modified based on user activities. In some embodiments, the score 432 is negatively affected if the user is presented the content in a series of search results, but fails to select the content from the results page. In some embodiments, the score 432 is positively affected when the user visits locations or pages or clicks on results that are similar to the content. Similarity can be determined by a number of well-known techniques (e.g., text classifier, ODP categorization, link structure, URL, edit distance, etc.). In some embodiments, a site is defined as a logically related group of pages, or physically related pages such as pages belonging to the same URL or related URLs.
- the score 432 incorporates the number of past queries of the user for which the content was presented (e.g., a higher number of times certain content is presented to the user correlates with a higher score 432 ). In some embodiments, the score 432 incorporates the number of past queries of the user for which related content was presented (e.g., a higher number of times related content is presented to the user as a result of the user's queries correlates with a higher score 432 ).
- derived data 406 includes aggregate scores. For example, the same query may be generated by the user multiple times and in some embodiments each occurrence will have a different eventID. Accordingly, in some embodiments, an aggregate score is maintained for events that occur multiple times. The aggregate score can be computed by any of a number of different methods. A reference to the multiple events and to the aggregate score can be maintained in the derived data 406 .

- FIG. 5 shows processes performed by search engine 112 . It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that one or more of the acts described may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems.
- client 102 prior to sending Internet usage data for a computer user, client 102 receives login information for the user, such as a username and password, and sends the information to search engine 112 via communications network 106 .
- Search engine 112 receives and verifies the login information, thereby enabling search engine 112 to associate subsequent data received from client 102 (e.g., Internet usage data such as event-based data 404 ) with a particular user record 400 in user information database 116 .
- the user may be identified using a cookie stored on the client 102 , or by a user identifier that is stored by and associated with a browser toolbar or browser extension.
- the user may pre-approve the use of the user's Internet usage data.
- Query server 114 in search engine 112 accesses ( 502 ) Internet usage data for a computer user (e.g., data in user record 400 ).
- the usage data include a plurality of search queries by the user (e.g., queries 421 in query events 410 ).
- the Internet usage data are grouped into query sessions, as described below.
- query server 114 identifies ( 504 ) search queries in the plurality of search queries that meet predefined query selection criteria for queries that correspond to continuing interests of the user.
- the identifying of search queries is performed without explicit input from the user identifying search queries that are continuing interests of the user.
- the predefined query selection criteria include a score derived from a combination of at least some of the Internet usage data.
- query server 114 determines whether the user found what she was looking for, and how interested she is in seeing new results? First, it would appear that the user was interested in finding an answer, since she spent a considerable amount of time in the session, viewed a number of pages, and performed a large number of refinements (query refinements, next pages, etc.). Second, query server 114 might also guess that the user did not find what she was looking for, because the session ended with her looking at a number of search results pages, but not actually clicking on anything. Finally, it is not as clear what the duration of the user's information need is. However, because this query topic seems to address a work-related need, query server 114 might guess that the user needs to find a solution immediately, or in the near future. Thus, from this example we can see how query server 114 might determine search queries that correspond to continuing interests with signals such as duration of the session, number of actions, ordering of actions, and so on.
- query server 114 evaluates a “query session”, i.e., all actions associated with a given initial query. Such actions can include result clicks, spelling corrections, viewing additional pages of results, and query refinements.
- a query is a “query refinement” of the previous query if both queries contain at least one common term.
- refinement we will use the term refinement to more broadly refer to spelling corrections, next pages, and query refinements.
- query server 114 evaluates a user's continuing interest in a query session, rather than a specific query, it needs to determine the actual query to make recommendations for.
- a session may consist of many query refinements, so which should be used?
- query server 114 uses the query refinement that is directly followed by the largest number of result clicks. If two or more query refinements are tied (with respect to number of result clicks), then query server 114 chooses the refinement for which the total duration of clicks is longest. For example, in the query session shown in Table 1, query server 114 will register the query “html encode java” because it has four result clicks, while “html encode java utility” has only one.
- Query selection criteria that query server 114 can use to identify queries that correspond to continuing interests of the user include, without limitation, the following Internet usage data of the user:
- an interest score for query sessions is defined that correlates with the continuing interest the user has in a query session.
- the predefined query selection criteria for queries that correspond to continuing interests of the user may require that the interest score be above a threshold value.
- Boolean criteria are not incorporated into the interest score, but can still be used as part of the query selection criteria.
- Query server 114 reruns ( 506 ) at least some of the identified search queries.
- the rerunning is performed automatically by search engine 112 at predefined times.
- the predefined times include the times of periodic events (e.g., monthly, weekly, daily, twice per day, hourly, or the like) or the times of episodic events (e.g., in response to the occurrence of any one of a predefined set of trigger conditions, such as when the user logs in to the search engine or to another server or service).

- Query server 114 evaluates ( 604 ) the produced search results to select search results that meet predefined search result selection criteria.
- At least one of the criteria is based on Internet usage data for the user (e.g., data such as event-based data 404 for the user).
- the criteria include a requirement that selected search results are not present in query event data 410 for the user.
- the criteria include a requirement that selected search results are not present in the Internet usage data for the user.
- the predefined search result selection criteria identify search results deemed likely to be relevant to the computer user.
- Exemplary search result selection criteria may include, without limitation:
- a quality score for the search results is defined that correlates with search results deemed likely to be relevant to the computer user.
- quality scores are merely exemplary. Other scores can be constructed where higher score values correlate with higher likelihood of relevance to the user.
- the predefined result selection criteria for results that correspond to relevant new pages to the user may require that the quality score be above a threshold value.

-
- Number of query terms—A larger number of terms tends to indicate a more specific need, which in turn might correlate with shorter interest duration and lower likelihood of prior fulfillment.
- Number of clicks and number of refinements—The more actions a user takes on behalf of a query (e.g., clicks on query results), the more interested she is likely to be in the query. In addition, a high number of refinements probably implies low likelihood of prior fulfillment.
- History match score—If a query matches the interests displayed by a user through past queries and clicks, then interest level is probably high. A history match score may be generated in a number of ways, such as that described by Sugiyama, Hatano, and Yoshikawa in “Adaptive web search based on user profile constructed without any effort from users” in Proc. of WWW, 2004.
- Navigational queries—A navigational query is one in which the user is looking for a specific web site, rather than information from a web page. In some embodiments, it is assumed that if the user clicks on only a single result and makes no subsequent refinements, the query is either navigational, or answerable by a single good website. In this case, there is a high likelihood of prior fulfillment and low interest level.
- Repeated non-navigational queries—If a user repeats a query over time, she is likely to be interested in seeing further results. Note, however, that navigational queries which are often repeated, but for which the user does not care to see additional results, should be eliminated. In some embodiments,
query server 114 only considers a query that has been repeated, and for which the user has clicked on multiple or different clicks the most recent two times the query was submitted. - Session duration—Longer sessions might imply higher interest.
- Query topic—Leisure-related topics such as sports and travel might be more interesting than work-related topics.
- Number of “long clicks”—A user might quickly click through many results on a query she is not interested in, so the number of long clicks—where the user views a page for many seconds—may be a better indicator than the number of any kind of click.
- Whether the session ended with a refinement—Sessions that end with a refinement may be indicative of queries for which the user would want to see further results.
i score =a log(#clicks+#refinements)+b·log(#repetitions)+c·(history match score)
where a, b, and c are constants. It should be clear that this score is merely exemplary. Other scores can be constructed where higher score values correlate with higher continuing user interest. In some embodiments, the predefined query selection criteria for queries that correspond to continuing interests of the user may require that the interest score be above a threshold value.
-
- History presence—In some embodiments, some or all the URLs sent to a user for her past queries are stored, for example in user record 400. If a page appears in this history, it is not selected. In some embodiments, if a page appears anywhere in the user record (e.g., as a
contentID 422 in user record 400), it is not selected. In some embodiments, to err on the side of high precision but low recall, a URL from any domain the user has seen is not recommended. - Rank—If a result R is ranked very highly by a search engine, it may be concluded that R is a good page relative to other results for the query. In addition, if it is also a new result, this indicates that the result R is new or was recently promoted.
- Popularity and relevance (PR) score—Results for keyword queries are assigned relevance scores based on the relevance of the document to the query—for example, by term frequency inverse document frequency (TFxIDF) analysis, anchor text analysis, etc. In addition, major search engines utilize static scores, such as PageRank, that reflect the query-independent popularity of the page. The higher the absolute values of these scores, the better a result should be.
- Above Dropoff—If the PR scores of a few results are much higher than the scores of all remaining results, these top results might be authoritative with respect to this query. In some embodiments, a result R is “above the dropoff” if there is a 30% PR score dropoff between two consecutive results in the top 5, and if R is ranked above this dropoff point. This dropoff formula is merely exemplary. Analogous formulas can be used to create other dropoff criteria.
- Days elapsed since query submission—This selection criterion is based on the hypothesis that the more days that have elapsed since the query was submitted, the more likely it is for interesting new results to exist. However, to date this criterion has not effected the recommendation quality.
- Sole changed result—This criterion refers to a result that is the only new result in the top N results, where N is an integer (e.g., N=6). This selection criterion is based on the hypothesis that such results are not a product of rank fluctuation. However, to date this criterion has been inversely correlated with recommendation quality.
- All poor signal—This criterion refers to when all top N results (e.g., N=10) for a query have PR scores below a threshold value. This selection criterion is based on the hypothesis that if every result for a query has low score, then the query has no good pages to recommend.
- History presence—In some embodiments, some or all the URLs sent to a user for her past queries are stored, for example in user record 400. If a page appears in this history, it is not selected. In some embodiments, if a page appears anywhere in the user record (e.g., as a
q score =a·(PR score)+b·(rank)
where a and b are constants
q score *=c·(PR score)+d·(1/rank)
where c and d are constants,
