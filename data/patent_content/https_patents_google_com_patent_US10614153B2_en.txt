Definitions
- first-party content providers can provide information for public presentation on resources, for example web pages, documents, applications, and/or other resources.
- Excessive network transmissions, packet-based or otherwise, of network traffic data between computing devices can prevent a computing device from properly processing the network traffic data, completing an operation related to the network traffic data, or timely responding to the network traffic data.
- the excessive network transmissions of network traffic data can also complicate data routing or degrade the quality of the response if the responding computing device is at or above its processing capacity, which may result in inefficient bandwidth utilization.
- the control of network transmissions corresponding to content item objects can be complicated by the large number of content item objects that can initiate network transmissions of network traffic data between computing devices.
- One implementation relates to a method for selecting and serving a content item based on a determined content item size for a resource.
- the present disclosure is generally directed to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission and processing over disparate computing resources. It is challenging for disparate computing resource to efficiently process instructions to serve content in, for example, a text or voice-based computing environment. For example, the disparate computing resources may not have access to the same voice models, or may have access to out of date or unsynchronized voice models that can make it challenging to accurately and consistently parse the audio-based instructions.

- FIG. 11 depicts a functional diagram of thread data structure generation and communication between remote data processing systems and service provider computing devices in a voice activated data packet based computer network environment
- FIG. 12 depicts a method of serving content.
- a computing device e.g., a client device
- can view a resource such as a web page
- a server such as a web page server
- the resource includes first-party content that is the subject of the resource from a first-party content provider, as well as additional third-party provided content, such as digital content or other content.
- Website visitors use a wide range of devices with a wide range of screen sizes for viewing web pages. Accordingly, the presentation of the resource may be modified based on the type of device requesting the resource (e.g., a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile device, etc.), a screen size of the device requesting the resource, and/or a viewable size of the first-party content on the client device.
- Such responsive web design enables the resource to be displayed in an aesthetically pleasing manner to an end user based on the client device and/or how the first-party content is being displayed on the client device.
- website owners manually decide what sizes of third-party content items they want for to be displayed with their web pages. That is, the presentation of third-party content items may be specified for the different types of devices requesting the resource, the different screen sizes, and/or the different viewable sizes of the first-party content such that the third-party content item does not dominate the viewable area of the device, yet is not overly small relative to the first-party content of the resource. For example, a large third-party content item that looks good and converts well on a large desktop screen may be too large on a mobile device.
- a third-party content item that is of a small size, such as 320 pixels (px) by 50 pixels, designed to be presented on small displays of mobile devices may not be noticeable on a large desktop screen.
- the selection and serving of the third-party content item may be in response to a request to access a web page from a web page server and/or a client device that communicates with a data processing system, such as a content item selection system, to request a content item to be presented with the requested web page.
- the content item selection system can select a third-party content item and provide data to effect presentation of the content item with the requested web page on a display of the client device.
- the content item is selected and served with a resource associated with a search query.
- a search engine may return search results on a search results web page and may include third-party content items related to the search query in one or more content item slots of the search results web page.
- a device identifier is associated with the client device.
- the device identifier may include a randomized number associated with the client device to identify the device during subsequent requests for resources and/or content items.
- the device identifier is configured to store and/or cause the client device to transmit information related to the client device to the content item selection system and/or resource server (e.g., a web browser type, an operating system, prior resource requests, prior content item requests, etc.).
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- a third-party content provider when providing third-party content items for presentation with requested resources via the Internet or other network, may utilize a content item management service to control or otherwise influence the selection and serving of the third-party party content items.
- a third-party content provider may specify selection criteria (such as keywords) and corresponding bid values that are used in the selection of the third-party content items.
- the bid values may be utilized by the content item selection system in a content selection process to select and serve content items for display with a resource.
- a third-party content provider may place a bid in the content selection process that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if a user interacts with the provider's content item (e.g., the provider agrees to pay $3 if a user clicks on the provider's content item).
- a third-party content provider may place a bid in the content selection process that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if the content item is selected and served (e.g., the provider agrees to pay $0.005 each time a content item is selected and served).
- the content item selection system uses content item interaction data to determine the performance of the third-party content provider's content items.
- bids to place the third-party content items may be higher for high-performing web pages, categories of web pages, and/or other criteria, while the bids may be lower for low-performing web pages, categories of web pages, and/or other criteria.
- a web page or other resource (such as, for example, an application) includes one or more content item slots or units in which a selected and served third-party content item may be displayed.
- the code e.g., JavaScript®, HTML, etc.
- defining a content item slot for a web page or other resource may include instructions to request a third-party content item from the content item selection system to be displayed with the web page.
- Such code may be executed by the client device to perform other tasks prior to requesting the third-party content item.
- the code may be configured to automatically determine the size for a content item to be presented with the resource based on a type of the client device, a screen size of the client device, a viewable size of the first-party content on the client device, and/or the size of a parent element to the content item slot or unit of the resource such that the request sent to the content item selection system results in an appropriately sized content item for the resource presented on the display of the client device.
- Such responsive content item slots or units provide first-party content providers with an easy solution and implementation for presenting third-party content items without having to manually define the sizes for content items for the various sizes that the first-party content may be displayed at.

- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine the amount of time by differencing a time stamp corresponding to when the client device transmits the audio signals and a time stamp corresponding to when the client device receives the response from the NLP component.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine the quality of the response by parsing data packets comprising the response. For example, the feedback monitor component 120 can parse and analyze the text of the response, the accuracy of the response, or the relevancy of the response to the query from the client device. The feedback monitor component 120 can perform this assessment by providing the query to another NLP component and compare the responses from the two NLP components. The feedback monitor component 120 can perform this assessment by providing the query and response to a third party assessor.

- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine a quality level based on an amount of silence from the client device (e.g., absence of audio signals).
- the absence of audio signals can be identified based on the SNR from the client device being less than a threshold (e.g., 6 dB, 3 dB, or 0 dB).
- the feedback monitor component can measure the characteristic based on a duration of the communication session. For example, a duration greater than a threshold can indicate that the end user of the client device was satisfied with the communication session. However, a long duration combined with other characteristics such as an increased amplitude of audio signals, repeated queries, and decreased tempo may indicate a low quality since the user of the client may have spent an unnecessary or unwanted extended amount of time engaged with the communication session.
- the NLP component can perform a semantic analysis on the queries transmitted by the client device to determine that the client device repeatedly transmits the same or similar queries even though the NLP component is generated and providing responses.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine, based on the number of repeat queries within a time interval (or sequentially repeated queries) exceeding a threshold (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more), that the quality level is low.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine the quality of the communication session at different parts of the communication session (e.g., beginning, middle, or end; or time intervals). The for example, the feedback monitor component 120 can determine the quality of a first portion or first time interval of the communication session; and the quality of a second portion or second time interval in the communication session that is subsequent to the first portion or first time interval. The feedback monitor component 120 can compare the quality at the two portions to determine a quality of the overall communication session. For example, a difference in quality between the two portions that is greater than a threshold can indicate a low quality, inconsistent quality, or unreliable quality.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine the quality based on a characteristic of the communication session or at least a portion thereof.
- the characteristic can include, for example, at least one of amplitude, frequency, tempo, tone, and pitch.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can use the characteristic to determine a reaction of the user of the client device or sentiment of the use of the client. For example, if the amplitude of the audio signals transmitted by the client device increases after each response from the NLP, the feedback monitor can determine that the end user is frustrated with the NLP component generated responses.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can compare the amplitude of the audio signals detected by the client device with a threshold or with other audio signals received by the client device during the same communication session or different communication sessions.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine the quality based on a characteristic such as the tempo or pitch of the audio signals detected by the client device and transmitted to the NLP component.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can determine, for example, that a slowing down of the tempo (e.g., rate of words spoken per time interval) after each NLP response can indicate that the end user is not satisfied with the response generated by the NLP component and is repeating it slower to allow the NLP component to better parse the audio signals and improve the response.
- an increase or steady tempo can indicate that the use of the client device is satisfied with the responses generated by the NLP and has confidence in the responses.
- an increase in the pitch of the audio signals detected by the client device can indicate a poor quality of responses from the NLP or lack of confidence in the responses.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can transmit queries to the client device to measure or determine the quality. For example, the feedback monitor component 120 can transmit survey questions to the end user asking about the quality of the communication session, NLP component, or provider device. In some cases, the feedback monitor component 120 can generate the query responsive to the feedback monitor component 120 determining that a first quality signal is below a threshold. For example, the feedback monitor component 120 can determine a first quality signal based on measuring the quality using characteristics such as the increase in amplitude of the audio signals detected by the client device in combination with the decrease in tempo of the audio signals detected by the client device. The feedback monitor component 120 can generate a quality signal indicating a low level of quality based on the combined characteristics of amplitude and tempo.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can generate and transmit a query to the client device that either implicitly or explicitly enquires about the quality of the communication session (e.g., How satisfied are you with the responses generated by the NLP component?; How satisfied are you with the communication session?).
- the data processing system can determine a quality based on whether the service provider 108 can provide the requested service. For example, the end user may request a product or service, but the service provider 108 responds stating that they do not have that product or cannot perform that service, which can cause the end user to indicate frustration with the service provider 108 . The data processing system 101 can identify this frustration, and assign a quality accordingly.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can measure the characteristic based on network activity on multiple electronic surfaces, and aggregate the quality measured from the multiple electronic surfaces to generate a summed quality signal.
- the summed quality signal can be an average, weighted average, absolute sum, or other combined quality signal value.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can further generate statistics for the combined quality signal value or perform a statistical analysis, such as determine the standard deviation, variance, 3 sigma quality, or 6 sigma qualities.
- the feedback monitor component 120 can adjust the real-time content selection process performed by the content selection system 108 . Adjusting the real-time content selection process can refer to adjusting a weight used to select the content item provided by the third-party content server 102 or service provider device 148 or third party provider device 108 that executed the NLP component used to establish the communication session with the client device 104 . For example, if the content item led to a low quality communication session, the feedback monitor component 120 can adjust an attribute or parameter of the content data 130 comprising the content item to reduce the likelihood of that content item being selected for similar action data structures or similar client devices 104 (or accounts or profiles thereof).
- the feedback monitor component 120 can prevent or block the content selection system 108 from selection, in the real-time selection process, of the content item responsive to the quality signal less than a threshold. In some cases, the feedback monitor component 120 can allow or permit the content selection system 108 to select, in the real-time selection process, the content item responsive to the quality signal greater than or equal to a threshold.
- the thread optimization component 150 can obtain or access data packets of the first and second (and any other) data transmissions.
- the direct action API 116 can provide the transmissions (e.g., the corresponding data packets) to the data repository 124 for storage, where they can be retrieved by the thread optimization component 150 .
- the thread optimization component 150 can also receive the data packets (or other protocol based structure) of the data transmissions from the direct action API 116 (or other data processing system 101 component) bypassing the data repository 124 .
- the thread optimization component 150 can parse or otherwise extract information from data packets of multiple data transmissions that correspond respectively to multiple action data structures. For example, the thread optimization component 150 can apply a heuristic technique to data packets of a first data transmission (or to the corresponding first data structure) and to data packets of a second data transmission (or to the corresponding second data structure) to determine at least one sequence dependency parameter.
- the heuristic or other statistical technique can determine or identify with a threshold degree of certainty patterns among the first and second data transmissions (or corresponding data structures) that indicate a sequence dependency of actions indicated by the data transmissions.
- the sequence dependency parameter can indicate the existence or likelihood (e.g., relative to a threshold level or other benchmark) of actions represented by the data transmissions (or corresponding action data structures) having an order of operations, time, or sequence dependency on each other.
- the sequence dependent operations or actions, indicated by the sequence dependency parameters can include a number of actions that occur in a known, suggested, required, or particular order. For example, going from home to a movie theater, then back home can include three sequence dependent operations or actions.
- the first action in this example includes travelling from home to the movie theater.
- the second action includes watching the movie in the theater.
- the third action includes returning home from the theater.
- These three (and perhaps other) actions can be determined by the direct action API 116 from requests or trigger keywords corresponding to the input audio signal “OK, I would like to catch a movie later”.
- the second action in the sequence is subsequent to and dependent on the first action (going out from home to the movie theater)
- the third action is subsequent to and dependent on the first action and the second action.
- the third action can be considered subsequent to and dependent on the second action, as having expressed an intent to do so, the data processing system 101 determines or predicts that the end user would watch the movie in the theater before returning home as well.
- the thread optimization component 150 can merge two or more packetized data transmissions (or their corresponding action data structures) into a single thread.
- the single thread can include data identifying actions as well as other data (e.g., metadata or third party data) from multiple data action structures.
- the single thread can be in packetized (or other protocol based) form, e.g., in the same format as the first and second data transmissions.
- the single thread can also be in a data structure format, e.g., generated by the direct action API 116 , or following a format of at least one template 132 , policy 128 , or parameter 126 .
- the single thread can include or indicate an association or linking of actions from one or more data transmissions, or from one or more action data structures.
- the data transmissions or action data structures can be merged or otherwise associated with one another by the thread optimization component 150 to generate the single thread prior to transmission of the data indicated by the action data structures via the communication session to the service provider computing device 148 .
- the direct action API 116 or other data processing system 101 component e.g., the interface 146
- the data processing system 101 may have delayed, prevented withheld, or not transmitted data associated with the first or second (or any other) data structure.
- at least some of the data indicated by individual data structures can be provided by and from the data processing system 101 to the service provider computing device 148 prior to creation of the single thread.
- the thread optimization component 150 can merge or otherwise consolidate or associate the data transmissions (or corresponding action data structures) into the single thread based on the sequence dependency parameter.
- the first data transmission (and first data structure) can represent actions associated with the first input audio signal “OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight”
- the second data transmission (and second data structure) can represent actions associated with the second input audio signal “OK, I would like to catch a movie later”.
- the first and second (or any other) input audio signals can be sequential (following on another by less than one minute), separated from one another by time (e.g., greater than one minute), and can originate from the same or different client computing devices 110 .
- the thread optimization component 150 can obtain data packets (or other data) representing this information, and can determine at least one sequence dependency parameter.
- the sequence dependency parameter can indicate that the action of returning home from the movie theater occurs after the action of watching the movie, or that the action of watching the movie occurs or is predicted to occur after the action of eating dinner.
- the single thread (in any data structure or format) can indicate a set of sequence dependent operations that correspond to one or more input audio signals (or corresponding data structures or data transmissions), such as a series of actions.
- the thread can include any two or more actions, such as a first action, a second action, and a third action.
- a merger of the first input audio signal “OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight,” and the second input audio signal “OK, I would like to catch a movie later” can include at least one request indicating an interest to attend dinner and a movie, and at least one trigger keyword, e.g., “go” indicating a need for transportation.
- the thread optimization component 150 can identify at least one sequence dependency parameter indicating at least one sequence, temporal, or order of operations dependency between the actions and can generate the single thread to combine the multiple input audio signals (or corresponding template based data structures or packet/protocol based data transmissions).
- the thread optimization component 150 can create the single thread that indicates at least three actions, such as a dinner action (first action), a movie action (second action), and a transportation home action (third action).
- the thread optimization component 150 generates a single thread from multiple separate inputs that indicates the three actions.
- the single thread can include other actions, such as an initial transport to dinner action.
- the data processing system 101 or component thereof such as the thread optimization component 150 can determine that the actions of the thread are sequence dependent operations. For example, the thread optimization component can determine that the second action of watching the movie is subsequent to the first action of eating dinner, and that the third action of travelling home from the movie theater is after the second action of watching the movie.
- the thread optimization component 150 can access the parameters 126 or policies 128 in the data repository 124 to determine or otherwise estimate the order of the sequence dependent actions.
- the parameters 126 or policies 128 could indicate that a transport action (e.g., a taxi home) can occur after an event action (e.g., watching a movie).
- the content selection system 108 can obtain indications of any of the actions of the single thread.
- the thread optimization component 150 can directly or indirectly (e.g., via the data repository 124 ) provide at least a portion of the single thread that indicates the third (or any other) action to the content selection system 108 .
- the content selection system 108 can obtain this information from the data repository 124 , where it can be stored as part of the content data 130 .
- the indication of the third action can inform the content selection system 108 of a need for transportation from the location of the movie theater to a location as determined or indicated by the client computing device 110 , such as a ride to an end destination.
- the content selection system 108 can obtain indications of a later action in the thread prior to the occurrence of at least one earlier action. For example, the content selection system 108 can receive an indication of the third action (e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater) before the movie plays in the theater (second action), or before the person who input the input audio signal into the client computing device 110 eats dinner at the restaurant (first action). The content selection system 108 can obtain indications of at least one action of the thread before completion of at least one action of the thread.
- the third action e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater
- second action e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater
- first action e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater
- the content selection system 108 can obtain indications of at least one action of the thread before completion of at least one action of the thread.

- the content item can be responsive or related to the third (or any other) action.
- the content item can include an audio message offering services of a car share company, responsive to the third action that indicates a transportation need.
- the content selection system 108 can query the data repository 124 to select or otherwise identify the content item, e.g., from the content data 130 .
- the content selection system 108 can also select the content item from the third-party content server 102 .
- the third-party content server 102 can provide a content item to the data processing system 101 (or component thereof) for eventual output by the client computing device 110 .
- the audio signal generator component 122 can generate or otherwise obtain an output signal that includes the content item responsive to the third (or any other) action.
- the data processing system 101 can execute the audio signal generator component to generate or create an output signal corresponding to the content item.
- the interface 146 of the data processing system 101 can provide or transmit one or more data packets that include the output signal via the computer network 165 to the client computing device 110 , e.g., as part of the communication session.
- the interface 146 can be designed, configured, constructed, or operational to receive and transmit information using, for example, data packets.
- the interface 146 can receive and transmit information using one or more protocols, such as a network protocol.
- the interface 146 can include a hardware interface, software interface, wired interface, or wireless interface.
- the interface 146 can facilitate translating or formatting data from one format to another format.
- the interface 146 can include an application programming interface that includes definitions for communicating between various components, such as software components of the system 100 .
- the data processing system 101 can provide the output signal from the data repository 124 or from the audio signal generator component 122 to the client computing device 110 .
- the data processing system 101 can also instruct, via data packet transmissions, the third-party content server 102 or the service provider computing device 148 to provide the output signal to the client computing device 110 .
- the output signal can be obtained, generated, transformed to or transmitted as one or more data packets (or other communications protocol) from the data processing system 101 (or other computing device) to the client computing device 110 .
- the content selection system 108 can skip to a later action in a set of sequence dependent operations indicated by the single thread to select a content item for the later action prior to occurrence (and prior to an immediate need) for activity corresponding to the later action.
- a later sequenced action e.g., to select a content item for the second subsequent action prior to selecting a content item for a first prior action
- the data processing system 101 is not required to first process information related to the prior action to select content items for subsequent actions. This reduces processor utilization, power consumption and bandwidth from data transmissions that would otherwise be associated with selecting a content item (for the first action) prior to selecting the content item for the second action.
- the content selection system 108 can select the content item for the (subsequent or later) action as part of a real-time content selection process.
- the content item can be provided to the client computing device for transmission as audio output in a conversational manner in direct response to the input audio signal.
- the real-time content selection process to identify the content item and provide the content item to the client computing device 110 can occur within one minute or less from the time of the input audio signal and be considered real-time.

- the threshold value may be a value between 10%, inclusive, to 50%, inclusive. In one implementation the threshold value may be 15%. In other implementations, the first-party content provider may specify the threshold value.
- a standard content item size in the ranking may be whether the width of the standard content item size exceeds a width of the viewport, whether the height of the standard content item size exceeds a height of the viewport, and/or whether the standard content item size is an excluded geometric type based on the value or values of the variable of data-ad-format.
- each standard content item size of the set of standard content item sizes may be ranked.

- the estimated revenue value for a predetermined standard content item size may a value that is publisher-specific, website specific, webpage specific, and/or location-specific.
- the ratio match value provides a measure of how well suited the predetermined standard content item size is for the portion of the resource where a third-party content item will be served.
- the ratio match value may be based on a width of a parent element and a width of the viewport.
- vertical standard content item sizes may be preferable to be displayed in narrow columnar portions of the displayed resource
- horizontal standard content item sizes may be preferable to be displayed in wide portions of the displayed resource
- rectangular standard content item sizes may be preferable to be displayed in the remaining portions of the displayed resource.
- an if-then statement may be used to sort standard content item sizes based on the ratio match value. For example:
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an implementation of a first-party resource 400 shown in a viewport 402 .
- the resource 400 includes multiple divisions of elements 404 , 406 , 408 , 410 and showing an example third-party content item 420 having a standard content item size of 728 pixels by 90 pixels in a parent element 410 .
- the parent element 410 has a width of 800 pixels and spans across the entire width of the viewport 402 .
- the standard content item size that does not exceed the width of the parent element 410 and occupies the highest percentage of the width of the parent element 410 is the standard content item size of 728 pixels by 90 pixels; an example third-party content item 420 of this size is shown within the parent element 410 .
- the ratio match value for the standard content item size of 728 px by 90 px may be determined to be 728 divided by 800, or 0.91 or 91%.
- the ratio match value may be used in the rating equation described above to determine a rating for the standard content item size such that a standard content item size with the best rating may be determined and selected.
- the other standard content item sizes may also have ratio match values determined in a similar manner.
- FIG. 5A is an illustration of an implementation of a first-party resource 500 shown in a viewport 502 .
- the resource 500 includes multiple divisions of elements 504 , 506 , 508 , 510 and showing an example third-party content item 520 having a standard content item size of 320 pixels by 50 pixels in a parent element 510 .
- the parent element 510 has a width of 320 pixels and spans 25% of the width of the viewport 502 .
- the percentage of the width of the parent element 510 that the standard content item size occupies is 100% (i.e., 320 px divided by 320 px is one).
- the standard content item size of 320 pixels by 50 pixels occupies very little vertical space of the parent element 510 .
- a second percentage may be calculated based on a remaining portion of the viewport 502 width (i.e., after subtracting the width of the parent element 510 from the total width of the viewport 502 ) and a height dimension of the standard content item size, shown in FIG. 5B .
- the width of the remaining portion of the viewport 502 in the example shown is 880 pixels (1200 pixels minus 320 pixels).
- the percentage of the height dimension of the standard content item size relative to the width of the remaining portion of the viewport 502 is 50 divided by 880, or approximately 6%.
- the ratio match value for the standard content item size of 320 pixels by 50 pixels for the parent element 510 may be the first percentage, 100% or 1.0, multiplied by the second percentage, 6% or 0.06, resulting in a ratio match value of 0.06.
- the first percentage is approximately 94% (300 pixel width for the standard content item size divided by 320 pixel width for the parent element 510 ) and the second percentage is approximately 68% (600 pixel height for the standard content item size divided by 880 pixel width of the remaining portion of the viewport 502 ).
- the ratio match value for the standard content item size of 300 pixels by 600 pixels may be 0.94 multiplied by 0.68, or approximately 0.64.
- the standard content item size of 300 pixels by 600 pixels has a greater ratio match value than the standard content item size of 320 pixels by 50 pixels, which indicates that the standard content item size of 300 pixels by 600 pixels is likely to be better suited for portion of the resource where a third-party content item will be served.
- a multiplier may be used with the second percentage of the ratio match value. For example, for a vertical standard content item size, such as 120 px by 600 px, 160 px by 600 px, or 300 px by 600 px, a multiplier for the second percentage may be zero since the vertical format may be out of proportion relative to the rest of the resource.
- the multiplier for horizontal or rectangular standard content item sizes such as 320 px by 50 px, 234 px by 60 px, 468 px by 60 px, 728 px by 90 px, 970 px by 90 px, 125 px by 125 px, 180 px by 150 px, 200 px by 200 px, 250 px by 250 px, 300 px by 250 px, or 336 px by 280 px, may be between 1, inclusive, and 2, inclusive.
- the multiplier for horizontal standard content item sizes such as 320 px by 50 px, 234 px by 60 px, 468 px by 60 px, 728 px by 90 px, or 970 px by 90 px
- the multiplier for rectangular standard content item sizes such as 125 px by 125 px, 180 px by 150 px, 200 px by 200 px, 250 px by 250 px, 300 px by 250 px, or 336 px by 280 px, may be 1.5.
- the top ranked standard content item size may be determined.
- the height value of the determined standard content item size and the width of the parent element are sent to the content item selection system, such as part of a content item request.
- the height value is set to 90 pixels, which is the height of the determined standard content item size
- the width value is set to 800 pixels, which is the width of the parent element 410 .
- the full width of the parent element 410 is sent such that, if a textual third-party content item is selected by the content item selection system, then the full width of the parent element 410 may be used for displaying the textual content item. If an image third-party content item is selected by the content item selection system then the standard content item size may be used.
- Data to effect display of the selected content item may be transmitted to the client device such that the selected content item is displayed with the resource.
- a total limit threshold value may be used such that the total area of all the content item sizes does not exceed a predetermined percentage of the viewport area or a total limit threshold value may be used such that the total area of the content item sizes above the fold do not exceed a predetermined percentage of the viewport area.

- the script may be requested and received from another device, such as the content item selection system 108 of FIG. 1A or another device.
- the script may be cached on the client device and retrieved and executed.
- the script is configured to cause the client device to locate the portions of the resource where third-party content items will be served and a size determination is needed (block 606 ).
- the script is further configured to cause the client device to determine a size of a viewport (block 608 ).
- the determination of the size of the viewport may include retrieving the values for body offsetWidth and body offsetHeight for the width and height of the body of the resource.
- the script is further configured to cause the client device to determine a width of a parent element for each portion where a third-party content item will be served (block 610 ). For example, the determination of the parent element width may be determined based on the viewport width, a parent element of the parent element, a static value for the parent element width, etc.
- the height of the parent element may also be queried and used in the determination of the content item size.

- the single thread 1000 created by the data processing system 101 can indicate an actual, known, scheduled, or estimated time of actions that correspond to the thread. These times can include movie start times, transport pick up times, dinner reservation times, or event times, among others. The times can be discrete times, e.g., 8:00 pm dinner reservations, or relative times relative to other actions, e.g., the action ‘B’ is scheduled to begin 15 minutes after the known or estimated conclusion time of action ‘A’.
- the thread 1000 can indicate that a first action (e.g., eating dinner) is scheduled to occur prior to a second action (e.g. watching a movie).
- the direct action API 116 can detect the completion of a first action.
- the client device 110 can execute a script to pay the bill at the restaurant, or the direct action API 116 can estimate that dinner will last for 90 minutes, or the end user can provide an audio input signal or other data message to indicate that the first action is complete or scheduled for completion at a time or within a time window. Responsive to detection of completion (e.g., a known or estimate end time) of a first action, the direct action API 116 can proceed to transmit data packets of the single thread to a service provider device 148 or to a third-party content server 102 .

- the direct action API 116 can identify a deadlock condition when the first action is a movie action (watching a movie in a theater) and a second action is transport home via a car share service after the movie is over.
- the direct action API 116 can determine a deadlock condition for the second action (e.g., the ride home) that lasts until a time associated with the first action, such as a scheduled end time of the movie.
- the direct action API 116 or other component such as the interface 115 can prevent transmission of the data transmission to a service provider computing device (e.g., a car share service) responsive to the deadlock condition.
- a service provider computing device e.g., a car share service
- the data processing system 101 or component thereof can prevent transmission of data packets of the data transmission (or data structure) for the action (e.g., to reserve a car) to a service provider device 148 (e.g., of a car share service) during the time period of the deadlock condition. This prevents the service provider device 148 from receiving the request for a car (or other service) too early.
- the direct action API 116 can obtain an indication or otherwise determine that the deadlock condition has terminated or no longer exists. For example, the direct action API 116 can query the service provider device 148 or other third party computing device to determine a scheduled end time of a movie or other action. Upon arrival of this time, or within a threshold time period (e.g., 30 minutes or 5 minutes) in advance of this time the direct action API can break, release, or terminate the deadlock condition. Subsequent to expiration of the deadlock condition the data processing system 101 can transmit (e.g., via the interface 146 ) to the service provider device 148 data of the data transmission or data structure corresponding to a subsequent action such as a ride home after the movie.
- a threshold time period e.g. 30 minutes or 5 minutes
- the direct action API 116 can receive an indication form the client device 110 to terminate the deadlock condition. For example, the end user may decide to leave the movie early, before the movie is finished, and can enter an input audio signal into the client computing device, e.g., “OK, this movie stinks, I'd like a ride home please”.
- the data processing system 101 e.g., the NLP component 110 or the direct action API 116
- the direct action API 116 can also provide data for an action (e.g., data of a data transmission or action data structure of the single thread 1000 ) to the third-party content server 102 to obtain a content item related to the post-deadlock action.
- the content item can be provided by the data processing system 101 or by the third-party content server 102 to the client device 110 for rendering.
- the content item can indicate, for example, “Sorry to hear about the movie, would you like to order a car from a car share company?”.
- the content selection system 108 (or other component such as the interface 146 or the direct action API 116 ) can block selection of the content item, or transmission of the selected content item to the client device 110 , responsive to a deadlock condition or until release of the deadlock condition.
- the direct action API 116 can modify sequential orders of actions indicated by the single thread 1000 .
- the direct action API can determine an indication of a first sequential order, e.g., a first action, a second action subsequent to the first action, and a third action subsequent to the second action (dinner, then a movie, then a ride home).
- the direct action API 116 and other components such as the NLP component 110 and the interface 115 can receive a request to modify the sequential order.
- the data processing system 101 can receive in input audio signal from the client computing device of “OK I'd like to eat dinner after the movie.”
- the direct action API 116 (or NLP component 110 ) can obtain from this audio input signal a request to modify the sequential order of the actions to, for example, a movie, then dinner, then a ride home. From this information, the direct action API 116 can generate a modified sequential order so that the second action (watching the movie) is now scheduled to occur prior to the first action (eating dinner).
- the direct action API 116 or content selection system 108 (or other components) can proceed accordingly to transmit data transmission of the movie action prior to data transmissions of the dinner action to the third-party content server 102 or the service provider device 148 .
- the direct action API 116 can also identify or modify a deadlock condition to delay operations related to the dinner action based on an end time of the first movie action.
- the actions of dinner, movies, and transport are examples and any number of end user activities or requests can constitute actions. The modifications can occur responsive to inputs other than the input audio signal. For example, if tickets to the 9 pm movie (after dinner) are sold out, the data processing system 101 can provide an audio output for rendering at the client device 110 to suggest watching a movie (e.g., the 5 pm showing) prior to dinner.
- the data processing system 101 can perform offline action. This can save processing and electrical power requirements and reduce or shift network traffic to off-peak times.
- the single thread 1000 can indicate a first action and a second subsequent action that depends on resolution of the first action. These actions can be days or weeks (or more) apart from one another, such as buying a plane ticket (first action, today) for a three week tropical beach vacation that will occur six months in the future, and booking scuba lessons for the last day of the vacation (second action, more than six months away).
- the direct action API 116 can communicate in real time with the service provider device 148 corresponding to an airline entity responsive to receipt of the input audio signal to buy the plane tickets in an online action to effect a conversion—the purchase of the plane tickets.
- the second action in this example remains six months away.
- the direct action API 116 or other component such as the content selection system 108 can select content items or perform other operations responsive to the second action (scuba lessons).
- the direct action API can obtain offline by obtaining this information from the data repository 124 or from a third party data repository relating to scuba lessons.
- the offline action may or may not be in real time, and an offline action does not require time separation (e.g., six months) between actions.

Abstract
Description
Rating=Area*eRPM*ratio_match
In some implementations, each multiplier in the foregoing equation may be weighted. The area of each predetermined standard content item size may be the pixel area of the predetermined standard content item size, such as 320 px by 50 px, which has an area of 16,000 pixels. The estimated revenue value for a predetermined standard content item size (i.e., estimated revenue per thousand impressions or eRPM in the equation above) may be a value determined for each predetermined standard content item size based on global data for that particular predetermined standard content item size. That is, a list of static values for each standard content item size may be used based on historical data. In other implementations, the estimated revenue value for a predetermined standard content item size may a value that is publisher-specific, website specific, webpage specific, and/or location-specific.
