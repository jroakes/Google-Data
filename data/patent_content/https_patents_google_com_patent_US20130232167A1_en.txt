- This specification generally relates to information presentation.
- Users can employ Internet-based search engine interfaces to provide search queries and to receive query results.
- Content providers can target specific search query keywords, and can sponsor content to be provided to users along with the query results.
- Some search engines may include predictive capabilities for presenting users with query suggestions, based on characters entered in a search box.
- One innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods, systems, and computer program products for targeting content to users based on receipt of partial terms.
- One example method includes identifying one or more terms associated with a campaign, the campaign having an associated content item that is presented to users responsive to requests for content, presenting a campaign sponsor with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms, receiving from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of the partial form of the term for use in targeting, and optionally presenting the content item in a search suggestion control along with search completions in response to receipt of the partial form of the term in a search control.
- Another example method includes receiving targeting criteria for a campaign, the campaign including an associated content item that is to be provided in response to a content item request, wherein the targeting criteria includes a designation of one or more partial search terms, associating a bid with each partial search term, receiving in a search control a partial query, the partial query being entered by a user though not completed by the user, determining whether the partial query matches the partial search terms associated with the campaign, and providing the content item in response to receipt of the partial query.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in computer program products that can perform operations including identifying one or more terms associated with a campaign, the campaign having an associated content item that is presented to users responsive to requests for content, presenting a campaign sponsor with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms, receiving from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of the partial form of the term for use in targeting, and presenting the content item in a search suggestion control along with search completions in response to receipt of the partial form of the term in a search control.
- a keyword identifier can identify one or more terms associated with a campaign, the campaign having an associated content item that is presented to users responsive to requests for content.
- a targeting option provider can present a campaign sponsor with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms.
- a targeting selection receiver can receive from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of the partial form of the term for use in targeting.
- a keyword receiver can receive the partial form of the term.
- a content item provider can present the content item along with suggested search completions.
- Identifying one or more terms can includes receiving the one or more terms from the campaign sponsor.
- Presenting the campaign sponsor with an option can include presenting the campaign sponsor a control for selecting one or more partial forms for targeting.
- Presenting the campaign sponsor a control can include presenting suggestions for partial forms for targeting.
- Presenting the campaign sponsor a control can include presenting estimated reach information for each partial form suggested.
- Receiving the selection can include receiving a bid to be associated with the partial form of the term.

- the partial form can include the first few letters of the term.
- the partial form can be a word in a phrase.
- the partial form in the content item can be highlighted when presenting the content item to users.
- An auction can be conducted for all campaigns that targeted the partial search terms, including evaluating bids and associated quality scores for the campaign and presenting a content item from one or more winning campaigns in a search suggestion control responsive to receipt of the partial query.
- campanhas may employ online interfaces to evaluate various targeting options regarding partial keyword forms, and to make appropriate targeting decisions based on the circumstances of their particular campaigns.
- Campaign sponsors may increase their potential exposure to users.
- System users may receive sponsored content suggestions based on the submission of a minimal number of keystrokes, or a single keystroke, improving system response times and content relevance for users.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to users in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers, and a content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content providers 108 .
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- a request for a resource 105 or a search query 116 sent from a user device 106 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of the user device 106 .
- the search system 112 can access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the content information system 110 can update usage information 124 for a user, based on activity of the user, subject to the user's express permission. For example, the user may receive notice of what data may be collected and how such data may be used or retained, and may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs that may collect personalized information. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable data is removed.
- the usage information 124 can include, for example, information about past user activities, such as past requests for resources 105 , past search queries 116 , other requests for content, websites visited, or interactions with content. In some implementations, the usage information 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content. In some implementations, the usage information 124 can include, for each entry, a cookie identifying the user, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requesting user device 106 , a type of usage, and details associated with the usage
- the content management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page.
- the data representing the resource 105 can include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented.
- An example slot is an ad slot.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- Information about slots can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- keywords or portions of keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords (or portions of keywords) or search queries 116 .
- content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords (or portions thereof) or the search query 116 are selected as eligible content items by the content management system 110 .
- a targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a search query 116 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword or search query 116 .
- a content item e.g., an advertisement
- the targeting keyword “automobiles” can be an eligible content item (or an eligible ad) for a content item request that includes the resource keyword “automobiles.”
- the ad can be selected as an eligible content item for a request including the search query “automobiles.”
- partial keyword forms may be considered when matching targeting keywords with resource keywords or search queries.
- a content item associated with a partial form of a targeting keyword can be selected as an eligible content item for a request including similar partial resource keywords or partial search queries.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource 105 or search results page 118 based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive bids from content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 105 or search results page 118 .
- content providers 108 e.g., advertisers
- the bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 105 or search results page 118 .
- a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each one thousand impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 that can target content items to users based on receipt of partial terms (e.g., keywords).
- FIG. 2 also illustrates an example flow of data within the system 200 during states (A) to (G), where the states (A) to (G) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. For example, two or more of the states (A) to (G) may occur concurrently.
- the system 200 can provide suggestions, for instance, as completions in the form of multi-term phrases or dominant queries that are derived from the received user input.
- a content management system 210 included in the system 200 can evaluate the user input as received and identify one or more completions based on the user input. Based on the completions, one or more associated content items can be identified.
- Ones of the completions e.g., popular ones
- the additional content items can be merged with selected ones of the completions and provided for display to the user.
- the suggestions can be displayed in proximity to or in an augmented form of the control that receives the user input.
- the suggestions and associated content can be included in an answer box that is displayed in proximity to the control (e.g., a search query box).
- ads, navigational links, static content, video content, or other content can be displayed in an answer box adjacent to (e.g., directly below) an input control (e.g., a search query box) on the user's computer screen.
- the suggestions and additional content items can appear on the user's screen in an answer box or other form of display element after the user has entered just a portion (e.g., a character, a few characters, etc.) of the query, such as after the input is sufficient to generate useful suggestions.
- one or more content items are provided along with one or more suggestions for completing the user input.
- the content items can be included along with the suggestions or presented in a separate augmented form of the control (e.g., expanded textual input box or drop down box).
- the user input received and processed to determine suggestions and related content is referred to herein as a prefix.
- the prefix can constitute one or more textual characters that are entered by/received from the user.
- a completion refers to a particular completed request, and can be based on historical processing of other requests. For example, a completion can be of the form of words or phrases that embody the request the user is providing, as evaluated as a portion of that request is entered.
- the suggestions and/or additional content (e.g., advertisements) returned by the content management system 210 can correspond to content exactly matching the prefix entered by the user.
- the system 200 can generate suggestions and locate additional content items related to the subject of bicycles, such as suggestions for ads for local bicycle shops.
- additional content items related to the subject of bicycles such as suggestions for ads for local bicycle shops.
- the information returned by the content management system 210 can be based on the user's interests, profile information, geographical location, etc. These additional criteria can be combined for use with the user's input in order to provide targeted content.
- the system 200 can include one or more client devices 202 (each operated by a corresponding device user 204 ) that communicate over one or more networks 206 with one or more computing servers 208 .

- campaign sponsors can provide one or more keywords associated with a campaign.
- Campaigns may include actions for reaching users, or particular categories (e.g., based on user demographics, locations, and/or profiles) of users.
- Campaign sponsors may include entities (e.g., organizations, businesses, individuals, etc.) that intend to target content items (e.g., advertisements) to system users (e.g., the user 204 b ) during one or more campaigns.
- the user 204 a can employ the client device 202 a to interact with an interface 230 (shown here as interface 230 a ).
- the user 204 a may be a representative, agent, and/or employee of campaign sponsor 240 (e.g., “Example Motors”, an automobile dealership).
- the interface 230 may be an online interface (e.g., a web page) provided by the content management system 210 , and may include various controls (e.g., output, input, command, etc.) for presenting information to and receiving information from campaign sponsors via networks 206 a, to facilitate campaign configuration and management by the sponsors.
- the user 204 a e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240
- the content management system 210 can employ the keyword identifier 212 to identify one or more keywords (e.g., “example”, “motors”) included in the phrase.
- the content management system 210 can identify keywords associated with the sponsor from the keywords data store 222 , and can identify associated content items (e.g., including text, images, video, audio, web links, etc.) from the content data store 224 .
- campaign sponsors can be presented with options to target content items to users based on receipt of partial forms of one or more keywords.
- the content management system 210 can employ the targeting option provider 214 to provide one or more targeting options 242 to the user 204 a (e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240 ) via the interface 230 (shown here as interface 230 b ).
- the targeting options 242 may include one or more partial form suggestions, and estimated reach information for each partial form suggested, based on the identified keywords.
- the targeting options 242 for the identified keyword “example” includes various partial forms of the keyword, including the letter “e” (with an estimated reach of one million impressions), the letters “ex” (with an estimated reach of ten thousand impressions), the letters “exe” (with an estimated reach of one thousand impressions), and the letters “exam” (with an estimated reach of fifty impressions).
- partial keyword forms with few letters may have greater estimated reach (and thus, may be more expensive in a bidding environment) than partial keyword forms with many letters.
- partial keyword forms with many letters may be considered by campaign sponsors as having greater potential for targeting than partial keyword forms with few letters.
- potential trade-offs may exist between various keyword forms.
- Campaign sponsors may employ the interface 230 , for example, to evaluate various targeting options, and to make suitable targeting decisions based on their preferences and on the circumstances of their particular campaigns. Detailed examples of the interface 230 are presented below (refer to FIGS. 3 and 4 ).
- selections of designations of partial keyword forms can be received from campaign sponsors.
- the user 204 a e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240

- This specification generally relates to information presentation.
- Users can employ Internet-based search engine interfaces to provide search queries and to receive query results. Content providers can target specific search query keywords, and can sponsor content to be provided to users along with the query results. Some search engines may include predictive capabilities for presenting users with query suggestions, based on characters entered in a search box.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods, systems, and computer program products for targeting content to users based on receipt of partial terms. One example method includes identifying one or more terms associated with a campaign, the campaign having an associated content item that is presented to users responsive to requests for content, presenting a campaign sponsor with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms, receiving from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of the partial form of the term for use in targeting, and optionally presenting the content item in a search suggestion control along with search completions in response to receipt of the partial form of the term in a search control.
- Another example method includes receiving targeting criteria for a campaign, the campaign including an associated content item that is to be provided in response to a content item request, wherein the targeting criteria includes a designation of one or more partial search terms, associating a bid with each partial search term, receiving in a search control a partial query, the partial query being entered by a user though not completed by the user, determining whether the partial query matches the partial search terms associated with the campaign, and providing the content item in response to receipt of the partial query.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in computer program products that can perform operations including identifying one or more terms associated with a campaign, the campaign having an associated content item that is presented to users responsive to requests for content, presenting a campaign sponsor with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms, receiving from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of the partial form of the term for use in targeting, and presenting the content item in a search suggestion control along with search completions in response to receipt of the partial form of the term in a search control.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in content management systems for serving sponsored content to users. The systems can include keyword identifiers, targeting option providers, targeting selection receivers, keyword receivers, and content item providers. A keyword identifier can identify one or more terms associated with a campaign, the campaign having an associated content item that is presented to users responsive to requests for content. A targeting option provider can present a campaign sponsor with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms. A targeting selection receiver can receive from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of the partial form of the term for use in targeting. A keyword receiver can receive the partial form of the term. A content item provider can present the content item along with suggested search completions.
- These and other embodiments may each optionally include none, one or more of the following features. Identifying one or more terms can includes receiving the one or more terms from the campaign sponsor. Presenting the campaign sponsor with an option can include presenting the campaign sponsor a control for selecting one or more partial forms for targeting. Presenting the campaign sponsor a control can include presenting suggestions for partial forms for targeting. Presenting the campaign sponsor a control can include presenting estimated reach information for each partial form suggested. Receiving the selection can include receiving a bid to be associated with the partial form of the term. The partial form can include the first letter of the term. The partial form can include the first few letters of the term. The partial form can be a word in a phrase. The partial form in the content item can be highlighted when presenting the content item to users. An auction can be conducted for all campaigns that targeted the partial search terms, including evaluating bids and associated quality scores for the campaign and presenting a content item from one or more winning campaigns in a search suggestion control responsive to receipt of the partial query.

- In general, computer systems can provide targeted content based on receipt of partial terms. Users can interact with a search engine interface (e.g., a web page) to provide queries via a search control (e.g., a search box). Search disambiguation may occur as the user types his or her query, for example, by presenting the user with query completion options within a search suggestions control (e.g., a search suggestions box). In addition to providing query completion options, one or more content items (e.g., advertisements) may be provided in the search suggestions control. Campaign sponsors (e.g., advertisers) may be given the option to target content items to users, based on partial term forms provided by users.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to users in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers, and acontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andcontent providers 108. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - To facilitate searching of
resources 105, theenvironment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies theresources 105 by crawling and indexing theresources 105 provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 can be stored in an indexedcache 114. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. A request for aresource 105 or asearch query 116 sent from auser device 106 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of theuser device 106. - In response to a
search query 116, thesearch system 112 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The
content information system 110 can update usage information 124 for a user, based on activity of the user, subject to the user's express permission. For example, the user may receive notice of what data may be collected and how such data may be used or retained, and may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs that may collect personalized information. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable data is removed. The usage information 124 can include, for example, information about past user activities, such as past requests forresources 105, past search queries 116, other requests for content, websites visited, or interactions with content. In some implementations, the usage information 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content. In some implementations, the usage information 124 can include, for each entry, a cookie identifying the user, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requestinguser device 106, a type of usage, and details associated with the usage. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. For example, the data representing theresource 105 can include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. An example slot is an ad slot. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - Information about slots can be provided to the
content management system 110. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords or portions of keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords (or portions of keywords) or search queries 116. As another example, content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords (or portions thereof) or thesearch query 116 are selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. - A targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a
search query 116 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword orsearch query 116. For example, a content item (e.g., an advertisement) associated with the targeting keyword “automobiles” can be an eligible content item (or an eligible ad) for a content item request that includes the resource keyword “automobiles.” Similarly, the ad can be selected as an eligible content item for a request including the search query “automobiles.” Moreover, partial keyword forms may be considered when matching targeting keywords with resource keywords or search queries. For example, a content item associated with a partial form of a targeting keyword (e.g., the letter “a”, the partial form “au”, the partial form “aut”, etc.) can be selected as an eligible content item for a request including similar partial resource keywords or partial search queries. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of aresource 105 orsearch results page 118 based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive bids from content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with aresource 105 orsearch results page 118. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each one thousand impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. The selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample system 200 that can target content items to users based on receipt of partial terms (e.g., keywords).FIG. 2 also illustrates an example flow of data within thesystem 200 during states (A) to (G), where the states (A) to (G) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. For example, two or more of the states (A) to (G) may occur concurrently. - The
system 200 can provide suggestions, for instance, as completions in the form of multi-term phrases or dominant queries that are derived from the received user input. For example, acontent management system 210 included in thesystem 200 can evaluate the user input as received and identify one or more completions based on the user input. Based on the completions, one or more associated content items can be identified. Ones of the completions (e.g., popular ones) can be provided as suggestions to the user. The additional content items can be merged with selected ones of the completions and provided for display to the user. The suggestions can be displayed in proximity to or in an augmented form of the control that receives the user input. For example, the suggestions and associated content can be included in an answer box that is displayed in proximity to the control (e.g., a search query box). In some implementations ads, navigational links, static content, video content, or other content can be displayed in an answer box adjacent to (e.g., directly below) an input control (e.g., a search query box) on the user's computer screen. The suggestions and additional content items can appear on the user's screen in an answer box or other form of display element after the user has entered just a portion (e.g., a character, a few characters, etc.) of the query, such as after the input is sufficient to generate useful suggestions. In some implementations, one or more content items are provided along with one or more suggestions for completing the user input. The content items can be included along with the suggestions or presented in a separate augmented form of the control (e.g., expanded textual input box or drop down box). - For the purposes of this disclosure, the user input received and processed to determine suggestions and related content is referred to herein as a prefix. The prefix can constitute one or more textual characters that are entered by/received from the user. A completion refers to a particular completed request, and can be based on historical processing of other requests. For example, a completion can be of the form of words or phrases that embody the request the user is providing, as evaluated as a portion of that request is entered. In some implementations, the suggestions and/or additional content (e.g., advertisements) returned by the
content management system 210 can correspond to content exactly matching the prefix entered by the user. For example, if the user enters “bicyc”, thesystem 200 can generate suggestions and locate additional content items related to the subject of bicycles, such as suggestions for ads for local bicycle shops. In some implementations, the information returned by thecontent management system 210 can be based on the user's interests, profile information, geographical location, etc. These additional criteria can be combined for use with the user's input in order to provide targeted content. - The
system 200 can include one or more client devices 202 (each operated by a corresponding device user 204) that communicate over one or more networks 206 with one or more computing servers 208. The networks 206 may include a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or WiFi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, an intranet, the Internet, or any other suitable network or any appropriate combination thereof. - The client device(s) 202 may be any suitable type of computing device (e.g., mobile phone, smartphone, personal digital assistant, tablet computer, laptop or desktop computer, or other stationary or portable device) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media. Among other components, for example, the client device(s) 202 includes one or more processors, computer readable media that store software applications, input device(s) (e.g., touch screens, keyboards, computer mice, motion sensors, microphones, etc.), output device(s) (e.g., display screens, speakers, etc.), and communications interfaces.
- The computing server(s) 208 may be configured to execute application code associated with a variety of software components (e.g., modules, objects, libraries, services, etc.), including computer instructions to perform some or all of the method steps described below. In some implementations, the
computing server 208 a may include one or more components of thecontent management system 210 described below. - The content management system 210 (e.g., similar to the
content management system 110, shown inFIG. 1 ) can identify keywords associated with a campaign, can present a campaign sponsor with an option to target one or more content items to users based on receipt of a partial form of one or more terms (e.g., keywords), and can provide the content items to users for presentation. In the present example, thecontent management system 210 includes akeyword identifier 212, a targetingoption provider 214, aselection receiver 216, akeyword receiver 218, and acontent item provider 220. Two or more of thecomponents - The
content management system 210 may be in communication with one or more data stores, servers, and/or other systems. In the present example, thecontent management system 210 and server(s) 208 a communicates with akeywords data store 222, acontent data store 224, and the server(s) 208 b (e.g., servers for running a search system, similar to thesearch system 112 shown inFIG. 1 ). Thedata stores system 200. The server(s) 208 b (the search system), for example, can receive search queries from and can provide search results to system users (e.g., theuser 204 b). - Referring to the example flow of data, during state (A), campaign sponsors can provide one or more keywords associated with a campaign. Campaigns, for example, may include actions for reaching users, or particular categories (e.g., based on user demographics, locations, and/or profiles) of users. Campaign sponsors, for example, may include entities (e.g., organizations, businesses, individuals, etc.) that intend to target content items (e.g., advertisements) to system users (e.g., the
user 204 b) during one or more campaigns. - In the present example, to provide one or more campaign keywords to the
content management system 210, theuser 204 a can employ theclient device 202 a to interact with an interface 230 (shown here asinterface 230 a). Theuser 204 a, for example, may be a representative, agent, and/or employee of campaign sponsor 240 (e.g., “Example Motors”, an automobile dealership). The interface 230, for example, may be an online interface (e.g., a web page) provided by thecontent management system 210, and may include various controls (e.g., output, input, command, etc.) for presenting information to and receiving information from campaign sponsors vianetworks 206 a, to facilitate campaign configuration and management by the sponsors. - In the present example, using the
interface 230 a, theuser 204 a (e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240) provides the keyword phrase “Example Motors” to thecontent management system 210. Upon receiving the keyword phrase, for example, thecontent management system 210 can employ thekeyword identifier 212 to identify one or more keywords (e.g., “example”, “motors”) included in the phrase. As another example, upon receiving identification information from thecampaign sponsor 240, thecontent management system 210 can identify keywords associated with the sponsor from thekeywords data store 222, and can identify associated content items (e.g., including text, images, video, audio, web links, etc.) from thecontent data store 224. - During state (B), campaign sponsors can be presented with options to target content items to users based on receipt of partial forms of one or more keywords. For example, the
content management system 210 can employ the targetingoption provider 214 to provide one ormore targeting options 242 to theuser 204 a (e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240) via the interface 230 (shown here asinterface 230 b). The targetingoptions 242, for example, may include one or more partial form suggestions, and estimated reach information for each partial form suggested, based on the identified keywords. In the present example, the targetingoptions 242 for the identified keyword “example” includes various partial forms of the keyword, including the letter “e” (with an estimated reach of one million impressions), the letters “ex” (with an estimated reach of ten thousand impressions), the letters “exe” (with an estimated reach of one thousand impressions), and the letters “exam” (with an estimated reach of fifty impressions). - In general, partial keyword forms with few letters may have greater estimated reach (and thus, may be more expensive in a bidding environment) than partial keyword forms with many letters. However, partial keyword forms with many letters may be considered by campaign sponsors as having greater potential for targeting than partial keyword forms with few letters. Thus, potential trade-offs may exist between various keyword forms. Campaign sponsors may employ the interface 230, for example, to evaluate various targeting options, and to make suitable targeting decisions based on their preferences and on the circumstances of their particular campaigns. Detailed examples of the interface 230 are presented below (refer to
FIGS. 3 and 4 ). - During state (C), selections of designations of partial keyword forms can be received from campaign sponsors. For example, the
user 204 a (e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240) can use the interface 230 (shown here asinterface 230 c) to indicate one or more partial keyword selections 244 (e.g., the partial forms “exa” and “exam”). Upon receiving the selections, for example, thecontent management system 210 can employ theselection receiver 216 to associate theselections 244 with a campaign of thecampaign sponsor 240. For example, theselections 244 may be maintained by thekeywords data store 222 in association with one or more campaign identifiers. Moreover, one or more content items associated with the campaign (e.g., content items such as advertisements maintained by the content data store 224) may be associated with theselections 244. - During state (D), system users can submit requests for content. Requests for content, for example, may include search queries, map requests, social network requests, and other sorts of content requests. Requests may be submitted, for example, by providing text (e.g., by typing), voice commands, images (e.g., photos), and other appropriate mechanisms. In the present example, the
user 204 b can employ theclient device 202 b to access a search page 250 (shown here assearch page 250 a) provided by the server(s) 208 b (the search system) vianetworks 206 b. Interacting with thesearch page 250 a, for example, theuser 204 b can enter search text in a search control 252 (shown here assearch control 252 a). Theuser 204 b in the present example begins entering text (e.g., via keypad), including a prefix (i.e., a sequence of letters) “exa”. As the user enters the sequence of letters, for example, thesearch page 250 a can provide the sequence to the server(s) 208 b. Upon receiving the sequence, for example, the server(s) 208 b (the search system) may recognize a partial form 254 (e.g., “exa”) of a term (e.g., a keyword), and may provide thepartial form 254 to thecontent management system 210. - During state (E), partial forms of keywords can be received. For example, the
content management system 210 can employ thekeyword receiver 218 to receive the partial form 254 (e.g., “exa”) from the server(s) 208 b (the search system). Upon receiving thepartial form 254, for example, thecontent management system 210 can reference thekeywords data store 222 to identify one or more campaign sponsors and/or campaigns that are associated with the partial form. In the present example, thecontent management system 210 may determine that thecampaign sponsor 240 is associated with thepartial form 254, and is associated with content to be provided to users in response to receipt of the partial form. Thecontent item provider 220, for example, can reference thecontent data store 224 or another suitable content source, and can provide a content item 260 (shown here ascontent item 260 a) to the server(s) 208 b. Content items, for example, may include text, images, video, audio, web links, and other types of content. In the present example, the content item 260 includes text (e.g., “Example Motors”), a web link (e.g., www.example.com), and a favicon (e.g., an automobile icon) associated with thecampaign sponsor 240. If plural campaigns are identified, for example, then a selection (e.g., an auction or reservation selection) can be made to determine which among the plural eligible items should be delivered. - In some implementations, cached content-completion pairs may provide the basis for retrieving or generating content items. The
system 200 can populate and update the content-completion pairs by querying ad mixers (not shown) in the background. For example, completions can be determined based on predictions of the most popular requests (e.g., search queries) received. One or more content items can be associated with each completion, forming pairs that are stored as ad-completion pairs. The actual content items or links thereto can be stored, for example, in thecontent data store 224. Thecontent data store 224 can include references, for example, to keywords or other information associated with the content items (e.g., advertisements). Content-completion pairs can be indexed by completion, keywords associated with a completion, or other means. Which completions are associated with which content items (and hence mapped in the form of content-completion pairs) can be based on the frequency of previously performed searches. This provides the advantage of caching matching items that are generally more likely to lead to specific additional content that is useful to the user. - During state (F), content items can be presented to users. For example, the server(s) 208 b (the search system) can include the content item 260 (shown here as
content item 260 b) in asearch suggestion control 270 along with one or more search completions 272 (e.g., “example”, “example cover”, “example of data”, etc.). Thesearch suggestion control 270, for example, may be included in the search page 250 (shown here assearch page 250 b) withsearch results 274 for presentation to theuser 204 b via theclient device 202 b. The server(s) 208 b, for example, may provide search results that are relevant to a primary search completion (e.g., “example”), and may update the search control 252 (shown here assearch control 252 b) to include the completed term(s). - Various embellishments may be provided to facilitate recognition of content items in search suggestion controls. In some implementations, a separation indicator (e.g., a line or another sort of boundary) may be included to provide a distinction between search completions and sponsored content items. Thus, users may readily determine which suggestions are sponsored, for example, and which are not. In some implementations, partial forms may be highlighted in content items when presenting content items to users. For example, the partial form “exa” may be highlighted within the text “Example Motors”. Thus, if the
user 204 b happens to be interested in “Example Motors”, for example, he or she may readily identify the entity via the highlighted text, web link, and/or favicon, and may interact with (e.g., click) thecontent item 260 b to navigate his or her web browser to a website associated with thecampaign sponsor 240. -
FIGS. 3 and 4 showexample user interfaces client device 202 a (shown inFIG. 2 ) can execute an application such as a web browser to present one or more user interfaces such as theuser interfaces user 204 a (e.g., a representative of campaign sponsor 240). By interacting with user interfaces such as theuser interfaces FIG. 2 ) can designate partial term forms for use in targeting content items to system users. - Referring to
FIG. 3 , for example, theuser interface 300 may include acontrol 302 for indicating one or more keywords or phrases, acontrol 304 for indicating one or more websites, and acontrol 306 for indicating one or more filters. For example, thecampaign sponsor 240 may employ theuser interface 300 to submit information such as keyword/phrase information, website information, and filter information to thecontent management system 210, and may in turn receive one or more suggestions for keywords and/or partial keyword forms for use in targeting content items to users during a campaign. In the present example, thecampaign sponsor 240 can interact with (e.g., enter a value in) thecontrol 302 to indicate the keyword phrase “example motors”. Instead of or in addition to indicating keywords and/or phrases, for example, thecampaign sponsor 240 can interact with thecontrol 304 to indicate the website “www.example.com”. By providing website information, for example, campaign sponsors may direct thecontent management system 210 toward resources (e.g., web pages) from which potential keywords to be used for targeting can be extracted. In the present example, thecampaign sponsor 240 can also interact with thecontrol 306 to indicate an interest in targeting content to users in San Francisco whose primary language is English and who employ mobile devices (e.g., smartphones). Upon indicating keyword/phrase, website, filter, and other suitable parameters, for example, the user can interact with (e.g., click) acontrol 308 to search for keyword and partial keyword suggestions and associated information. - Upon receiving one or more parameters via the
user interface 300, for example, thecontent management system 210 can process the request for partial keyword suggestions. For example, the keywords and/or phrases submitted via thecontrol 302 can be parsed and can be analyzed to identify individual keywords and common synonyms. As another example, websites submitted via thecontrol 304 can be visited and can be analyzed to identify frequently used terms. Referring toFIG. 1 , for example, the usage information 124 can be analyzed to identify the frequency of which keywords and partial keywords have been submitted by users (e.g., as part of a search query). Moreover, based on the filtering parameters submitted via thecontrol 306, for example, estimated reach information for subsets of system users may be determined, such as users at particular locations, users of different languages, users who employ different sorts of client devices, and so forth. Moreover, based on past and current auctions for having content items provided to users, for example, competition information for various keywords and partial keywords may be determined. - Upon processing the request for partial keyword suggestions, for example, the
content management system 210 can provide thecampaign sponsor 240 with one or more keyword and partial keyword suggestions for targeting content items to system users, and can provide information associated with various keyword forms to facilitate selection. For example, theuser interface 300 may include one ormore controls 310 for selecting suggested keyword and/or partial keyword forms for targeting, one ormore controls 312 for presenting estimated reach information for each of the keywords and partial keywords, and one ormore controls 314 for presenting competition information for each of the keywords and partial keywords. Considering the suggested keyword “example”, for example, partial keyword forms may be presented for each possible partial keyword, starting with the first keyword letter, followed by the first two keyword letters, etc. Thus, for the keyword “example”, the partial keyword forms “e”, “ex”, “exa”, “exam”, “examp”, and “example” may be suggested. - In some implementations, estimated reach information and competition information may be presented for each suggested keyword and partial keyword. In the present example, the keyword “example” may be associated with an estimated reach of twenty impressions (e.g., per hour, per day, per week, or another time period) and a high level of auction competition. Further, in the present example, the partial keyword “e” may be associated with an estimated reach of one million impressions, and a higher level of auction competition than that of the keyword “example”. Based on estimated reach and/or competition information, for example, campaign sponsors may select one or more keywords and/or partial keywords for targeting. In the present example, the content sponsor may interact with (e.g., select via checkbox) the keyword “example”, and the partial keyword forms “exa” and “exam”, based on a preferable combination of estimated reach information, perceived targeting value, and/or favorable levels of competition.
- Referring to
FIG. 4 , for example, theuser interface 400 may include one ormore controls 402 for specifying campaign targeting parameters, one ormore controls 404 for specifying bid information (e.g., auction bid information) and one ormore controls 406 for editing campaign keywords. For example, thecampaign sponsor 240 may employ theuser interface 400 to manage an existing campaign for targeting content items to system users. In the present example, thecampaign sponsor 240 can interact with the control(s) 402 to indicate that a particular campaign is to target all available websites for users employing mobile devices (e.g., smartphones), whose primary language is English, and who are located in San Francisco. Moreover, in the present example, thecampaign sponsor 240 can interact with the control(s) 404 to indicate a default bid of $0.25 for having content items presented to users in response to receipt of keywords and/or partial keyword forms. - Referring to the control(s) 406 for editing keywords, for example, a keyword 408 (e.g., “example”) may be included for a particular campaign. Using a
control 410, for example, thecampaign sponsor 240 may select a type of matching to be performed when targeting content items to thekeyword 408. Types of keyword matching, for example, may include broad matching (e.g., matching different word forms, such as plural/singular, verb tenses, etc.), exact matching, phrase matching (e.g., for phrases including multiple keywords), and partial matching. Moreover, the control(s) 406 may present additional information (e.g., maximum costs per click, numbers of impressions and/or clicks for particular periods of time, etc.) for each keyword, to facilitate selections of desired matching types. In the present example, thecampaign sponsor 240 may indicate via thecontrol 410 that partial forms of the keyword 408 (e.g., “example”) are to be matched to partial forms provided by system users in association with requests for content (e.g., search queries). In some implementations, upon selecting the “partial match” option, thecampaign sponsor 240 may be presented with possible partial forms for selection (refer to thecontrol 310, shown inFIG. 3 ). In some implementations, all possible partial matches of thekeyword 408 may be considered by thecontent management system 210. Upon modifying campaign parameters and/or keywords, for example, a representative of thecampaign sponsor 240 can interact with (e.g., click) a control 412 to submit changes to thecontent management system 210. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of anexample process 500 for presenting campaign sponsors with options for targeting content items to users based on receipt of partial terms. In some implementations, theprocess 500 may be performed by thesystems 100 and/or 200, and will be described as such for the purpose of clarity. Briefly, theprocess 500 includes identifying terms (e.g., keywords) associated with a campaign, presenting a campaign sponsor with options for targeting content items to users based on receipt of a partial term, receiving from the campaign sponsor a selection of a designation of a partial term for use in targeting, and optionally presenting a content item in a search suggestion control along with search completions in response to receipt of the partial term in a search control. - One or more terms (e.g., keywords) associated with a campaign can be identified (502). Referring to
FIG. 2 , for example, thekeyword identifier 212 can identify one or more keywords associated with a campaign (e.g., an advertising campaign) of thecampaign sponsor 240. For example, thecampaign sponsor 240 may be an entity such as an organization, business, or individual. In the present example, the campaign sponsor 240 (e.g., “Example Motors”, an automobile dealership) may have an ongoing campaign for presenting content items (e.g., thecontent item 260 a) to users responsive to requests for content by users. In some implementations, one or more keywords may be received from a campaign sponsor. For example, a representative (e.g., theuser 204 a) of thecampaign sponsor 240 may employ theinterface 230 a to provide the keyword phrase “Example Motors” or the distinct keywords “example” and “motors” to thecontent management system 210. - A campaign sponsor can be presented (504) with an option to target the content item to users based on receipt of a partial form of one of the one or more terms. In the present example, based on the keywords “example” and “motors”, the targeting
option provider 214 can provide theinterface 230 b including options to target thecontent item 260 a to users based on receipt of various partial forms of the keywords “example” and/or “motors”. In some implementations, a partial form may be a word in a keyword phrase. For example, the keyword phrase “Example Motors” may be parsed into distinct keywords “example” and “motors”. In some implementations, a partial form may include the first letter or the first few letters of a term. For example, the keyword “example” may include the partial forms “e”, “ex”, “exa”, “exam”, and so forth. - In some implementations, presenting a campaign sponsor with an option to target a content item to users may include presenting the sponsor with one or more controls for selecting one or more partial forms for targeting. Referring to
FIG. 3 , for example, theuser interface 300 can include one ormore controls 310 for selecting partial keyword forms for targeting. By selecting a control (e.g., a check box) associated with a particular partial form (e.g., “exa”, “exam”, etc.) of a keyword (e.g., “example”), for example, thecampaign sponsor 240 can indicate that thecontent item 260 a is to be targeted to users in response to receipt of the selected partial form. - In some implementations, suggestions for partial forms for targeting may be presented. For example, based on input received from the
campaign sponsor 240 via controls 302 (keywords and/or phrases), 304 (websites), and 306 (filtering parameters), appropriate suggestions for keywords and partial keyword forms may be presented via theuser interface 300. In some implementations, reach information and/or competition information may be presented for each partial form suggested. For example, the control(s) 312 for presenting estimated reach information may include an estimated number of impressions for a corresponding keyword and/or partial keyword for a particular time period (e.g., per hour, per day, per week, etc.). As another example, the control(s) 314 for presenting competition information may include an indication (e.g., a graphic, a numeric value, a monetary value, etc.) of a level of competition for a corresponding keyword and/or partial keyword in an estimated auction for having content items presented to users in response to receipt of the keyword or partial keyword form. - A selection of a designation of the partial form for use in targeting can be received (506) from a campaign sponsor. For example, the
selection receiver 216 can receive one or more selections of keywords and/or partial keyword forms for use in targeting thecontent item 260 a to users. In the present example, thecampaign sponsor 240 may provide the partial keyword selections 244 (e.g., “exa” and “exam”) to thecontent management system 210 via theinterface 230 c. In some implementations, receiving the selection may include receiving a bid to be associated with a partial form of a keyword. Referring toFIG. 4 , for example, default bids and/or bids on particular keywords and/or partial keyword forms may be provided. For example, a representative of thecampaign sponsor 240 may employ theuser interface 400 to indicate that a bid of $0.25 is to be entered in an auction for having thecontent item 260 a presented to system users in response to receipt of the keyword “example” and/or partial forms (e.g., the letter “e”, the letters “ex”, etc.) of the keyword. - In some implementations, the content item can optionally be presented (508) in a search suggestion control along with search completions in response to receipt of the partial form in a search control. For example, the
content management system 210 can employ thekeyword receiver 218 to receive keywords and partial forms of keywords, and can employ thecontent item provider 220 to provide one or more content items in response to the receipt. In the present example, thecontent item 260 b can be presented in the search suggestions control 270, in response to receipt of the partial form “exa” of the keyword “example” in thesearch control 252 a. Thus, for example, sponsored search suggestions may be presented along with potential search completions in a search suggestion control. Potential applications may include search suggestion interfaces for web searches, map searches, video searches, product searches, and other search types. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of anexample process 600 for presenting campaign sponsors with options for targeting content items to users based on receipt of partial terms. In some implementations, theprocess 600 may be performed by thesystem 100 and/or 200 and will be described as such for the purpose of clarity. Briefly, theprocess 600 includes receiving targeting criteria for a campaign, the targeting criteria including a designation of one or more partial search terms. Theprocess 600 includes associating a bid with each partial search term, receiving in a search control a partial query, determining whether the partial query matches the partial search terms associated with the campaign, optionally conducting an auction for all campaigns that targeted the partial search terms, and providing the content item in response to receipt of the partial query. - Targeting criteria can be received (602) for a campaign. For example, the
content management system 210 can receive targeting criteria for a campaign initiated and maintained bycampaign sponsor 240. A campaign, for example, may include one or more content items (e.g., including text, images, video, audio, links, and other types of content) associated with the campaign, to be provided to a user in response to a content item request by the user. For example, a campaign (e.g., an advertising campaign) of the campaign sponsor 240 (e.g., “Example Motors”) may include thecontent item 260 a, including text (e.g., “Example Motors”), a web link (e.g., www.example.com), and a favicon (e.g., an automobile icon) associated with thecampaign sponsor 240. Targeting criteria, for example, may include a designation of one or more partial search terms. In the present example, partial search terms may include partial forms (e.g., a letter, a few letters, etc.) of the keywords “example”, “motors”, “automobiles”, and other potentially related terms and phrases. In some implementations, targeting criteria may include criteria related to system users and/or devices. For example, content items may be targeted to users associated with certain demographic attributes, profile characteristics, language preferences, and/or may be targeted to devices associated with certain locations and/or of certain types (e.g., mobile devices, etc.). - A bid can be associated (604) with each partial search term. For example, the
content management system 210 can associate a bid from a campaign sponsor with one or more of the partial terms included in the keywords “example”, “motors”, and/or “automobiles”. Each of the bids, for example, may be subsequently used in an auction between multiple campaign sponsors for having sponsored content items (e.g., thecontent item 260 a) presented to users in response to receiving partial queries matching one or more of the partial search terms. - In a search control, a partial query can be received (606), the partial query being entered by a user though not completed by the user. For example, the
user 204 b may use theclient device 202 b to access thesearch page 250 a, and may begin entering text (e.g., by typing) into thesearch control 252 a. As text is entered (e.g., as the text is typed into the search control), for example, thesearch page 250 a may automatically submit partial queries to the computing server(s) 208 b (the search system). Thus, the computing server(s) 208 b may receive and evaluate partial queries as the queries are entered by users, and may generate suggested query completions based on historical usage information. - A determination (608) can be made of whether the partial query matches the partial search terms associated with the campaign. For example, the
content management system 210 can receive the partial query “exa” and can determine that the partial query matches a partial search term (e.g., a partial form of the keyword “example”) associated with a campaign maintained bycampaign sponsor 240. - In some implementations, an auction can be conducted (610) for all campaigns that targeted the partial search terms. For example, the
content management system 210 can conduct an auction between various content sponsors who may have bid on the partial search term “exa”. During the auction, for example, thecontent management system 210 can evaluate bids and associated quality scores for each campaign, and can determine one or more auction winners. Quality scores, for example, may be based on historical click rates of content items, campaigns, and/or campaign sponsors, and other suitable factors. - The content item can be provided (612) in response to receipt of the partial query. In the present example, the
content item 260 b may be provided within the search suggestion control 270 (along with suggested search completions 272) included on thesearch page 250 b, for presentation to theuser 204 b via theclient device 202 b. For example, thecontent management system 210 may have identified the campaign of thecampaign sponsor 240 as winning an auction between multiple campaigns for providing content items to users in response to receiving the partial query “exa”. -

processor 752 can execute instructions within thecomputing device 750, including instructions stored in thememory 764. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 750, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 750, and wireless communication bydevice 750. -
Processor 752 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 758 anddisplay interface 756 coupled to adisplay 754. Thedisplay 754 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 756 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 754 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 758 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 752. In addition, anexternal interface 762 may be provided in communication withprocessor 752, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 750 with other devices.External interface 762 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used. - The

Thememory 764 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 774 may also be provided and connected todevice 750 throughexpansion interface 772, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 774 may provide extra storage space fordevice 750, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 750. Specifically,expansion memory 774 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 774 may be provide as a security module fordevice 750, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 750. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below.

Device 750 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 766, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 766 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 768. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 770 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 750, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 750. -
Device 750 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 760, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 760 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 750. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating ondevice 750. - The
computing device 750 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 780. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 782, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.
