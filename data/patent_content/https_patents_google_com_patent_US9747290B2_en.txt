Description
This application claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/739,566, entitled “Relevance Bar for Content Listings,” filed Apr. 24, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
This application is related to patent application Ser. No. 11/739,557, entitled “Virtual Channels,” filed on Apr. 24, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
The disclosed embodiments relate generally to the presentation of scheduling information for multimedia events, and more specifically to aspects of creating virtual channels based on selected search results related to the scheduling information for multimedia events.
Currently, multimedia events, such as television shows, are organized by channels. The major television networks dictate which show is to be broadcast at a particular time for a respective channel. Thus, a user must tune-in to a show of the user's choosing at the time of broadcast as dictated by the respective television network. If the user wishes to view all the scheduling information for a particular show, or for a set of shows selected by the user, the user must search through the channels provided by the television networks for all the showings or episodes of the show or shows that are of interest to the user.
Methods, systems, user interfaces, and other aspects of the invention are described. Reference will be made to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to these particular embodiments alone. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents that are within the spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
Moreover, in the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these particular details. In other instances, methods, procedures, components, and networks that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art are not described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the present invention.
According to certain embodiments of the invention, a computing system provides listings of multimedia events, including scheduled time of broadcast to a user. Non-limiting examples of multimedia events include television shows, radio shows, video shows, sporting events and motion pictures (e.g., sporting events and motion pictures that are broadcast by TV, cable, satellite, video-on-demand, etc.). Multimedia events may include user created content, and/or content produced or created by content broadcasting and publishing companies, and/or content from a variety of other content providers. Other examples of multimedia events include events referenced by metadata site summaries, and multimedia messaging services. Examples of multimedia events referenced by metadata site summaries are podcasts, ESPN real time sports feeds, etc. Metadata site summaries provide information such as summaries of a multimedia show, original airtime, re-broadcast airtime, genre, show ratings, actor lists, images of actors, links to the referenced multimedia show, links to one or more trailers of the referenced multimedia show, etc. Multimedia messaging services provide information such as title, description, authorship, airtime, links to the referenced multimedia show, links to one or more trailers of the referenced multimedia show, etc.
For example, the user can specify a headend (name of content provider) and/or a zip code (or other geographic location identifier) and enter one or more search strings. In response, the system performs a search, using the entered search strings, on the listings of multimedia events corresponding to the specified headend and/or zip code. According to one feature of certain embodiments, the search results are presented to the user as an ordered list based on the scheduled time of broadcast. The user, if so desired, can select all or some of the listings to create a virtual channel of the selected listings.
The communication network 104 may be the Internet, but may also be any local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network, a wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, or the Internet, or any combination of such networks. It is sufficient that the communication network 104 provides communication capability between the clients 102 and the multimedia events server 106. In some embodiments, the communication network 104 uses HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The HTTP permits client computers to access various resources available via the communication network 104. The various embodiments of the invention, however, are not limited to the use of any particular protocol. The term “resource” as used throughout this specification refers to any document, object, information item, set of information, or service that is accessible via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and can be, for example, a web page, a text or word processing document, an email message, a transcribed voice message, a database, an image, a computational object, or other type of file.
Notwithstanding the discrete blocks in FIG. 1 , the figure is intended to be a functional description of some embodiments of the invention rather than a structural description of functional elements in the embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that an actual implementation might have the functional elements grouped or split among various components. Moreover, one or more of the blocks in FIG. 1 may be implemented on one or more servers designed to provide the described functionality. Although the description herein refers to certain features implemented in client 102 and certain features implemented in multimedia events server 106, the embodiments of the invention are not limited to such distinctions. For example, features described herein as being part of multimedia events server 106 could be implemented in whole or in part in client 102, and vice versa.
A search is performed on the identified set of time-bounded multimedia events based on the search query currently entered by the user (204). The search results are presented to the user ordered by relevance, according to certain embodiments (206). For example, the search results may be presented as a list. Alternately, or in addition, the search results may be presented on a relevance bar, as described in greater detail herein with reference to FIGS. 3A-3E , and FIGS. 4A-4D , respectively. A new virtual channel is created for the user if the user initiates an operation to create a new channel based on time-bounded multimedia events selected by the user from the search results (208). Further, searches are performed on the identified set of time-bounded multimedia events based on the user's respective saved queries associated with the user's existing virtual channels, if any (210). In other words, the user may have previously created one or more virtual channels. The information associated with the virtual channels are updated by performing searches on the identified set of time-bounded multimedia events using the saved queries associated with the virtual channels. It may be necessary to identify other sets of time-bounded multimedia events from the multimedia events database before performing searches based on the user's respective saved queries associated with the user's existing virtual channels. For example, a new set of time-bounded multimedia events is identified for a given saved query of the user if the associated headend, and/or zip code, and/or time period is different than that which is currently specified by the user as described with reference to (202). The user's virtual channels including the newly created virtual channel are presented to the user (212). The virtual channels presented to the user correspond to a user selected day and time of scheduled broadcast for the multimedia events. The user may select the day and time using GUI selector as described in greater detail herein with reference to FIGS. 4A-4C . If the user wishes to view virtual channel information corresponding to a new time period, such channel information is retrieved and presented to the user. If the user initiates a new search query (214), a new search is performed (204). If along with the new search query, the user initiates changes to the headend, and/or zip code, it may be necessary to identify additional sets of time-bounded multimedia events (202) before performing the new search. Process 200 ends if the user does not initiate any changes or a new search (216).
The broadcast schedule 308 for the user's existing virtual channels may be a grid representing scheduled multimedia events being broadcast on a particular day. According to certain embodiments, the search queries corresponding to the user's existing virtual channels are re-executed in order to identify the relevant time-bounded multimedia events for rendering on broadcast schedule 308. As illustrated in FIG. 3A , broadcast schedule 308 for the user's existing virtual channels is a grid having rows for displaying multimedia events scheduled for broadcast on virtual channels 308 a, 308 b, 308 c, and broadcast channels (from third party sources) 311 a, 311 b and 311 c. The displayed virtual channels 308 may be conveniently deleted by clicking on the delete button 309 next to the virtual channel title. Further, the user can manage the user's current collection of virtual channels and broadcast channels (also herein called television channels) by selecting link 322. For example, the user may delete one or more of the user's virtual channels, rename the user's virtual channels, and/or rearrange the order of appearance of the virtual channels and broadcast channels. For example, the virtual channels (or the virtual channels and broadcast channels) can be arranged alphabetically, in user specified order, based on genre, or based on relevance to a search query (e.g., channels are listed in accordance with a score based on the number and quality of matching results).
According to certain embodiments, the user may select one or more virtual channels from the user's current collection of virtual channels for publication using link 322. Published virtual channels are described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 3E . According to certain embodiments, the user may automate the recording of multimedia events in a given virtual channel using link 322. For example, relevant recording instructions may be sent to a recording device (e.g., a digital video recorder, or other storage device) associated with client 102.
In FIG. 3A , the information shown in broadcast schedule 308, results panel 310 and relevance bar 316 includes basic information (also referred to as “low resolution data”) associated with the multimedia events. For example, the low resolution data associated with broadcast schedule 308 can include channel names and the number of shows or episodes scheduled for broadcast in a given time period (for a particular channel or virtual channel).
A calendar 312 displays a grid representing a range of dates. The date of the time-bounded multimedia events shown in broadcast schedule 308 is indicated by a highlighted date 314 in the calendar 312. The date of the events shown in broadcast schedule 308 for the user's existing virtual channels is indicated by a highlighted date 314 in the calendar 312. The date 314 may be highlighted by surrounding it with a box, as shown in FIG. 3A , or the text of the date may be displayed in a different color than the other dates, or the “whitespace” around the date may be a different color than the whitespace around the other dates in the calendar 312. In other embodiments, the calendar may also be represented in a different manner. For example, the calendar may be represented by a horizontal bar.
If the user wishes to add the current search results as a new virtual channel in the user's collection of virtual channels, the user may initiate such an action by selecting option 318 as shown in FIG. 3A . According to certain embodiments, the user may use a portion of the current search results by selecting multimedia events from the current search results for constructing a new virtual channel. The user may also provide a name for the newly created virtual channel, according to certain embodiments. For purposes of explanation, assume that the user adds the search results corresponding to the search query “Simpsons” as a new virtual channel to the user's collection of virtual channels. FIG. 3B shows that “The Simpsons” is added to broadcast schedule 308 as a new virtual channel 308 d.
If more than one multimedia event is broadcast at the same time, broadcast schedule 308 indicates the number of multimedia events that are scheduled for broadcast in a given time slot, according to certain embodiments. For example, FIG. 3B shows that “The Simpsons” virtual channel 308 d has two multimedia events that are scheduled for broadcast at 9:00 p.m. According to certain embodiments, the user may obtain additional information (e.g., show or episode names) on the multimedia events that are scheduled for broadcast in a given time slot by hovering the user's cursor over the time slot on broadcast schedule 308. Such additional information may be referred to as “medium resolution data.” For example, FIG. 3C shows an iframe 342 that provides some medium resolution information (e.g., show names and episode names) on the multimedia events that are scheduled for broadcast in the time slot over which the user's cursor is hovering (cursor not shown in FIG. 3C ). If, for example, the number of multimedia events is too numerous to be displayed all at once in iframe 342 (also called an inline frame), the user may obtain a longer list of the multimedia events by selecting the “more” option 342 a as shown in FIG. 3C . According to certain embodiments, the user may obtain more detailed information on any one of the multimedia events displayed in iframe 342 by selecting a link 342 b associated with the particular multimedia event as shown in FIG. 3C . In some embodiments, the iframe 342 is closed and the display of the information in the iframe ceases when the user closes the iframe 342 (e.g., by clicking on a close frame icon) or when the user clicks on the landing page or search results page that is partially obscured by the iframe.
According to certain embodiments, when the user selects a link in results panel 310 or in an iframe on broadcast schedule 308, more detailed information (also referred to as “high resolution data”) on the multimedia event is displayed. For example, FIG. 3D shows detailed information displayed in an iframe 326 when the user selects the link 342 b (shown in FIG. 3C ) associated with the particular multimedia event. For purposes of explanation, assume that the user wishes to obtain more information on the multimedia event, “KTVU-002 The Simpsons: Marge on the Lam” as shown in FIG. 3C and selects link 342 a. According to certain embodiments, by selecting link 342 b for “Marge on the Lam”, the user is presented with more detailed information as shown in sample iframe 326 of FIG. 3D . As an example, the detailed information can include a description of the particular episode, information on the stars, director, writer, etc., associated with the multimedia event. A database structure for storing the low resolution data, medium resolution data and the high resolution data associated with multimedia events is described below with reference to FIG. 8 , according to certain embodiments.
If the user wishes to add virtual channels that are published by other users/sources, the user can select link 320 (see bottom of FIG. 3C ) to access a web page that publishes virtual channels, according to certain embodiments. Published virtual channels are described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 3E . According to certain embodiments, the user can create multimedia shows for broadcast. For example, the user may be associated with a media broadcast company. The user can create a multimedia show that is scheduled for broadcast at specific periods of time. For example, the user can create multimedia shows for broadcast through links provided in RSS feeds or through podcasts. Thus, such a user may choose to publish a channel comprising multimedia shows created by the user. As another example, the user may send information to a channel-publishing service. As an example, the user may use the Manage Channels feature, as previously described with reference to FIG. 3A , for publishing the user's virtual channels.
In addition to enabling a user to create virtual channels as described above, the user is provided the option of adding virtual channels that have been created by other users/sources. FIG. 3E is a schematic screenshot of a web browser GUI 300 presenting a web page 362 that displays published virtual channels, according to certain embodiments of the invention. Web browser GUI 300 comprises a URL field 364 for entering the URL of any web page that a user wishes to display, as well as for displaying the URL of the web page currently being displayed. As illustrated in this figure, the web browser GUI 300 displays an exemplary web page 362 for enabling the user to view and/or select virtual channels that have been created by other users and/or sources as well as broadcast channels from third party sources. Web page 362 comprises a search field 366 with a corresponding search button 367 for initiating a search for virtual channels (or a search for virtual channels and broadcast channels) corresponding to the search query entered in the search field 366. Web page 362 further comprises a panel of published channels 374 from which the user may select, if so desired, one or more channels for adding to the user's collection of virtual channels. A published channel (which may be a virtual channel or a broadcast channel) may optionally be associated with an icon 376. More published channels, if any, may be displayed by selecting the “more” button 364. Web page 362 also shows the user's current collection 372 of virtual channels, and a “Manage Channel” action element 368 for enabling the user to manage the user's collection of virtual channels. The user can select a channel from panel 374 for adding to the user's collection of virtual channels by initiating an “add channel” action element such as the “Add channels to your channel search page” element 369. One embodiment of a channel search page is previously described herein with reference to FIG. 3A (see web page or channel search page 302 of FIG. 3A ).
According to certain embodiments, multiple time-bounded multimedia events that are associated with a similar date and time can be depicted, for example, as stacked rectangular bars as shown in FIG. 4A . As another non-limiting example, multiple time-bounded multimedia events that are associated with a similar date and time can be depicted as a rectangular bar that is relatively taller than other rectangular bars that represent a fewer number of time-bounded multimedia events. As yet another non-limiting example, multiple multimedia events may be depicted using an object of a shape that is different from one representing a single multimedia event. According to certain other embodiments, the vertical axis of the relevance bar may represent a measure of importance or relevance of a particular multimedia event. For example, the height of a rectangular bar may be proportional to the importance or relevance of the particular multimedia event that the rectangular bar represents. As another example, the physical attributes of the objects representing a respective multimedia event may be associated with varying levels of importance or relevance. For example, on object representing a multimedia event of relatively high importance may light-up, flash or blink to attract the user's attention. As yet another example, multimedia events that are related to the multimedia events of the search results are represented as objects of a shape and/or color that is different from ones representing multimedia events of the search results (i.e., multimedia events that match or satisfy a search query). Examples of related multimedia events include multimedia events that have content that is similar to the content of multimedia events from the search results.
According to certain embodiments, search results of multimedia events may be scored based on any combination of various factors such as the user's profile, results from a co-citation analysis, or anchor text analysis (e.g., analysis of text in or near links to the multimedia events) to determine related multimedia events. The user's profile may be based on user specified preferences. Alternately, the user's profile may be generated by the system based on the user's online behavior. As another example, a group profile may be used as the user's profile. A group profile is a general profile for a group of users of which the user is a member.
Further, relevance bar 400 may include a slider 404 that slides along the time axis. The position of the slider on the time axis is associated with a date and time 408. According to certain embodiments, when the user moves the slider to a new position along the time axis, the broadcast schedule 308 (see FIG. 3A , for example) is re-rendered to present new broadcast information corresponding to the date and time associated with the new position of the slider along the time axis of the relevance bar. Alternately, instead of slider 404, the relevance bar 400 may be responsive to the hovering of a mouse or other pointer over a portion of the relevance bar, and/or may be responsive to mouse clicks or other select signals on a user selected portion of the relevance bar.
According to certain embodiments, when the user's mouse brushes over an object 402 (in the relevance bar 400) representing a respective multimedia event, an iframe 410 is presented to the user as shown on relevance bar 420 of FIG. 4B . According to certain embodiments, if the user selects a link (e.g., by clicking on the link) that is associated with a respective multimedia event in the iframe 410, the user is presented with another iframe that provides more detailed information on the selected multimedia event. For example, assume that the user clicks on the link for the TV show, “Simpsons—Marge on the lam” shown in iframe 410 as shown in FIG. 4B . As a result, iframe 412 on relevance bar 420 as shown in FIG. 4C is presented to the user. As a non-limiting example, iframe 412 shows detailed information on the TV show, “Simpsons—Marge on the lam” that is scheduled to broadcast at 9 p.m., Monday July 14.
According to some embodiments, the horizontal axis of the relevance bar may represent units of relevance. For example, FIG. 4D shows that the horizontal axis 416 of the relevance bar 460 represents units of relevance. The objects 418 on relevance bar 460 are ordered by relevance on the horizontal axis.
