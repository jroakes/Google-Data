The concept of description is not limited to the embodiment of any ad hoc fashion.Embodiment and the example of application mainly due to
The purpose of explanation and be provided.
Web in monitoring computer environment interacts to application content faces many technological challenges.Web to application content interact
It is the Uniform Resource Identifier with being activated in web browser and being opened in response to the activation in client application
(URI) associated interaction (or conversion) event.Activate platform (for example, web browser) and interaction (or conversion) platform (example
Such as, client application) between in the new content of difference requirements of corresponding software module and data configuration aspects interact surveillance technology.
For example, the web browser run on a client device may and be not configured as sharing or exchanging accordingly with client application
Status information accordingly performs event.
Third party content provider provides third party content to be shown on client device, above-mentioned client device
Seek to cause the user of such equipment to participate in performing alternative events.The interaction thing associated with shown third party content item
Part (or transformation event) can include purchase product item, purchase service, participate in game on line, registration service, be offered (such as
For the donation of non-profit organization or political race), fill in questionnaire, access webpage, or combinations thereof.Such as advertisement it
The third party content item of class can include the Uniform Resource Identifier for representing to point to the link of additional content (or login page)
(URI) (or therewith showing).The additional content for example can be associated with product or service, the said goods or service and the
Tripartite's content providers are associated.Client device can show the additional content associated with URI, such as in response to the URI
Activation and be shown with third party content item.
Client device can be in web browser or different from web browser and the visitor in the client application
Family end is using the interior display content associated with URI.For example, certain operations system can support general link.So, this is supported
The client device of the operating system of sample can be for example in the web browser or on client device client application
Interior opening HTTP (HTTP) URL (URL).When URI (or URL) is with third party content item
When being shown in web browser, show that the content associated with the URI is being supervised in client application when URI activates
Technological challenge is faced with terms of depending on any alternative events associated with URI with what is occurred in client application.
Third party content provider seeks to monitor the alternative events (for example, advertising conversion) associated with corresponding URI.So
Monitoring allow reliable and objectively assess various third party content items and corresponding URI success rate.Alternative events can include
The product associated with third party content provider or the on-line purchase of service, online booking is performed, is offered, filled in online
Online investigation questionnaire, download e-file, participate in electronic game or combinations thereof.Monitor that alternative events can include number
According to system the information of instruction alternative events is received when alternative events occur and by such information and phase from client device
Corresponding URI is mapped.
Web can assess the URI opened in web browser to web alternative events monitoring mechanism.Swash in client device
Live in the URI shown in web browser, data handling system can send data block to obtain instruction visitor to client device

Reason system.The data handling system can scan received data block and extract what instruction performed in web browser
The information of alternative events.In this example, the data handling system can monitor each web to web alternative events, wherein with
The associated URI of tripartite's content item is displayed in web browser and corresponding contents are also shown in when the URI is activated
In web browser.
For web to the interaction applied, wherein URI is in web browser with corresponding third party content item
It has been shown that, but activation of the content associated with the URI then in response to the URI is shown in client application, is used
Data block and alternative events detection module may e insufficient to the alternative events that monitoring occurs in client application.By client
When end equipment performs, alternative events detection module enables to the alternative events that client device detection occurs on a web browser,
But do not detect the conversion occurred in client application.In addition, for many client applications, data block is as note
Record client device may and be insufficient to via the instrument interacted of the content shown by client application.Therefore, web is extremely
Web alternative events surveillance technology may be not enough to monitor that web extremely applies alternative events.
Client application can be by sending conversion message (or conversion ping) to data handling system or remote server
To report alternative events.The message can include URI of the instruction in any alternative events starting point any information.At data
From the point of view of managing angle, the alternative events that at least one technological challenge involves how to be reported map to corresponding URI.Moreover,
Different client applications can report alternative events by different way.For example, for report the type of the message of alternative events,
Form or content can be with client application and different.The change of such message brings another technological challenge.Example
Such as, web is expected to have to support to apply associated various conversions with different clients to using alternative events monitoring solution
ping。
At least one technical scheme described herein provides a kind of data handling system, and it can automatically and reliably
The monitoring web associated with corresponding URI extremely applies alternative events.Web performed by the data handling system is to using interaction thing
Basic alternative events report model used by part monitors process independently of various third party content providers.For example, web extremely should
It can will convert ping's used by the client application for alternative events to be linked to alternative events monitoring process
The mechanism of corresponding URI (or corresponding URI activation event) is decoupling.The mechanism can be herein referred to as clickthrough mechanism.
Will click on linking mechanism allows to support for example to apply associated various conversions with different clients from conversion ping is decoupling
ping。
