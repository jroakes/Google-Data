- the Media GW 410 represents the media gateway 102 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the dynamic portal system and method may operate during an idle mode of the wireless communication device 104 .
- the wireless communication device 104 is generally designed to perform operations directed by its user. When the user interacts with the input devices 210 of the wireless communication device 104 , the device responsively performs the requested functions as it is able, such as managing voice calls, text messages, and the like. When the wireless communication device 104 no longer performs such functions and is merely waiting to activity, the device enters the idle mode. When the device 104 enters the idle mode, the dynamic portal system and method may operate in response.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary activation operation 400 of the wireless communication device 104 .
- the device may start in the idle mode and have one or more default containers configured.
- the number of containers, the container types, channels and contents are pre-configured in the device 104 and defined in a Dynamic Portal configuration file and its container profiles.
- the wireless communication device 104 may then execute its normal start-up sequences, create personal settings and load up the default contents for viewing by the user.
- the default contents may come from a local storage, such as the content cache 306 of the memory 206 .
- the new contents may be downloaded from a service provider's media gateway 102 .
- the Dynamic Idle Service 404 sends a request for contents to the Cache Manager 406 at step 412 .
- the Cache Manager 406 checks the timestamps of the media content in the content cache 306 for new contents availability and last download time at step 414 . If new media content is available or the existing media content (presently stored in the content cache 306 ) is not up-to-date, then the Cache Manager 406 sends a request to fetch new media content to the Fetch Task 408 at step 416 .
- the Cache Manager 406 also provides the existing media content to the Dynamic Idle Service 404 at step 418 which, in turn, forward the existing media content to the GUI 402 for viewing by the user at step 420 .
- the Fetch Task 408 In response to receiving the request to fetch new media content from the Cache Manager 406 , the Fetch Task 408 sends a formatted request for the new media content, in an appropriate common format, to the Media GW 410 at step 422 .
- the Fetch Task 408 sends an HTTP request for RSS content.
- the Media GW 410 then clears a Not-to-Send flag at step 424 and sends a formatted response, including the requested content in the requested format, to the Fetch Task 408 at step 426 .
- the Fetch Task 408 saves the time of download and associates it with the received media content at step 428 .
- the Fetch Task 408 also parses the received media content, for example, into appropriate channels.
- the Fetch Task 408 then sends the media content to the Cache Manager 406 for storage in the content cache 306 at step 430 . Thereafter, the Cache Manager 406 sends the media content and a service notification to the Dynamic Idle Service 404 at step 432 and, in turn, the Dynamic Idle service forwards the media content to the GUI 402 for presentation to the user at step 434 .
- the initial contents may be provided free by the GUI 402 for a specific length of time, i.e., trial period. Once the trial period is over, if the user does not subscribe any channels, the service provider may provide some free media content (e.g., out of date content) to fill up the channels and only subscribed channels would have up-to-date media content. Also, media content may be received from a Media GW 410 of a particular service provider may be tied to an identity card of the wireless communication device 104 , such as a SIM card. When a different SIM is inserted to the device 104 , the cached and archived contents may be removed during the startup sequence of the device.

- FIG. 14 there is provided a conceptual view illustrating exemplary communications and resulting actions of another embodiment.
- This embodiment tracks viewing and usage habits of the wireless communication device based on time and activity.
- the device may deliver information and experiences that are integrated with their habitual behaviors. By informing the device of these results, the device is capable of limiting its fetching operations to relevant and useful information at times when there is high probability of the information being consumed.
- the above operations may be performed by the media gateway 102 and, for another embodiment, they may be performed by the wireless communication device 104 .
- the media gateway 102 comprises a transceiver and a processor coupled to the transceiver.
- the media gateway 102 identifies one or more events occurring at the wireless communication device during a predetermined time period.
- the transceiver 202 may receive usage information from the wireless communication device 104 that indicates activity of the device during the predetermined time period.
- the media gateway 102 determines a reporting event based on the one or more events and a reporting time corresponding to the reporting event.
- the processor 204 may determines a reporting time based on the usage activity of the device during the predetermined time period, so that the transceiver 202 may communicate event content to the device at a reporting time.
- the processor 204 may determine a time period of inactivity based on the usage information of the device, so that the transceiver 202 may minimize communication of event content to the device during at least one future time period corresponding to the time period of inactivity.
- One way to determine the reporting time is to identify a particular time of day when activity occurs and marking the particular time of day for future days.
- Another way to determine the reporting time is to identify time periods when the device is not being used, and minimizing communication to the device during those time periods. The event content corresponding to the reporting event is obtained before the reporting time to minimizing any delay in providing the content to the user.
- the present invention makes intelligent decisions about communications between the media gateway 102 and the wireless communication device 104 by transmitting media content from the media gateway to the device just before the user is likely to consume the media content. For example, on an average weekday, a user may be asleep until 7:00 AM and reads the weather report for the day some time after waking-up. Thus, based on this information, the media gateway 102 knows to send an up-to-date weather report to the device 104 about ten minutes before the user typically wakes-up, i.e., 6:50 AM, as represented by block 1402 . Thereafter, the user may wake-up at 7:00 AM and check the received weather report before getting dressed, as represented by block 1404 .
- the device 104 While checking the weather report, the device 104 also noticed that the user read a news story about a new health drink and reports this activity to the media gateway 102 .
- the media gateway 102 records this activity in the memory 206 , including the time when the activity occurred, for future reference. For example, the media gateway 102 may obtain media content, e.g., news, advertisements, and the like, about health drinks before the user wakes-up the next day so that the user may read more up-to-date information this subject matter.
- media content e.g., news, advertisements, and the like
- the user reads news headlines from the wireless communication device 104 at 7:40 AM, as represented by block 1406 .
- the media gateway 102 already obtained the news content in advance, e.g., 7:30 AM, because the media gateway determined that 7:40 AM is a regular reporting time for the device based on prior activity monitored by the device. For example, the prior activity may be access to news headlines every day the previous week at about 7:45 AM.
- the user then drives to work and is busy for the entire morning, as represented by block 1408 .
- the media gateway 102 previously noted from information received from the device 104 that, during the previous week, the device was only used to receive calls between 8:30 AM and 12:00 noon.
- the media gateway 102 minimized communication of media content to the device 104 during this time period, e.g., content was only communicated once.
- the user reads news stories during lunch, as represented by block 1410 .
- the media gateway 102 knows that the user typically reads news stories soon after 12:00 noon based on information received from the device 104 , so the media gateway downloaded media content to the content cache 306 ten minutes earlier, i.e., 11:50 AM.
