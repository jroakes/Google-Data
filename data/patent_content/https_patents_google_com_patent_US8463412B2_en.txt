Definitions
- This invention relates generally to signal processing and more particularly to audio signal processing.
- Various devices serve, at least in part, to process signals that are bounded, one way or the other, by a given bandwidth. In many cases this is done to ensure that the signal fits within some limited processing capability as corresponds to the processing platform and/or the application setting.
- some processing platforms such as cellular telephones
- some processing platforms often limit the audio signal to be processed to some predetermined bandwidth such as 300 to 3,400 Hz even though the original speech content may include frequencies that are outside that range.
- artificial bandwidth extension typically comprises adding artificially generated content outside the aforementioned predetermined bandwidth to the processed signal in order to hopefully improve the resultant sound quality.
- FIG. 1 comprises a flow diagram as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention
- FIG. 2 comprises a flow diagram as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 3 comprises a block diagram as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- a signal processing platform presents a signal to be processed (such as a digitized audio signal) and then identifies signal portions with specific characteristics to provide corresponding identified signal portions. The latter are then used to automatically determine at least one bounding frequency for the signal. This (or these) bounding frequency(s) can then be used to facilitate bandwidth extension for the signal.
- this step of identifying signal portions with specific characteristics can comprise identifying signal portions that exhibit at least a predetermined level of energy.
- the step of determining the bounding frequency can comprise, at least in part, computing a magnitude spectrum for each of the identified signal portions.
- the aforementioned magnitude spectrum can be used to determine a corresponding measure of flatness within a pass band as pertains to a corresponding normalized signal portion to thereby provide corresponding vetted signal portions.
- the step of determining the bounding frequency(s) can comprise accumulating the magnitude spectrum for these vetted signal portions to thereby provide an accumulated magnitude spectrum, and then using the latter to estimate a corresponding signal envelope. This signal envelope can then be used to determine the bounding frequency(s).
- these teachings will then accommodate performing bandwidth extension for the signal using high-band edge detection for the signal, at least in part, by automatically performing bandwidth extension for the signal using a lowest expected value of the high-band edge, then using an available narrow-band signal up to a detected high-band edge, and then using a bandwidth-extended signal above the detected high band edge to represent the signal.
- these teachings will accommodate performing bandwidth extension for a signal by detecting a low-band edge that is below a highest expected value of the low-band edge to provide a corresponding detected low-band edge.
- a low-band boost characteristic can then be adjusted based on this detected low-band edge to provide a corresponding adjusted low-band boost characteristic.
- This adjusted low-band boost characteristic can then be applied to the signal to obtain a resultant boosted low-band signal.
- bandwidth extension results themselves can be considerably superior in terms of audio quality as compared to numerous prior art approaches. This results, at least in part, due to a better accommodation and use of existing content in the original signal. This, in turn, reduces the amount of fabricated content to be included in the resultant bandwidth-extended signal in many cases.
- teachings are readily and economically facilitated by leveraging available processing platforms.
- the corresponding computational requirements are relatively modest, thereby rendering these teachings suitable for processing platforms (such as, but not limited to, cellular telephones or the like) having limited local processing resources (such as available power reserves, computational capabilities, and so forth).
- processing platforms such as, but not limited to, cellular telephones or the like
- local processing resources such as available power reserves, computational capabilities, and so forth.
- teachings are highly scalable and can be usefully employed with a variety of signals, bandwidth requirements and/or opportunities, and so forth.
- This process 100 can be carried out by a signal processing platform of choice.
- Examples in this regard include, but are certainly not limited to, cellular telephones, push-to-talk wireless devices (such as so-called walkie talkies), landline telephones, so-called Internet telephones, and so forth.
- This process 100 includes the step 101 of presenting a signal to be processed.
- this signal will comprise audio content.
- this step of presenting this signal will comprise presenting a plurality of sequential samples (such as digital samples) of the audio content.
- This step might comprise, for example, presenting a frame of such information that comprises 1,024 sequential samples that were obtained using an 8 KHz sampling rate.
- This step might also comprise, for example, presenting a window of content that comprises a plurality of such frames.
- a window having a duration of about 1 to 3 seconds, for example, may be quite useful in a wide variety of common application settings involving audio signals that include human speech.
- This process 100 then presents the step 102 of identifying signal portions of the signal with specific characteristics to thereby provide corresponding identified signal portions.
- this signal portion can comprise a predetermined temporal or data quantity such as the aforementioned frames.
- this step can comprise identifying specific frames that exhibit the specific characteristics of interest.
- this specific characteristic can comprise a predetermined level of energy.
- this step of identifying signal portions of the signal having a specific characteristic of interest can comprise identifying signal portions that exhibit, for example, at least this predetermined level of energy.
- This process 100 then presents the step 103 of using these identified signal portions to automatically determine at least one bounding frequency for the signal.
- This can comprise, for example, determining a lower bounding frequency, an upper bounding frequency, or both the upper and lower bounding frequencies for the signal as desired.
- this step can comprise automatically determining the at least one bounding frequency for the signal as pertains to each of at least some of a sequential series of groups of sequential samples for the audio content as may comprise the signal. For example, and as alluded to above, it may be useful in many application settings to make this determination for groups of sequential audio content samples with each group representing from about one second to about three seconds of the audio content.
- the aforementioned groups and the aforementioned signal portions may, or may not, tightly correlate with respect to one another depending upon the needs and/or opportunities as tend to characterize a given application setting.
- the aforementioned identified signal portions can fall within the aforementioned group.
- the groups that are selected for determining the bounding frequency do not necessarily have to be selected from a sequential series of groups. It would be possible, for example, for the selected groups to overlap with one another in time.
- these steps can include computing a magnitude spectrum for each of the identified signal portions.
- This magnitude spectrum can then be used to determine a corresponding measure of flatness within a pass band as pertains to a corresponding normalized signal portion to thereby provide vetted signal portions.
- Such an approach will support, for example, the further steps of accumulating the magnitude spectrum for the vetted signal portions to provide corresponding accumulated magnitude spectrum, using that accumulated magnitude spectrum to estimate a signal envelope as corresponds to the vetted signal portions, and then using that signal envelope to determine the aforementioned bounding frequency(s).
- this process 100 will readily accommodate using transformed versions of the magnitude spectrum to effect the aforementioned accumulation.
- Such transformations can be based on the magnitude spectrum itself, but in such a case it will not be the magnitude spectrum itself that is being accumulated.
- Useful transforms in this regard include, but are not limited to, raising the magnitude spectrum to a power other than one (such as, but not limited to, a power greater than one), performing a log operation on the magnitude spectrum followed by a multiplication step (for example, to convert the results into decibels), and so forth.
- input narrow-band speech (contained within, for example, 300-3400 Hz) is transformed to a corresponding wideband speech (such as 100-8000 Hz) output by synthesizing the missing information based on parameters extracted from the narrow-band speech itself.
- This input narrow-band (NB) speech is first analyzed using linear prediction (LP) coefficient analysis to extract the spectral envelope. From the NB coefficients, the wideband LP coefficients are estimated (using, for example, codebook mapping as is known in the art). The narrow-band LP coefficients are also used to inverse filter the input speech to obtain the NB excitation signal in the (1:2) up-sampled domain.
- LP linear prediction
- the wideband (WB) excitation signal is synthesized (using, for example, a non-linear operation such as rectification).
- An LP filter (employing the estimated WB coefficients) is then used to filter the WB excitation and to synthesize the wideband speech.
- the resultant synthesized wideband speech is high-pass filtered and added to the (1:2 up-sampled version of the) input NB speech to obtain the estimated wideband output speech.
- a typical application scenario for such a BWE system is in cellular phones wherein such a system can be used to extend the bandwidth of the received audio to enhance the user experience.
- the input NB signal has a specific bandwidth such as 300-3400 Hz.
- the bandwidth of the channel is not fixed but can and will vary from call to call (or even within the experience of a single call).
- the present teachings permit detecting the band edges of the received signal so that the original information is retained to a considerable extent (for example, from about 200 to 3600 Hz) and artificially generated information is added only where required or where at least likely to be helpful (for example, from about 100 to 200 Hz and from about 3600 to 8000 Hz).
- the input NB speech is composed into blocks of consecutive samples, referred to herein as frames.
- N is chosen as 1024 (128 ms at 8 kHz sampling) and the increment is chosen as 120 (15 ms at 8 kHz sampling).
- W is a suitable window W to obtain the windowed speech frame F k,w .
- Suitable windows are Hamming, Hann, and so forth.
- the energy threshold used is ⁇ 50 dB at the nominal signal level of ⁇ 26 dBov. This step 202 ensures that only frames with sufficient energy are used in the detection of band edges.
- this process provides a third step 203 to normalize the frame by dividing each of its samples by the square root of its energy. Normalization ensures that each frame used in the detection of band edges is given the same weight. Those skilled in the art will recognize that alternate weighting schemes are possible. Simplifying the notation, the normalized frame may be expressed as
- the magnitude spectrum is checked for its flatness. This can be done, for example, by estimating the spectral flatness measure (sfm) within the pass band (e.g., 300-3400 Hz).
- the spectral flatness measure is defined in this example as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the spectral values.
- the sfm ranges from 0 for a peaky, i.e., non-flat, spectrum to 1 for a perfectly flat spectrum.
- the sfm is computed using 12 equal-width frequency bands within the pass band (300-3400 Hz) as follows.
- the sfm threshold is chosen as 0.5. This step ensures that the frames used for band edge detection have a reasonably flat spectrum in the pass band. Those skilled in the art will again understand that there are alternate ways to accomplish this. For example, one could compute the prediction gain of a frame using LP modeling, and select the frame for use in band edge detection only if the prediction gain is below a threshold.
- a fifth step 205 the magnitude spectrum of the frame is accumulated and a count for frames used in the accumulation is incremented.
- a sixth step 206 the frame count for the accumulated magnitude spectrum is checked to see if it is at least equal to a specified threshold (such as, in this illustrative example, 100). When this is not the case, the flow is returned back to the first step.
- a specified threshold such as, in this illustrative example, 100
- the accumulated spectrum is further processed in a seventh step 207 .
- the linear frequency cepstral coefficients are computed by taking an IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) of the log-spectrum as
- M 1 is chosen as 14.
- the lower and higher band edges can be estimated.
- the mean value of the log-spectrum within the pass band can be estimated as
- l p1 and l p2 represent the lower and higher indices within the pass band.
- the lower band edge can be estimated as the index l l at which the log-spectral envelope is T L dB below LS mean . This is easily found by searching within a suitable range, such as 115-265 Hz, and selecting the index at which the log-spectral envelope value LS(l l ) is closest to (LS mean ⁇ T L ). Alternately, one can find the two indices enclosing the desired envelope value, and use linear interpolation to obtain a fractional index value for the lower band edge.
- the higher band edge l h is similarly found by searching within a suitable range, such as 3450-3750 Hz, to find the index at which LS(l h ) is (LS mean ⁇ T H ) dB.
- a suitable value for the thresholds T L and T H is about 10 dB. Note that the choices of the search ranges as well as the thresholds T L and T H for the detection of both lower and higher band edges depend on the input NB speech; that is, whether the speech is clean or coded, what type of coder is used, the signal-to-noise ratio, and other factors as may uniquely apply in a given application setting. These can be chosen empirically for the best performance in a desired application. It may also be useful to process the input NB speech using a pair of notch filters with notches at about 0 Hz and 4000 Hz respectively to ensure that the log-spectral envelope decays at both edges.
- the detected band edges i.e., l l and l h , are then transformed into corresponding frequency values F l and F h Hz respectively, using the detected band edges of signals with pre-designed bandwidths for calibration.
- the band edges are detected, incorporating them in a BWE to enhance its performance is fairly straightforward.
- the BWE system has been designed for the bandwidth 300-3400 Hz but the actual signal bandwidth as detected by the band edge detection algorithm is 200-3600 Hz.
- the cut-off frequency of the HPF can be moved from 3400 Hz to 3600 Hz.
- the low-band boost characteristic can be shifted lower by 100 Hz (from 300 Hz to 200 Hz).
- the apparatus 300 comprises a processor 301 that operably couples to a memory 302 that has the aforementioned signal to be processed stored therein.
- a processor can comprise a fixed-purpose hard-wired platform or can comprise a partially or wholly programmable platform. All of these architectural options are well known and understood in the art and require no further description here.
- This processor 301 can be configured (via, for example, corresponding programming as will be well understood by those skilled in the art) to carry out one or more of the steps, actions, and/or functions as are set forth herein.
- this can comprise configuring the processor 301 to perform bandwidth extension for a signal using high-band detection (as taught herein by determining the corresponding bounding frequency for the signal as pertains to each of at least some of a sequential series of groups of the sequential samples of the signal) by, at least in part, automatically performing bandwidth extension for the signal using a lowest expected value of the high-band edge, using an available narrow-band signal up to a detected high-band edge, and using a bandwidth-extended signal above the detected high band edge to represent the signal.
- high-band detection as taught herein by determining the corresponding bounding frequency for the signal as pertains to each of at least some of a sequential series of groups of the sequential samples of the signal
- bandwidth extension for the signal using a lowest expected value of the high-band edge, using an available narrow-band signal up
- the processor 301 can be programmed to detect a low-band edge below a highest expected value of the low-band edge to provide a corresponding detected low-band edge, adjust a low-band boost characteristic based on the detected low-band edge to provide an adjusted low-band boost characteristic, and apply the adjusted low-band boost characteristic to the signal to obtain a boosted low-band signal.
- Such an apparatus 300 may be comprised of a plurality of physically distinct elements as is suggested by the illustration shown in FIG. 3 . It is also possible, however, to view this illustration as comprising a logical view, in which case one or more of these elements can be enabled and realized via a shared platform. It will also be understood that such a shared platform may comprise a wholly or at least partially programmable platform as are known in the art.
