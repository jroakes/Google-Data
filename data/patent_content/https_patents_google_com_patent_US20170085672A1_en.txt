Definitions
- This specification relates to providing digital content items (e.g., advertisements and/or other types of presentations) to users in a display environment.
- digital content items e.g., advertisements and/or other types of presentations
- Resource providers may include content such as sponsored content in their respective publications to help financially support their operations. Some resource providers do not maintain a content sponsoring (e.g., advertising) infrastructure, and thus depend on third party content sponsor serving companies to recruit content sponsors and to serve content items to the resource providers' sites. Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances. For example, a content sponsor serving company can provide directed content items, such as advertisements, to identified groups of users. Content items, such as advertisements, can be directed to the user by selecting suitable or appropriate content based on the user's user profile.
- content sponsoring e.g., advertising
- Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances. For example, a content sponsor serving company can provide directed content items, such as advertisements, to identified groups of users. Content items, such as advertisements, can be directed to the user by selecting suitable or appropriate content based on the user's user profile.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and computer storage media encoded with computer programs that include the actions of maintaining a user interest profile corresponding to a particular user and containing information that describes visits to publisher sites (e.g., and/or individual pages within a site) over a predetermined period of time; analyzing each of the visited publisher sites in the particular user's interest profile to identify publisher sites that indicate a level of commercial interest; based on a result of the analyzing, assigning a commercial-interest weight value to each of the visited publisher sites such that publisher sites indicating higher levels of commercial interest receive higher commercial-interest weight values than publisher sites indicating lower levels of commercial interest; updating the particular user's interest profile based on the assigned commercial-interest weight values; and using the updated user interest profile to determine subsequent content items to be presented to the particular user when visiting publisher sites.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example network.
- FIG. 2 is block diagram of an example of a commercial-interest page weight engine.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process of determining and using commercial-interest weights in connection with user interest profiles.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of example computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- the delivery of content (e.g., ads) in a content network to a particular user can be based on a current presentation page (e.g., webpage) that the user is visiting and/or on previous presentation pages that the user has visited.
- the content of the set of presentation pages visited by the user (or a portion thereof, as appropriate), along with the user's behavior relative to a displayed presentation page (e.g., clicking on a link or item of content), can be used to build a user interest profile for that particular user.
- Each user may have an associated user interest profile, which can be maintained at a central location (e.g., a server operated by a content serving entity) and/or on a local device associated with the user under consideration.
- a user interest profile can be implemented as a collection of keywords (and/or other signals) that indicate or suggest topics or subject matter that may interest the associated user.
- each keyword has an associated value (e.g., ranging between 0-50) indicative of its relevance within the context of the presentation page in which it appears.
- a content serving entity may choose content that relates to keywords in that user's interest profile having higher values rather than keywords with lower values.
- a particular user's user interest profile may be used, e.g., by a content serving entity to determine what ads and/or other content likely may interest a user and subsequently to deliver such content to the user with the hope and expectation that the user will express an interest in the served content, for example, by selecting or clicking on a content item, which in turn may result in the display of a presentation page associated with the served content item.
- a content serving entity determines what ads and/or other content likely may interest a user and subsequently to deliver such content to the user with the hope and expectation that the user will express an interest in the served content, for example, by selecting or clicking on a content item, which in turn may result in the display of a presentation page associated with the served content item.
- the keywords appearing on those pages may be collected, assigned respective values, and used to form, at least in part, the user's interest profile, which subsequently may be used in deciding which ads or other content items are to be displayed to the user when visiting presentation pages going forward.
- a content sponsor serving entity may use the user's interest profile to cause ads from vendors selling goods or services relating to camping, hiking, etc. to be displayed to the user since, based on the user's interest profile, such ads are likely to be of interest to the user.
- a potential expected outcome is that the user may click on one of the displayed ads and perhaps even continue one to consummate a sale (a process referred to as a “conversion”) on a presentation page associated with the vendor.
- Some presentation pages are more clearly indicative of a user's discernible interests than other presentation pages. For example, when a user visits a website or other presentation page associated with a specific vendor of goods/services, his or her interests are more easily discernible (namely, as relating to the nature of goods/services offered by that vendor) than when the user visits, e.g., a generic social network or news site. Moreover, a particular user's commercial interests (e.g., those interests that are relevant to the types of goods/services that the user is likely to purchase) may be more easily discernible from some types of presentation pages relative to other types of webpages.
- weighted presentation pages may be used to build user interest profiles that are optimized to suggest ads or other content that are likely to appeal to the user's commercial interests.
- a potential advantage of using such commercial-interest-weighted user profiles is that content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) are more likely to realize improved conversion rates, click-through-rates (CTRs) and the like, thereby increasing the return-on-investment (ROI) spent on their advertising dollars.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, a user's current location, or a user's browsing history), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, a user's current location, or a user's browsing history
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example operating environment 100 in which various aspects of the subject matter described here may be implemented.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects resource provider web sites 104 , user devices 106 , and the search engine 110 , and an advertisement management system 120 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of resource provider web sites 104 and user devices 106 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a content resource provider, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource is any data that can be provided by the resource provider 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JAVASCRIPT scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling the resource provider web sites 104 and indexing the resources provided by the resource provider web sites 104 .
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources, are stored in an index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 109 to the search engine 110 .
- the user devices 106 can interact directly with website 104 without going through the search engine 110 .
- the search queries 109 are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies the user device 106 that submits the request.
- the unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with the search engine 110 , or some other identifier that identifies the user device 106 or the user using the user device.
- the search engine 110 uses the index 112 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources in the form of search results 111 and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results page resource.
- a search result is data generated by the search engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score).
- IR information retrieval
- the search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- the user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result.
- the resource provider of the web site 104 hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from the user device 106 and provides the resource to the requesting user device 106 .
- the queries 109 submitted from user devices 106 are stored in query logs 114 .
- Click data for the queries and the web pages referenced by the search results are stored in click logs 116 .
- the query logs 114 and the click logs 116 define search history data 117 that include data from and related to previous search requests associated with unique identifiers.
- the click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by the search engine 110 .
- the query logs 114 and click logs 116 can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to web pages that were identified in search results and the actions taken by users (i.e., that data are associated with the identifiers from the search requests so that a search history for each identifier can be accessed).
- the click logs 116 and query logs 114 can thus be used by the search engine to determine the sequence of queries submitted by the user devices, the actions taken in response to the queries, and how often the queries are submitted.
- the advertisement management system 120 facilitates the provisioning of content items with the resources 105 .
- the advertisement management system 120 allows content sponsors to define rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide customized content items for the users.
- Example rules include keyword customization, in which content sponsor provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Content items that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots.
- the user device 106 When a user of a user device 106 selects an advertisement, the user device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage of the content sponsor.
- the resource providers 104 may include content sponsors, each having hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the content items of the content sponsors.
- a resource 105 from a resource provider 104 includes instructions that cause the user device to request content items from the advertisement management system 120 .
- the request includes a resource provider identifier and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource 105 .
- the advertisement management system 120 provides customized content items to the particular user device.
- the user device 106 renders the search results page and sends a request to the advertisement management system 120 , potentially along with one or more keywords related to the query that the user provide to the search engine 110 .
- the advertisement management system 120 generates one or more keywords by parsing the content of the request URL. In any event, the advertisement management system 120 , in turn, provides customized content items to the particular user device.
- the advertisement management system 120 includes a data storage system that stores campaign data 122 and performance data 124 .
- the campaign data 122 stores content items, customization information, and budgeting information for content sponsors.
- the performance data 124 stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items. Other performance data can also be stored.
- the campaign data 122 and the performance data 124 are used as input parameters to an advertisement auction.
- the advertisement management system 120 in response to each request for content items, conducts an auction to select content items that are provided in response to the request.
- the content items are ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in the performance data 124 .
- the highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram 200 of commercial-interest weight calculation engine 200 , which may be used to determine a commercial-interest weight for each of the presentation pages 205 visited or otherwise viewed by a user.
- each of the pages 205 visited by a user over a predetermined period of time e.g., 30 minutes
- a predetermined period of time e.g. 30 minutes
- the oldest page 215 is analyzed and weighted first while the page immediately preceding the most recent page 210 is analyzed and weighted last, although a different ordering could be used.
- the most recent page 210 i.e., the current page
- his/her user profile is derived only from the preceding pages—that is, only from those past pages are the commercial weights computed.
- Each page's respective commercial-interest weight which represents the likelihood that the page under consideration is indicative of the commercial-interests of the particular user that visited the page, may be calculated by the engine 220 using one or more factors 225 .
- the factors may include (1) the page's expected revenue; (2) the page's expected CTR (Click-Through-Rate); (3) the duration of time that the user spent on the page under consideration; (4) the page's publisher quality; (5) the quantity of ads and/or other content items that were determined to be available for display on the page under consideration; (6) the similarity between the page under consideration and the most recent page 210 ; (7) the time decay (e.g., time lapse) between display of the page under consideration and the most recent page 210 ; and (8) any other suitable factor tending to indicate the likelihood that the page under consideration is indicative of the user's commercial interests.
- Page's Expected Revenue this factor relates to the expected amount of revenue that is generated by the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page having a higher expected revenue is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower expected revenue.
- a page's expected revenue may be calculated, for example, by summing the respective CPM (Cost-Per-Mille or, equivalently, cost per thousand impressions) for each of the ads displayed on the page.
- CPM Cost-Per-Mille or, equivalently, cost per thousand impressions
- the range of expected revenues can be bucketized into percentiles. For example, a page having relatively high expected revenue may fall into the 90 th percentile of expected revenue values, meaning that the engine 220 would use 0.9 as the factor value corresponding to the page's expected revenue.
- Page's Expected CTR this factor relates to the historical rate, as extracted from the logs, that users clicked on one of the ads displayed on the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page having a higher CTR is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower CTR.
- CTR values fall between zero and one.
- Time Spent on Page this factor relates to the duration of time (e.g., measured in seconds) that the user spent on the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page on which a user lingered for a relatively long time is more likely to be of interest to the user.
- Page's Publisher Quality this factor relates to the historical rate, as extracted from the logs, that an impression of the page resulted in a conversion, for example, by a user clicking on a displayed ad and then following up to consummate a commercial transaction (e.g., a purchase) with the associated advertiser or vendor, the underlying logic being that a page having a higher conversion rate is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower conversion rate. Publisher quality values fall between zero and one.
- Quantity of Ads this factor relates to the quantity of ads that, based on the advertisers' respective criteria, were available to be displayed on the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page having a relatively high number of potentially available ads for display is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower number of potentially available ads for display. Quantity of ads values are positive, whole numbers.
- Similarity in Content this factor relates to the degree of similarity between the page under consideration and the most recent page, the underlying logic being that the most recent page more accurately reflects the user's current or most recent interests, and this a page having a relatively high degree of similarity with the most recent page also is likely to accurately reflect the user's current interests.
- the similarity in content factor may be calculated using a cosine similarity function, with output values ranging from zero (no detected similarity) to one (virtual identity).
- Time Decay this factor relates to the duration of time (e.g., measured in seconds) that lapsed between the user's visiting the page under consideration and the user's visiting the most recent page, the logic being that the longer the duration the less likely that the page under consideration accurately represents the user's current interests.
- the commercial-interest page weight engine 220 uses one or more of the above-described factors to calculate page weights 230 , that is, a separate page weight for each individual page 205 that was analyzed (i.e., not including current page 210 ). Once all of the page weights have been calculated for the pages 205 , the resulting values may be normalized to cause them all to fall between zero and one. The normalized page weights 230 may then be associated with their respective corresponding pages and used to generate, or update, the user's user interest profile 235 . This may be accomplished, for example, by multiplying each of the page's keyword values by the commercial weight for the page.
- the user interest profile 235 included information describing a particular page (e.g., Page X) visited by the user along with an indication of, e.g., three keywords appearing on Page X having example normalized values of 0.90, 0.70, and 0.20, respectively.
- the engine 220 calculates that Page X has a normalized commercial-interest weight of 0.5. Accordingly, to account for Page X's calculated commercial interest weight, the values of each of the keywords associated with Page X would be multiplied by 0.5, thereby causing the keyword values of Page X to be modified to 0.45, 0.35, and 0.10, respectively.
- the corresponding calculated commercial interest weight for that page may be zero, thereby causing the keyword values for that page in the user interest profile also to be modified to zero.
- the corresponding calculate commercial interest weight for that page may be one, thereby causing the keyword values in the user interest profile for that page to remain unaffected.
- user interest profile keywords appearing on pages having a lower likelihood of being indicative of a user's commercial interest will have a proportionately smaller effect, if any, on the choice of ads and/or other content items to be presented to the user on current and/or future pages.
- user interest profile keywords appearing on pages having a high likelihood of being indicative of a user's commercial interest will have a proportionately larger effect on the choice of ads and/or other content items to be presented to the user on current and/or future pages.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 of determining and using commercial-interest weights in connection with user interest profiles.
- the process 300 maintains a user interest profile corresponding to a particular user and containing information (e.g., keywords along with an identification of the publisher page on which the respective keywords appeared) that describes the particular user's history of visiting publisher pages over a predetermined period of time (e.g., the last 30 minutes).
- the process 300 analyzes each of the publisher pages in the particular user's interest profile to identify publisher pages that indicate a level of commercial interest.
- the process 300 assigns a commercial-interest weight value to each of the publisher pages using, e.g., one or more factors including the page's expected revenue, the page's expected CTR, the duration of time that the user spent on the page under consideration, the page's publisher quality, the quantity of ads and/or other content items that were determined to be available for display on the page under consideration, the similarity between the page under consideration and the most recent page, and/or the time decay (e.g., time lapse) between display of the page under consideration and the most recent page.
- the time decay e.g., time lapse
- the process 300 updates the particular user's interest profile based on the assigned commercial-interest weight values, e.g., by adjusting the respective values of the keywords associated with a page using that page's commercial-interest weight value.
- the process 300 uses the updated user interest profile to determine subsequent content items to be presented to the particular user when visiting publisher pages.

Abstract
Systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and computer storage media encoded with computer programs for maintaining a user interest profile corresponding to a user and containing information describing visits to publisher sites (e.g., and/or individual pages within a site) over a predetermined period of time; analyzing each of the visited publisher sites in the particular user's interest profile to identify publisher sites that indicate a level of commercial interest; based on a result of the analyzing, assigning a commercial-interest weight value to each of the visited publisher sites such that publisher sites indicating higher levels of commercial interest receive higher commercial-interest weight values than publisher sites indicating lower levels of commercial interest; updating the particular user's interest profile based on the assigned commercial-interest weight values; and using the updated user interest profile to determine subsequent content items to be presented to the particular user when visiting publisher sites.
Description
- This specification relates to providing digital content items (e.g., advertisements and/or other types of presentations) to users in a display environment.
- Resource providers (e.g., publishers such as web site publishers) may include content such as sponsored content in their respective publications to help financially support their operations. Some resource providers do not maintain a content sponsoring (e.g., advertising) infrastructure, and thus depend on third party content sponsor serving companies to recruit content sponsors and to serve content items to the resource providers' sites. Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances. For example, a content sponsor serving company can provide directed content items, such as advertisements, to identified groups of users. Content items, such as advertisements, can be directed to the user by selecting suitable or appropriate content based on the user's user profile.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and computer storage media encoded with computer programs that include the actions of maintaining a user interest profile corresponding to a particular user and containing information that describes visits to publisher sites (e.g., and/or individual pages within a site) over a predetermined period of time; analyzing each of the visited publisher sites in the particular user's interest profile to identify publisher sites that indicate a level of commercial interest; based on a result of the analyzing, assigning a commercial-interest weight value to each of the visited publisher sites such that publisher sites indicating higher levels of commercial interest receive higher commercial-interest weight values than publisher sites indicating lower levels of commercial interest; updating the particular user's interest profile based on the assigned commercial-interest weight values; and using the updated user interest profile to determine subsequent content items to be presented to the particular user when visiting publisher sites.
- Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- The delivery of content (e.g., ads) in a content network to a particular user can be based on a current presentation page (e.g., webpage) that the user is visiting and/or on previous presentation pages that the user has visited. The content of the set of presentation pages visited by the user (or a portion thereof, as appropriate), along with the user's behavior relative to a displayed presentation page (e.g., clicking on a link or item of content), can be used to build a user interest profile for that particular user. Each user may have an associated user interest profile, which can be maintained at a central location (e.g., a server operated by a content serving entity) and/or on a local device associated with the user under consideration. In general, a user interest profile can be implemented as a collection of keywords (and/or other signals) that indicate or suggest topics or subject matter that may interest the associated user. Typically, each keyword has an associated value (e.g., ranging between 0-50) indicative of its relevance within the context of the presentation page in which it appears. In deciding which content to deliver to a user, a content serving entity may choose content that relates to keywords in that user's interest profile having higher values rather than keywords with lower values.
- A particular user's user interest profile may be used, e.g., by a content serving entity to determine what ads and/or other content likely may interest a user and subsequently to deliver such content to the user with the hope and expectation that the user will express an interest in the served content, for example, by selecting or clicking on a content item, which in turn may result in the display of a presentation page associated with the served content item. As an example, assume that over a predetermined period of time a particular user has been visiting presentation pages that include keywords relating to outdoor recreational activities such camping, hiking, hunting and fishing. The keywords appearing on those pages may be collected, assigned respective values, and used to form, at least in part, the user's interest profile, which subsequently may be used in deciding which ads or other content items are to be displayed to the user when visiting presentation pages going forward. In the above example, a content sponsor serving entity may use the user's interest profile to cause ads from vendors selling goods or services relating to camping, hiking, etc. to be displayed to the user since, based on the user's interest profile, such ads are likely to be of interest to the user. By doing so, a potential expected outcome is that the user may click on one of the displayed ads and perhaps even continue one to consummate a sale (a process referred to as a “conversion”) on a presentation page associated with the vendor.
- Some presentation pages—for example, the keywords and/or other signals appearing thereon—are more clearly indicative of a user's discernible interests than other presentation pages. For example, when a user visits a website or other presentation page associated with a specific vendor of goods/services, his or her interests are more easily discernible (namely, as relating to the nature of goods/services offered by that vendor) than when the user visits, e.g., a generic social network or news site. Moreover, a particular user's commercial interests (e.g., those interests that are relevant to the types of goods/services that the user is likely to purchase) may be more easily discernible from some types of presentation pages relative to other types of webpages. Accordingly, upon inferring a user's commercial interest from one or more presentation pages visited by the user—some of which have been determined to more clearly indicate the user's commercial interest than others—that information can be used as weighting factors to be applied to the corresponding presentation pages in the user's browsing history. The weighted presentation pages, in turn, may be used to build user interest profiles that are optimized to suggest ads or other content that are likely to appeal to the user's commercial interests. A potential advantage of using such commercial-interest-weighted user profiles is that content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) are more likely to realize improved conversion rates, click-through-rates (CTRs) and the like, thereby increasing the return-on-investment (ROI) spent on their advertising dollars.
- In situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, a user's current location, or a user's browsing history), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample operating environment 100 in which various aspects of the subject matter described here may be implemented. Acomputer network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects resourceprovider web sites 104,user devices 106, and thesearch engine 110, and anadvertisement management system 120. Theonline environment 100 may include many thousands of resourceprovider web sites 104 anduser devices 106. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 is maintained by a content resource provider, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A resource is any data that can be provided by the
resource provider 104 over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JAVASCRIPT scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network. - To facilitate searching of these
resources 105, thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling the resourceprovider web sites 104 and indexing the resources provided by the resourceprovider web sites 104. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources, are stored in anindex 112. - The
user devices 106 submitsearch queries 109 to thesearch engine 110. Alternatively, or in addition, theuser devices 106 can interact directly withwebsite 104 without going through thesearch engine 110. When thesearch engine 110 is employed, thesearch queries 109 are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies theuser device 106 that submits the request. The unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with thesearch engine 110, or some other identifier that identifies theuser device 106 or the user using the user device. - In response to the search request, the
search engine 110 uses theindex 112 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries. Thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 111 and returns the search results to theuser devices 106 in search results page resource. A search result is data generated by thesearch engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. - The search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score). The search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- The
user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users. In response to the user selecting a search result at auser device 106, theuser device 106 requests the resource identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result. The resource provider of theweb site 104 hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from theuser device 106 and provides the resource to the requestinguser device 106. - In some implementations, the
queries 109 submitted fromuser devices 106 are stored in query logs 114. Click data for the queries and the web pages referenced by the search results are stored in click logs 116. The query logs 114 and the click logs 116 definesearch history data 117 that include data from and related to previous search requests associated with unique identifiers. The click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by thesearch engine 110. The query logs 114 and clicklogs 116 can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to web pages that were identified in search results and the actions taken by users (i.e., that data are associated with the identifiers from the search requests so that a search history for each identifier can be accessed). The click logs 116 and querylogs 114 can thus be used by the search engine to determine the sequence of queries submitted by the user devices, the actions taken in response to the queries, and how often the queries are submitted. - The
advertisement management system 120 facilitates the provisioning of content items with theresources 105. In particular, theadvertisement management system 120 allows content sponsors to define rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide customized content items for the users. Example rules include keyword customization, in which content sponsor provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Content items that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots. - When a user of a
user device 106 selects an advertisement, theuser device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage of the content sponsor. For example, theresource providers 104 may include content sponsors, each having hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the content items of the content sponsors. - These customized content items can be provided for many different resources, such as the
resources 105 of theresource providers 104, and on a search results page resource. For example, aresource 105 from aresource provider 104 includes instructions that cause the user device to request content items from theadvertisement management system 120. The request includes a resource provider identifier and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of theresource 105. Theadvertisement management system 120, in turn, provides customized content items to the particular user device. - With respect to a search results page, the
user device 106 renders the search results page and sends a request to theadvertisement management system 120, potentially along with one or more keywords related to the query that the user provide to thesearch engine 110. Alternatively, or in addition, theadvertisement management system 120 generates one or more keywords by parsing the content of the request URL. In any event, theadvertisement management system 120, in turn, provides customized content items to the particular user device. - The
advertisement management system 120 includes a data storage system that storescampaign data 122 andperformance data 124. Thecampaign data 122 stores content items, customization information, and budgeting information for content sponsors. Theperformance data 124 stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items. Other performance data can also be stored. - The
campaign data 122 and theperformance data 124 are used as input parameters to an advertisement auction. In particular, theadvertisement management system 120, in response to each request for content items, conducts an auction to select content items that are provided in response to the request. The content items are ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in theperformance data 124. The highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram 200 of commercial-interestweight calculation engine 200, which may be used to determine a commercial-interest weight for each of the presentation pages 205 visited or otherwise viewed by a user. As shown, each of thepages 205 visited by a user over a predetermined period of time (e.g., 30 minutes) is analyzed by the engine 220 and assigned a corresponding commercial-interest weight 230. In this example, theoldest page 215 is analyzed and weighted first while the page immediately preceding the most recent page 210 is analyzed and weighted last, although a different ordering could be used. The most recent page 210 (i.e., the current page) is not analyzed and weighted, rather the user interest profile is generated from past pages. For example, when the user is on the current page 210, his/her user profile is derived only from the preceding pages—that is, only from those past pages are the commercial weights computed. - Each page's respective commercial-interest weight, which represents the likelihood that the page under consideration is indicative of the commercial-interests of the particular user that visited the page, may be calculated by the engine 220 using one or
more factors 225. The factors, described in more detail below may include (1) the page's expected revenue; (2) the page's expected CTR (Click-Through-Rate); (3) the duration of time that the user spent on the page under consideration; (4) the page's publisher quality; (5) the quantity of ads and/or other content items that were determined to be available for display on the page under consideration; (6) the similarity between the page under consideration and the most recent page 210; (7) the time decay (e.g., time lapse) between display of the page under consideration and the most recent page 210; and (8) any other suitable factor tending to indicate the likelihood that the page under consideration is indicative of the user's commercial interests. - (1) Page's Expected Revenue—this factor relates to the expected amount of revenue that is generated by the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page having a higher expected revenue is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower expected revenue. A page's expected revenue may be calculated, for example, by summing the respective CPM (Cost-Per-Mille or, equivalently, cost per thousand impressions) for each of the ads displayed on the page. To determine a value of this factor to be used by the engine 220, the range of expected revenues can be bucketized into percentiles. For example, a page having relatively high expected revenue may fall into the 90th percentile of expected revenue values, meaning that the engine 220 would use 0.9 as the factor value corresponding to the page's expected revenue.
- (2) Page's Expected CTR—this factor relates to the historical rate, as extracted from the logs, that users clicked on one of the ads displayed on the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page having a higher CTR is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower CTR. CTR values fall between zero and one.
- (3) Time Spent on Page—this factor relates to the duration of time (e.g., measured in seconds) that the user spent on the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page on which a user lingered for a relatively long time is more likely to be of interest to the user.
- (4) Page's Publisher Quality—this factor relates to the historical rate, as extracted from the logs, that an impression of the page resulted in a conversion, for example, by a user clicking on a displayed ad and then following up to consummate a commercial transaction (e.g., a purchase) with the associated advertiser or vendor, the underlying logic being that a page having a higher conversion rate is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower conversion rate. Publisher quality values fall between zero and one.
- (5) Quantity of Ads—this factor relates to the quantity of ads that, based on the advertisers' respective criteria, were available to be displayed on the page under consideration, the underlying logic being that a page having a relatively high number of potentially available ads for display is more likely to be commercial in nature—and thus more likely to be indicative of the user' commercial interests—than a page having a lower number of potentially available ads for display. Quantity of ads values are positive, whole numbers.
- (6) Similarity in Content—this factor relates to the degree of similarity between the page under consideration and the most recent page, the underlying logic being that the most recent page more accurately reflects the user's current or most recent interests, and this a page having a relatively high degree of similarity with the most recent page also is likely to accurately reflect the user's current interests. The similarity in content factor may be calculated using a cosine similarity function, with output values ranging from zero (no detected similarity) to one (virtual identity).
- (7) Time Decay—this factor relates to the duration of time (e.g., measured in seconds) that lapsed between the user's visiting the page under consideration and the user's visiting the most recent page, the logic being that the longer the duration the less likely that the page under consideration accurately represents the user's current interests.
- The commercial-interest page weight engine 220 uses one or more of the above-described factors to calculate
page weights 230, that is, a separate page weight for eachindividual page 205 that was analyzed (i.e., not including current page 210). Once all of the page weights have been calculated for thepages 205, the resulting values may be normalized to cause them all to fall between zero and one. The normalizedpage weights 230 may then be associated with their respective corresponding pages and used to generate, or update, the user'suser interest profile 235. This may be accomplished, for example, by multiplying each of the page's keyword values by the commercial weight for the page. For example, assume that, prior to modifying theuser interest profile 235 to account for the commercial weight of the page, theuser interest profile 235 included information describing a particular page (e.g., Page X) visited by the user along with an indication of, e.g., three keywords appearing on Page X having example normalized values of 0.90, 0.70, and 0.20, respectively. Assume further that the engine 220 calculates that Page X has a normalized commercial-interest weight of 0.5. Accordingly, to account for Page X's calculated commercial interest weight, the values of each of the keywords associated with Page X would be multiplied by 0.5, thereby causing the keyword values of Page X to be modified to 0.45, 0.35, and 0.10, respectively. Similarly, for a page determined to have zero likelihood of indicating a user's commercial interest, the corresponding calculated commercial interest weight for that page may be zero, thereby causing the keyword values for that page in the user interest profile also to be modified to zero. Conversely, for a page determined to have among the highest likelihood of indicating a user's commercial interest, the corresponding calculate commercial interest weight for that page may be one, thereby causing the keyword values in the user interest profile for that page to remain unaffected. - In this manner, user interest profile keywords appearing on pages having a lower likelihood of being indicative of a user's commercial interest will have a proportionately smaller effect, if any, on the choice of ads and/or other content items to be presented to the user on current and/or future pages. Conversely, user interest profile keywords appearing on pages having a high likelihood of being indicative of a user's commercial interest will have a proportionately larger effect on the choice of ads and/or other content items to be presented to the user on current and/or future pages.

FIG. 3 is a flow chart of anexample process 300 of determining and using commercial-interest weights in connection with user interest profiles. At 305, theprocess 300 maintains a user interest profile corresponding to a particular user and containing information (e.g., keywords along with an identification of the publisher page on which the respective keywords appeared) that describes the particular user's history of visiting publisher pages over a predetermined period of time (e.g., the last 30 minutes). Next, at 310, theprocess 300 analyzes each of the publisher pages in the particular user's interest profile to identify publisher pages that indicate a level of commercial interest. - At 315, based on a result of the analyzing, the
process 300 assigns a commercial-interest weight value to each of the publisher pages using, e.g., one or more factors including the page's expected revenue, the page's expected CTR, the duration of time that the user spent on the page under consideration, the page's publisher quality, the quantity of ads and/or other content items that were determined to be available for display on the page under consideration, the similarity between the page under consideration and the most recent page, and/or the time decay (e.g., time lapse) between display of the page under consideration and the most recent page. In general, publisher pages indicating higher levels of commercial interest receive higher commercial-interest weight values than publisher pages indicating lower levels of commercial interest. - At 320, the
process 300 updates the particular user's interest profile based on the assigned commercial-interest weight values, e.g., by adjusting the respective values of the keywords associated with a page using that page's commercial-interest weight value. At 325, theprocess 300 uses the updated user interest profile to determine subsequent content items to be presented to the particular user when visiting publisher pages. -
