4. for colliding the exemplary method and system that avoid
Fig. 6 is the simplified flowchart for illustrating the method according to one exemplary embodiment.Specifically, it is wearable with HMD
Computer implemented method 600 in response to neighbouring object to initiate collision and avoid acting.
More specifically, method 600 is related to wearable computer and shows user on the display of HMD substantial transparent
Interface, the user interface include viewing areas and at least one content area outside viewing areas, as illustrated in block 602.
Initially, the state of user interface is so that viewing areas is substantially filled with the HMD visual field, and at least one content area regarding
Yezhong is not fully visible.In this original state, wearable computer shows one or more virtual in viewing areas
Object, as shown in block 604.Wearable computer then uses the data from one or more first sensors as determination
The basis of the distance between HMD and physical objects, as indicated at block 606.It is determined that after distance between HMD and physical objects,
Identified distance can be used to avoid the basis of action as initiation collision for wearable computer, and it is weak that the collision avoids action from including
Change in shown virtual objects it is at least one so as to provide the transparent display through HMD to physical objects less by
The viewing of obstruction, as shown in block 608.
The degree of approach and/or the relative motion data of neighbouring physical objects can be used what to be determined in exemplary wearable computer
When be likely to occur collide and as response arrangement wearable computer HMD.For example, exemplary wearable computer can make
With proximity data, the proximity data can indicate that from wearable computer (or from associated with wearable computer
Sensor) to it is each nearby object distance.The proximity data, which is subsequently used in, determines when object is too near to, and as sound
HMD (for example, by the way that virtual objects are substantially removed from the visual field of wearer) should be arranged.
In addition to proximity data, some embodiments can analyze relative motion data, and the relative motion data may indicate that
Go out fortune of the real world objects relative to wearable computer (or relative to sensor associated with wearable computer)
Dynamic speed and/or direction.Term " relative motion " can refer to object wearing relative to this data of measurement in the case
Wear the speed and/or acceleration of computer (for example, sensor relative to the wearable computer for measuring this data).This
Sample, the relative motion of object are also considered as motion of the object relative to the wearer of this wearable computer.So as to thing
The relative motion of body can depend not only on the motion of their own, and also depend on wearable computer (or wearable computing
The sensor of machine) motion.
As indicated, in certain embodiments, proximity data and relative motion data can be used in wearable computer
Combination come determine with neighbouring object collision risk whether so that HMD should be organized.For example, wearable computer is for touching
Hit and avoid that variable thresholding distance can be achieved, it depends on object towards the relative velocity of wearable computer.Specifically, it is wearable
Computer can adjust threshold distance according to the relative motion and/or direction of neighbouring object.For example, wearable computer can be substantially
On (a) nearby object towards wearable computer relative velocity increase when and/or (b) nearby object track indicate collision
Reduce when more likely and initiate to collide threshold distance when avoiding, vice versa.Replaceable implementation can utilize motion and away from
Determine the time untill collision from data, then using this to collision untill time as initiation collision avoid acting
Basis.
As a specific example, can be assigned with one from ten meters of distant places with the first close object of the relative velocity of two metre per second (m/s)s
It is determined that distance, the determination distance is assigned to from ten meters of distant places with the determination of the second close object of the relative velocity of a metre per second (m/s)
The half of distance.Because the first object in this example can cause risk of collision more immediately, exemplary method can be favourable
Initiate more urgent collision and avoid acting in ground.In addition, some exemplary systems can be configured as being only in response to close to display
The object of device and activate collision and avoid acting, without distance determined by consideration.Other examples are also possible.
Some exemplary methods can relate to detect the physical hazard outside the visual field, and be initiated in response to this harm
Collision avoids acting.For example, HMD may be close to too lower on the ground so that it cannot the object seen by display window
(for example, curb, stub, step).Although the virtual objects on HMD may not just cover the viewing to this object, should
The harm tripped can be presented to HMD wearer in object.
A. distance is determined
The combination of various sensors or sensor can be used to avoid acting for initiating collision to obtain for wearable computer
Data.For example, some embodiments are using the data from video camera.As a specific example, HMD may include preposition phase
Machine, it can be configured as catching the image extended to outside the visual field provided in viewing areas.Then, integral or long-range attachment
Computing device can represent physical objects and further to estimate come a part for the image that determine to catch using image processing techniques
Count the distance between camera and the object.In the case, camera and wearable computer can send out the range data of this estimation
It is sent to the computing system for performing object detection process.Therefore, the distance having determined can be used as activation in object detection process
Collision avoids the basis of action.
As another example, some embodiments are assessing whether to initiate when collision avoids action using from one or more
The data of individual acoustics or optical sensor.For example, one exemplary embodiment can include active acoustical sensing process to determine true generation
The degree of approach of boundary's object.This process can relate to launch clearly defined ping, and then detection returns to the reflected sound of system
Ripple (that is, echo).Additionally or alternatively, some embodiments can include active optics sensing process, and the process is related to transmitting
Clearly defined light wave, the light wave detect the light wave of reflection generally outside visible spectrum.In any case, demonstrate
This technology can be used to detect the presence of neighbouring object and determine the degree of approach of object nearby in sexual system.In addition, this technology
Available for tracking the motion of these physical objects over time (for example, determining to transport by periodically repeating this technology
It is dynamic).
Data Collection can be carried out using any one of many exemplary sensors.In some cases, sense
Device can handle initial data to determine the distance of object, then this determination is just sent out to the processing be responsible for collision and avoid action
Device.In other cases, processor can receive initial data and it be handled to determine the distance of object.
In certain embodiments, the data received from one or more range sensors can also be used to determine around HMD
The position of physical objects.For example, sensor can be configured as detecting the line and ground and and HMD between physical objects and HMD
The angle that the direction just faced is formed.So, it can determine that the position of physical objects (that is, utilizes two angles in three dimensions
With relative distance as spherical coordinates).Then, the position determines the part for the covering physical objects that can be used for tracking HMD.For example,
If vectorial direction between HMD and physical objects, should in the summary lower left in the vectorial direction in the front for representing HMD
Object largely can be covered by the virtual objects of HMD lower left quarter.Determination to covering part can help to enable HMD true
The optimal collision for being set for being applied avoids acting.In the example of the object of center lower left, some are exemplary
Method can only influence the virtual objects in the bottom left section of screen.
B. relative motion is determined
As indicated, in certain embodiments, the relative motion of object is available adjusts and will be avoided for initiating collision
The basis of the distance of the identified object of action.It is thus possible to use either individually or in combination various types of sensors with
Just the relative motion of object nearby is determined.
In certain embodiments, second group sensor can be used for collecting and reporting relative motion data.In practice, this
Second group sensor can partially or even wholly include first group of sensor.For example, active optics detecting system can launch it is short
Monochromatic pulses and the frequency, phase offset and time delay for measuring close echo.Time delay and phase offset can be used for determining
Reflect the distance of object.Extraly, frequency and phase place change can be used for the relative velocity for determining object.In this example, first
Can be actually identical sensor with second sensor.However, it is also possible to for determining that the sensor of relative motion data can be with
Those are used for the sensor separation for determining proximity data.
C. collision is initiated to avoid acting
It may be in response to many factors and activate collision and avoid acting.For example, for physical objects in given distance threshold
Determination can be used as activation collision avoid action basis.In addition, for physical objects just with the phase higher than given speed threshold value
Activation fully can be used as towards the determination of HMD movements to speed and collide the basis for avoiding acting.As another example, it may be determined that
Physical objects just accelerate on HMD direction.For wearable computer during exercise or the viewing areas of user interface fills
Mixed and disorderly determination is divided also to be used as the basis that activation collision avoids action.In addition, any factor in these factors or it is all because
Element can be combined to form the basis that action is avoided for activating collision.For example, one exemplary embodiment may be in response to from acceleration
Meter receives the data in the motion for indicating speed of the wearable computer more than with certain speed threshold value and activates collision
Avoid acting, wherein the certain speed threshold value is determined from the data for indicating percentage that viewing areas is occupied.
In certain embodiments, the identified distance of physical objects can be used as the basis that activation collision avoids action.Example
Such as, a kind of method can be all objects setpoint distance threshold value.Then, may be in response to determine physical objects in this distance threshold and
Activation collision avoids acting.In some exemplary systems and method, multiple distance thresholds can avoid acting phase with multiple collisions
Association.
In certain embodiments, action is avoided only to be applicable apart from the collision for determining or using distance as activation basis
In the physical objects fully covered by HMD.For example, system can determine that physical objects close to HMD, but the viewing to object not by
HMD is covered.In this example, the collision for the virtual objects that reduction is shown to HMD avoids action from not providing to physical objects
The viewing less hindered.Therefore, exemplary system can determine that touches without using the degree of approach of this physical objects as activation
Hit the basis for avoiding action.Alternatively, some one exemplary embodiments can determine that the degree of approach of all physical objects detected
The basis of action is avoided as activation collision.
The basis for being determined as activation collision and avoiding action of the relative motion to object can be used in some embodiments.Example
Such as, some one exemplary embodiments can be configured as being substantial access to display only in response to object and activating collision and avoid moving
Make.In this case, identified distance can still function as the second basis that activation collision avoids action, but only identified
After the condition of relative motion is met.Some embodiments may include to set relative velocity threshold value, wherein being confirmed as with height
In threshold velocity speed fully towards HMD movement physical objects can be activation collision avoid action basis.It is similar
Ground, if it is determined that object more than threshold value rate of acceleration towards HMD just to accelerate, then exemplary wearable computer can be used as response hair
Collision is played to avoid acting.Other exemplary motor patterns can also be used.
As indicated on, in certain embodiments, available adjust of the relative motion of object avoids in its initiation collision
The basis of the threshold distance of the physical objects of action.For example, consider to move towards sensor with the relative velocity of two metre per second (m/s)s again
The first dynamic object and the second object moved with the relative velocity of a metre per second (m/s) towards sensor can be each true with institute with HMD
Ten meters fixed of distance.However, one exemplary embodiment can the relative motion based on the first object be the first object assign 12 meters
Threshold distance.Second object can be assigned based on its relative motion with eight meters of threshold distance.Then, may be in response to detect
The first object at ten meters and activate collision and avoid acting, but be not responsive to detect the second object at same distance and
Activation collision avoids acting.Pay attention to, the specific distance and adjustment in this and other example herein be in order at illustrate purpose and
There is provided, and be not construed as restricted.The distance of object nearby it has been susceptible to collide and/or has moved and has been touched for triggering
Hit and avoid the mode of action from may depend on specific implementation and different.
In certain embodiments, the identified time value untill collision can be used as initiating the base that collision avoids action
Plinth.Using the example from above section, the initial time value untill collision of the first object will be five seconds, and second
The initial time value untill collision of object will be ten seconds.If detect the system of these objects to collision untill when
Between threshold value be eight seconds, then only the first object will initially exceed the threshold value and activate collision and avoid acting.It can also be based on higher
The exercise data (for example, acceleration, wrench (jerk) etc.) of rank come determine or change to collision untill time.For example, such as
Initial second object close with a metre per second (m/s) in fruit above-mentioned example is also with a metre per second (m/s) (1m/s^2) per second rate of acceleration
Accelerate towards HMD, then the second object actually may can reach HMD in four seconds.Therefore, relative motion data can be used in HMD
It is close faster and assigned the shorter time untill colliding for this object to be expected this.
In certain embodiments, it can be used as the basis that activation collision avoids action to the determinations of HMD during exercise.For example,
System can be configured as only HMD with it is more than threshold velocity speed move when activation collision avoid acting.This embodiment is also
Other activation bases can be used, but only after HMD exceedes movement threshold.Some embodiments can be configured as only it is determined that HMD
Just start to detect physical objects after during exercise.
Mixed and disorderly horizontal another basis that action is avoided as activation collision can be used in some embodiments.For example, to miscellaneous
Random horizontal determination may include to receive the instruction to the amount for not being occupied region in the viewing areas of user interface.As another
One example, the number and size of the virtual objects shown in viewing areas can be used as mixed and disorderly horizontal basis.One embodiment is subsequent
Can just activation collision avoids acting only when horizontal in a jumble more than threshold value.
Predefined user preference can also indicate that the limitation for avoiding action to collision (for example, time restriction, the collision allowed
Speed and acceleration rate threshold for avoid acting, specifying etc.).As processing quality preference, system can be configured as only with
Just activation collision avoids acting when the viewing areas of family interface is fully mixed and disorderly.If for example, only one small virtual objects quilt
The adjacent edges of viewing areas are shown in, then system, which can determine that, to take collision to avoid in response to the physical objects detected
Action.
D. virtual objects are weakened
Exemplary collision avoids action from may include the one or more shown in the viewing areas of reduction user interface virtually
Object.Reduction virtual objects, which may include for example to remove, is confirmed as the virtual objects of covering physical objects, from viewing areas
Except all virtual objects, in viewing areas mobile virtual object, by virtual objects be moved to part in viewing areas and
Region of the part outside viewing areas, the size for reducing virtual objects and make it that virtual objects are at least partly transparent.Additionally
Ground, exemplary reduction action may include to describe the change to virtual objects in many ways.
5. exemplary collision avoids user interface
Once detecting neighbouring physical objects, then many potential collisions can be applied to avoid acting.It is for instance possible to use
A variety of methods weaken one or more virtual objects.Extraly, new virtual objects, audible alarm and/or thing can be used
Reason is indicated notice to be preferably attracted to detected physical objects.Avoid moving furthermore it is possible to combine exemplary collision
Make to maximize effect.
Fig. 7 A are the simplified illustrations according to the user interface of one exemplary embodiment.Specifically, Fig. 7 A, which are illustrated, wherein may be used
The state of the user interface 700 of action is avoided using collision.As illustrated, user interface 700 provides void in viewing areas 702
Intend object 706 and 708.User interface 700 provides content-label 712A, 712B and 712C, content regions also in content area 704
Domain 704 can be outside the shown portion of user interface 700.Extraly, some beyond display are shown in Fig. 7 A
Physical view, including the physical objects 710 close to display.As shown in Figure 7A, the viewing to physical objects is substantially
Covered by virtual objects 706 and virtual objects 708.
Fig. 7 B to 7H are the simplification figures of the user interface shown in Fig. 7 A being in the state different from shown in Fig. 7 A
Show.Specifically, each width in Fig. 7 B to 7H illustrates the user interface 700 after performing exemplary collision and avoiding action.
More specifically, Fig. 7 B illustrate removes showing for virtual objects 706 from the viewing areas 702 of user interface 700
Plasticity collision avoids the result of action.Extraly, provided in content area 704 it is corresponding with virtual objects 706 it is new in
Hold object 714.It is no longer substantially shielded that Fig. 7 B illustrate physical objects 710, because virtual objects 708 are covered to physics thing
The relatively small part of the viewing of body 710.After collision avoids action from activating, user can select content from content area
Object 714, and system can be used as response that virtual objects 706 are returned into viewing areas 702.In some cases, virtual
While object 706 is displayed in viewing areas 702, representing the content object of the content of virtual objects 706 may account for
According to content area.In this case, this exemplary collision avoids action from simply removing virtual objects from viewing areas 702
706, without creating new content object 714.
Fig. 7 C illustrate removes 708 liang of virtual objects 706 and virtual objects from the viewing areas 702 of user interface 700
The exemplary collision of person avoids acting.As in above-mentioned technology, if without offer and virtual objects in content area 704
706 corresponding content objects, then it can create and this content object 714 is provided in content area 704.In the process,
The content object 716 corresponding with virtual objects 708 can be also provided to content area 704.Except allowing to physical objects 710
Beyond more unimpeded viewing, this technology can also be more abundant compared with the technology of single virtual object is only removed from display
Ground attracts the notice of user.Advantageously, this collision avoids action from not needing object detection process to determine beyond viewing
The position of physical objects beyond region, and in order to which the technology described in application drawing 5B may then need the process.
It is each virtual for what is removed from viewing areas 702 in addition to embodiment represented in Fig. 7 B and Fig. 7 C
Object, the content object placed in content area 704 and represent each virtual objects can be in or be not in.For example, area unless the context
Beyond domain, exemplary user interfaces may also include history area, wherein there is the content object for the content for representing to close recently.Herein
In the case of, the content object for the virtual objects for representing to be removed can be created in history area, is placed as by the content object
Additional or substitution in content area 704.In addition, the removal of virtual objects can be not accompanied by any new content object.
Fig. 7 D illustrate moves rather than is removed from viewing areas virtual objects 706 and virtual in viewing areas 702
The exemplary collision of object 708 avoids the result of action.As shown in Figure 7 D, as simply by the shifting of virtual objects 706 and 708
The result of the side edge of viewing areas 702 is reached, physical objects 710 can be largely visible.In some cases, motion can be abided by
Follow predefined route.For example, display can be configured as the nearest transverse edge transverse shifting by object towards screen all the time
(Fig. 7 D example may be such case).Alternatively, wearable computer can be configured as based on the current of display
Plus lap the specific part of the viewing to physical objects to specify appropriate motor pattern.
Fig. 7 E illustrate another exemplary collision of mobile virtual object 706 and 708 in viewing areas 702 and avoid acting
Result.Different from the process illustrated in Fig. 7 D, virtual objects 706 and 708 can be moved at least by the process illustrated in Fig. 7 E
Position of the part outside viewing areas 702.In exemplary system, wearable computer can be configured as storing user interface
The position of the virtual objects outside viewing areas is given tacit consent in 700.Used as described above, wearable computer is also configured to change
The part for being provided to display of family interface 700.So, what system can provide actually greater than shown viewing areas can
Access user interface.Therefore, if virtual objects are partially moved to outside viewing areas, user interface can be provided for user
Continue to inspect the process of the virtual objects.For example, HMD may be configured such that if an object is moved from the center of display
To left side, and HMD is then turned left, then the object is brought back viewing areas using according to HMD motion as response
Center.
As shown in figure 7e, while virtual objects are partially moved to outside viewing areas, the content of virtual objects
It can remain intact, as illustrated in virtual objects 706.Alternatively, the content of virtual objects can be modified, the void being such as modified
Intend illustrated in object 708.In this example, the title of the content of virtual objects 708 and briefly pre- is retained in viewing areas
Look at, this object is identified to allow user to be easier.Many other contents can be applied to change for this situation.
Fig. 7 F illustrate the result that a kind of exemplary collision avoids action, wherein virtual objects 706 and virtual objects 708 still
Substantially its original position is displayed in viewing areas 702, but its size is reduced.By reducing the He of virtual objects 706
708 size, it can be seen that physical objects 710, and virtual objects 706 and 708 are positively retained at its home position.Certainly, such as
Fruit is combined by this process and another reduction technology, then in addition to diminution process, can move virtual objects from its home position
Open or otherwise influence virtual objects.As reduction technology illustrated in Fig. 7 E, in response to the big of virtual objects
Small reduction, the content of each virtual objects can be changed in several ways.For example, virtual objects 706 in Fig. 7 F
Content has uniformly been carried out size reduction, just as the diminution of single picture.As another example, virtual objects 708
Content is condensed to title and the brief excerpt from content.It is virtual right that exemplary technique may include that reception selection is minimized
The process that the user of elephant inputs and is used as response that the virtual objects are returned to its original size.So, the row of virtual objects 708
The content object that can be similar to show in viewing areas for mode.Many other contents can be used to reduce process.For example, can
Content change procedure is selected with the content based on specific virtual objects, expected reduction volume and/or user preference.
Fig. 7 G illustrate a kind of exemplary collision and avoid the result of action, wherein making virtual objects 706 and 708 at least partly
It is transparent, so that physical objects 710 can be easily visible by HMD transparent display.One exemplary embodiment can be only right
It is confirmed as the fully object of masking physical objects or to all virtual objects in viewing areas using transparent (in such as Fig. 7 G
Described).In addition, some embodiments can be configured as only causing a part of transparent of each virtual objects.It is if for example, single
Individual virtual objects cover whole screen, then exemplary technique may be such that the window of the virtual objects in the physical objects detected
Front becomes transparent, and keeps the remainder of the virtual objects substantially opaque simultaneously.
In addition to mobile and/or reduction virtual objects, it is one or more that exemplary collision avoids action from can relate to addition
Virtual objects protrude the physical objects detected.Fig. 7 H illustrate the result that a this collision avoids action.It is more specific and
Speech, in addition to mobile virtual object 706 and virtual objects 708, user interface also presents new virtual objects 718 and will noted
Gravitational attraction anticipate to close physical objects 710.This example new virtual objects 718 are illustrated as careful symbol and detected
Border around object.However, prominent object can take many forms.Extraly, if physical objects are partially visible,
This technology need not combine with other processes.In addition, if physical objects are detected outside the visual field beyond display, then newly
Virtual objects may include directional character or for certain the other instruction of potential barrier relative to display wherein.
It is exemplary collision avoid action can also the characteristic based on the physical objects detected come specify to be presented it is specific
New virtual objects.For example, the new virtual objects 718 from Fig. 7 H include the border around the object that detects.If detect
Different physical objects, then need to change the shape on this border to surround this different object.If the physics detected
Object then avoids a part for action that the thing that instruction detects can be presented outside the visual field of shown window cover as collision
The new virtual objects in the direction of body.In addition, if moved in a specific way (for example, being moved to the left, anxious by HMD wearer
It is busy to bend over, accelerate speed) it can be easiest to avoid one or more physical objects detected, then new virtual objects can be presented,
Such as point to the arrow of the direction of motion and/or the text of motion mode is indicated to wearer.
Exemplary collision avoids action from may also include non-vision alarm to remind wearer.For example, wearable display can
Including loudspeaker, audible alarm can be presented to supplement visual cues in it.Advantageously, this alarm can remind user, without changing
Become visual display.As new virtual objects are presented, non-vision alarm can be as the case may be.Such as, if it is determined that it is logical
Object can best be avoided by crossing wearer and being moved to the left, then audio alert may include the voice for saying " being moved to the left ".Extraly,
Non-vision clue may include physics clue, such as the vibration of system or the physics movement of display window.
One exemplary embodiment is also configured to combine any or all collision and avoids action from most effectively tackling collision
Avoid acting.For example, not only mobile virtual object but also its can be made partially transparent, and to cause compared with simply mobile object, physics
Object can with it is fully visible and cause circle-of-sight visibility it is more visible.As another example, if initial trial does not have the generation phase
(for example, avoid acting in spite of initial collision, but wearer continues to the proximity test in a manner of potentially dangerous for the influence of prestige
The object arrived), then collision avoids action from weakening virtual objects by successive step.For example, example procedure may include
Receive for instruction of the object in first threshold distance and provided as the mobile virtual objects of response to the thing
The viewing of body.The process, which may also include, receives the subsequent finger for the object that detects in second closer distance threshold value
Show and provide the viewing less hindered to close object as the mobile all virtual objects of response.Connecing
When receiving the extra instruction for continuing to cause risk of collision for object, example procedure may include one into virtual objects
Or all remove from viewing areas and finally present completely using size that is transparent, reducing virtual objects, by virtual objects
New virtual objects are to protrude physical objects.Action is avoided for those skilled in the art with the combination collision of many other advantageous manners
It will be apparent.
Exemplary display can be configured as in a variety of ways to describe the movement of virtual objects or removal.For example, seeing
See in region that the virtual objects that another location is moved to from a position can be shown in succession in middle position, with describe with
The similar pattern of the movements of physical objects.Object is being removed from viewing areas and corresponding content pair is created in content area
As when can also apply this process.In the case, the object can show the successive progress towards content area to graphically,
Until virtual objects by untill removing completely from viewing areas.Describing another example procedure of the removal of virtual objects can wrap
Include and little by little make it that the object is more transparent, untill it disappears from display.As another example, virtual objects are by from sight
Size reduction can be depicted as by seeing in region before removing.In addition, virtual objects can quilt before by the removal from viewing areas
Size increase is portrayed as to provide the impression of any that virtual objects pass through display and are moved to wearer rear.
Another exemplary depiction technology can in a manner of to indicate close barrier rapidly mobile virtual object help
Permission wearer is helped to be avoided using the instinct collision of their own motor-driven.For example, if the edge of virtual objects towards screen is rapid
Sweep and size increases, then compared with virtual objects are just disappearance, wearer can perceive physical objects around it more
Add close or just more promptly approach.Therefore, this motor pattern can describe the danger approached to wearer, so as to permit
Perhaps wearer carries out adjustment more immediately to avoid physical objects.In this example, computer can be based on the relative of physical objects
Position is come the screen edge that selects virtual objects to be moved to.If for example, on the left of HMD front but summary in central region
Place detects physical objects, then virtual objects can be exaggerated and move away to the left side of screen.As another example, if physics thing
The relative motion of body is directed towards the point only on the left of HMD summary, then object similarly can be swept towards the left hand edge of screen.One
In a little embodiments, virtual objects size can amplify while becoming more and more transparent, be until being removed completely from screen
Only.Virtual objects in the case of this need not move towards screen edge, and can just simply original place amplify, so as to provide void
Intend object just through HMD to the impression of any at wearer rear.
Some example procedures may include in response to receive for physical objects be no longer harm instruction or conduct
User input result and remove collision avoid action the step of.Exemplary collision avoids action therefore may include that handle is kept away in collision
The virtual objects that viewing areas is occupied before exempting from the activation of action are moved back into the process in its home position in viewing areas.
In addition, this process may also include the size and opacity for establishing virtual objects again.For example, the exemplary process of removing can wrap
Include and home position and content of the virtual objects in viewing areas are stored before activation collision avoids action.Then, in response to
Collision avoids action from being removed, and the original contents of virtual objects can be moved back into its raw bits in viewing areas by the process
Put.
After initiating collision and avoiding action, one exemplary embodiment may also include in response to receiving the second number from sensor
According to and remove collision avoid action technology.For example, in response to determining that static physical objects have the wearer's for directing at HMD
Relative motion, because wearer walks towards the stationary object, system can activate collision and avoid acting.Avoid moving by collision
The wearer for making to remind can adjust route to avoid the stationary object.Then, system can determine that the object no longer has and point to HMD
Relative motion and remove collision as response and avoid acting.As another example, when a cyclist is suddenly HMD's
When being turned round in threshold distance, HMD wearer may positive transfixion.Exemplary system can detect neighbouring cyclist
And activating collision avoids action from reminding wearer.Then, cyclist can move into away from HMD threshold distance with
Outside, and as response, system it can remove collision and avoid acting.Exemplary process is removed using many other.
Removing process also can be due to the input in addition to the distance except being received from sensor and relative motion data.Example
Such as, it can be received from one or more input equipments and indicate that should remove collision avoids the user of action from inputting.As specifically showing
Example, collision avoid action from may include virtual objects moving away to the left side of viewing areas or be even moved to the super of user interface
Go out in the part of the left margin of viewing areas.The wearer of display, which may want to ignore collision, to be avoided acting and recovers to quilt
The original viewing of mobile virtual objects.Exemplary system can be configured as rapid for wearer from motion sensor reception
Instruction that display is turned left and virtual objects are made to return to its home position as response.Many other use can be used
Family input technology, such as voice command, eye tracking eye motion, switch actuating or interacted with touch pad, indicating
Need to remove collision and avoid acting.
Although disclosed herein various aspects and embodiment, those skilled in the art will be clear that other side and implementation
