- Such classification can employ a probabilistic or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.
- a support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data.
- directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., na ⁇ ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used in this disclosure also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

Abstract
Systems and methods for media content licensing are disclosed. A reception component can receive a media file and an analysis component analyzes the media file in connection with a set of quality metrics. The analysis component can also determine characteristics of the media file including potential monetization of a new media file that integrates the media with other media content. A matching component can match the media file to a set of other media content for potential integration with the media file. In an aspect, the matching is based on the potential monetization of a new media file generated by integration of the media file with the subset of the other media content. A licensing component further presents the media file to an owner of a subset of the other media content to consider granting a license to use the subset of the other media content with the media file.
Description
- This disclosure relates to media content licensing, particularly to facilitating collaboration between media content owners based on a predicted monetization of the collaboration.
- A significant issue with publishing homegrown media content relates to managing unauthorized use of copyrighted content (e.g., music, audio, images . . . ) merged with the homegrown media content (e.g., video). For example, some developers of video may dub unauthorized copyrighted music to their video in order to enhance the video. Third party publishers of content, advertisers, and etc. spend considerable resources attempting to police unauthorized use of copyrighted content. Moreover, owners of copyrighted works (e.g., famous music artists) also spend considerable resources policing the Internet to detect and cease unauthorized use of their respective copyrighted works. In addition to costs associated with such enforcement efforts, there also is potential opportunity costs in not partnering up with certain homegrown developers in connection with monetizing their works.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure.

In an embodiment,system 100 employs areception component 110, ananalysis component 120 that can include aninference component 130, amatching component 140 and a licensing component. In an aspect,reception component 110 receives amedia file 180 andanalysis component 120 analyzes the media file in connection with a set of quality metrics. Then, matchingcomponent 140 matches the media file to a set of other media content for potential integration with the media file. The other media content can include content located at an external orinternal source 190. Licensingcomponent 150 further presents the media file to an owner of a subset of the other media content to consider granting a license to integrate the subset of the other media content with the media file. - As used herein, media content includes digital media content including but not limited to, video data, audio data, image data, or animation data. For example, media content can include movies, television, streaming television, video games, pictures, or music tracks. In an aspect, media content is stored in media files. For example, a
media file 180 can include a video recording file, an audio recording file, an image file, an image series file, or an animation file. Media content can include media data associated with one ormore data sources 190 that can be received and/or transmitted by a client device or by media collaboration system such as system 100 (and additional systems described in this disclosure). Adata source 190 can include one or more data stores storing media content and affiliated with a content provider that interacts with themedia collaboration system 100. In another aspect, adata source 190 can include any data store that stores media content remote or external from media collaboration system. Still in yet another aspect, adata source 190 can include any data store storing media content internally at media collaboration system. - A client device can include any suitable computing device associated with a user and configured to interact with or receive media content. For example, a client device can include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smart-phone, a tablet personal computer (PC), or a PDA. As used in this disclosure, the terms “content consumer” or “user” refer to a person, entity, system, or combination thereof that employs media collaboration system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure). In an aspect, a client device or media collaboration system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure) can be configured to access, transmit and/or receive media content via a network such as for example the Internet, intranet, or cellular service.
- According to an embodiment,
reception component 110 receives amedia file 180 which is then processed bysystem 100. The media file 180 is processed in order to determine other media content which may benefit from collaboration with themedia file 180. In an aspect, themedia file 180 received byreception component 110 can include homegrown media content. As used herein, the term homegrown media content generally refers to original media content generated by amateur users or individuals unaffiliated with corporate media production. For example, homegrown media content can include a home video of taken by an individual on his or her cellular phone. Further, the other media content that may benefit from a collaboration with a receivedmedia file 180 can include mainstream media content. As used herein, the term mainstream media content generally refers to original media content produced by corporate media production. For example, mainstream media content can include media content produced by a media corporation or a music production company for the purpose of generating revenue. - The terms homegrown media content and mainstream media content are used herein merely to differentiate from different types of media content that may be combined my media collaboration system 100 (and additional systems described herein) in accordance with various aspects of the subject disclosure. It should be appreciated that throughout the subject disclosure, reference to
media files 180 received byreception component 110 as homegrown media content and reference to the other media files to which receivedmedia files 180 are matched with for collaboration as mainstream media content, is merely employed for exemplary purposes. Any suitable type of media content can be received bymedia reception component 110 and matched for potential licensing with any other type of media content. For example, media content including the media content received and accessed bymedia collaboration system 100 can include registered and unregistered copyrighted material. - In an embodiment, users can provide
reception component 110 with amedia file 180 for the purpose of achieving collaboration with other media content. For example, a user may submit a personal home video tomedia collaboration system 100 with hopes of receiving a license to employ other media content in a new media work combining the user's media file and the other material. In another aspect,reception component 110 can scanmedia sources 190 for media files to determine potential pairings betweenmedia files 190 and other media content. For example,reception component 110 can perform a continuous scanning process to find media files or a periodic scanning process.Reception component 110 can further randomly select to receive media files in response to scanning or employ an intelligence agent (not shown) to facilitate selecting media files to receive in response to a scan. -
Analysis component 120 analyzes receivedmedia files 180 in order to facilitate determining potential collaborations between the received media files and other media content.Analysis component 120 determines or infers (e.g., via inference component 130), various characteristics of a receivedmedia file 180 that can later be employed by matchingcomponent 140 to match themedia file 180 with other media content. Theanalysis component 120 also analyzes other media content in a same or similar manner as a received media file to identify or determine characteristics of the other media content. In addition,analysis component 120 can determine and/or infer (e.g., via inference component 130), potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating the received media file with other media content. Thematching component 140 can further employ the potential monetization of the new media file generated by integrating the received media file with the other media content to facilitate matching themedia file 180 with the other media content. - In an aspect,
analysis component 120 vets receivedmedia files 180 against one or more metrics to determine various technical characteristics of themedia file 180 including but not limited to: type, format, resolution, encoding, quality, and fidelity. In an aspect, the technical characteristics of amedia file 180 can be grouped as quality metrics and can include measures for determining media resolution, format, encoding, fidelity, and etc., including but not limited to measurements of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), perceptual evaluation of video quality (PEVQ), structural similarity (SSIM), and czenakowski distance (CZD). - In one embodiment, the
analysis component 120 can determine whether a received media file meets a pre-determined quality threshold required to undergo matching the receivedmedia file 180 with other potential media content for integration with the media file. In another embodiment, theanalysis component 120 can associate a received media file with various quality metrics and/or technical metrics. For example, theanalysis component 120 can associate a receivedmedia file 180 with a general quality score and/or results for determinations in various contributing quality categories, including format, resolution, encoding, and fidelity. The associated quality score and/or contributing technical metrics can later be employed by thematching component 140 as consideration factors when selecting matches of other media content for potential integration with themedia file 180. Further, the associated quality score and/or metrics for a receivedmedia file 180 can be taken into consideration when determining licensing agreements between the received media file and other matched content. - Similarly, the
analysis component 120 can also determine technical characteristics and requirements of other media content. For example, theanalysis component 120 can determine the quality of other media content as well as features including type, format, resolution, encoding, quality, and fidelity. Later, theanalysis component 120 and/or the matching component can further determine or infer correlations and similarities between technical characteristics of other media content and a receivedmedia file 180. - In another aspect,
analysis component 120 can determine substantive characteristics of amedia file 180 and other media content, including but not limited to author, artist, or producer of a media file, context of creation of a media file, and other content based characteristics of amedia file 180. For example, theanalysis component 120 can extract information about a media file and other media content from metadata associated with themedia file 180 and/or the other media content. In another aspect, theanalysis component 120 can employ a search engine (not shown) to find substantive information about a media file and/or other media content available at one ormore data sources 190. Theanalysis component 120 can also determine features of amedia file 180 and other media content including length, object movement, rhythm, and mood. Further, theanalysis component 120 can analyze content of amedia file 180 and other media content to determine or infer what the media file is about. For example, theanalysis component 120 can determine or infer a description of a video. - In an embodiment, the
analysis component 120 can employ audio and video analysis software to perform various analysis of video and audio content to determine substantive characteristics of amedia file 180 and other media content. For example, theanalysis component 120 can determine rhythm, beat, pitch, intonation, dialect, language, instrumentation, etc. in an audio track that includes vocal sound and a plurality of types of musical instrument sounds. As a result, theanalysis component 120 can estimate information including but not limited to, rhythms, moods, notes, instruments, words, voices, styles, genres, tempos, patterns, and etc. associated with an audio track. In another example, theanalysis component 120 can determine movement of objects in the media content, identity of objects, changes in dimensions of objects (such as changes in dimensions associated with close ups and fade outs), colors present in different frames of a media file, words or noises spoken or written in a media item and/or inflection associated with the words or noises spoken in a media item. - In another embodiment, the
analysis component 120 can analyze and determine or infer (e.g., via inference component) social value associated with a media file and or other media content. As used herein, the term social value relates to the popularity of a media file with respect to one or more demographic audiences. In an aspect, theanalysis component 120 can determine or infer current and prospective social value of a media file and/or other media content based on user interest in media content. For example, theanalysis component 120 may determine that a particular media file comprising footage of a popular football game is popular with men between the ages of 12 and 60. In an embodiment, theanalysis component 120 can determine user interest in media content associated with a media file or other media content based at least in part on content consumer traffic associated with the media content. In an aspect,analysis component 120 can determine user interest in media content based on user interaction of media content, including but is not limited to, viewing a section of a media content, controlling playing of a section of media content, bookmarking a section of media content, referencing a section of media content, communicating a section of media content, posting or storing a section of media content, tagging or bookmarking a section of media content. - In yet another aspect, the analysis component can employ extrinsic information to determine social value of a
media file 180 and/or other media content. For example, extrinsic information can include but is not limited to, world wide web (web) postings associated with sections of media content, clippings of sections of media content, web links associated with the sections of the media content, user queries associated with the media content, or information regarding user interest in media content associated with social networking websites. According to this aspect, extrinsic information can be employed by theanalysis component 120 to determine or infer content consumer interest media content. For example, multiple views of a particular of media content accompanied by postings of links to the particular section of the media content and multiple search queries for the particular media content can be employed as a measure of content consumer interest in the particular section of the media content. - The
analysis component 120 can further examine patterns in media content that receives relatively high user interest to identify characteristics of media content that correlate to user interest. For example, theanalysis component 120 may determine that video clips featuring celebrities are more popular than video clips featuring unknown individuals, or that video clips with attractive people are generally popular compared to similar video clips featuring unattractive people. The analysis component can further attribute a higher social value to media content that includes one or more identified popular characteristics. - In addition to various characteristics and features of
media files 180 and other media content, theanalysis component 120 can determine and/or infer potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating a receivedmedia file 180 with other media content. Theanalysis component 120 can employ a variety of techniques to determine and or infer potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating a receivedmedia file 180 with other media content. In an aspect, the potential monetization of a new media file can be a function of the social value of a new media file attributed to the joining of the content, the audiences reached, and attraction and integration of the new media content by advertisers. For example, mainstream media content may reach an otherwise unresponsive demographic audience through the integration into a popular homegrown video. - In another embodiment, potential monetization of a new media file can be a function of the quality of the new media file based in part on the individual quality of the
media file 180 and the other media content in which it is integrated. In yet another embodiment, theanalysis component 120 can examine and determine potential monetization of a new media file as a function of trends in media content, including trends between previous media content joinings and the monetization value resulting there from. Further, theanalysis component 120 can examine and determine potential monetization of a new media file as a function of target audiences of advertisers, techniques of advertisers, and popular products and services of advertisers which would likely be enhanced through association with the new media file. - In an embodiment, the
analysis component 120 can employ aninference component 130 to facilitate making inferences or determinations in connection with determining characteristics ofmedia files 180, determining characteristics of other media content, and potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating a receivedmedia file 180 with other media content. In order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described in this disclosure,inference component 120 can examine the entirety or a subset of data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about characteristics ofmedia files 180, other media content, and potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating a receivedmedia file 180 with other media content.Inference component 130 can be granted access to any information associated withcollaboration system 100, including information logged and/or monitored byanalysis component 120 and stored inmemory 170, as well as accessible extrinsic information. An inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events or data. - Such inference can result in construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly or implicitly trained) schemes or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.) can be employed in connection with performing automatic or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
- A classifier can map an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, such as by f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used in this disclosure also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.
- Referring back to
FIG. 1 , in anembodiment matching component 140 matches a receivedmedia file 180 to a set of other media content for potential integration with themedia file 180. In an aspect, the set of other media content can include any media content accessible bymedia collaboration system 100 at one or more internal orexternal data sources 190. In another aspect, the set of other media content can include media content affiliated withmedia collaboration system 100, such as media content to which media collaboration system has previously received permission to employ. Still in yet another aspect, the set of other media content can include a subset of all other media content to whichmedia collaboration system 100 is granted access to employ that has been restricted by one or more initial narrowing parameters applied by thematching component 140 in response to an initial analysis of a received media file byanalysis component 120. For example, analysis component may determine initial technical characteristics of a media file such as quality or format, and thematching component 140 may identify a subset of other media that can be matched to the media file which employ a same or similar quality and/or format. - In an embodiment,
matching component 140 matches a received media file to a set of other media content based on one or more characteristics of the media file and the set of other media content and/or potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating the media file with the subset of other media content. For example, technical characteristics of a media file and other media content as determined by theanalysis component 120 can include but are not limited to type, format, resolution, encoding, quality, and fidelity. Substantive characteristics of a media file and other media content can include but are not limited to author, artist, producer, cast, context of creation, subject matter or content, rhythm, mood, beat, tone style, genre, and etc. In an aspect, a characteristic of a video or audio file can include a description of what the video or audio content is about. In addition, a characteristic of a media file and other media content can include its social value and factors contributing to social value. - In an aspect, the
matching component 140 can identify one or more similarities and/or correlations between a receivedmedia file 180 and other media content based on their respective characteristics. Thematching component 140 then matches the receivedmedia file 180 to the set of other media content for potential integration with the media file based on the one or more similarities and/or correlations to identify a subset of the other media content which the matching component determines as “good” matches for integration with themedia file 180. Thematching component 140 can employ any technique to determine a “good” match. In an aspect, thematching component 140 can select the top ten matches having the greatest percentage of similarities and/or having the highest degree of correlation. In another aspect, thematching component 140 can be configured to select matches having a having a percentage of similarity and/or degree of correlation that surpasses a predetermined threshold value. In an aspect,licensing component 150 can then present the subset of good matches to an owner of the subset of the other media content to consider granting a license to integrate the subset of the other media content with the media file. - In an embodiment, the
matching component 140 can identify correlations and similarities between a media file other media content based on data trends in media indicating correlations between media content characteristics and correlations between media content characteristics and monetization value. In an aspect, the trends can relate to positive trends regarding media content characteristics and monetization value as well as negative trends regarding media content characteristics and monetization value. For example, positive trends can be pre-defined and relate to generally accepted uses of media content that also results in an increase in monetization value. According to this example, a positive trend could be associated with media content use that includes non-discriminative use, non-offensive use, non-vulgar use, and etc. while a negative trend could be associated with discriminative, offensive, or vulgar use of media content. Thematching component 140 can further be configured to match media content based on positive trends while avoiding matching based on negative trends. - According to this aspect, any of the
matching component 140,analysis component 120, and/orinference component 120 can identify correlations between media characteristics through analysis of existing media. For example, theanalysis component 120 may determine that general history shows that certain type of video often is employed with a certain type of song. For example, theanalysis component 120 may determine that a media file is a snowboarding video and find other snowboarding videos having audio tracks associated therewith. Thematching component 140 can then identify the audio tracks associated with the other snowboarding videos as possible audio tracks for integration with the snowboarding media file. - In an embodiment, the
matching component 140 can perform matching of a media file to a subset of other media content based in part on a determined or inferred description of the media file. For example, thematching component 140 may match homegrown video having the description of “funny video of a woman falling of her chair” with other media content having a similar description or with a lighthearted audio track with a “boom” noise that can be matched to the timing of the woman's fall in the video. In another embodiment, thematching component 140 can perform matching of media files with other media content based on a potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating the media file with a subset of other media content. For example, theanalysis component 120 can determine or infer (e.g., via inference component) the potential monetization of paired media content. In turn, thematching component 140 can be configured to select subset of media content as “good” matches with a media file when the potential monetization of the integrated media content is above a predetermined threshold. - Still in yet another aspect, the
matching component 140 may employ a variety of factors including similarities and/or correlations in characteristics, potential monetization, and social value associated with a media file and/or other media content, in order to determine good matches. For example, the matching component can associate matches with a weighted score based on the various factors employed and find matches having a score surpassing a predetermined value. According to this example, thematching component 140 may determined that a media file has a strong correlation with a subset of other media content, and also determine that the other media content has a high social value. Further, thematching component 140 may determine that the combined media content has a high potential monetization. As a result, thematching component 140 may determine that the media file and the subset of the other media content is a good match having a match score of for example, 8 out of 10. -
Licensing component 150 is configured to present receivedmedia files 180 to an owner of media content the matching component identifies as good or qualifying potential matches. In turn, the owner of the subset of the other media content that is matched to amedia file 180 can consider granting a license to the owner of themedia file 180 to integrate the subset of the other media content with the media file. For example, thelicensing component 150 may send an owner of a subset of the other media content and electronic message indicating one or more media file 180 that have been matched with his or her subset of other media content. The electronic message can further include a description of the basis for the match, such as information about the media file, scores associated with the match, and/or a potential monetization value associated with the integration of the media file with the owner's media content. - With reference to
FIG. 2 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of amedia collaboration system 200 that facilitates dynamic media content licensing in accordance with the subject disclosure.System 200 can includeauthorization component 210 that authorizes granting a license to integrate the subset of the other media content with themedia file 180 when the potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating the media file with the subset of the other media content is above a pre-determined threshold. In an aspect, in response to authorization byauthorization component 210, an owner of themedia file 180 can automatically be granted a license to integrate the subset of the other media content with his or her media file and upon granting, begin legal integration and use. - In an embodiment, the
authorization component 210 automatically authorizes the granting of licenses based on media content owner authorization information provided by the content owner. According to this embodiment, content owners, or assignee's thereof, can pre-authorize licensing agreement regarding their media content by providingsystem 200 with authorization information. In an aspect, content owners can providesystem 200 with authorization information regarding licensing agreements in general which can be stored by the system inmemory 170. In another aspect,authorization component 210 may access licensing authorization information for content owners stored at an external data store (not shown). In an aspect, users can opt-out of providing personal information in connection with providing authorization information. - In an aspect, content owner authorization information can specify requirements for authorizing a licensing agreement with respect to his or her media content. For example, a media content owner may provide authorization for
authorization component 210 to automatically authorize a licensing agreement to allow integration of his or her media content with that of another when the potential monetization of a new media file generated by integrating the media file with the subset of the other media content is above a pre-determined threshold. - In another aspect, a content owner may specify other parameters for which automatic authorization of licensing agreements regarding his or media content may be granted. For example, authorization information may set limits for quality levels, subject matter of content, or authors and producers of creation. According to this example, a content owner may automatically authorize a licensing agreement for when potential monetization is above ten thousand dollars, when the quality of owner of the media content to which the license is granted is above a specified grade, when the subject matter of the other media content does not include lewd content, and when the author or producer is not John Smith. In an aspect, any media content owner, including owners of media files received by
system 200 and owners of media content accessed bysystem 200, may provide authorization information for the automatic granting of licensing agreements by authorization component. - Additional parameters for which automatic authorization of a licensing agreement may be granted can account for the intended use of media content. According to this aspect, a media content owner may only grant automatic authorization of his or media content when the licensee agrees to use the media content a required by the licensor. For example, a media content owner may forbid usage of his or her media content in a political satire, in an offensive or crude manner, or in a politically correct manner. In an aspect, in order to receive automatic authorization for a license to user certain media content, the authorization component can require the licensee to select a dialog box indicating agreement to the usage parameters defined by the content owner of the licensor.
- With reference to
FIG. 3 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of amedia collaboration system 300 that facilitates dynamic media content licensing in accordance with the subject disclosure.System 300 can includeselection component 310 that receives user preferences of owners of receivedmedia files 180 that they may have regarding other media content that they may desire to integrate with their media files 180. In an embodiment, thematching component 140 can perform matching based in part on the user preferences. In an aspect, users can opt-out of providing personal information in connection with providing user preference information. - In an aspect, a user of
system 300 may provide preferences regarding the other media content to match with his or her media content. The user can include the owner or affiliate of a received media file. In an aspect, a user may submit amedia file 180 tosystem 300 for processing, including matching themedia file 180 with other media content. The owner can further provideselection component 310 with various user preferences regarding the other media content to match with his or her media file. For example, the owner may indicate characteristic requirements of the other media content, such as technical characteristics and substantive characteristics. In another aspect, the user may provide general preferences regarding a user's likes, dislikes, and associations. For example, a user may indicate genres of music he likes, actors he likes, political parties he likes, his demographic affiliations, his age, his educational status, his marital status, and etc. In another example, the user may provide preferences regarding matches the he or she does not favor, including matches which facilitate offensive use, lewd use, inappropriate use, use with media content including a political agenda, or use with media content including profanity, and etc. In turn, the matching component can match a media file associated with the user to a set of other media content for potential integration with the media file based on his or her preferences. - In an embodiment, a user may provide preference information to selection component in the form a user profile. A user may provide
system 300 with a profile comprising preference information which can be associated with the user each time the user submits amedia file 180 or eachtime system 300 receives a media file associated with the user. The user profile can further be stored inmemory 170. In another aspect, selection component can employ extrinsic information associated with a user to determine user preferences. For example, selection component may extract user preferences from a profile of the user associated with a social networking website. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of amedia collaboration system 400 that facilitates dynamic media content licensing in accordance with the subject disclosure.System 400 can includerevenue share component 410 that shares revenue with owners of content associated with a new media file generated by integrating the media file with the subset of other media content. Therevenue share component 410 can provide for auditing and distributing revenue to respective parties associated with the new media file in accordance with a granted license. - In an embodiment, the
licensing component 150 presents the media file to an owner of a subset of the other media content to consider granting a license to integrate the subset of the other media content with the media file. In another embodiment, the authorization component can automatically authorize the granting of the license. Regardless of the manner in which a license is obtained, the license can provide an agreement governing the monetary distribution of revenue earned from a new work or media file generated by integrating a receivedmedia file 180 with other media content. For example, a licensing agreement may include terms that provide the licensor (i.e. owner of the other media content) with 75 percent of the revenue generated from the new work and the licensee (i.e. the owner of the received media file 180) with 25 percent of the revenue generated from the new work. - The
revenue share component 410 is configured to monitor the usage of the new work and any revenue generated in connection with the usage of the new work. The revenue share component can further track money owed to respective parties and provide the respective parties indication of the money owed thereto. In an aspect, the revenue share component can also control the distribution of revenue generated by the new work. For example, therevenue share component 410 can collect money generated through usage of the new work in a joint account associated with the new work. The revenue share component can further distribute to the money to individual accounts of the respective contributing parties from the joint account based on the parameters regarding monetary distribution in the licensing agreement. It should be appreciated that an aspect, users can opt-out of providing personal information in connection with monitoring and revenue sharing aspect. Further, one or more security measures can be employed by revenue share component keeps confidential financial information provided by users secure. - Referring now to
FIG. 5 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of amedia collaboration system 500 that facilitates dynamic media content licensing in accordance with the subject disclosure.System 500 can includeadvertising component 510 that presents a new media file generated by integrating a receivedmedia file 180 with other media content to potential advertisers in connection with purchasing advertisement space associated with the new media file. In an aspect,advertising component 510 can employanalysis component 120 and associatedinference component 130 to facilitate determining potential advertisers who may be interested in purchasing advertisement space associated with the new media file. -
System 500, viaanalysis component 120 and/orinference component 130 can identify and rank media content of user interest and popular segments of media that likely to have impact on particular content consumers, relevant to user interest, or likely to capture content consumer attention. In addition, theanalysis component 120 and/orinference component 130 can determine or infer respectively, the types of media content that draw audiences who may be interested in a product or service associated with an advertiser or advertisement. Further, theanalysis component 120 and/orinference component 130 can determine or infer respectively, the aims and interests of various advertisers. - The
advertising component 510 can then determine good matches between respective advertisements, new media files, target audience, geography, user demographics, purchasing history, etc. in order to facilitate optimizing advertising in connection with provisioning of new media file content generated by integrating a received media file with other media content. In turn, theadvertising component 510 can present the new media file to potential advertisers in connection with purchasing advertisement space associated with the new media file. Moreover, theadvertising component 510 can facilitate pricing of advertising impressions.

FIG. 6 , presented is an exemplary non-limiting embodiment of amedia collaboration system 600 that facilitates dynamic media content auctioning and licensing in accordance with the subject disclosure.System 600 facilitates media collaboration by allowing owners of media content to auction their media content for licensed use by others. For example, an owner of a homegrown media file may auction his or her work to publishers of other media content related to the homegrown media file. The publishers may for instance aggregate related media content to generate a complete body of media (e. g. an aggregation of homegrown video clips of sports highlights for a news report). In an aspect,system 600 can enable dynamic generation of greatest hits for a music genre, clips of recent sports highlights, or popular items for news feeds.System 600 can include anauctioning component 610 that presents a receivedmedia file 180 to publishers of other media content in an auctioning format. In turn,licensing component 150 can receive bids for a license to use themedia file 180. In an aspect, thelicensing component 150 can grant the license to use the media file to a highest bidder. - In an embodiment, the
analysis component 120 analyzes a receivedmedia file 180 and determines one or more characteristics of themedia file 180. For example, theanalysis component 120 may determine technical characteristics, substantive characteristics, social value, and or potential monetization of the media file when associated with or integrated with other media content associated with various publishers. Theauctioning component 610 can then present the media file to the publishers of other media content so that they may bid on receiving a license to use the media file. In an aspect, theauctioning component 610 can present themedia file 180 to a publisher of media content having one or more similar characteristics of the one or more characteristics of the content of themedia file 180. For example, theauctioning component 180 may present sports video clips to sports highlight providers. In another aspect, the auctioning component can associate the one or more characteristics of themedia file 180 with the media file in a searchable form. Providers of media content can then conduct a search for media content based on a characteristic and find respective media files being auctioned by auctioningcomponent 610 that have the characteristic. -
Auctioning component 610 can provide a bidding format that enableslicensing component 150 to receive bids for a license to use amedia file 180. As used herein, the term publisher of media content can include any user or entity that uses media content. In an aspect, a publisher of media content can include a user or entity that intends to publish media content, including amedia file 180 for which it is granted a license to use. -
Licensing component 150 can employ a variety of methods of granting licenses for usage of auctioned media content. In an aspect, thelicensing component 150 can receive bids for a license to use amedia file 180 and grant the license to use the media file to a highest bidder after a predetermined duration of time. In another aspect, thelicensing component 150 can receive bids and grant a license to any bidder willing to pay a predetermined amount of money for the license. Still in yet another aspect, thelicensing component 150 may provide various licensing agreement parameters, and provide the license to the bidder willing to accept the license which most favors the media file owner based on values provided by the media file owner. For example, amedia file owner 180 may indicate that he values receiving a high percentage of shared revenue from usage of his media file and further short term time limits on usage. As a result, a bidder willing to accept a licensing contract that provides the media file owner with the highest percentage of shared revenue and the shortest duration of time will win the license to use the media file. - In an aspect,
revenue share component 410 can be configured to share revenue associated with usage of an auctioned media file by the highest bidder or bid winner with owners of the media file and the highest bidder or bid winner in response to granting the license. For example, such media content may be auctioned off by the content owner for a percentage of revenue share based on advertising revenue generated by the end piece of his or her media content when associated with other media content of a bid winner. - Referring now to
FIG. 7 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of amedia collaboration system 700 that facilitates dynamic media content licensing and auctioning in accordance with the subject disclosure.System 700 can includepolicing component 710 to facilitate policing proper usage of licensed media content. In an aspect, a user can automatically and/or upon manual review, authorize a license based in part on agreement of the licensing to abide by usage requirements. For example, a licensor may require that his media content not integrated with other media content in the form of a political satire or for lewd purposes. In another aspect, a user may provide user preferences to facilitate matching of his or her media content with other media content. The user preferences can also provide likes and dislikes regarding matching of his or her media content. For example, the user may indicate that she does not like her media content matched with media content comprising cartoon characters with brown hair and blue skin. -
Policing component 710 can monitor usage of licensed media content to determine if the licensed media content is being used in accordance with usage parameters associated with the licensing agreement. Similarly,policing component 710 can monitor the activity of matchingcomponent 140 to determine whether the matching component is performing matching in accordance with user preferences. Policing component can employanalysis component 120 and/orinference component 130 to facilitate determining abidance to user licensing agreement parameters and/or user preferences. - In an aspect, the
policing component 710 can issue a notification to a media content owner and/or the licensee, if thepolicing component 710 determines an improper use or an improper matching of licensed media content. In yet another aspect, thepolicing component 710 can employrevenue share component 410 to apply a penalty system that deducts revenue from an improper user of media content. For example, in a licensing agreement where the licensor and the licensee are entitled to receive equal shares of revenue generated by a new work of their joined content, if the licensee uses the licensed media content in an improper way, thepolicing component 710 can direct therevenue share component 410 to automatically provide the licensor with 100 percent of the revenue generated as a result of the improper use. -
