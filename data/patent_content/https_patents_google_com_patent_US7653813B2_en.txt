- entire address may be derived using the shared key without separately obtaining a prefix and suffix.
- an entity in a communication network such as an access router needs to verify whether a mobile node is authorized to use a particular IP address it can do so by contacting the trusted network server. Such verification may be needed for instance when a mobile node sends a binding update to an access router as described in Fast Mobile IPv6 or when the mobile node responds to a neighbor solicitation to ensure that no other node in the network is using that address and to create a mapping between the mobile nodes IP address and the mobile nodes MAC address.

Abstract
Description
Suffix=Hash (MN-AAA key, MN — ID|AR — ID|advertised network prefix |“Suffix Generation Key”)
IP address of Node=Concatenation {Advertised network prefix and truncate[Suffix, suffix_lenght]}
AR Specific Address Key=Hash (MN-AAA key, AAA — ID|AR — ID|SPI|“Step 1”)
Suffix=Hash (AR Specific Address Key, MN — ID|Prefix|collision count |“Suffix”)
IP address of Node=Concatenation {Advertised network prefix and truncate[Suffix, suffix_length]}
AGK=PRF (PSK, Node ID|“Address Generation Key”), where | denotes concatenation.
In AAA-based scenarios, the PSK is the key that the node shares with the AAA server (e.g., MN-AAA secret). The Node ID in this case is the NAI of the node.
The IPv6 suffix of the address of the node is derived as follows.
Address Suffix=PRF (AGK, Link ID|Router ID|Nonce |Collision Count), where | denotes concatenation.
The Link ID may be the MAC address of the node; the Router ID is the IP address of the router advertising the IPv6 prefix; the nonce is a random value generated by the node. It is recommended that the nonce be a cryptographically generated value for added privacy. The collision count by default is 0 and is incremented by 1 every time there is a collision on the generated address. The Pseudo Random Function (PRF) used is SHA-1.
The generated suffix is then concatenated with the advertised prefix to form a complete IPv6 address for the node.
4. PBA Verification
The PBA may be sent to an entity that shares the PSK with the node for address ownership verification. Such a message must contain a hash of the address generated using the PSK. For instance, a node may use the AAA key to sign the message to the AAA server. The other parameters such as the nonce, link ID, router ID and collision count must also be sent to the AAA server.
After successful verification of the signature, the AAA server must generate the AGK corresponding to the node based on the PSK as in the previous section. The AGK can then be used along with the other parameters in generating the address suffix in exactly the same manner as done by the node. It is generally sufficient to verify that the node is claiming the right suffix.
