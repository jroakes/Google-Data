Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates to improving user convenience in online shopping by providing a direct link to purchase a product in a search result.
- Users conduct searches online for items that they are interested in purchasing. Particularly, users may conduct image searches so that they can have a visualization of the product that they are interested in purchasing. However, once a user has searched for an item and views search results associated with the item, a user must then access a website at which the user may initiate a purchase of the item. If the search result links to a merchant website, then the user must click the search result then click one or more options on the merchant website to purchase the item. If the search result does not link to a merchant website, then the user must first find the item on a merchant website or shopping application before purchasing the item. Thus, the process for purchasing an item associated with search results is inconvenient to the user and consumes unnecessary bandwidth and processing power.
- Techniques herein provide computer-implemented methods to provide image search results comprising purchase links for products associated with the image search results are provided. A search system receives an image search from a user and retrieves image search results based on the image search. For each image search result, the search system identifies a product based on metadata associated with the image search result. For each image search result, the search system associates an offer for the product corresponding to the image search result based on comparing metadata associated with the image search result to metadata associated with offers. For each image search result, the search system identifies a purchase link for the product associated with the offer associated with each image search result and generates a purchase icon within the image search result comprising the purchase link. The search system presents the image search results comprising the purchase icons to the user in response to the user's image search. The user selects, via the user computing device, a purchase icon of an image search result and the user computing device web browser is redirected to a website where the user may purchase the product corresponding with the purchase link.
- In certain other example aspects described herein, systems and computer program products to provide image search results comprising purchase links for products associated with the image search results are provided.
- In certain other example aspects described herein, computer-implemented methods, systems, and computer program products to provide text search results, audio search results, image search results, and/or video search results comprising purchase links for products associated with the respective search results are provided.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.

FIG. 5 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for completing an online purchase of the product associated with selected image result, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - The example embodiments described herein provide computer-implemented techniques to provide image search results comprising purchase links for products associated with the image search results. In an example embodiment, a search system receives an image search from a user and retrieves image search results based on the image search. For each image search result, the search system identifies a product based on metadata associated with the image search result. For each image search result, the search system associates an offer for the product corresponding to the image search result based on comparing metadata associated with the image search result to metadata associated with offers. For each image search result, the search system identifies a purchase link for the product associated with the offer associated with each image search result and generates a purchase icon within the image search result comprising the purchase link. The search system presents the image search results comprising the purchase icons to the user in response to the user's image search. The user selects, via the user computing device, a purchase icon of an image search result and the user computing device web browser is redirected to a website where the user may purchase the product corresponding with the purchase link.
- In an example embodiment, a user accesses a search website via a user computing device. For example, the user enters the website address of the search website into a web browser of the user computing device. In another example, the user selects a search application resident on the user computing device that communicates with the search website. The user submits a search query using the user computing device. In an example, the user submits one or more search terms comprising a combination of characters, alphabetical letters, symbols, blank spaces, and/or words. The search system receives the search query and retrieves image search results associated with the search query. For example, the search system retrieves image search results corresponding to one or more of the one or more search terms submitted by the user in the search query. In an example, the search system comprises a database of image search results that are tagged to match to search terms. In this example, the search system accesses the database of images and retrieves one or more image search results associated with one or more of the search terms received in the user's search query. The search system retrieves metadata associated with the retrieved image search results and identifies a product corresponding to each retrieved image search result based on the metadata associated with the image search results. In an example embodiment, one or more of the retrieved image search results comprise images from one or more corresponding publishers' websites. In this example embodiment, the metadata associated with an image search result comprises text from the corresponding publisher's website. In this example embodiment, the search system retrieves image metadata comprising text in proximity to the image from the publisher's website. For example, the metadata associated with the image search results comprises a text description of a product depicted by the image. In this example, the search system identifies the product depicted by the image based on metadata comprising the text description.
- The search system accesses metadata corresponding to offers and retrieves, for each image search result, one or more offers associated with the identified product corresponding to the respective image search result. In an example embodiment, the search system comprises a database of offers. In this example embodiment, offers in the database of offers may be associated with one or more merchant systems offering products for sale. An example offer comprises a description of a product and a price at which the user may purchase the product in an online transaction with a merchant system that sells the product. For each image search result, the search system selects an offer from the one or more retrieved offers to associate with the image search result. For example, the search system selects an offer corresponding to the lowest price at which the product is being offered for sale. In another example, the search system selects an offer corresponding to the lowest total cost including purchasing and shipping the item. In yet another example, the search system selects an offer corresponding to a merchant system that bids for advertising services. The search system identifies, for each image search result, a purchase link associated with the selected offer corresponding to the image search result. In an example embodiment, the purchase link is a merchant system website address that initiates an online transaction for the product. In another example embodiment, the link comprises a link to shopping search results corresponding to the product from a shopping service associated with the search system.
- In an example embodiment, the search system generates, for each image search result, a purchase icon within the image search result comprising the corresponding purchase link. For example, the purchase icon is superimposed on the image within the boundaries of the image. In another example, all or part of the image comprises the purchase icon. The search system presents the image search results comprising the corresponding purchase icons to the user computing device to display in response to the user's image search. The user selects a purchase icon of an image search result. For example, the user actuates an object on the user interface of the user computing device to select the purchase icon. For example, the user clicks, touches, or otherwise selects the purchase icon via the user computing device. In this example, the search system receives an indication of the user selection from the user computing device.
- The web browser of the computing device is redirected to the merchant system website associated with the purchase link and the offer on the merchant system website is displayed on the user computing device. In another example embodiment, an application that communicates with the merchant system website resident on the user computing device opens in response to the user selecting the purchase icon. The user selects an option on the merchant system website to purchase the product associated with the offer. For example, the user clicks a user interface object that reads “purchase now.” The merchant website requests payment and shipping information from the user and the user enters the requested information. For example the user may enter a shipping address and payment information associated with one or more of a credit card account, a coupon, a voucher, a rewards points account, a bank account, a merchant system store account, or any other applicable account that may be used in an online purchase transaction with the merchant system. The user selects an option to approve a payment transaction to purchase the product and the merchant system processes the payment transaction initiated by the user. In an example embodiment, the merchant system communicates with an issuer system, such as a credit card issuer system or coupon issuer system, associated with payment information provided by the user for use in the payment transaction.
- In certain other example embodiments, instead of or in addition to providing image search results, the search system provides text search results, audio search results, and/or video search results. In these example embodiments, the search system may provide one type of search results (for example, only video search results) or may provide a combination of two or more types of search results (for example, video, image, and text search results). In these example embodiments, a search system receives a search from a user and retrieves appropriate results based on the search. For example, the search system retrieves video search results, text search results, audio search results, and/or image search results. For each search result, the search system identifies a product based on metadata associated with the search result. For each search result, the search system associates an offer for the product corresponding to the search result based on comparing metadata associated with the image search result to metadata associated with offers.
- For each search result, the search system identifies a purchase link for the product associated with the offer associated with each search result and generates a purchase icon within the search result comprising the purchase link. For example, the search system generates the purchase icon in the form of an annotation to a text search result. In another example, the search system generates the purchase icon as an interface object superimposed over a region of a video search result as the video search result is being played after the user selects to play the video in the video search result. In this example embodiment, the purchase icon may be an annotation beside the video search result. In yet another example embodiment, the purchase icon may comprise an interface object superimposed over a region of an image search result. The search system presents the search results comprising the purchase icons to the user in response to the user's search. In another example embodiment, the search system provides a purchase icon to a publisher's website from which the search system obtained an image search result to associate with the image search result and to be displayed on the publisher's website.
- The user selects, via the user computing device, a purchase icon of search result and the user computing device web browser is redirected to a website where the user may purchase the product corresponding with the purchase link. For example, the user computing device web browser may be redirected to a merchant system website. In this example, the merchant website may show the product associated with the image result in a virtual shopping cart and display an option to check out or purchase the item. In this example, the user may enter shipping and/or payment information into the merchant website and select an option to purchase. In another example, when the user selects the purchase icon, an application associated with the merchant system opens on the user computing device. In this example, the user selects an option to check out, enters shipping and payment information, and selects an option to initiate a purchase of the item via the application, which communicates with the merchant system via a network.
- By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, the search system provides the user with a purchase link for an item associated with a search result in a search result in response to receiving a user search query. Additionally, the user, via the user computing device, by selecting a purchase link directly from a search result, does not have to manually search for a product to purchase in a shopping application or a merchant website. As such, the systems and methods described herein may provide a convenience to the user while also reducing bandwidth and processing required for linking a user to a product for purchase.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.

In an example embodiment, the user 101 submits a search query to thesearch system website 139 via thesearch application 113 or via theweb browser 119. In an example embodiment, the user 101 may actuate one ormore user interface 111 objects to direct thesearch application 113 or theweb browser 119 to submit the search query to thesearch system website 139 over thenetwork 140. For example, the user computing device 110 may comprise a touch screen keyboard interface that enables the user 101 to submit alphanumeric and/or symbolic characters to thesearch application 113 orweb browser 119 application for use in a search query. In another example, the user 101 submits audio, video, or image input as a search query to thesearch application 113 and/orweb browser 119 application. In an example embodiment, a user 101, after inputting a search query, actuates an object on theuser interface 111 to submit the search query. For example, the user 101 may click, touch, or otherwise actuate an icon on thesearch application 113 orweb browser 119 application that states “submit search query” or “search.” In an example embodiment, thesearch application 113 or theweb browser 119 resident on the user computing device 110 communicates the search query inputted by the user to thesearch system website 139 via thenetwork 140. - In
block 330, thesearch system 130 receives the search query. For example, thesearch system website 139 receives the search query via thenetwork 140 from thesearch application 113 or theweb browser 119 application resident on the user computing device 110. - In
block 340, thesearch system 130 retrieves images associated with the search query. In other example embodiments, thesearch system 130 retrieves one or more videos, audio files, text, and/or images. For example, the methods described herein to retrieve images may also be used to retrieve other types of search results, including videos, audio files, and text. - In an example embodiment, the
search system 130 parses the received search query into one or more search terms or otherwise determines one or more search terms based on the received search query. For example, the user 101 submits a search query comprising text reading “brand A refrigerator model 1200X.” In this example, thesearch system 130 may interpret the search query as comprising search terms “refrigerator,” “brand A,” and “model 1200X.” In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 retrieves images based on the search terms and ranks the retrieved images according to a compatibility with the search terms. In another example embodiment, thesearch system 130 retrieves one or more video files, audio files, text, and/or images. In an example, an image result of a brand A refrigerator model 1200X is more compatible with the user search terms “refrigerator,” “brand A,” and “model 1200X” than an image result of a brand A refrigerator model 500. - Continuing with this example, the image result of the brand A refrigerator model 500 is more compatible than an image result of a brand B refrigerator or a brand A freezer with the aforementioned search terms. In an example embodiment, the
search system 130 may determine a compatibility of each of the retrieved image search results by comparing information associated with the image results against the one or more search terms. For example, thesearch system 130 may comprise a database comprising image search results, wherein each image search result is associated with one or more text descriptors. For example, an image result comprising an image of a brand A piano may comprise text descriptors “piano,” “brand A,” “musical instrument,” “brand A piano,” “brand A instrument,” and/or other relevant text descriptors associated with the image result. In this example, another image result comprising an image of a brand A electric organ may comprise descriptors “organ,” “electric organ,” “brand A,” “musical instrument,” “brand A electric organ,” and/or other relevant text descriptors associated with the image result. In this example, the user 101 submits a search query comprising the search term “brand A piano.” In this example, thesearch system 130 retrieves search results comprising the image of the brand A piano and the image of the brand A electric organ. In this example, thesearch system 130 determines that the image result of the brand A piano is more compatible with the user's 101 search query than the image result of the brand A organ because the text descriptor “brand A piano” associated with the image of the brand A piano more closely matches the search term in the search query than any of the text descriptors associated with the image of the brand A electric organ. In an example embodiment, text descriptors associated with an image result are entered manually bysearch system 130 operators into asearch system 130 database. In another example embodiment, text descriptors associated with an image result are extracted from a website from which the image result was obtained by thesearch system 130. For example, thesearch system 130 may obtain an image from a publisher's website, wherein the publisher's website comprises a text description of the image displayed in proximity to the image. In this example, thesearch system 130 may generate one or more text descriptors to associated with the image based on the text description obtained from the publisher's website. - From
block 340, themethod 210 proceeds to block 220 ofFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 220, thesearch system 130 associates an offer with each image result. In other example embodiments, thesearch system 130 associates an offer with each video, audio, text, and/or image result. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting amethod 220 for identifying offers to associate with image results based on metadata associated with image results and metadata associated with offers, in accordance with certain example embodiments. The methods described herein to associate an offer with each image result based on metadata associated with the image results and metadata associated with offers may also be used to associate offers with each of one or more of video search results, audio search results, and/or text search results based on metadata associated with the search results and metadata associated with offers. Themethod 220 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 410, thesearch system 130 retrieves metadata associated with the retrieved image results. In an example embodiment, one or more of the image results is a copy of an image from a publisher's website from which thesearch system 130 obtained the image result. In this example embodiment, the publisher's website may, in addition to the image, comprise a text description of the image in proximity to the image. In this example embodiment, the metadata comprises the text description of the image. For example, the publisher's website comprises an image of a brand A piano model X and a text description comprising a customer review of the brand A piano model X. In this example, the text description identifies the image as a brand A piano model X. For example, the text description may read “Here is my new brand A model X piano that I recently bought from online merchant A.” In this example, the text description comprises information that identifies the image as a brand A piano and a model X piano, and identifies an online merchant from which the piano in the image may be purchased. - In
block 420, thesearch system 130 identifies a product corresponding to each retrieved image result based on the metadata. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 identifies a products corresponding to a particular image result based on metadata associated with the particular image result. For example, based on metadata associated with a retrieved image result comprising a text description from a publisher's website from which thesearch system 130 obtained the image result, thesearch system 130 identifies “brand A model X piano” as a product corresponding to the image result. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 identifies two or more products corresponding to a particular image result based on metadata associated with the particular image result. For example, based on the metadata associated with a particular image result, thesearch system 130 identifies “brand A model X piano” and “brand A piano bench” as products corresponding to the image result. - In an example embodiment, the
search system 130 identifies a product corresponding to a particular image result by comparing the image result to one or more other image results for which thesearch system 130 has identified a corresponding product. In this example embodiment, thesearch system 130 may comprise a database of image results and associated products. For example, the database of image results and associated products may associate image results with products. In an example, an image result of a user 101 search query comprises an image of a brand A model X piano, but thesearch system 130 is unable to identify the image result as corresponding to the product “brand A model X piano” based on metadata associated with the image result. In this example, thesearch system 130 may compare one or more features of the image result of the user's 101 search query to one or more corresponding features of image results in the database of image results and associated products. In this example, features of the image result may comprise color, pattern, brightness, shape, space, texture, or other properties of the image or of regions of the image associated with the image result. In this example, thesearch system 130 determines the features of the image result of the user's 101 search query and compares the features of image result of the user's 101 search query against the features of image results in the search system's 130 database of image results, which comprises at least one image result of a brand A model X piano. In this example, thesearch system 130 identifies an image result in the database comprising an image associated with the product “brand A model X piano” as having features that are most similar to the features of the image result of the user's 101 search query. In this example, thesearch system 130 identifies the image result of the user's 101 search query as a brand A model X piano based on the comparison of features. In this example, thesearch system 130 may only identify the product of the user 101 search query image result using this method if, upon comparison, the corresponding features of the user 101 search query image result and an image result in the database exceed a predetermined threshold similarity. - In
block 430, thesearch system 130 accesses metadata corresponding to offers. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 comprises a product offer listing catalog. In this example embodiment, the product offer listing catalog comprises a list of products and one or more offers associated with each listed product. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 obtains offers for products from one ormore merchant systems 120. For example, thesearch system 130 comprises a web crawler that periodically extracts information comprising offers from one or moremerchant system websites 129. In another example, one ormore merchant systems 120 periodically transmit, via thenetwork 140, a list of offers associated one or more products to thesearch system 120. - In
block 440, thesearch system 130 retrieves, for each image result, one or more offers associated with the identified product corresponding to the image result. In an example embodiment, for each image search result, thesearch system 130 identifies a product in the image search result and retrieves one or more offers associated with the identified product in the product offer listing catalog. In another example embodiment, thesearch system 130 identifies two or more products in an image search result and retrieves one or more offers associated with each of the two or more identified products in the product offer listing catalog. - In
block 450, thesearch system 130 selects, for each image result, an offer from the one or more retrieved offers to associate with the image result. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 selects an offer for which thesearch system 130 received a highest bid in an advertising auction. In this example embodiment, one ormore merchant systems 120, in addition to transmitting offers to thesearch system 130 to include in the product offer listing catalog, submit bids for the offers. In this example embodiment, amerchant system 120 is charged for the amount of the bid if thesearch system 130 provides a purchase link to the offer in an image search result to a user 101. In another example embodiment, thesearch system 130 selects an offer from the one or more offers offering the user 101 the lowest price for the product compared to the other offers. For example, the lowest price may be the lowest price for the product or the lowest price that includes the sum of the price of the product and shipping costs. In yet another example embodiment, thesearch system 130 selects an offer from the one or more offers corresponding to the mostreliable merchant system 120. For example, offers associated with amerchant systems 120 having a high number of positive user 101 and/or low number of negative user 101 reviews may be considered more reliable or trustworthy than offers associated withmerchant systems 120 having a low number of positive user 101 reviews or a high quantity of negative user 101 reviews. - In yet another example embodiment, the
search system 130 selects an offer from the one or more offers corresponding to a location of themerchant system 120 that is closest to a location of the user computing device 110 associated with the user 101 that submitted the search query. In this example embodiment, thesearch system 130 requests the user 101 location from the user computing device 110 over thenetwork 140. In this example embodiment, the user 101 enables location-based services on the user computing device 110 and the user computing device 110 transmits the current location of the user computing device 110 to thesearch system 130. In this example embodiment, thesearch system 130 compares the received location of the user computing device 110 against locations ofmerchant systems 120 associated with one or more offers associated with an image result. In this example embodiment, thesearch system 130 selects an offer from the one or more offers corresponding to the shortest distance between the location of the user computing device 110 and the location of themerchant system 120. - In yet another example embodiment, a
search system 130 may select an offer for each image search result based on preferences selected by the user 101 that submitted the search query. For example, the user 101 may select an option for thesearch system 130 to retrieve offers having the lowest price, offers having the mostreliable merchant system 120, offers corresponding tomerchant systems 120 in close proximity to the user 101 location based on user computing device 110 location data, or offers corresponding to another relevant user 101 preference. - From
block 450, themethod 220 proceeds to block 230 inFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 230, thesearch system 130 identifies, for each image result, a purchase link associated with the selected offer corresponding to the image result. In other example embodiments, thesearch system 130 identifies, for each image search result, text search result, audio search result, and/or video search result, a purchase link associated with the selected offer corresponding to the corresponding search result. An example purchase link comprises a link to amerchant system website 129 from which the selected offer originated. In an example embodiment, the purchase link comprises a link that, when selected by the user 101 operating the user computing device 110, redirects theweb browser 119 of the user computing device 110 to amerchant system website 129 that presents the offer to the user 101 and allows the user 101 to enter payment and/or shipping information to purchase the product. In another example embodiment, the purchase link comprises a link to a shopping system (not depicted) website offering the product for sale. - In
block 240, thesearch system 130 generates, for each image result, a purchase icon within the image result comprising the corresponding purchase link. For example, the purchase icon is located at a margin, corner, or other appropriate region of the image result so as not to occlude the user's 101 view of the image result. In another example, the purchase icon is located at a margin, corner, or other appropriate region of a video search result, an audio search result, and/or a text search result. In an example embodiment, the purchase icon comprises a text format. For example, the purchase icon comprises a price of the selected offer associated with the image result displayed in a corner of the image result. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130, when receiving an indication that a user 101 has selected a purchase icon, redirects theweb browser 119 of the user computing device 110 associated with the user 101 to thewebsite 129 associated with the purchase link. - In
block 250, thesearch system 130 presents image results comprising corresponding purchase icons to the user computing device 110 to display in response to the user's 101 image search query. In other example embodiments, thesearch system 130 presents video, audio, image, and/or text results comprising corresponding purchase icons to the user computing device 110 to display in response to the user's 101 search query. For example, from the user's 101 perspective, the user 101 submitted an image search query or other search query to thesearch system 130 and thesearch system 130 presents the image results comprising the purchase icons to the user 101 in response to receiving the image search query. In another example embodiment, thesearch system 130 transmits an image result comprising a purchase icon to a publisher's website from which the offer associated with the image result was obtained by thesearch system 130. In this example embodiment, the publisher's website replaces the image result with the corresponding image result comprising the purchase icon. - In
block 260, the user 101 selects a purchase icon of an image result. For example, the user 101 actuates an object of theuser interface 111 to select a purchase icon of an image result. In an example embodiment, the user computing device 110 transmits, via thenetwork 140 and to thesearch system 130, an indication of the user's 101 selection of the purchase icon of the image result. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 receives, from the user computing device 110 via thenetwork 140, the indication of the selection of the purchase icon of the image result by the user 101. In an example embodiment, in response to receiving the indication of the user's 101 selection of the purchase icon, thesearch system 130 identifies the purchase link associated with the purchase icon. - In
block 270, the user computingdevice web browser 119 is redirected to amerchant system website 129 associated with the purchase link. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 transmits instructions to the user computing device 110 comprising the purchase link and instructing theweb browser 119 of the user computing device 110 to redirect to a website associated with the purchase link. In an example embodiment, the user computing device 110 receives the purchase link and the instructions from thesearch system 130 and instructs theweb browser 119 to display thewebsite 129 associated with the purchase link. In an example embodiment, the user computingdevice web browser 119 communicates with themerchant system server 127 via thenetwork 140 to display thewebsite 129 on the user computing device 110. In another example embodiment, the user computingdevice web browser 119 is not redirected to themerchant system website 129. In yet another example embodiment, the an application associated with themerchant system 120 and residing on the user computing device 110 executes on the user computing device 110 in response to the user 101 selecting the purchase icon. In this example embodiment, the application associated with themerchant system 120 communicates with themerchant system 120 via thenetwork 140. - In
block 280, the user 101 completes an online purchase of the product associated with the selected image result. In an example embodiment, after the user computingdevice web browser 119 is redirected to themerchant system website 129, the user 101 completes a transaction with themerchant system 120 via themerchant system website 129 to purchase the product associated with the selected image result.

processor 2010 may be connected to the other elements of thecomputing machine 2000 or the various peripherals discussed herein through thesystem bus 2020. It should be appreciated that thesystem bus 2020 may be within theprocessor 2010, outside theprocessor 2010, or both. According to some embodiments, any of theprocessor 2010, the other elements of thecomputing machine 2000, or the various peripherals discussed herein may be integrated into a single device such as a system on chip (“SOC”), system on package (“SOP”), or ASIC device. - In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity or option to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
