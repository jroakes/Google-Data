- RRC Request For Comment
- trTCM three-color marker
- a particular header field of a packet may be marked with a marker to indicate whether the packet is green, yellow, or red.
- VRE 204 may support color-blind and color aware modes. In a color-blind mode, an incoming packet's color may be ignored and any color may be added to the packet. In a color-aware mode, an incoming packet's color may be taken into consideration. Packets marked green may have the lowest probability of being dropped and may be dropped last if necessary.
- the packet When an incoming packet is marked green, the packet may stay green, or may be downgraded to yellow or red. In this mode, packets are generally never upgraded.
- a packet may be marked red when it exceeds a peak information rate (PIR), which may be defined for the packet flow. Otherwise, the packet may be marked either yellow or green depending on whether it exceeds a committed information rate (CIR), which may be defined for the packet flow.
- PIR peak information rate
- CIR committed information rate
- This scheme may be used, for example, for ingress policing of a service when the peak rate may need to be enforced separately from the committed rate.
- the packet's color may be encoded in an internal control header of the packet and may be interpreted by the flow control manager of line interface 202 to help provide congestion control.

- the metering context may be updated every time a packet is processed by one of VREs 202 .
- a packet such as a virtual local area network (VLAN) Ethernet packet, may arrive at an input port of line interface 202 .
- the input port may be a gigabit Ethernet input port, which may be one of several input ports.
- the flow manager may program a steering table look-up to determine which VLAN is associated with a particular one of VREs 204 .
- the flow manager may tag the packet with an internal control header and may transfer the packet from line interface 202 across switching fabric 210 to the selected VRE 204 .
- a service controller of VRE 204 may perform deep packet classification and extract various fields on the packet header.
- a flow cache may be looked up to determine whether the packet should be processed in hardware or software. If the packet is to be processed in hardware, an index to the packet processing action cache may be obtained. Ingress metering is performed and statistics are registered as part of ingress flow processing.
- the packet may be deposited via a high-speed direct access memory (DMA) into the VRE's main memory.
- DMA direct access memory
- a routing processor may retrieve the packet, identify the packet processing actions and may perform actions, such as time-to-live decrementation, IP header and checksum updating, and IP forwarding patch matching. Egress statistics counters may also be updated.
- the packet may be forwarded to one of ASEs 208 for security operations.
- the packet may also be forwarded to another one of VREs 204 .
- egress statistics may be generated, metering and marking may be performed, maximum transmit unit size may be enforced and packet fragmentation may be implemented.
- An egress flow manager may also apply priority queuing based on marking and may transmit the packet out of virtual routing platform 200 .
- packet-forwarding engine (PFE) 216 may be included within one or more of VREs 204 .
- PFE 216 may be logically situated between a switch fabric interface and a DMA Engine, and may be partitioned into an ingress and egress unit.
- the PFE ingress unit may process incoming packets from the switch fabric and may transfer them to the DMA Engine ingress.
- the PFE egress unit may process outgoing packets from the DMA Engine egress and may transfer them to the switch fabric. Both the ingress and egress units may have direct access to memory.
- PFE 216 may operate synchronously to a CPU interface and a memory system.
- a micro-architecture of both the PFE ingress and egress units may be comprised of an array of packet processors that may share an on-chip write-back cache.
- This packet processor may implement a RISC-like integer instruction set with special instructions for bit field extraction and merging and for unaligned block data transfers.
- Each packet processor may operate on a different packet and hardware interlocks maintain packet order.
- the ingress processors may share common micro-code for ingress processing and the egress processors may share common micro-code for egress processing.
- the PFE memory may map the ingress and egress instruction stores and may supports micro-code updates.
- the PFE ingress unit may pass forwarding state information to the DMA Engine which may incorporates this state into a packet receive descriptor.
- This forwarding state may indicate whether the CPU should software forward the packet or the packet may bypass the CPU and PFE 216 can hardware forward the packet.
- the forwarding state may also includes a 20-bit index into a forwarding transform cache that describes PFE processing per packet micro-flow.
- the receive descriptor may be pushed onto the DMA ingress descriptor queue.
- the descriptor may bypass the DMA ingress queue and may be pushed directly onto the DMA egress descriptor queue as a transmit descriptor.
- the PFE ingress unit may support two basic forms of packet classification.
- One form includes flow-based packet classification, using various fields of the LQ header along with fields in the L 3 /L 4 headers to identify a particular virtual router (VR) micro-flow.
- the other form may use the upper bits of the IP address or MPLS label to index a table of flow indices.
- the host software may control which classification form the PFE uses by programming different micro-code into the ingress instruction store. In both forms, the classification result may be a 20-bit forwarding index that the hardware may use to select the correct packet transformations.
- Each flow ID cache entry may store the LQ ID, LQ protocol, L 3 , and L 4 fields that identify a particular VR micro-flow along with state indicating whether to hardware or software forward packets belonging to the micro-flow.
- the PFE ingress unit may generate an index into the flow ID cache by hashing the incoming packet's LQ ID, LQ protocol, L 3 , and L 4 header fields. It may look-up the indexed cache entry and compares the packet micro-flow ID fields to the cached micro-flow ID fields. On a cache hit, a forward action field of the cache entry may indicate whether to software or hardware forward the packet. On a cache miss, the ingress controller may allocate a cache entry and may forward the packet to software for flow learning.

- Hierarchy 300 may include a hierarchy of metering control blocks (MCBs) to perform metering on packets of various packet flows. For each packet, a packet flow may be identified by packet flow identifier 308 .

- Hierarchy 300 may also include a second level of MCBs, which may include MCB 306 .
- MCB 306 may be defined for a group of packet flows, such as packet flows ‘A’ and ‘B’ as illustrated. This second level of MCBs may also include many hundred or even thousands of MCBs.
- Hierarchy 300 may also include higher level MCBs (not illustrated) to meter higher level packet flows.

- Other MCBs may meter packet flows for particular services and may also be arranged in a hierarchy. Although hierarchy 300 illustrates that packets from lower level flows are also part of higher-level flows and metered by higher-level MCBs, this is not a requirement. For some packet flows, only one level of metering may be performed.
- a packet flow may be identified for unmarked packet stream 310 , and hierarchy 300 may mark the packets to provide marked packet stream 312 .
- Unmarked packet stream 310 may include pre-marked or pre-colored packets as discussed above.

- the PFE may implement both ingress and egress rate metering and marking according to the two-rate three-color marker (trTCM) discussed above.
- the PFE marks the drop precedence color of a packet as green if it does not exceed a committed burst size (CBS), yellow if it exceeds the CBS but not a peak bust size (PBS), and red if it exceeds both CBS and PBS.
- CBS committed burst size
- PBS peak bust size
- the packet's color may be encoded into an rm field of an LQ header.
- the PFE may increment a committed (C) and peak (P) token buckets by the CIR and PIR values, respectively, in 1 ms intervals, for example.
- the PFE egress unit may optionally drop Yellow or Red packets or may color packets for a downstream dropper.
- RateInCtl and RateOutCtl fields of the TCB may designate whether and how to drop packets on ingress and egress rate limiting.

- the hardware loads an MCB pointer array, it may perform metering and rate marking starting with the first MCB pointer and continuing as directed by the Next Pointer field in the MCB pointer.
- Software may disable rate marking, for example, by setting all four bytes of MCB pointer to 0. The lowest five bits may be masked out before using this 4-byte word as the memory pointer.

- Software may provide that this reserved field of the stats block may be initialized to 0 in the case where metering may be not enabled.
- VI-based statistics block may also contain two MCB pointers for metering traffic bound for software. One pointer may be for best effort traffic and the other may be used for control traffic. Software may initialize these pointers to 0 when metering is not enabled.
- the PFE may use a QOS pointer in the VI-based ingress stats block. This pointer may indicate how the hardware translates an incoming TOS/EXP field into the LQ header's PRI and RM fields. If the pointer is NULL then, the translation may be skipped. Similarly, as a final step before transmitting an IP/MPLS packet, the hardware may take the updated LQ header PRI and RM fields and may reverse translate these back to the packet's TOS/EXP field. If the QOS pointer is NULL, then the translation may be skipped.
- the ingress QOS translation pointer may reside in the last four bytes of the VI-based ingress stats block.
- the ingress table may be comprised of 256 entries, which may be indexed by the incoming packet's IP header TOS field.
- the ingress table may be comprised of eight or more entries, which may be indexed by the incoming packet's MPLS EXP field. Each entry may be 8 bytes wide (4B mask, 4B value).
- An egress QOS translation pointer may resides in word 12 of the associated TCB.
- the egress table be comprised of 32 entries indexed by the concatenation of the outgoing packet's ⁇ RM, PRI ⁇ SF header fields (the RM bits reside in the MSB of the table index). Each entry may be 8 bytes wide (4B mask, 4B value).
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of a packet processing procedure in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Packet processing procedure 400 may be performed by VRE 204 ( FIG. 2 ) although other routing engines and devices may also be suitable for performing procedure 400 .
- procedure 400 is performed by a packet-forwarding engine (PFE) of VRE 204 in a packet-processing pipeline.
- PFE packet-forwarding engine
- packets of various packet flows are received, various levels of ingress metering may be performed, headers may be transformed, and various levels of egress metering may be performed before the packet is sent on to it's destination.
- PFE packet-forwarding engine
- packets of various packet flows are received, various levels of ingress metering may be performed, headers may be transformed, and various levels of egress metering may be performed before the packet is sent on to it's destination.
- the individual operations of procedure 400 are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the
- a packet is received at one of the physical ports of a line interface, such as line interface 202 ( FIG. 2 ).
- the packet may be part of a particular packet flow known to the virtual router.
- a flow manager of the line interface may identify a particular VRE, such as one of VREs 204 ( FIG. 2 ), designated for handling the packet flow, and in operation 404 , the packet may be sent to the identified VRE.
- a packet-forwarding engine of the VRE may perform a hash to generate an index for a flow classification block (FCB), which may point to an entry in a flow cache table.
- FCB flow classification block
- Each packet flow may have a separate FCB entry defining the packet flow.
- the table may identify a packet profile and may identify the various levels of metering which may be performed for the packet flow.
- a flow classification may be added as part of descriptor layer field of the packet to indicate which metering operations are to be performed on the packet.
- a metering policy may have been used to establish which metering operation should be performed.
- one or more levels of ingress metering operations may be performed on the packet.
- the ingress metering of operation 408 may be performed per virtual interface (VI) basis.
- the metering may utilize one or more MCBs 410 , such as MCBs 302 and/or 306 , or more, as defined for the packet flow.
- Operation 412 may perform a header transformation for packet routing and/or switching.
- one or more levels of egress metering operations may be performed on the packet.
- Operation 414 may utilize one or more egress MCB 416 , such as MCBs 302 and/or 306 , as defined for the packet flow.
- Operation 414 may use pointers in the FCB to point to a transform control block (TCB), which may identify the particular MCB.
- TBC transform control block
- procedure 400 includes an embodiment of the present invention that performs both of ingress metering and egress metering, nothing requires that both ingress and egress metering be performed.
- the ingress metering performed by operation 408 may utilize information from existing packet headers prior to header transformation in operation 412 .
- the egress metering performed by operation 414 may utilize information from packet headers subsequent to header transformation in operation 412 .
- MCBs are shared data structures that may be utilized by one or more processing elements of a VRE. Unlike conventional metering, because packets may be metered at various times during packet processing, an MCB may be needed concurrently by more than one metering operation. To help preserve the integrity of MCBs, in one embodiment of the present invention, a cache locking operation is implemented to prevent the changes to a data structure, such as the MCBs. In this embodiment, when an MCB is used during a metering operation, a cache-lock bit may be set preventing another metering operation from updating or changing the MCB. Upon completion of the metering operation, the cache-lock bit may be reset. In one embodiment, the cache lock bit may be part of a cache tag store.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a metering procedure in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Procedure 500 may be suitable for performing one or more various levels of ingress metering, such as the ingress metering performed in operation 408 ( FIG. 4 ).
- Procedure 500 may also be suitable for performing one or more various levels of egress metering, such as the egress metering performed in operation 414 ( FIG. 4 ).
- a packet of a particular packet flow may, for example, be metered, marked and dropped.
- Procedure 500 may serve as a rate limiting function for packets of various profiles. Packet processing procedure 500 may be performed by VRE 204 ( FIG.
- Procedure 500 may be performed as part of one or more operations of pipeline processing performed by the VRE's PFE.
- metering may be performed for each level of a hierarchy of metering for packets of a particular flow.
- procedure 500 may use a two-rate three color metering and marking scheme such as the trTCM scheme described in RFC 2698 , however other metering and marking schemes are also suitable.
- the individual operations of procedure 500 are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated.
- an MCB for a first level MCB is identified for a packet flow.
- the MCB may be identified for packets from a particular virtual interface (VI).
- the packet is metered.
- operation 504 may include incrementing a token count Tp by one PIR times per second up to PBS.
- operation 504 may also include incrementing a token count Tc by one CIR times per second up to CBS.
- Token counts Tp and Tc may be initially full (i.e., set to PBS and CBS respectively).
- the number of bytes in the packet may be subtracted from the token buckets to determine the color the packet.
- the packet is marked to indicate the result of the metering in operation 506 .
- a packet may be marked as green if it does not exceed a CBS, yellow if it exceeds the CBS but not a PBS, and red if it exceeds both CBS and PBS.
- the red packet may remain red, and a yellow packet may remain yellow or be marked as red, and a green packet may remain green, or be marked as yellow or red depend on the remaining tokens in the token bucket.
- operation 506 may encode the packet's color into an RM field of the packets LQ header.
- the CIR, PIR, CBS, and PBS may be viewed as traffic parameters, which define a packet profile for a particular packet flow.
- the packet may be dropped depending on policy 510 which may be operational for a specific packet flow or VI.
- policy 510 may allow packets at lower levels to exceed packet profiles provided that a higher level profile has not been exceeded. In other words, packets colored as red may not necessarily be dropped and may go through a next level of metering.
- RateInCtl and RateOutCtl fields of the TCB may dictate whether and how to drop packets on ingress and/or egress rate limiting.
- operations 502 through 508 may be repeated by operation 509 for next packet, which may be a packet of a different packet flow or different VI and which may use a different combination of MCBs.
- operation 512 determines if another level of metering is to be performed. If additional-metering is to be performed, operation 514 may identify a MCB for the next level of metering and the metering, marking and dropping of operations 504 through 508 may be performed on the packet using the MCB for the next level of metering. Accordingly, procedure 500 may implement a hierarchy of metering for any particular packet flow or VI. When operation 512 determines that no additional metering is required, operation 516 is performed. In operation 516 , the packet may be sent to the next stage of pipeline processing in the VRE.
- the method and system allows for metering of particular customers, communication devices, service providers, as well as metering for particular services, such as IPSec, ACL, etc.
