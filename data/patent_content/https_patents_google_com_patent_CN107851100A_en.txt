It is the packet or selection for one or more content items for being available for the user of client device to check or access.Processing logic can be entered
One step calculates each Relevance scores (frame 330) being directed in playlist.For example, playlist and text query can be based on
Correlation, playlist use or access frequency, the time or date of the last editor of playlist or modification or such as phase
For Fig. 4, other this kind of factors calculate the Relevance scores of the playlist each retrieved in greater detail.
Reference picture 3, processing logic can be calculated in retrieved playlist based on the Relevance scores of playlist
Total score (frame 340) of each content item.In certain embodiments, total score of content item can be based on for including
The Relevance scores of each playlist of the content item add up to.With reference to Fig. 5 disclose on calculate total score other are thin
Section.
Processing logic can be based further on total score of content item to generate new playlist (frame 350).For example, it can incite somebody to action
The content item of score is added up to be included in new playlist with highest.In certain embodiments, it can remove the content item repeated
(for example, remove all same content items) in addition to one or can provide with artist (for example, singer or performing artist,
Author etc.) association maximum quantity content item.If for example, specify most five content items of single author and if list
The highest that individual artistical ten content items obtain content item adds up to score, then five in content item can be included in new broadcasting
In list and remaining five can be included in new playlist.For example, add up to the similar artists of score with highest
Content item can be selected as being included in new playlist, and can be not selected as wrapping with the content item of relatively low total score
Include in new playlist.
For example, user can provide and search for the text query of music video (that is, content item) association.Text query can
Including text string " 1980s music videos ".The playlist (that is, playlist) of recognizable music video, wherein, broadcast
Theme, description or other description informations for emplacing table match with the search criterion of text query.It can calculate for each played column
The Relevance scores of table.Can recognize that each playlist in each music video and can be based on the phase for playlist
Closing property score calculates each total score in music video.Can be new based on being generated for total score of music video
Playlist.In addition, may be in response to text query provides a user new playlist.Then, user can be from search result list
The middle new playlist of selection, and user can play or check the music video for being selected as being included in new playlist.

As shown in figure 4, since method 400 can be handling logic identification playlist (frame 410).For example, playlist can
To be retrieved from the playlist matched based on the search criterion with text query among greater amount of playlist
Multiple playlists in one.Playlist may include the list or packet of multiple content items so that if user accesses
Playlist, then the identification of each content item of playlist can be provided a user, to access corresponding content item.Processing is patrolled
The correlation (frame 420) of playlist and text query can be further determined that by collecting.The correlation of playlist and text query can
Be based on with search text query keyword playlist associate theme, describe or any other data
Match somebody with somebody.For example, if the more multi-key word of text query is included in title or the description of playlist, playlist can quilt
Think with high correlation score, and if the less keyword of text query is included in title or the description of playlist
In, then playlist can be considered to have relatively low Relevance scores.Therefore, the correlation of playlist and text query can be
The theme or profile matching associated based on the playlist with the keyword with text query.Processing logic can further determine that
The frequency of use (frame 430) of playlist.For example, what recognizable playlist had been accessed or used by one or more users
Number.When user is provided playlist and selects the identification of content item from playlist to access corresponding content item,
The playlist can be considered as being accessed.In alternative embodiments, the frequency of use of playlist can be when being based on specific
Between during section one or more users accessed multiple situations of playlist.Processing logic can determine that last modification played column
The time (frame 440) of table.For example, the recognizable nearest time for adding title, description or new content item in the play list or from
The nearest time of content item is removed in playlist.Therefore, the recency (recency) of the last modification of playlist can be used
To determine the Relevance scores of playlist.
Reference picture 4, processing logic can based on playlist and the correlation of text query, the frequency of use of playlist and
The final time that playlist is changed calculates the Relevance scores (square frame 450) for playlist.Usable text is looked into
The sigmoid functions for asking correlation calculate Relevance scores, as follows：
Relevance scores=sigmoid (r)=1.0/ (1.0+exp ((5.0-r)/2.0))
In certain embodiments, r can be the correlation (that is, search query relevance) of playlist and text query.
In described or alternate embodiment, Relevance scores can be set based on the frequency of use of playlist and/or last modification
Into zero.For example, if the last modification date of playlist exceedes threshold value number of days and/or if frequency of use uses less than threshold value
Amount (for example, playlist check or access times less than check or access thresholds amount), then can be by for the phase of playlist
Closing property score is set to zero value.In identical or alternate embodiment, the phase for playlist can be calculated based on following formula
Closing property score：
Relevance scores=sigmoid (r)-α * a+ β * log (v)
(Relevance score=sigmoid (r)-alpha*a+beta*log (v))
In certain embodiments, r may correspond to the correlation of playlist and text query, may correspond to from last change
Playlist rise number of days, and v may correspond to playlist check or access times (that is, frequency of use).α(Alpha)
Can be nonnegative constant with β (beta), it is used to assign for the last modification of playlist and the relative importance of frequency of use
Weight.
In certain embodiments, method can be performed for each playlist retrieved in response to text query
400.In alternative embodiments, method 400 can be performed for the playlist subset retrieved in response to text query.Example
Such as, can be calculated for the subset (for example, for first 500 in 5000 playlists retrieved) of multiple playlists
Relevance scores.
