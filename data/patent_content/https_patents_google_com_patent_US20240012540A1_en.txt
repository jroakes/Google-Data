Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to human-computer interaction. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to input suggestion.
- Computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, wearable computing devices, and/or the like) are ubiquitous in modern society. They can support communications between their users, provide their users with information about their environments, current events, the world at large, and/or the like. A myriad of different types of interfaces enable users to interact with such devices. For example, many devices include a touchscreen and provide an interface (e.g., including user-selectable options, a keyboard, and/or the like) configured to enable users to input information.
- Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or can be learned from the description, or can be learned through practice of the embodiments.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method. The method can include receiving, by one or more computing devices and from a first application executed by the computing device(s), data indicating information that has been presented by and/or input into the first application. The method can also include generating, by the computing device(s), based at least in part on the data indicating the information that has been presented by and/or input into the first application, one or more suggested candidate inputs for a second application executed by the computing device(s). The generating can be performed without receiving user input via the first application indicating a desire to be able to utilize data based at least in part on the information in the second application, and the second application can be different and distinct from the first application. The method can further include providing, by the computing device(s) and in association with the second application, an interface comprising one or more options to select at least one suggested candidate input of the suggested candidate input(s). The method can further include, responsive to receiving data indicating a selection of a particular suggested candidate input of the suggested candidate input(s) via the interface, communicating, by the computing device(s) and to the second application, data indicating the particular suggested candidate input.
- Another example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a system. The system can include one or more processors and a memory storing instructions that when executed by the processor(s) cause the system to perform operations. The operations can include receiving data indicating information that has been presented by a first application executed by the system. The operations can also include receiving data indicating information that has been input into a second application executed by the system. The second application can be different and distinct from the first application. The operations can further include generating, based at least in part on the data indicating the information that has been presented by the first application and the data indicating the information that has been input into the second application, one or more suggested candidate inputs for the second application. The operations can further include providing, in association with the second application, an interface comprising one or more options to select at least one suggested candidate input of the suggested candidate input(s). The operations can further include, responsive to receiving data indicating a selection of a particular suggested candidate input of the suggested candidate input(s) via the interface, communicating, to the second application, data indicating the particular suggested candidate input.
- A further example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to one or more non-transitory computer-readable media. The non-transitory computer-readable media can comprise instructions that when executed by one or more computing devices cause the computing device(s) to perform operations. The operations can include receiving data indicating information that has been presented by and/or input into an application executed by the computing device(s). The operations can also include generating, based at least in part on the data indicating the information that has been presented by and/or input into the application, one or more suggested candidate inputs for the application. The suggest candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input comprising metadata determined based at least in part on an entity associated with the suggested candidate input. The operations can further include providing, in association with the application executed by the computing device(s), an interface comprising one or more options to select at least one suggested candidate input of the suggested candidate input(s). The at least one suggested candidate input can include the suggested candidate input comprising the metadata determined based at least in part on the entity associated with the suggested candidate input.
- Other aspects of the present disclosure are directed to various systems, apparatuses, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces, and electronic devices.
- These and other features, aspects, and advantages of various embodiments of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate example embodiments of the present disclosure and, together with the description, serve to explain the related principles.
- Detailed discussion of embodiments directed to one of ordinary skill in the art is set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, in which:
-
FIG. 1 depicts an example computing environment according to example embodiments of the present disclosure; -
FIGS. 2A-N depict example graphical user interfaces (GUIs) according to example embodiments of the present disclosure; -
FIGS. 3A-D depict additional example GUIs according to example embodiments of the present disclosure; -
FIG. 4 depicts example GUI elements according to example embodiments of the present disclosure; -
FIG. 5 depicts example use cases according to example embodiments of the present disclosure; and -
FIG. 6 depicts an example method according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. - Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to input suggestion. In particular, one or more computing devices can provide (e.g., as part of an operating system (OS), and/or the like) an input interface (e.g., a graphical user interface (GUI) comprising a keyboard, and/or the like) configured to enable a user to input data into one or more applications executed by the computing device(s). Such an interface can be configured to present (e.g., as part of the keyboard, and/or the like) the user with suggested candidate inputs, for example, one or more words, phrases, and/or the like that the user may desire to input (e.g., into an application being utilized, at a current cursor position, and/or the like). For example, the user's historical input, recently input text, and/or the like can be analyzed (e.g., using natural-language models, and/or the like) to generate suggested candidate inputs. The provision of suggested candidate input(s) as described herein can enable a user to more efficiently input data into computing device(s), thereby reducing interaction between the user and the computing device(s). This may be particularly useful for users having reduced dexterity, manual capabilities, and/or the like in all or certain situations, which can make effective interaction with the device(s) problematic, and/or the like.
- A user can switch between different and distinct applications executed by the computing device(s), for example, to perform various functions with respect to an undertaken task, and/or the like. For example, a user can utilize a messaging (e.g., chat, short message service (SMS), and/or the like) application to communicate with a contact to schedule an appointment, and/or the like. While utilizing the messaging application, the user may utilize (e.g., switch to, amongst, and/or the like) one or more other applications (e.g., a calendar application, web browser, and/or the like), for example, to identify, locate, determine, and/or the like information pertinent to the conversation with the contact (e.g., their schedule availability, a venue at which to meet, and/or the like).
- In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the computing device(s) can receive data indicating information (e.g., text, graphics, imagery, audio, video, and/or the like) presented by and/or input into one or more of the applications, and based at least in part on such data, the computing device(s) can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs for an application. An interface comprising one or more options to select at least one of the suggested candidate input(s) can be provided in association with the application (e.g., within a GUI of the application, in conjunction with a GUI of the application, adjacent to a GUI of the application, overlaid on a portion of a GUI of the application, as part of a keyboard, via the OS, and/or the like) executed by the computing device(s). A user can utilize the interface to select one of the suggested candidate input(s), and data indicating the same can be received by the computing device(s). Responsive to receiving such data, the computing device(s) can communicate data indicating the selected suggested candidate input to the application.
- In some embodiments, the application for which the suggested candidate input(s) are generated can be different and distinct from the application(s) that presented the information, into which the information was input, and/or the like. For example, the data received can indicate information presented by and/or input into a web browser (e.g., pertaining to a venue, such as a restaurant or the like, at which to meet, and/or the like), and the suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., the name of the venue, and/or the like) can be generated for a messaging application (e.g., to communicate to the contact the name of the venue, and/or the like). It will be appreciated that subject to user consent (e.g., regarding potential privacy concerns, and/or the like), this can be performed in an automated fashion, for example, without receiving user input (e.g., via the web browser, and/or the like) indicating a desire to be able to utilize data based at least in part on the information (e.g., presented by and/or input into the web browser, and/or the like) in the different application (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like). That is, the functionality need not be affirmatively invoked by the user (e.g., via an OS clipboard command such as cut, copy, and/or the like) in order to generate the suggested candidate input(s), provide the interface, and/or the like.
- Additionally or alternatively, the computing device(s) can generate the suggested candidate input(s) based at least in part on data indicating information presented by and/or input into the application for which the suggested candidate input(s) are generated. For example, the suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., the name, address, and/or the like of the venue, and/or the like) can be generated for the messaging application (e.g., to communicate to the contact, and/or the like) based at least in part on data indicating information presented by and/or input into the messaging application (e.g., one or more portions of the conversation providing context indicating the name, address, and/or the like of the venue should be input, and/or the like).
- In some embodiments, the suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input comprising data configured to cause a different and distinct application executed by a different and distinct computing device to output content related to the information presented by and/or input into the application(s) executed by the computing device(s). For example, the suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input comprising data configured to cause a different and distinct application (e.g., an application other than the messaging application, such as a web browser, mapping application, product/service-review application, and/or the like) executed by one or more computing devices of the contact to output content related to the information (e.g., pertaining to the venue, and/or the like) presented by and/or input into the application(s) executed by the user's computing device(s).
- In some embodiments, the application(s) can communicate the data indicating the information presented by and/or input into them via an application programming interface (API) of the computing device(s) configured to manage a file-based application-indexing log stored on the computing device(s) and comprising data indicating one or more application actions, events, and/or the like. In some of such embodiments, receiving the data indicating the information can include retrieving such data from the file-based application-indexing log via the API, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, the data indicating the information can be received via a device-accessibility API of the computing device(s), and/or the like.
- In some embodiments, the computing device(s) can utilize a machine learning (ML) model (e.g., based at least in part on data generated by multiple different users' computing devices, via a federated-learning paradigm, and/or the like) to determine, for each of the suggested candidate input(s), a predicted likelihood that a user will select the suggested candidate input via the interface. In some of such embodiments, the computing device(s) can determine, for each of the suggested candidate input(s) for which a selection option is provided in the interface, to include the selection option for the suggested candidate input in the interface based at least in part on the predicted likelihood that the user will select it.
- In some embodiments, the computing device(s) can annotate one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) with metadata determined based at least in part on factual knowledge about the user (e.g., their name, their schedule availability, and/or the like), factual knowledge about a physical environment in which the computing device(s) are located (e.g., facts about their current geographic locations, such as the names of streets, businesses, and/or the like, facts about society, such as the names, titles, characteristics, and/or the like of famous people, entities, organizations, places, events, and/or the like), a portion of the information provided by and/or input into the application(s), and/or the like. In some of such embodiments, for each of the annotated suggested candidate input(s), the computing device(s) can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on its metadata.
- Additionally or alternatively, for each of one or more of the suggested candidate input(s), the computing device(s) can generate one or more numeric descriptions of one or more features of the suggested candidate input distinct from its content. For example, such features can include a type of societal entity (e.g., person, organization, business, and/or the like) associated with the suggested candidate input, how recently and/or how frequently the content of the suggested candidate input was presented by the computing device(s), and/or the like. In some embodiments, for each of such suggested candidate input(s), the computing device(s) can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on one or more of its corresponding numeric description(s).
- In some embodiments, for each of such suggested candidate input(s), the computing device(s) can generate a training record for the ML model based at least in part on the numeric description(s) for the suggested candidate input, whether the user selected the suggested candidate input, and/or the like. For example, such training record(s) can enable the ML model to more accurately process inputs based at least in part on their generic characteristics, contexts, structures, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, such training record(s) can omit, obscure, and/or the like the content of the suggested candidate input(s), the information presented by and/or input into the application(s), and/or the like, which can, for example, mitigate privacy concerns (e.g., in the context of a federated-learning paradigm, and/or the like). In some embodiments, a training record can be generated based at least in part on a determination that the user manually input data corresponding to content of the suggested candidate input, for example, in lieu of selecting the suggested candidate input via the interface. For example, such a record can indicate the suggested candidate input was accurate, correct, and/or the like even if the user failed to select the suggested candidate input.
- In some embodiments, for each of one or more of the suggested candidate input(s), the computing device(s) can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on data identifying the application for which the suggested candidate input was generated, a selected input field of such application, and/or the like. For example, the user can switch to a ride-sharing application; a destination field therein can be selected (e.g., by the user, by default, and/or the like); based at least in part on data identifying the ride-sharing application, the destination field, and/or the like, the computing device(s) can determine one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., an address of the venue, and/or the like) has a higher likelihood of being selected than one or more other of the suggested candidate input(s); and/or the like.
- In some embodiments, a prominence within the interface of one or more of the option(s) for selecting the suggested candidate input(s) can be determined based at least in part on the likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input(s). For example, in some embodiments, providing the interface can include generating a graphical user interface (GUI) comprising one or more elements corresponding to the option(s) for selecting the suggested candidate input(s). In some of such embodiments, the computing device(s) can determine one or more sizes of such element(s) based at least in part on the likelihood that the user will select their corresponding suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., a larger element could be generated for a suggested candidate input with a higher likelihood of being selected, and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, the computing device(s) can determine a number of elements (e.g., corresponding to one or more other (or alternative) suggested candidate inputs, and/or the like) to be presented alongside an element based at least in part on the likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input corresponding to the element (e.g., fewer elements could be presented alongside an element for a suggested candidate input with a higher likelihood of being selected, and/or the like).
- The technology described herein can provide a number of technical effects and benefits. For example, the technology described herein can enable a user to interact with one or more computing devices more efficiently, for example, by enabling them to more efficiently input data into various applications, and/or the like. By reducing interaction between the user and the computing device(s), device resources (e.g., energy, and/or the like) can be conserved. As previously indicated, the technology described herein may be particularly useful for users having reduced dexterity, manual capabilities, and/or the like, which can make effective interaction with the device(s) problematic, and/or the like. For example, the technology described herein can reduce the need for users to switch between applications in order to identify, locate, manually copy, and/or the like information for use in another application, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, the technology described herein can facilitate the development of an ML model capable of accurately suggesting candidate inputs based at least in part on their generic characteristics, use context, and/or the like. Moreover, the technology described herein can permit such a model to be developed in a manner that leverages the resources, wisdom, and/or the like of the crowd (e.g., via a federated-learning paradigm, and/or the like) but mitigates potential privacy concerns of participating users, and/or the like.

FIGS. 2A-N depict example graphical user interfaces (GUIs) according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. - Referring to
FIG. 2A ,computing device 10 can include a display (e.g., a touchscreen, and/or the like) and can generate data describing one or more GUIs. The data describing the GUI(s) can be communicated to the display, which can present (e.g., render, display, and/or the like) the GUI(s) (e.g., for viewing by a user, and/or the like). For example,computing device 10 can generatedata describing GUI 202, which can be associated with an application executed by computing device 10 (e.g., a messenger application, and/or the like) and can be presented by the display ofcomputing device 10. -
Computing device 10 can provide, in association with the application (e.g., within a GUI of the application, in conjunction with a GUI of the application, adjacent to a GUI of the application, overlaid on a portion of a GUI of the application, as part of a keyboard, via the OS, and/or the like) an input interface (e.g., one or more GUI elements comprising a keyboard, and/or the like) configured to enable a user to input data into the application. For example,GUI 202 can include element 214 (e.g., a QWERTY keyboard, and/or the like), which can be configured to enable a user ofcomputing device 10 to input data into the application associated with GUI 202 (e.g., by interacting with one or more portions ofGUI 202 via the display ofcomputing device 10, and/or the like). While for purposes of illustration, convenience, clarity, and/or the like, reference is made herein to interfaces comprising one or more GUIs, it will be appreciated that other types of interfaces (e.g., audio-prompt/command interfaces, human-gesture interfaces, and/or the like) can be utilized (e.g., in addition to GUI(s), in lieu of GUI(s), and/or the like) in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. - In accordance with aspects of the disclosure,
computing device 10 can receive data indicating information (e.g., text, graphics, imagery, audio, video, and/or the like) presented by and/or input into one or more different and distinct applications executed by computingdevice 10. For example,computing device 10 can receive data indicating information presented viaelement 204 ofGUI 202 by the application associated with GUI 202 (e.g., text comprising messages exchanged between the user ofcomputing device 10 and an individual named “Joe Friend,” and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively,computing device 10 can receive data indicating information input viaelement 206 ofGUI 202 into the application associated with GUI 202 (e.g., text comprising messages composed (or being composed) by the user ofcomputing device 10, and/or the like). - In some embodiments, the application(s) can communicate the data indicating the information presented by and/or input into them via an application programming interface (API) of
computing device 10 configured to manage a file-based application-indexing log stored oncomputing device 10 and comprising data indicating one or more application actions, events, and/or the like. In some of such embodiments,computing device 10 can receive the data indicating the information by retrieving such data from the file-based application-indexing log via the API, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively,computing device 10 can receive the data indicating the information via a device-accessibility API ofcomputing device 10, and/or the like. It will be appreciated that receiving such data may be subject to consent of the user of computing device 10 (e.g., to mitigate privacy concerns, and/or the like). - Based at least in part on such data,
computing device 10 can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs (e.g., one or more words, phrases, and/or the like) for an application executed by computingdevice 10. For example, based at least in part on the data indicating the information presented viaelement 204 and/or input viaelement 206,computing device 10 can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs (e.g., “Not sure,” “Give me a sec,” “I'm,” and/or the like) that the user ofcomputing device 10 may desire to input into the application associated withGUI 202 via a field corresponding toelement 206 ofGUI 202, and/or the like. In some embodiments,computing device 10 can analyze (e.g., using natural-language models, and/or the like) the data indicating the information to generate the suggested candidate input(s). - The input interface provided by computing
device 10 can include one or more options to select at least one of the suggested candidate input(s). For example,GUI 202 can includeelements computing device 10 can utilize the interface to select one of the suggested candidate input(s), andcomputing device 10 can receive data indicating the same. For example, the user ofcomputing device 10 can utilize the interface (e.g., invokeelement 210, and/or the like) to select the suggested candidate input (e.g., “Give me a sec,” and/or the like) corresponding toelement 210, andcomputing device 10 can receive data indicating the selected suggested candidate input. Responsive to receiving such data,computing device 10 can communicate data indicating the selected suggested candidate input to the application. For example, responsive to receiving the data indicating the user ofcomputing device 10 has selected the suggested candidate input (e.g., “Give me a sec,” and/or the like) corresponding toelement 210,computing device 10 can communicate data indicating the selected suggested candidate input to the application associated with GUI 202 (e.g., by populating the field corresponding toelement 206 with “Give me a sec,” and/or the like). - The user of
computing device 10 can switch between the different and distinct application(s) executed by computingdevice 10, for example, to perform various functions with respect to an undertaken task, and/or the like. For example, the user can utilize the application associated with GUI 202 (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like) to communicate with another individual (e.g., Joe Friend, and/or the like) to schedule a lunch, and/or the like. While utilizing the application associated withGUI 202, the user may utilize (e.g., switch to, amongst, and/or the like) one or more of the other application(s) executed by computing device 10 (e.g., a calendar application, web browser, and/or the like), for example, to identify, locate, determine, and/or the like information pertinent to the conversation with the other individual (e.g., their schedule availability, a restaurant at which to meet, and/or the like). - For example, referring to
FIG. 2B , the user ofcomputing device 10 can switch to an application (e.g., a web browser, and/or the like) associated with GUI 216 (e.g., to identify a restaurant at which to meet Joe Friend, and/or the like).Computing device 10 can generatedata describing GUI 216, which can be presented by the display ofcomputing device 10, and/or the like. As previously indicated,computing device 10 can receive data indicating information presented by and/or input into the application(s) executed by computingdevice 10. For example,computing device 10 can receive data indicating information presented viaelement 218 ofGUI 216 by the application associated with GUI 216 (e.g., text from a website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like). - The user of
computing device 10 can then switch back to the previously utilized application associated with GUI 202 (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like). For example, referring toFIG. 2C , the user ofcomputing device 10 can switch to an application (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like) associated with GUI 220 (e.g., to resume communicating with Joe Friend, and/or the like).Computing device 10 can generatedata describing GUI 220, which can be presented by the display ofcomputing device 10, and/or the like.Computing device 10 can receive data indicating information presented viaelement 204 ofGUI 220 by the application associated with GUI 220 (e.g., “You up for lunch?”, “Sure,” “What you thinking?”, “How about pizza?”, “Sounds good,” and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively,computing device 10 can receive data indicating information input viaelement 206 ofGUI 220 into the application associated with GUI 220 (e.g., “Let's try,” and/or the like). - In accordance with aspects of the disclosure,
computing device 10 can generate, based at least in part on the received data, one or more suggested candidate inputs for an application executed by computingdevice 10. For example, based at least in part on the data indicating the information presented via element 218 (e.g., the text from the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like), the data indicating the information presented viaelement 204, and/or the data indicating the information input viaelement 206,computing device 10 can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs (e.g., “Slice House,” “not to,” and/or the like) that the user ofcomputing device 10 may desire to input into the application associated withGUI 220 via a field corresponding toelement 206 ofGUI 220, and/or the like. In some embodiments, one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., “Slice House,” and/or the like) can include metadata (e.g., “Restaurant,” “https://<url . . . site>.com,” and/or the like) determined based at least in part on one or more entities (e.g., the restaurant, the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like) associated with such suggested candidate input(s). - As previously indicated, the input interface provided by computing
device 10 can include one or more options to select at least one of the suggested candidate input(s). For example,GUI 220 can includeelements computing device 10 can utilize the interface to select one of the suggested candidate input(s), andcomputing device 10 can receive data indicating the same. For example, the user ofcomputing device 10 can utilize the interface (e.g., invokeelement 222, and/or the like) to select the suggested candidate input (e.g., “Slice House,” and/or the like) corresponding toelement 222, andcomputing device 10 can receive data indicating the selected suggested candidate input. Responsive to receiving such data,computing device 10 can communicate data indicating the selected suggested candidate input to the application. For example, responsive to receiving the data indicating the user ofcomputing device 10 has selected the suggested candidate input (e.g., “Slice House,” and/or the like) corresponding toelement 222,computing device 10 can communicate data indicating the selected suggested candidate input to the application associated with GUI 220 (e.g., by populating the field corresponding toelement 206 with “Slice House,” and/or the like). - In some embodiments (e.g., to mitigate potential privacy concerns, and/or the like), a user can be provided with one or more controls for allowing the user to make one or more elections as to if and/or when the methods, systems, functions, operations, and/or the like described herein can enable collection of certain information (e.g., presented by and/or input into the application(s), and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, certain data (e.g., presented by and/or input into the application(s), and/or the like) can be treated in one or more ways before being stored, used, and/or the like (e.g., so personally identifiable information can be removed, and/or the like). For example, a user's identity, data associated therewith, and/or the like can be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, and/or the like. Thus, the user can have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, what information is provided to the user, and/or the like.
- It will be appreciated that subject to user consent (e.g., regarding potential privacy concerns, and/or the like), this can be performed in an automated fashion, for example, without receiving user input via the application associated with GUI 216 (e.g., the web browser, and/or the like) indicating a desire to be able to utilize data based at least in part on the information (e.g., presented by and/or input into the web browser, and/or the like) in the application associated with GUI 220 (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like). That is, the functionality need not be affirmatively invoked by the user (e.g., via an OS clipboard command such as cut, copy, and/or the like) in order to generate the suggested candidate input(s), provide the interface including the option(s) to select at least one of the suggested candidate input(s), and/or the like.
- In some embodiments,
computing device 10 can utilize a machine learning (ML) model to determine, for each of the suggested candidate input(s), a predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input via the interface (e.g., in order to rank the suggested candidate input(s) by their likelihood of being selected, identify one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) likely to be selected, and/or the like). In some of such embodiments,computing device 10 can determine, for each of the suggested candidate input(s) for which a selection option is provided in the interface, to include the selection option for the suggested candidate input in the interface based at least in part on the predicted likelihood that the user will select it. For example,computing device 10 can utilize an ML model to determine a likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input corresponding to element 222 (e.g., “Slice House,” and/or the like), a likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input corresponding to element 224 (e.g., “not to,” and/or the like), as well as one or more likelihoods that the user will select one or more other suggested candidate inputs generated by computingdevice 10, andcomputing device 10 can determine to include, in the input interface, the options for selecting the suggested candidate input(s) corresponding toelements device 10, and/or the like). - In some embodiments, for each of one or more of the suggested candidate input(s),
computing device 10 can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on data identifying the application for which the suggested candidate input was generated, a selected input field of such application, and/or the like. For example,computing device 10 can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input corresponding to element 222 (e.g., “Slice House,” and/or the like) based at least in part on data identifying the application associated withGUI 220, the field corresponding toelement 206 ofGUI 220, and/or the like. - In some embodiments,
computing device 10 can annotate one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) with metadata determined based at least in part on factual knowledge about the user (e.g., their name, their schedule availability, and/or the like), factual knowledge about a physical environment in whichcomputing device 10 is located (e.g., facts about its current geographic location, such as the names of streets, businesses, and/or the like, facts about society, such as the names, titles, characteristics, and/or the like of famous people, entities, organizations, places, events, and/or the like), a portion of the information provided by and/or input into the application(s) executed by computingdevice 10, and/or the like. In some of such embodiments, for each of the annotated suggested candidate input(s),computing device 10 can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on its metadata. - Additionally or alternatively, for each of one or more of the suggested candidate input(s),
computing device 10 can generate one or more numeric descriptions of one or more features of the suggested candidate input distinct from its content. For example, such features can include a type of societal entity (e.g., person, organization, business, and/or the like) associated with the suggested candidate input, how recently and/or how frequently the content of the suggested candidate input was presented by computingdevice 10, and/or the like. In some embodiments, for each of such suggested candidate input(s),computing device 10 can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on one or more of its corresponding numeric description(s). - In some embodiments, for each of such suggested candidate input(s),
computing device 10 can generate a training record for the ML model based at least in part on the numeric description(s) for the suggested candidate input, whether the user selected the suggested candidate input, and/or the like. For example, such training record(s) can enable the ML model to more accurately process inputs based at least in part on their generic characteristics, contexts, structures, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, such training record(s) can omit, obscure, and/or the like the content of the suggested candidate input(s), the information presented by and/or input into the application(s), and/or the like, which can, for example, mitigate privacy concerns (e.g., in the context of a federated-learning paradigm, and/or the like). In some embodiments, a training record can be generated based at least in part on a determination that the user manually input data corresponding to content of the suggested candidate input (e.g., typed out “Slice House” viaelement 214, and/or the like), for example, in lieu of selecting the suggested candidate input via the interface (e.g., by invokingelement 222, and/or the like). For example, such a record can indicate the suggested candidate input was accurate, correct, and/or the like even if the user failed to select the suggested candidate input. - In some embodiments, the ML model can be based at least in part on data generated by multiple different users' computing devices, for example, via a federated-learning paradigm, and/or the like. For example,
computing devices system 112, and/or the like (e.g., to discover patterns by which users select, ignore, and/or the like suggested candidate inputs having particular characteristics, provided in certain contexts, and/or the like).Computing devices computing system 112; generate suggested candidate inputs; utilize the ML model to determine likelihoods that the suggested candidate inputs will be selected; generate training records based at least in part on the generated suggested candidate inputs, their determined respective likelihoods of being selected, data indicating whether they were selected, ignored, and/or the like; generate updates to the ML model (e.g., differentials, and/or the like) based at least in part on the training records; and communicate the updates tocomputing system 112, which can refine the ML model based at least in part on the updates and communicate the refined ML model (e.g., reflecting the wisdom of the group's experiences, and/or the like) tocomputing devices - In some embodiments, the ML model can be, otherwise include, and/or the like various ML models, such as neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks, and/or the like), other types of ML models, including non-linear models, linear models, multilayer models, and/or the like. Neural networks can include feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (e.g., long short-term memory recurrent neural networks, and/or the like), convolutional neural networks, other forms of neural networks, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the ML model can be trained using supervised techniques, semi-supervised techniques, unsupervised techniques, and/or the like.
- In some embodiments, the ML model can comprise a dynamic vocabulary recurrent neural network, which can be configured to score the generated suggested candidate input(s) based at least in part on their likelihood of being selected by the user. In some of such embodiments, the ML model can be conceptually structured such that a first side (e.g., the left-hand side, and/or the like) takes in input tokens, data identifying the application for which the suggested candidate input(s) were generated, a selected input field of such application, and/or the like, and a second side (e.g., the right-hand side, and/or the like) takes in the suggested candidate input(s), their annotated metadata, numeric description(s), and/or the like. The first side can generate a next-word embedding (e.g., via a recurrent neural network, and/or the like), the second side can embed the suggested candidate input(s) in the same vectorial space, and the network can output data (e.g., numerical values, and/or the like) for the suggested candidate input(s) indicating their respective similarities to the next-word embedding, and/or the like.
- In some embodiments, the suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input comprising data configured to cause an application different and distinct from the application for which the suggested candidate input(s) were generated to output content related to the information presented by and/or input into the application(s) executed by computing
device 10. In some of such embodiments, the different and distinct application can be executed by a computing device different and distinct from computingdevice 10. - For example, referring to
FIG. 2D , as previously indicated, the user of computing device 10 can switch to an application (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like) associated with GUI 226 (e.g., to resume communicating with Joe Friend, and/or the like); computing device 10 can generate data describing GUI 226, which can be presented by the display of computing device 10, and/or the like; computing device 10 can receive data indicating information presented via element 204 of GUI 226 by the application associated with GUI 226 (e.g., “You up for lunch?”, “Sure,” “What you thinking?”, “How about pizza?”, “Sounds good,” and/or the like) and/or data indicating information input via element 206 of GUI 226 into the application associated with GUI 220 (e.g., “Let's try,” and/or the like); and based at least in part on the data indicating the information presented via element 218 (e.g., the text from the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like), the data indicating the information presented via element 204, and/or the data indicating the information input via element 206, computing device 10 can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs that the user of computing device 10 may desire to input into the application associated with GUI 226 via a field corresponding to element 206 of GUI 226, and/or the like. As previously indicated, in some embodiments, one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., “Slice House,” and/or the like) can include metadata determined based at least in part on one or more entities (e.g., the restaurant, the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like) associated with such suggested candidate input(s). In some of such embodiments, the metadata can comprise one or more GUI interface elements, for example, graphics, icons, and/or the like (e.g., an image of a pizza slice, such as one from the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like). -
Computing device 10 can be different and distinct from computingdevice 20, which can, for example, be utilized by a different user (e.g., Joe Friend, and/or the like). The generated suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input (e.g., data object, hyperlink, and/or the like) configured to cause an application (e.g., a web browser, and/or the like) executed by computingdevice 20 to output content related to the information presented by and/or input into the application associated withGUI 226, for example, to output the information presented via element 218 (e.g., the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like). The input interface provided by computingdevice 10 can include an option to select the suggested candidate input configured to cause the application executed by computingdevice 20 to output such content. For example,GUI 226 can includeelement 228, which can correspond to such an option. The user ofcomputing device 10 can utilize the interface (e.g., invokeelement 228, and/or the like) to select the suggested candidate input configured to cause the application executed by computingdevice 20 to output the related content, andcomputing device 10 can receive data indicating the same. Responsive to receiving such data,computing device 10 can communicate, to the application associated with GUI 226 (e.g., by populating the field corresponding toelement 206 with the data object, hyperlink, and/or the like), data indicating the suggested candidate input configured to cause the application executed by computingdevice 20 to output the related content. - In some embodiments, the suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input comprising data configured in accordance with a predetermined format, and/or the like. For example, referring to
FIG. 2E , the user ofcomputing device 10 can utilize an application (e.g., the messaging application, and/or the like) associated with GUI 230 (e.g., to communicate with Joe Friend, and/or the like); computingdevice 10 can generatedata describing GUI 230, which can be presented by the display ofcomputing device 10, and/or the like; computingdevice 10 can receive data indicating information presented viaelement 204 ofGUI 230 by the application associated with GUI 230 (e.g., “What you thinking?”, “How about pizza?”, “Sounds good,” “Let's try Slice House,” and/or the like) and/or data indicating information input viaelement 206 ofGUI 230 into the application associated with GUI 230 (e.g., “Please call ahead. Their number is,” and/or the like); and based at least in part on the data indicating the information presented via element 218 (e.g., the text from the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like), the data indicating the information presented viaelement 204, and/or the data indicating the information input viaelement 206,computing device 10 can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs (e.g., “(123) 456-7890,” “online,” “in my book,” and/or the like) that the user ofcomputing device 10 may desire to input into the application associated withGUI 230 via a field corresponding toelement 206 ofGUI 230, and/or the like. - The generated suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input (e.g., “(123) 456-7890,” and/or the like) comprising data configured in accordance with a predetermined format (e.g., a phone number, and/or the like).

computing device 10 can determine (e.g., utilizing the ML model, and/or the like), for each of the suggested candidate input(s), a predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input via the interface. In some of such embodiments, for one or more of the suggested candidate input(s) (e.g., the suggested candidate input(s) for which selection option(s) will be included in the interface, and/or the like),computing device 10 can determine one or more prominences within the interface of one or more of the option(s) for selecting the suggested candidate input(s) based at least in part on the likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input(s). - For example,
computing device 10 can determine one or more sizes of element(s) 224, 228, 232, 234, and/or 236 based at least in part on the likelihood that the user will select their corresponding suggested candidate input(s). In some embodiments,computing device 10 can determine an element (e.g.,element 228, and/or the like) corresponding to a suggested candidate input with a higher likelihood of being selected should have a larger size than an element (e.g.,element 224, and/or the like) corresponding to a suggested candidate input with a lower likelihood of being selected, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively,computing device 10 can determine a number of elements (e.g., corresponding to one or more other (or alternative) suggested candidate inputs, and/or the like) to be presented alongside an element based at least in part on the likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input corresponding to the element. For example, in some embodiments,computing device 10 can determine to present fewer elements (e.g.,element 224, and/or the like) alongside an element (e.g.,element 228, and/or the like) corresponding to a suggested candidate input with a higher likelihood of being selected in comparison with a number of elements (e.g.,elements device 10 to be presented alongside an element (e.g., element 232, and/or the like) corresponding to a suggested candidate input with a lower likelihood of being selected, and/or the like. - The user of
computing device 10 can utilize the interface (e.g., invoke element 232, and/or the like) to select the suggested candidate input comprising the data configured in accordance with the predetermined format, andcomputing device 10 can receive data indicating the same. Responsive to receiving such data,computing device 10 can communicate, to the application associated with GUI 230 (e.g., by populating the field corresponding toelement 206 with “(123) 456-7890,” and/or the like), data indicating the suggested candidate input comprising the data configured in accordance with the predetermined format. - As previously indicated, in some embodiments, the suggested candidate input(s) can include a suggested candidate input comprising data configured to cause an application different and distinct from the application for which the suggested candidate input(s) were generated to output content related to the information presented by and/or input into the application(s) executed by computing

computing device 10 can switch between the different and distinct application(s) executed by computingdevice 10, for example, to perform various functions with respect to an undertaken task, and/or the like. For example, referring toFIG. 2N , the user of computing device 10 (e.g., as the time for the scheduled lunch with Joe Friend approaches, and/or the like) can utilize an application (e.g., a car-service application, and/or the like) associated with GUI 272 (e.g., to request a car to travel to the lunch with Joe Friend, and/or the like); computing device 10 can generate data describing GUI 272, which can be presented by the display of computing device 10, and/or the like; computing device 10 can receive data indicating information presented via element 274 of GUI 272 by the application associated with GUI 272 (e.g., “<Enter a New Address Here>,” and/or the like); and based at least in part on the data indicating the information presented via element 218 (e.g., the text from the website pertaining to the restaurant, and/or the like), data indicating information presented via element 270 (e.g., the calendar entry for the planned lunch with Joe Friend at the restaurant, and/or the like), the data indicating the information presented via element 274, the data indicating the information presented via element 204, and/or the data indicating the information input via element 206, computing device 10 can generate one or more suggested candidate inputs (e.g., “(Slice House) 123 Main Street, Small City, Big State 12345,” “456 2nd St,” and/or the like) that the user of computing device 10 may desire to input into the application associated with GUI 272 via a field corresponding to element 274 of GUI 272, and/or the like. - As previously indicated, in some embodiments,
computing device 10 can determine (e.g., utilizing the ML model, and/or the like), for each of the suggested candidate input(s), a predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input via the interface. In some of such embodiments, for each of one or more of the suggested candidate input(s),computing device 10 can determine the predicted likelihood that the user will select the suggested candidate input based at least in part on data identifying the application for which the suggested candidate input was generated, a selected input field of such application, and/or the like. For example,computing device 10 can determine there is a high likelihood the user ofcomputing device 10 will select a particular suggested candidate input (e.g., “(Slice House) 123 Main Street, Small City, Big State 12345,” and/or the like) based at least in part on data identifying the application associated with GUI 272 (e.g., the car-service application, and/or the like) and/or the field corresponding to element 274 (e.g., a destination-address field, and/or the like). - The input interface provided by computing
