- This specification relates to data processing.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for advertisements (or other sponsored content items) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include “slots” (i.e., pre-defined portions of the web page) in which advertisements (or other content items) can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, in a pop-up window.
- Advertisement slots can be allocated to advertisers through an auction. For example, advertisers can provide bids specifying amounts that the advertisers are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their advertisements. In turn, an auction can be performed and the advertisement slots can be allocated to advertisers according to their bids. When one advertisement slot is being allocated in the auction, the advertisement slot can be allocated to the advertiser that provided the highest bid. When multiple advertisement slots are allocated in a single auction, the advertisement slots can be allocated to set of bidders that provided the highest bids.
- Content items that are presented in slots of a resource can be selected for presentation by a content distribution system.
- the content distribution system receives content requests for content items (e.g., advertisements, video, audio or other content items) to be provided with a resource and selects a content item provider to provide a content item in response to the request.
- the content item request can be a request for advertisements to be provided with search results. For example, when a search query is submitted by a user, the content item request is generated and transmitted to a content distribution system that selects advertisements for presentation with the search results.
- the advertisement management system selects advertisements, for example, based on characteristics of the search query, such as keywords that are matched by the search query, as well as bids that are associated with (e.g., indexed according to and/or stored with a reference to) the keywords by the advertisers.
- Advertisement management accounts can enable advertisers to specify keywords and corresponding bids that are used to control allocation of their advertisements.
- the advertiser can also track the performance of advertisements that are provided using the keywords and corresponding bids. For example, an advertiser can access the advertisement management account and view performance measures corresponding to the advertiser's advertisements that were distributed using each keyword. In turn, the advertiser can adjust settings that control the allocation of advertisements and compare the performance measures for the advertisements that are allocated using the new settings.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, from a content distributor, a set of candidate keywords specifying targeting keywords for one or more content items, each targeting keyword being a phrase to be matched for a content item to be eligible to be provided in response to a content item request; receiving, for each of the targeting keywords, a probability distribution specifying likelihoods of specified user actions occurring in response to a content item being distributed based, at least in part, on the targeting keyword being matched by a content item request; and selecting, based on the probability distributions, a set of final keywords with which distribution of the one or more content items will be controlled, the set of final keywords being one or more keywords for which a likelihood of a specified outcome occurring exceeds a threshold likelihood, and the set of final keywords being a set of the candidate keywords for which a total cost of distributing the content items is below a specified value.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded
- Selecting a set of final keywords can include selecting a set of final keywords that, based on the probability distributions, will provide at least a threshold conversion rate.
- Methods can further include the actions of computing, based on the probability distribution, a marginal value that will result in response to increasing a bid amount for at least one of the candidate targeting keywords, where selecting the set of final keywords can include selecting the set of final keywords that will result in a highest marginal value.
- Methods can further include the actions of selecting, based on the probability distribution, corresponding bid amounts for each of the selected final keywords.
- Receiving a probability distribution can include receiving data indicating a likelihood that a user performs a conversion following presentation of an advertisement that is provided based, at least in part, on the targeting keyword being matched by a search query.
- the likelihood that the user performs the conversion can be based, at least in part, on whether the user was previously presented with an advertisement in response to a different targeting keyword being matched by a search query.
- Methods can further include the actions of receiving a content item request that includes data that match a keyword in the final set of keywords and providing an advertisement that is targeted using the final set of keywords.
- Methods can further include the actions of determining a user state for a user for which the content item request was received, the user state specifying at least one search query that was previously submitted by the user and determining, based on the user state and the probability distribution, the likelihood of the specified outcome occurring following presentation of an advertisement that is targeted using the final set of keywords.
- Selecting a set of final keywords can include determining for each of a plurality of proper subset of the set of candidate keywords, a marginal value that will be provided by selecting the proper subset as the set of final keywords and selecting, as the set of final keywords, the proper subset that provides a highest marginal value.
- the carryover effect that a bid on one keyword has on another keyword can be taken into consideration when measuring the effectiveness of keyword bidding.
- the carryover effect is included in the effectiveness measurement of an advertising campaign, the advertising budget allocated to the campaign can be more effectively allocated among possible target keywords.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which online content is distributed to user devices
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow for allocating advertising budgets.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for allocating advertising budgets considering carryover effects.
- FIG. 4 is block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to allocate advertising budgets considering carryover effects.
- Advertisements can be provided with search results pages and/or other resources based, at least in part, on targeting keywords for the advertisements being matched by information included in an content item request.
- Units of content that are presented in (or with) resources are referred to as content items.
- an advertisement can be provided when a search query for which search results are being provided (or a resource keyword for a resource) is determined to match the targeting keyword for the advertisement.
- Advertisers can assign bids of varying amounts to different targeting keywords.
- a content item request includes information that matches one of the targeting keywords
- the bid that the advertiser has assigned to the targeting keyword is used in an auction.
- the likelihood that the advertisement is provided is generally proportional to the bid that has been assigned to the keyword that was matched.
- the amount of money that the advertiser can bid on other keywords can be reduced.
- a goal of advertising can be obtaining a conversion, or in other words, having a user perform an advertiser specified action after the advertisement has been presented with a resource or search results page.
- a conversion can be a user purchasing a product advertised by the ad.
- a presentation of an ad might not always result in a conversion.
- the advertiser thus has to decide how much of the advertising budget to spend on which keywords in order to achieve at least a threshold number of conversions, given a finite amount of money in the advertising budget.
- the advertiser can receive data that provides some feedback on the effectiveness of specific advertisements on specific keywords.
- the advertiser can be provided statistics, such as click-through rate (CTR), which can provide the advertiser with a sense of how many users who see an ad click on the ad.
- CTR click-through rate
- the advertiser can also receive information on conversion rates (e.g., how frequently users who click on ad continue on to purchase a product or service advertised by the ad). Using this information, advertisers can gauge an effectiveness of an ad and select bid amounts for particular keywords based on the effectiveness of advertisements that were distributed based on the particular keywords being matched.
- statistics for ads that are presented using a particular keyword might provide an incomplete picture of the effectiveness of the keyword, and therefore provide a suboptimal budgeting strategy.
- a retailer can sell a product, widgets, of a certain brand, BrandWidgets.
- the retailer can bid on keywords, including “widgets,” “Example Retailer,” and “BrandWidgets.”
- the users who search on “Example Retailer” might be more likely to purchase a widget from Example Retailer.
- the conversion rate for a bid on “Example Retailer” might be higher than the conversion rate for Example Retailer for a bid on “widgets” or “BrandWidgets.” Furthermore, since competition for bidding on “Example Retailer” will likely be lower than the competition for “BrandWidgets,” the cost might also be lower to bid on “Example Retailer.” In this example, the retailer might determine that they should allocate more of the advertising budget to the keyword Example Retailer, since this keyword appears to have a higher conversion rate.
- Example Retailer spends the majority of an advertising budget on “Example Retailer” as a result of this information, the retailer might miss out on the advertising exposure that is obtained by bidding on “widgets” or “BrandWidgets.”
- “widgets” and “BrandWidgets” might not necessarily result in either clicks or conversions when an advertisement is provided in response to search queries that match these targeting keywords.
- the advertisements that are provided in response to these keywords might inform users of the fact that Example Retailer sells BrandWidgets, and the users might later submit the search query “Example Retailer,” and complete a purchase.
- an advertising budget can be allocated based, at least in part, on the effect that bidding on one keyword has on the bidding of another keyword.
- the effect of bidding on “BrandWidgets” e.g., the exposure of Example Retailer as a source of BrandWidgets
- the effectiveness e.g., the conversion rate
- the effect that a content item has on the effectiveness of subsequently presented content items is referred to as carryover effect.
- the carryover effect for a content item e.g., an advertisement
- a specified outcome e.g., that a user will perform an action that constitutes a conversion
- a budget management apparatus can allocate an advertising budget among candidate keywords based, at least in part, on the carryover effect that is provided by advertisements that are targeted to the keywords.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which online content is distributed to user devices.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , advertisers 108 , and the advertisement management system 110 .
- the advertisement management system 110 includes a budget management apparatus 111 .
- the example environment 100 can include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and advertisers 108 .
- a website 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that can include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation of the resource 105 by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 are stored in a search index 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the search index 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages (i.e., resources in which search results are presented).
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- the advertisement management system 110 receives a request (e.g., a content item request) for content items (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the advertisement management system 110 is a data processing apparatus that selects advertisements (or other content items) that are responsive to an advertisement request (or other content item request).
- the advertisement management system 110 can include one or more ad servers that can select and or distribute advertisements (or other content items) that are responsive to an advertisement request (or another content item request).
- the request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the advertisement management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the advertisement slot can be provided to the advertisement management system 110 .
- resource keywords associated with e.g., indexed according to, specified by code for, and/or stored with a reference to
- a requested resource or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the advertisement management system 110 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the advertisement management system 110 selects advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”).
- eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics (e.g., size and/or aspect ratio) matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 116 are selected as eligible advertisements by the advertisement management system 110 .
- a targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a search query 116 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword or search query 116 .
- an advertisement associated with the targeting keyword “hockey” can be an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the resource keyword “hockey.”
- the advertisement can be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the search query “hockey.”
- a targeting keyword can also match a resource keyword or a search query 116 by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword or search query 116 despite having different text than the targeting keyword.
- an advertisement having the targeting keyword “hockey” can also be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including a resource keyword or search query for “sports” because hockey is a type of sport, and therefore, is likely to be relevant to the term “sports.”
- the advertisement management system 110 can select the eligible advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a resource or search results page based on results of an auction. For example, the advertisement management system 110 can receive bids from advertisers 108 and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the advertisers 108 are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a conversion following selection of the advertisement. The highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from advertisement performance or landing page scores.
- campaign parameters are parameters corresponding to a content distribution campaign that are used to control content selection in response to content requests.
- campaign parameters can include targeting keywords and corresponding bids, geographic or demographic targeting criteria, as well as other parameters corresponding to a set of advertisements.
- Campaign parameters can also include a budget, which is a maximum amount (or range of amounts) of money an advertiser wants to spend on bids on targeting keywords.
- a campaign is a set of one or more advertisements and corresponding campaign parameters that are grouped together into a same advertising unit. For example, advertisements for sporting equipment can be grouped together into a campaign.
- budgets can bet set on a monthly or daily basis for a specific advertisement or a group of advertisements, such as an advertisement campaign.
- the budgets can also be set based on a specific keyword or a group of keywords.
- Budgets can include a total amount of money, or more specific parameters, such as a maximum cost per click for a keyword.
- the advertisers 108 can also access the advertisement management system 110 to monitor performance of the advertisements that are distributed using the campaign parameters. For example, an advertiser can access a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), selections (i.e., clicks), and conversions that have been identified for the advertisements.
- the campaign performance report can also provide a total cost, a cost-per-click, and other cost measures for the advertisement over a specified period of time.
- the advertisement management system 110 can also store user interaction data with advertisements in a performance data store 119 b .
- Data representing conditions under which advertisements were selected for presentation to a user, and user interaction data representing actions taken by users in response to presentation of the advertisement can be stored in a data store such a performance data store 119 b .
- data can be stored in the performance data store 119 b representing the advertisement impression.
- selection data is stored in the performance data store 119 b representing the user selection of the advertisement.
- the data can also store information relating to user selections that lead to conversions.
- the data can also include the presentation of more than one advertisement to the user that led to the actions taken by the user.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's demographics, past advertisement selection).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's demographics, past advertisement selection.
- user data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized and/or encrypted so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's activities may be generalized (e.g., to a large group of users) where user activity information is obtained.
- the interaction data can be used, for example, to determine carryover effects of advertisements that might not directly lead to a conversion.
- statistical analysis of the interaction data might reveal that a baseline likelihood that a user performs an action that constitutes a conversion after clicking on an advertisement that was presented based on a particular keyword being matched (e.g., a baseline conversion rate for the particular keyword).
- the statistical analysis might also reveal a value by which the baseline likelihood increases when the advertisement is presented to a user subsequent to another (or the same) advertisement being provided to the user in response to a different keyword being matched.
- the increase to the baseline likelihood is referred to as the carryover effect for the different keyword.
- Not taking into account carryover effects of targeting keywords and/or advertisement presentations can result in incomplete analysis of an effectiveness of assigning bids to certain targeting keywords.
- an advertisement that is presented in response to a first targeting keyword being matched can result in a subsequent search on a second targeting keyword for which a conversion rate is relatively high.
- the conversion rate of the second targeting keyword can depend on whether an advertisement has been presented in response to the first targeting keyword being matched.
- the second targeting keyword might be less effective if a bid is not assigned to the first keyword (and/or an advertisement is not presented based on the first keyword being matched).
- bids for targeting keywords should be selected based, at least in part, on the carryover effects that are provided by the targeting keywords.
- the advertisement management system 110 includes, or is in communication with, a budget management apparatus 111 .
- the budget management apparatus 111 can include one or more servers (or other computing devices) that can select targeting keywords to which an advertising budget is allocated.
- the targeting keywords can be selected based, at least in part, on the carryover effects of the targeting keywords and/or a marginal value that is expected to be realized (directly and/or indirectly) by assigning a portion of the advertising budget to the targeting keyword.
- the budget management apparatus 111 can select a proper subset of a candidate set of targeting keywords and corresponding bids that increase a conversion rate for a campaign, given a budget for the campaign.
- the candidate set of targeting keywords can include, for example, the targeting keywords that an advertiser has selected for one or more advertisements.
- the budget management apparatus 111 can consider carryover effect in determining to which keywords the budget should be allocated (e.g., which targeting keywords can result in an increased or maximum conversion rate). For example, the budget management apparatus 111 can select a particular candidate targeting keyword even though the particular candidate targeting keyword might not have a high click-through rate, selection rate or conversion rate.
- the budget management apparatus 111 can select the subset of the candidate targeting keywords based on a probability distribution function that specifies a likelihood that a specified outcome (e.g., a conversion) will occur if a portion of the advertising budget is (or is not) allocated to the targeting keyword. For example, the budget management apparatus 111 can receive a probability distribution function for each of the candidate targeting keywords. The probability distribution function for each of the candidate targeting keywords can account for ads previously provided using other targeting keywords in the candidate set.
- the budget management apparatus 111 can select a final set of targeting keywords that provides at least a threshold likelihood (e.g., an absolute value, such as 30%, or a relative value, such as top ten likelihoods) of a specified outcome (e.g., conversion), with a total cost below a specified value (e.g., a budget).
- a threshold likelihood e.g., an absolute value, such as 30%, or a relative value, such as top ten likelihoods
- a specified outcome e.g., conversion
- a total cost below a specified value e.g., a budget
- the final set of targeting keywords can be a set of targeting keywords that together provide the highest conversion rate while not exceeding a specified advertising budget.
- the final set of targeting keywords can include at least one targeting keywords that might not directly provide a high conversion rate, but does have a high carryover effect, such that the conversion rates of other keywords in the final set are increased when the at least one targeting keyword is included in the final set.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow 200 for allocating an advertising budget among targeting keywords based, at least in part, on carryover effects of the targeting keywords.
- the data flow 200 begins with the advertisement management system 110 receiving a set of candidate keywords 202 .
- the set of candidate keywords include targeting keywords that have been specified for an ad campaign by an advertiser.
- the advertisement management system 110 includes, or is in communication with, the budget management apparatus 111 .
- the budget management apparatus 111 receives the candidate keywords from the advertisement management system 110 .
- the budget management apparatus 111 can receive the candidate keywords 202 directly from the advertiser 108 .
- the budget management apparatus 111 receives a probability distribution function 214 , 216 , 218 for each of the targeting keywords 204 , 206 , 208 in the set of candidate keywords 202 .
- Each of the probability distribution functions 214 , 216 , 218 models likelihoods of user actions occurring in response to targeting content items (e.g., targeting advertisements) using the targeting keywords 204 , 206 , 208 , respectively.
- Each of the probability distribution functions 214 , 216 , 218 accounts for content items previously targeted using one or more other targeting keywords.
- the probability distribution function 214 can be generated based on a statistical analysis of historical user action that follows presentation of advertisements associated with the targeting keyword 204 .
- the set of candidate keywords can be for a BrandWidget advertising campaign by Example Retailer.
- Keyword1 204 can be, for example, “widgets.”
- Keyword2 206 can be “Example Retailer.”
- KeywordN 208 can be “BrandWidgets.” While we discuss only three example targeting keywords, the set of candidate keywords 202 can include hundreds of targeting keywords or more.
- the budget management apparatus 111 receives a probability distribution function 214 for keyword1 204 , “widgets.”
- the probability distribution function 214 models probabilities of actions a user can take in response to advertisements associated with the targeting keyword, “widgets.” For example, based on previous user interactions, the probability distribution function 214 can specify actions and likelihoods with which users will take the actions if provided an advertisement that is targeted using the keyword 204 .
- the actions can include, for example, user interaction with (e.g., clicking of) the advertisement and user conversion (e.g., purchasing of a widget).
- the actions can also include a subsequent search executed by the user, for example, including another targeting keyword (e.g., targeting keyword 206 ).
- the probability distribution function 214 can provide probabilities of the user actions being performed when different amounts are assigned as a bid for keyword1 204 .
- the probability distribution function 214 can be based, at least in part, on previous advertisements that have been provided to the user (e.g., based on other targeting keywords being matched). For example, the probability distribution function 214 can specify a likelihood that a user that is provided an advertisement in response the targeting keyword “widgets” being matched will submit subsequent search queries that match other targeting keywords (e.g., 206 and/or 208 ). The subsequent search queries can be search queries that match the targeting keyword “BrandWidgets,” such that the presentation of the advertisement associated with “widgets” targeting keyword can have a carryover effect on to the advertisements associated with “BrandWidgets.”
- the probability distribution functions 214 , 216 , 218 corresponding to each of the targeting keywords 204 , 206 , 208 can be used to determine a benefit to the advertiser 108 of changing the amount allocated to the keywords 204 , 206 , 208 .
- the budget management apparatus 111 can select a set of final keywords 222 with which advertisements associated with the advertiser 108 will provide at least a threshold likelihood of a specified outcome (e.g., conversion).
- the final keywords 222 can be keywords for which a total cost of distributing the advertisements is less than a specified value (e.g., a budget).
- the budget management apparatus 111 can provide the final keywords 222 to the advertiser 108 .
- the budget management apparatus 111 can receive prior approval from the advertiser 108 to use the final keywords 222 and their associated bids.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for allocating advertising budgets based, at least in part, on carryover effects of targeting keywords.
- the process 300 can be implemented, for example, by the advertisement management system 110 and/or the budget management apparatus 111 of FIG. 1 .
- the advertisement management system 110 and/or the budget management apparatus 111 are each data processing apparatus that include one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of the process 300 .
- the advertisement management system 110 is one or more data processing apparatus that includes the budget management apparatus 111 .
- a tangible computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of the process 300 .
- a set of candidate keywords specifying targeting keywords is received ( 302 ).
- the set of candidate keywords can be targeting keywords for a specific advertising campaign and/or a specific advertisement.
- the candidate keywords can also include initial corresponding bid amounts for each targeting keyword.
- Each targeting keyword is a phrase of one or more words that must be matched for the advertisement to be eligible to be provided in response to a content item request.
- Candidate keywords can be received from an advertiser, along with other campaign parameters for the campaign associated with the candidate keywords.
- the campaign parameters can include a budget, which can provide a total cost limit for distributing advertisements targeted by the candidate keywords.
- a probability distribution is received ( 304 ).
- the probability distribution is a function that models user action in response to advertisements presented to the user.
- the presentation of the advertisements is dependent on the bid amounts for each targeting keyword.
- the probability distribution function takes into account carryover effect by analyzing the ad presentation history to the user. For example, the probability distribution function can be adjusted to model an increased likelihood of a particular action occurring when an advertisement was previously presented to the user.
- the model can include user states, each user state capturing search queries submitted by the user and/or actions previously taken by the user.
- a finite space of user states can be represented by X, with each state in X being represented by x.
- the search queries can include search queries that match targeting keywords, and therefore, the actions taken by the user can include user interactions with advertisements associated with the targeting keywords that were provided in response to the search queries.
- the user states can also include a conversion state, represented by x c , a non-conversion state x n , and a final state, x f .
- the model can represent possible actions, or advertising levels, that can be taken by an advertiser at each state. Since each state represents a search query, the action can represent bid amounts for the targeting keywords that are matched by the search query.
- the finite set of possible actions for each state x can be represented by A(x).
- A(x) can be ⁇ advertise, do not advertise ⁇ .
- A(x) can include more levels of advertising corresponding to different bid amounts.
- A(x) can include different threshold bid values (e.g., $1.00 per click) that an advertiser can assign to a targeting keyword.
- the model can include transition probabilities between states, which depend on the amount of advertising the user has been exposed to at each state.
- the transition probabilities can be represented as P xay , which represents the probability a user moves from state x to state y if advertising level a is chosen.
- the cost of advertising at level a in state x can be represented by d(x, a).
- MDP constrained Markov Decision Process
- the reward C only applies for conversion and the conversion rate is to be maximized.
- the budget allocation problem can be defined as
- R is the expected total reward
- D is the expected total cost
- ⁇ is the initial flow of users (normalized to 1 to represent a probability measure)
- u is a general policy defining bid amounts for corresponding targeting keywords
- V is the budget constraint.
- D can be a cost per click for all bids on all targeting keywords multiplied by an expected total clicks on all ads based on the targeting keywords.
- V can be a maximum dollar amount that an advertiser is willing to spend on an advertising campaign.
- Marginal value of raising a bid on the targeting keyword is calculated ( 306 ) for each targeting keyword.
- the modeled MDP problem can be solved by calculating the marginal values of raising advertising levels.
- the modeled MDP problem can specify an amount of expected increased revenue that can be realized by increasing a bid level for a particular keyword.
- the MDP problem can be implemented, for example, as follows:
- ⁇ is a marginal cost, as d(x, a m(x) ) is the cost of advertising at a new level m(x) compared to the cost d(x, a m ) of advertising at a current level m.
- ⁇ is a marginal value, summing the increase in probability of a user going from state x to state y with the change in advertising level.
- ⁇ i (y) is the probability of being on state y.
- ⁇ is a Lagrange multiplier for the budget constraint. The Lagrange multiplier can be implemented as
- a maximum marginal value is obtained by computing a marginal cost for each increase in advertising level.
- An increase in transition probabilities is computed for each state, multiplied by the probability the user is on the state to begin with.
- the increase in cost is subtracted from the increase in transition probabilities, including the transition probability to a conversion state. Dividing that by its derivative provides the increase in value.
- the model can be trained using historical search data.
- the values for state and transition probabilities can be derived from past search history data. For example, initial values can be selected and back tested against historical user responses. Adjustments can be made to the values so that the probabilities more accurately model the historical data.
- Final keywords and corresponding bids are selected ( 308 ).
- the final keywords are selected such that the total cost of distributing advertisements (or other content items) associated with the keywords is below a specified value.
- the final keywords and the bids that are assigned to each of the final keywords can be selected so that the total cost of distributing the advertisements is below an advertiser specified advertising budget.
- using the linear programs described above provides a set of keywords and corresponding bid amounts that provide a threshold expected return on investment (ROI) (e.g., a maximum expected ROI among combinations of bids on targeting keywords) for an advertising budget.
- ROI expected return on investment
- the final keyword set can provide the highest probability for conversion for a given total cost, accounting for carryover effects the targeting keywords have on each other.

In the example method, m is a set of numbers representing the advertising level. Δ is a marginal cost, as d(x, am(x)) is the cost of advertising at a new level m(x) compared to the cost d(x, am) of advertising at a current level m. δ is a marginal value, summing the increase in probability of a user going from state x to state y with the change in advertising level. πi(y) is the probability of being on state y. λ is a Lagrange multiplier for the budget constraint. The Lagrange multiplier can be implemented as
Here, any fixed value of λ, π(x) can be thought of as the optimal value function in the Markov model Mλ with adjusted rewards rλ(x)=r(x,a)−λd(x,a). Thus, a maximum marginal value is obtained by computing a marginal cost for each increase in advertising level. An increase in transition probabilities is computed for each state, multiplied by the probability the user is on the state to begin with. The increase in cost is subtracted from the increase in transition probabilities, including the transition probability to a conversion state. Dividing that by its derivative provides the increase in value.
