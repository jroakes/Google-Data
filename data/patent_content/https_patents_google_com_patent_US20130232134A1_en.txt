- the book resource can be divided into sections and subsections corresponding to sections and subsections of the corresponding book or publication, for example, chapters.
- a particular portion of the book resource can be designated as a particular section of a corresponding book, e.g., Chapter 1.
- the sections can be identified using page layout analysis of scanned pages of a book or publication during, for example, an ingestion process that includes performing optical character recognition on the scanned pages.
- the n-gram engine limits the analyzed text to pages that correspond to a particular set of search results or to pages of the book that include one or more terms of a particular search query.
- the n-gram engine computes a section score of each of a plurality of n-grams in each section ( 320 ).
- the system can identify a number of n-grams to analyze from text of the scanned book. In some implementations, the system analyzes all n-grams occurring the text of the book below a particular n-gram order, e.g. all n-grams below n-gram order 3 or 4 .
- the section score for a particular n-gram can be based on a statistical measure of importance of occurrences of the n-gram in a section.
- the n-gram engine can use a term frequency-inverse document frequency (“tf-idf”) measure to determine importance for each n-gram in a section.
- the term frequency “tf” component of the section score is the frequency of the n-gram within the section
- the inverse document frequency “idf” component is based on the number of sections of the book resource in which the n-gram occurs.
- the inverse document frequency of an n-gram x can be computed as:
- idf ⁇ ( x ) log ⁇ ⁇ S ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ s : x ⁇ s ⁇ ⁇ ,
- the n-gram engine computes a book score for each distinct n-gram ( 330 ).
- the book score is generally based on the individual computed section scores for each n-gram.
- the book score can be computed in a variety of ways.
- the n-gram engine can compute a sum of the section scores, e.g., the tf-idf scores for each section.
- the n-gram engine can also rank n-grams in each section by section score and use the rank of the n-gram, e.g. 1, 2, etc., in each section to compute the book score.
- the book score can also be computed as an inverse of a sum of inverse section scores.
- the inverses of the section scores are summed, and the book score is based on the inverse of the sum.
- the book score can be defined by:
- K is a predetermined constant that can be used to scale the book score.
- the book score can also be based on a Bayesian average defined by:
- C is an average book score of all n-grams
- m is an average number of sections in which an average n-gram occurs
- R is an average of the computed section scores for the n-gram
- v is a number of sections in which the n-gram occurs.
- the n-gram engine can also boost a book score for n-grams that are the names of particular entities, for example known cities or names of well-known people. For example, the book score of the n-gram “David Jones” can be given a boost because the n-gram is the name of a particular person.
- the book score for a particular n-gram can also be influenced by how tightly clustered the particular n-gram is in the book text.
- the n-gram engine can accordingly boost the book score of n-grams that are more tightly clustered.
- the n-gram engine finds the shortest sequence of book terms that includes the n-gram a particular number of times. For example, the n-gram engine can determine that a particular n-gram occurred 5 times in a sequence of only 100 book terms.
- the n-gram engine can also use a sliding window of terms of a particular size and determine how often a particular n-gram occurs more than threshold number of times, e.g. more than 5 times.
- a presentation of search results can be ordered within a presented section heading by a measure of how tightly clustered a corresponding n-gram is for each identified search result for that section.
- the n-gram engine provides the list of n-gram summary terms ordered by respective computed book score of the n-gram summary terms ( 340 ). After computing a book score for each n-gram, the n-gram engine can rank the n-grams by book score. In some implementations, a list of the highest-ranked n-grams is provided as the list of n-gram summary terms.
- the n-gram summary terms can be provided as summary data for a book or as a list of query suggestion links.
- FIG. 4 is another illustration of an example presentation 400 of books search results.
- the headings 410 , 420 , 430 , 440 , 450 , and 460 each correspond to an n-gram summary term as identified, for example, by the process 300 of FIG. 3 .
- Each section heading can include one or more search results, for example, search results 432 a - d.
- the search system can generate one or more queries using a list of n-gram summary terms extracted from text of the corresponding book resource. Each query can include a distinct n-gram from the list of n-gram summary terms.
- the search system performs a search within a book resource using the generated queries.
- the system then provides a number of highest-ranked n-gram summary terms as headings.
- Each heading can be presented with one or more search results that each identify a portion of the book resource that includes the corresponding n-gram summary term.
- each heading can be ordered by location of occurrence within the book resource.
- the search results presented for each heading can alternatively be ordered by any other appropriate measure, including a measure of how tightly clustered each corresponding n-gram summary term occurs within text identified by each search result.

FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for identifying a list of n-gram summary terms from the text of a book. -
FIG. 4 is another illustration of an example presentation of books search results. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Search systems provide access to many kinds of digital resources. Some search systems provide access to book resources, that is, resources that have been identified as relating specifically to digital or scanned versions of printed books and similar publications, e.g., magazines and journals. In response to a search query, the search system can provide search results that identify book resources for publications matching the search query.
- Many types of book resources are structured in a particular way, e.g., by chapter. Search systems can use the structure of a particular book resource in order to obtain and present information about the book resource in an intuitive and accessible way.
-
FIG. 1 is an illustration of an example bookssearch results page 100. The search resultspage 100 is an example presentation of information about a book resource, a presentation that uses the internal structure of the book resource. The search resultspage 100 is generated and provided by a search engine in response to a user search query of one or more terms. - The search results
page 100 includes asearch box 102 or “query box”, an identification of the title andauthor 104 of the book resource, and animage 106 of the cover of the book resource. - The search results
page 100 includes section headings, e.g.,section headings - The search results
page 100 can also present hierarchical section headings in which section headings are followed by corresponding subsection headings. In some implementations, the section headings are presented in an order that corresponds to an order in which the sections occur in the book resource. In some other implementations, section headings are ordered by computed scores of associated search results. The search resultspage 100 can also include search results from multiple book resources, in which case the title of a book resource can be presented as a corresponding section heading. - One or more search results are presented under each section heading, for example, search results 132 a-d. Each search result 132 a-d identifies a portion of the book resource in which one or more of the terms of the search query occur. Each search result 132 a-d also includes a snippet of text from the identified portion of the book resource. In some implementations, the terms of the search query are highlighted in the snippet. The search results presented with each section heading can be presented in an order in which the terms of the query occur in the book resource.
- Each search result also includes a hyperlink, or link, 134 to the book resource. Each link can include as display text a page number corresponding to the particular search result. In some implementations, a selection, for example, a click or mouseover, of the link causes a program displaying the
page 100 to navigate to a page containing text or an image of a scanned page of the book or publication where the text of the snippet is located, or to provide in the text or the image in another way, for example, in a popup window. - The search results
page 100 also includes apresentation 180 of n-gram summary terms extracted from text of the book resource. The n-gram summary terms can be used by a user as summary information or as suggested search queries, in addition to other uses. In some implementations, each n-gram includes a link, and selection of the link of an n-gram summary term by a user initiates a search of the book resource with a query that includes the n-gram. Generation of the list of n-gram summary terms will be described in more detail with reference toFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of anexample system 200. Thesystem 200 includes auser device 210 in communication with asearch system 230 over anetwork 220. Thesearch system 230 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described in this specification can be implemented. - A
user device 210 can communicate with thesearch system 230 through adata communication network 220. In general, theuser device 210 runs a program, e.g., a web browser, that transmits aquery 215 over thenetwork 220 to thesearch system 230. Thesearch system 230 identifies resources that satisfy thequery 215 and generates asearch results presentation 225. Thesearch system 230 transmits thesearch results presentation 225 over thenetwork 220 back to theuser device 210 for presentation to a user 202. Generally, the user 202 is a person. - The
user device 210 can be any appropriate type of computing device, e.g., a server, mobile phone, tablet computer, notebook computer, music player, e-book reader, laptop or desktop computer, PDA (personal digital assistant), smart phone, or other stationary or portable device, that includes one ormore processors 206 for executing program instructions andmemory 204. Theuser device 210 can include computer readable media that store software applications, e.g., a browser or layout engine, an input device, e.g., a keyboard or mouse, a communication interface, and a display device. - The
network 220 can be, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or Wi-Fi network, a Third Generation (3G), Fourth Generation (4G), or other mobile telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any suitable combination of such networks. - The
search system 230 can be implemented as one or more computer programs installed on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled for data communication with each other. Thesearch system 230 includes asearch engine 240, abooks collection 250, and an n-gram engine 260. - When the
query 215 is received by thesearch system 230, asearch engine 240 identifies resources that satisfy thequery 215. Thesearch engine 240 generally includes aranking engine 244 to rank the resources that have been identified. The search engine will also include anindexing engine 242 that indexes resources in a collection, e.g., books, magazines, newspapers, web pages, or images. The indexing and ranking of resources can be performed using conventional techniques. - For example, book resources can be stored in
books collection 250 for indexing by theindexing engine 242. The books collection can include, for example, scanned images of book pages and corresponding text. Thesearch system 230 can obtain the corresponding text by performing optical character recognition on each scanned book page. Thesearch system 230 can also analyze scanned pages of the book to identify section headings of the book, for example, by analyzing font size, font style, page layout, or page spacing. - The search system can also populate the
books collection 250 by crawling available resources and downloading text of digitized books. - The
search system 230 responds to thequery 215 by generating asearch results presentation 225, which is transmitted over thenetwork 220 to theuser device 210 in a form that can be presented on theuser device 210, e.g., as a web page displayed in a web browser on theuser device 210. For example, thesearch results presentation 225 can be a markup language document, e.g., HyperText Markup Language or eXtensible Markup Language document. Theuser device 210 renders the document, e.g., using a web browser, and presents thesearch results presentation 225 on a display device. - The
search results presentation 225 can include a list of n-gram summary terms, e.g., thelist 180 of n-gram summary terms as shown inFIG. 1 . In order to generate the list of n-gram summary terms, thesearch system 230 can use an n-gram engine 260. The n-gram engine 260 can analyze text of a particular book resource in order to determine an ordering of n-grams according to a particular ranking model. In some implementations, the ranking model is designed to identify n-grams that provide good summary data for the contents of a book resource. The ranking model can also be designed to identify n-grams that provide useful search query suggestions to users. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart of anexample process 300 for determining a list of n-gram summary terms from the text of a book resource. Theprocess 300 can be implemented by one or more computer programs installed on one or more computers. Theprocess 300 will be described as being performed by an n-gram engine, for example, the n-gram engine 260 ofFIG. 2 . - The n-gram engine obtains text of a scanned book (310). The text can be obtained from a collection of book resources. The book resources can include scanned pages of books and other publications, and can include corresponding text obtained, for example, through optical character recognition.
- The book resource can be divided into sections and subsections corresponding to sections and subsections of the corresponding book or publication, for example, chapters. In other words, a particular portion of the book resource can be designated as a particular section of a corresponding book, e.g.,
Chapter 1. The sections can be identified using page layout analysis of scanned pages of a book or publication during, for example, an ingestion process that includes performing optical character recognition on the scanned pages. - In some implementations, the n-gram engine limits the analyzed text to pages that correspond to a particular set of search results or to pages of the book that include one or more terms of a particular search query.
- The n-gram engine computes a section score of each of a plurality of n-grams in each section (320). The system can identify a number of n-grams to analyze from text of the scanned book. In some implementations, the system analyzes all n-grams occurring the text of the book below a particular n-gram order, e.g. all n-grams below n-gram order 3 or 4.
- The section score for a particular n-gram can be based on a statistical measure of importance of occurrences of the n-gram in a section. For example, the n-gram engine can use a term frequency-inverse document frequency (“tf-idf”) measure to determine importance for each n-gram in a section. In some implementations, the term frequency “tf” component of the section score is the frequency of the n-gram within the section, and the inverse document frequency “idf” component is based on the number of sections of the book resource in which the n-gram occurs. For example, the inverse document frequency of an n-gram x can be computed as:
-
- where |S| is the number of sections in the book resource, and |{s:xεs}| is the number of sections that contain the n-gram x. The “tf-idf” measure can then be computed by multiplying the term frequency by the inverse document frequency. Other variations of the “tf-idf” measure can also be used.
- The n-gram engine computes a book score for each distinct n-gram (330). The book score is generally based on the individual computed section scores for each n-gram. The book score can be computed in a variety of ways. In some implementations, the n-gram engine can compute a sum of the section scores, e.g., the tf-idf scores for each section. The n-gram engine can also rank n-grams in each section by section score and use the rank of the n-gram, e.g. 1, 2, etc., in each section to compute the book score.
- The book score can also be computed as an inverse of a sum of inverse section scores. In other words, the inverses of the section scores are summed, and the book score is based on the inverse of the sum. For example, the book score can be defined by:
-
- for each section score scorei in each of N sections, where K is a predetermined constant that can be used to scale the book score.
- The book score can also be based on a Bayesian average defined by:
-
- where C is an average book score of all n-grams, m is an average number of sections in which an average n-gram occurs, R is an average of the computed section scores for the n-gram, and v is a number of sections in which the n-gram occurs.
- The n-gram engine can also boost a book score for n-grams that are the names of particular entities, for example known cities or names of well-known people. For example, the book score of the n-gram “David Jones” can be given a boost because the n-gram is the name of a particular person.
- The book score for a particular n-gram can also be influenced by how tightly clustered the particular n-gram is in the book text. The n-gram engine can accordingly boost the book score of n-grams that are more tightly clustered. In some implementations, the n-gram engine finds the shortest sequence of book terms that includes the n-gram a particular number of times. For example, the n-gram engine can determine that a particular n-gram occurred 5 times in a sequence of only 100 book terms. The n-gram engine can also use a sliding window of terms of a particular size and determine how often a particular n-gram occurs more than threshold number of times, e.g. more than 5 times. By boosting the book scores of n-grams that are more tightly clustered, the system can score an n-gram that occurs in a detailed discussion higher than another n-gram that is merely mentioned in passing or is spread evenly throughout a chapter or throughout the book. In some implementations, a presentation of search results can be ordered within a presented section heading by a measure of how tightly clustered a corresponding n-gram is for each identified search result for that section.
- The n-gram engine provides the list of n-gram summary terms ordered by respective computed book score of the n-gram summary terms (340). After computing a book score for each n-gram, the n-gram engine can rank the n-grams by book score. In some implementations, a list of the highest-ranked n-grams is provided as the list of n-gram summary terms. The n-gram summary terms can be provided as summary data for a book or as a list of query suggestion links.
-
FIG. 4 is another illustration of anexample presentation 400 of books search results. InFIG. 4 , theheadings process 300 ofFIG. 3 . Each section heading can include one or more search results, for example, search results 432 a-d. - The search system can generate one or more queries using a list of n-gram summary terms extracted from text of the corresponding book resource. Each query can include a distinct n-gram from the list of n-gram summary terms.
- In some implementations, the search system performs a search within a book resource using the generated queries. The system then provides a number of highest-ranked n-gram summary terms as headings. Each heading can be presented with one or more search results that each identify a portion of the book resource that includes the corresponding n-gram summary term.
- The search results presented for, and generally under, each heading can be ordered by location of occurrence within the book resource. The search results presented for each heading can alternatively be ordered by any other appropriate measure, including a measure of how tightly clustered each corresponding n-gram summary term occurs within text identified by each search result.

Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
