Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require an initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other autonomous systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself
- an autonomous vehicle cannot or should not drive an entire route in fully autonomous mode due to road conditions or other environmental factors. Thus, some routes may require some amount driver control or interaction at some point during the trip. Generally, the driver is not informed of the need to take control of the vehicle until immediately before such a change is necessary.
- the method includes receiving input including a destination; generating a set of proposed routes between a current location of a vehicle and the destination based on detailed map information; for each route of the set of proposed routes, generating by a processor, corresponding control information, the control information defining which portions of a particular route may be maneuvered in a manual driving mode where a driver controls one or more of the steering, acceleration, and braking, and where the control information also defines which portions of the particular route may be maneuvered in an autonomous mode where the processor controls the steering, braking, and acceleration; providing a set of routing options, wherein each routing option includes a particular proposed route of the set of proposed routes and the corresponding control information for the proposed route; receiving input indicating one of the proposed routes of the set of proposed routes; and after receiving the input indicating the one proposed route, maneuvering the vehicle according to the corresponding control information for the indicated proposed routes.

It will be further understood that aspects described herein are not limited to intersections, but may be utilized in conjunction with various other traffic or roadway designs which may or may not include additional features or all of the features described with respect to intersection 400 .
- Data about the intersection may be collected, for example, by driving a vehicle equipped various object detection components.
- the data may be processed in order to generate roadgraph information describing the roadway. For example, as shown in FIG. 5 , based on laser, geographic location, and other information collected while driving a vehicle through intersection 400 , a roadgraph 500 of the intersection may be generated. Similar to intersection 400 , roadgraph 500 may include various features such as lanes 530 - 37 , lane lines 540 - 43 , and roadway boundaries 550 - 59 (such as fog lines, curbs, etc.). Each of these features may be associated with geographic location information identifying where these objects may be located in the real world (for example in intersection 400 ). Again, although roadgraph 500 is depicted as an image-based map, it will be understood that this information may be stored as a graph network or grid of data or other information describing the various features and their relationships.
- the detailed map information is depicted herein as an image-based map, the map information need not be entirely image based (for example, raster).
- the detailed map information may include one or more roadgraphs or graph networks of information such as roads, lanes, intersections, and the connections between these features.
- Each feature may be stored as graph data and may be associated with information such as a geographic location and whether or not it is linked to other related features, for example, a stop sign may be linked to a road and an intersection, etc.
- the associated data may include grid-based indices of a roadgraph to allow for efficient lookup of certain roadgraph features.
- data 134 of computer 110 may store various control factor data 138 .
- the control factors may include the availability of detailed map information (e.g. a road map vs. a highly detailed map of the location of lane lines, curbs, etc.) along the route, input from current data feeds (including, for example, traffic, construction, accident information, and weather data), data from other autonomous vehicles reporting problem areas, and historical data (including past traffic data, dangerous areas or areas of high accident rates, weather conditions such as fog, bright sunlight, etc.).
- Data 134 may also store task and activity suggestions 139 .
- This may include, for example, a database or table may associate various lengths of time with corresponding tasks or activities. For example, time periods between 5 and 10 minutes may be associated with relatively short tasks such as text messaging or reading emails. Slightly longer periods may be associated with more involved tasks such as writing emails, web surfing, video games, etc. Even longer periods may be associated with activities such as watching a television show or movie.
- the task and activity suggestions data may also store information regarding which tasks a particular driver has typically engaged in during similar periods of time.
- a driver of an autonomous vehicle may begin a trip by indicating a destination.
- a driver may initially input a destination, such as location coordinates (latitude and longitude), an address, an intersection, a point of interest, etc. using user input 140 .
- the vehicle's computer may generate a set of proposed routes between the vehicle's current location and the destination based on the detailed map 136 .
- Each route may be based on typical navigational considerations such as the total travel time, travel distance, fuel economy, etc.
- Each route of the set of proposed routs may also be associated with control information generated by computer 110 .
- the control information may include whether and which portions of the proposed route may be controlled by the vehicle alone (fully autonomous mode), by both the vehicle and the driver (semiautonomous mode), or the driver alone (manual mode).
- vehicle 101 when vehicle 101 is operating in an autonomous mode, features such as the braking system 180 , acceleration system 182 , signaling system 184 , and navigation system 186 are being controlled by computer without continuous input from a driver.
- the driver may have primary control over some control features while computer 110 has control over other features.
- the driver may control the steering by adjusting the steering wheel while computer 110 may control the braking and acceleration systems.
- the computer may have primary control over all features, but the driver may be required to monitor the operation of the vehicle. For example, the driver may be required to confirm various information such as the state (red, yellow, green, etc.) of a traffic signal, whether a blind spot adjacent to the vehicle is clear, the posted speed limit, the number of lanes, etc.
- computer 110 or another of the vehicle's processing systems may control the vehicle based on input received from the driver at the steering wheel, brake pedal, and/or acceleration pedal.
- the control information for the proposed routes may be based on one or more of the control factors of control factor data 138 . These factors may be used to estimate the likelihood of different types of failures would be expected by computer 110 .
- Such conditions may include situations in which a driver may not feel comfortable without full control of the vehicle or where computer 110 would not be able to safely maneuver the vehicle.
- Examples of unsafe or dangerous driving conditions may include areas lacking specific map information, areas where lots of pedestrians would be expected (such as around a mall), weather conditions that may affect the vehicle's sensor or the computer's control capabilities (such as precipitation, snow or ice covered roadways, bright sunlight etc.), high traffic areas, areas associated with high occurrences of accidents, or any such conditions which may be estimated or determined from the factors listed above.
- One or more of the control factors of control factor data 138 may be input into a probabilistic estimation of how confident the computer is that a particular type of failure would not occur over a certain portion of the route.
- the computer 110 may use a machine learning classifier to compare correlated data such as past history of this or other vehicles and the number of times where there was a failure.
- the classifier may be trained across a number of different factors such as traffic feeds, weather, speeds of other autonomous vehicles, live or historic data from other autonomous vehicles, etc.
- the result may be a confidence value indicative of how likely the driver is going to be asked to take control.
- computer 110 may use a heuristic approach. In this example, when a set of factors are known to cause any type of failure these factors may be considered together. In one example, if the type of failure is related to traffic congestion, the factors considered may include speed, number of vehicles, distance between vehicles, weather conditions, or any other factors known to affect traffic conditions. Each factor may be associated with some cost value. The costs of different factors may accumulate until a threshold is met, and the computer determines that a failure is likely. In yet another example, the computer 110 may examine historic data from this or other vehicles to determine the probability of failure at the same times and locations along a route.
- FIG. 6 is an example of 3 different probabilistic estimations for a route.
- each of the graphs 1 - 3 is plotted for the distance traveled along the route between an initial starting location Xi for the route and a destination location Xd. Similar plots may also be generated for the time of the route (as opposed to distance traveled).
- Each of the three graphs includes a probabilistic estimation for a particular type of failure. For example, graph 1 is plotted for a failure associated with weather predictions, graph 2 is plotted for a failure associated with traffic congestion, and graph 3 is plotted for a failure associated with dangerous intersections.
- Each probabilistic estimation for the different types of failures may be considered together to determine an overall probability of failure along each part of the route. For example, if one of the probabilistic estimations indicates a possible failure, the computer 110 may determine from a single probabilistic estimation that a particular location along a route would surpass an acceptable level or threshold of risk. In this regard, the computer to determine that there would be a failure at some point along the route. In another example, the different probabilistic estimations may be added together, such as by using a weighted sum, to determine if some threshold of acceptable risk has been met. Thus, the factors may be used by computer 110 to determine the best driving mode for various portions of the route. For example, FIG. 7 is an example of a graph 4 plotted for a total probability of failure 710 along a route between the initial starting location Xi for the route and the destination location Xd.
- the overall probability of failure may then be compared to one or more acceptable threshold values. For example, any portion of the route where the overall probability of failure is estimated to be at or below an acceptable threshold for autonomous driving may be determined to be appropriate for the autonomous mode. In one example, portions of the route where the overall probability of failure is below the acceptable threshold may be associated with the autonomous mode while portions of the route where the overall probability of failure is above the acceptable threshold may be associated with the manual mode.
- graph 5 of FIG. 8 depicts the overall probability of failure 710 as compared to an acceptable threshold 810 .
- the overall probability of failure crosses threshold 810 at two locations, X 1 and X 2 , along the route between Xi and Xd.
- the probability of failure 710 is below threshold 810 between Xi and location X 1 (along dX 1 ) as well as between X 2 and Xd (along dX 3 ).
- the probability of failure 710 is above threshold 810 between X 1 and X 2 (along dX 3 ).
- portions above threshold 810 may be associated with the manual mode while portions below the threshold may be associated with the autonomous mode.
- dX 1 and dX 3 may be associated with the autonomous mode as the overall probability of failure 710 is below the threshold 810
- dX 2 may be associated with the manual mode as the overall probability of failure 710 is above threshold 810 .
- Areas of a route which may be above an acceptable threshold and associated with the manual mode may include, for example, those where only a street map is available.
- a particular portion along a route which is projected to have a high volume of traffic during the time which the vehicle would travel may be associated probability of failure that is above the acceptable threshold for autonomous driving, requiring a manual mode.
- the given portion may be associated with the autonomous mode.
- computer 110 may also be capable of operating in the semiautonomous mode.
- the overall probability of failure may be compared to two different thresholds, for example, one for autonomous driving and another for semiautonomous driving. Any portion of the route associated with an overall probability of failure is above the acceptable threshold for autonomous driving, but below an acceptable threshold for semiautonomous driving may be determined to be portion of the route appropriate for the semiautonomous mode.
- graph 6 of FIG. 9 depicts the total probability of failure 710 with an acceptable autonomous threshold 910 and an acceptable semiautonomous threshold 920 .
- portions of the route where the overall probability of failure 710 is below the autonomous threshold 910 may be associated with the autonomous mode
- portions of the route where the overall probability of failure 710 is above the autonomous threshold 910 but below the semiautonomous threshold 920 may be associated with the semiautonomous mode
- portions of the route where the overall probability of failure 710 is above the semiautonomous threshold 920 may be associated with the manual mode.
- thresholds 910 and 920 may include when a street map as well as speed limit information is available for a given portion, the given portion may be associated with either the manual mode or a semiautonomous mode (as described above.
- the semiautonomous mode may be appropriate where the probability of failure is close to, but has not actually surpassed the acceptable level of risk.
- the driver may have a greater level of concentration on the road such that he or she is able to take over at a moment's notice.
- the vehicle can safely drive in the semiautonomous mode with sufficient time to provide any necessary warning to the driver of the need to take immediate control.
- the computer may consider the type of failure and the amount of time associated with those types of failures.
- the probabilistic estimations determined based on the various control factors of factor data 138 , the overall probability of failure, and the one or more thresholds may be used by computer 110 to generate the control information for each proposed route.
- the computer may then provide the proposed routes and control information as routing options to the driver. For example, a given proposed route may be displayed to a user with information such as a total time for the route and a map depicting the given proposed route as with typical navigational systems.
- the computer may also provide details such as the time of the longest stretch of driving associated with the autonomous mode as well as map information highlighting the location of the route including information indicating which portions of the routes are associated with the type of control.
- computer 110 may provide information regarding not only the total time of the route but also the total time in the various driving modes.
- FIG. 10 is one example of how computer 110 may provide the proposed routing options to the driver, though various other methods may also be used.
- FIG. 10 may thus include an example screen shot of touch screen 217 and/or display 225 .
- Routing option 1010 includes Route 1 between initial and destination locations A and B depicted on map 1030 via River Road, while routing option 1020 includes Route 2 between initial and destination locations A and B via First Avenue.
- the routing options in this example include a total estimated travel time for each route as well as a time for the longest autonomous portion of each route.
- computer 110 may also provide the control information determined for the routing options to the driver.
- computer 110 may designate the portions of the route associated with different modes of driving (as determined from the probability of failure and thresholds described above).
- key 1040 distinguishes between the different operating modes based on the type of line displayed on map 1030 , this information may be displayed in other ways, such as by different colors, line widths, etc.
- Route 1 begins at location A in the autonomous mode, switches to a manual mode, and then concludes in an autonomous mode at location B.
- Route 2 begins at location A in the manual mode and subsequently switches to an autonomous mode until reaching location B.
- the driver may select that option and select button 1050 to begin the selected routing option in the predetermined driving mode.
- computer 110 may also provide the driver with task and activity suggestions for each of the routes.
- the task and activity suggestion data 139 may associate specific suggestions with different periods of time.
- Computer may search this data and identify a suggestion based on how long the driver may have to perform different tasks or activities during a particular proposed route.
- suggestions may be selected based on an estimated period of time for a portion of the route where vehicle 101 may operate in the autonomous mode, or rather, the amount of time computer 110 determines that it may control vehicle 101 without input from the driver.
- routing options 1010 and 1020 each include a recommendation for the driver. Routing option 1 suggests reading emails as the longest stretch of autonomous mode is only 7 minutes. Routing option 2 suggests a more time consuming activity of watching a television show as the longest stretch of autonomous mode is 25 minutes. In another example, route 2 might be associated with a suggestion that the driver could finish a movie started previously, while route 1 may be associated with a suggestion that the driver could complete only one or 2 levels of a popular game.
- the example suggestions provided in FIG. 10 are based on the longest period of time of the routes associated with the autonomous mode. However, the suggestions may also be based on the amount (time or distance) of any portion of a route associated with the autonomous mode. In another example, the suggestions may be based on the driver's previous reaction times. For example, it may be important in certain areas associated with higher probabilities of failure, which have not quite met the threshold for acceptable risk, that the driver be prepared to take control of the vehicle quickly. Thus, the computer 110 may suggest activities which the driver is easily and quickly taken away from for such areas along the route. In this regard, it may be easier to draw the driver from texting than from reading a book, etc.
- the recommended activities may be based on past actions by the driver (e.g. he or she prefers games or emailing). This may assist the user in selecting which route option to chose. These recommendations may also be provided while the vehicle is being driven (either by the computer, the user, or both) to the destination.
- the computer may warn or enforce which activities a user may perform during the drive.
- the computer may note with the routing options that a certain routing option does not have a large enough portion or cumulative total time associated with the autonomous mode to perform some task show so that a particular task or activity may be disabled during the proposed route.
- certain features may be disabled by the computer during portions which may require some oversight, semiautonomous driving, or control by the user. This information may be provided to the driver as a notification with the routing options.
- the driver may then select one of the routing options.
- computer 110 may begin to navigate the route according to the control information. Referring to FIG. 10 , if the driver selects routing option 1010 , computer 110 may begin maneuvering vehicle 101 the autonomous mode along Route 1 . In the driver selects routing option 1020 (as actually shown in the example of FIG. 10 ), computer 110 may indicate to the driver that he or she must begin driving in the manual mode along Route 2 .
- Flow diagram 1100 of FIG. 11 is an example of some of the features described above as performed by computer 110 .
- the computer receives user information including a destination at block 1102 .
- the computer then generates a set of proposed routes between a vehicle's current location and the destination at block 1104 .
- the computer For each proposed route, the computer generates corresponding control information at block 1106 .
- the control information includes which portions of a particular route may be maneuvered in a manual mode or an autonomous mode. In some examples, this may also include a semiautonomous mode.
- generating the corresponding control information at block 1106 desirably includes the steps of blocks 1108 through 1112 .
- control factors are input into a set of probabilistic estimations for a plurality of different types of failures along a particular route at block 1108 . Again, these failures refer to times when the vehicle is unable (for safety or other reasons) to maneuver in the autonomous mode.
- the set of probabilistic estimations are then combined into an overall probability of failure along the particular proposed route at block 1110 .
- the overall probability of failure is compared to a threshold value to determine corresponding control information for the particular route at block 1112 .
- These steps may be repeated sequentially or simultaneously for each proposed route of the set of proposed routes.
- the computer generates a corresponding activity suggestion for each proposed route based on the corresponding control information for that proposed route at block 1114 .
- the set of proposed routes, the corresponding control information, and the corresponding activity suggestion as a set of routing options at block 1116 .
- the computer receives user input indicating one of the routing options of the set of routing options at block 1118 .
- the computer maneuvers the vehicle according to the proposed route and corresponding control information for the indicated one of the routing options at block 1120 .
- a route may be selected accordingly.
