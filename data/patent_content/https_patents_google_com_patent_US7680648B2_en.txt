Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to text segmentation and, more particularly, to methods and systems for improving text segmentation.
- Text processing methods and systems exist that attempt to interpret data representing text. Text processing is made more difficult when text comprising a string of characters is received that has no breaks indicating words or other tokens.
- the characters can be segmented into tokens in order to interpret the string. Tokens can be words, acronyms, abbreviations, proper names, geographical names, stock market ticker symbols, or other tokens.
- a string of characters may be segmented into multiple combinations of segmented strings of characters using existing methods and systems.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for improving text segmentation.
- One aspect of one embodiment of the present invention comprises determining at least a first segmented result and a second segmented result from a string of characters, determining a first frequency of occurrence for the first segmented result and a second frequency of occurrence for the second segmented result, and identifying an operable segmented result from the first segmented result and the second segmented result based at least in part on the first frequency of occurrence and the second frequency of occurrence.
- identifying the operable segment from the first segment result and the second segment result based at least in part on the first frequency of occurrence and the second frequency of occurrence can comprise selecting the first segment result if the first frequency of occurrence is greater than the second frequency of occurrence.

- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by one or a combination of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIG. 2 .
- Block 202 the example method begins.
- Block 202 is followed by block 204 , in which a string of characters can be accessed by the segmentation engine 120 .
- a string of characters can be received or accessed from a device connected to network 106 , for example, or from another device.
- the string of characters can be a domain name associated with an inactive or non-existent website received from an advertising server associated with the domain name.
- Block 204 is followed by block 206 , in which a plurality of segmented results is generated from the string of characters by segmenting the string of characters.
- Segmenting the string of characters may include parsing the characters in the string into a plurality of combinations of tokens and can be performed by the segmentation processor 122 .
- the segmentation processor 122 can develop a list of segmentation results. Each segmented result can be a particular combination of tokens or a single token.
- the string of characters “usedrugs” can be segmented into the segmented results including “used rugs”, “use drugs”, “us ed rugs”, “used rugs”, “usedrugs”, etc.
- the unsegmented string of characters may also be included as a segmented result.
- the segmentation processor 122 can utilize tokens from the token database 126 in the segmentation process.
- Various methods can be used to segment the string of characters, such as the segmentation techniques described in PCT International Patent Application No. PCT/US03/41609 entitled “Methods and Systems for Text Segmentation” filed Dec. 30, 2003, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by this reference.
- Block 206 is followed by block 208 , in which the top segmented results are determined.
- the top segmented results can be determined by the segmentation processor 122 and can be the results with the highest probability of being the best or operable segmented result.
- the segmented results can be ranked based on a probability value determined for each segmented result.
- a probability value can be determined at least in part by summing frequency values associated with the individual tokens within each individual segmented result.
- a probability value can be determined by a complex function involving summing the logarithms of the frequency values associated with the individual tokens within each individual result.
- a number of the top ranking segmented results can then be selected. For example, the segmented results can be ranked and the top three results can be selected.
- Block 208 is followed by block 210 , in which a frequency search is performed for the top, selected segmented results.
- the frequency search can be performed by the frequency processor 124 in conjunction with the search engine 156 .
- the segmentation processor 122 can pass the selected segmented results to the frequency processor 124 , which can determine the frequency of occurrence for each of the segmented results in a corpus of articles or search queries.
- the frequency processor 124 can determine the frequency of occurrence for the segmented results based on articles indexed by a search engine 156 . In one embodiment, the frequency processor 124 can send the top selected segmented results to the search engine 156 via the network 106 .
- the search engine 156 can perform a search for each of the segmented results in the indexed articles by using each segmented result as a search query. For example, the frequency processor 124 can send each segmented result surrounded by quotation marks to the search engine 156 as a search query, so that the search engine 156 performs the search on the exact segmented phrase.
- the search engine 156 can generate a search result set containing a number of article identifiers responsive to the search query.
- the search engine 156 can send the search result set for each of the segmented results back to the frequency processor 124 via the network 106 .
- the frequency processor 124 can determine from each search result set, based on the number of article identifiers, the frequency with which each segmented result occurs.
- the frequency processor 124 can send the top, selected segmented results to the indexer 158 via the network 106 .
- the indexer 158 can access the index 160 to determine the number of articles in which a segmented result occurs and can do this for each of the selected segmented results.
- the index 160 may be multiple indexes and the indexer 158 can check a fraction of the total index for each segmented result. The indexer 158 can then pass the number of occurrences associated with each segmented result to the frequency processor 124 via the network 106 .
- the frequency processor 124 can send the top, selected segmented results to the search engine 156 via the network 106 to determine the number of occurrences of the segmented results in search queries.
- the search engine 156 can, for each segmented result, determine the number of times that the segmented result was used by users as an actual search query or part of an actual search query from a search of the logs of search queries.
- the number of occurrences in search queries for each segmented result can be sent by the search engine 156 to the frequency processor 124 via the network 106 .
- the frequency processor 124 can send these segmented results to the search engine 156 .
- the search engine 156 can, for example, use these results as search queries and generate three search result sets. For example, the search engine 156 can use “used rugs” as a search query and determine a search result set for the search query containing article identifiers associated with articles containing the phrase “used rugs”. In another embodiment, the search engine 156 can determine, from associated search logs containing prior received search queries, the number of times search queries containing the segmented results was received.
- the search engine 156 can search its search logs for the number of times a search query containing the phrase “used rugs” was received.
- the indexer 158 of the search engine 156 can receive the search results and determine the number of articles in the index 160 or a portion of the index 160 containing the segmented results.
- the indexer 158 can search through the index 160 or a portion of the index 160 for the number of articles containing “used rugs”.
- a spell-checking function can also be included in the frequency search.
- the frequency processor 124 can include or can call a spell-checking function, so that the top, selected segmented results can be spell checked.
- the spell-checking function can determine correct or preferred spellings for the individual tokens in each segmented result.
- the frequency processor 124 can perform a frequency search on the top segmented results as well as any spelling-corrected segmented results to determine a frequency of occurrence for both results. For example, if a segmented result is “basebal game” and the spelling-corrected result is “baseball game”, a frequency search can be performed for both of these results.
- Block 210 is followed by block 212 , in which the operable segmented result is identified.
- the frequency processor 124 can identify the operable segmented result. For example, the frequency processor 124 can select the segmented result that has the highest associated frequency of occurrence. As explained above, the frequency of occurrence can be a value based on the number of articles or search queries containing the segmented result and the total number of articles or search queries. Additional signals can also be used to determine the operable segmented result. For example, the frequency processor 124 can take into account an objective ranking (such as the PageRankTM ranking algorithm for web articles) of the articles containing each segmented result and use the objective ranking to weigh the articles containing each segmented result. The number of times the segmented result occurs in an article and the location of the segmented result in the articles can also be used to weigh the articles containing a segmented result. In block 214 , the method 200 ends.
- an objective ranking such as the PageRankTM ranking algorithm for web articles
- the operable segmented result can be used in a variety of ways.
- the operable segmented result can be used in the selection of advertisements. For example, a user 112 a may attempt to navigate his browser application to the website “usedrugs.com” by entering this string of characters into the browser application. If no such website exists at the domain name “usedrugs.com”, the user's browser application may be redirected to a third-party website.
- the third-party website may desire to place advertisements and/or links relevant to the domain name entered by the user on a web page being viewed by the user.
- the third-party website can send the domain name “usedrugs.com” to the segmentation engine 120 .
- the segmentation engine 120 can use the methods and systems described above to return an operable segmented result to the third party website or an advertising server associated with the website.
- the operable segmented result can be “used rugs”.
- the third-party website or advertising server can cause the display of advertisements and/or links relevant to the phrase “used rugs” on the web page being viewed by the user.
- the operable segmented result can also be used to optimize content filters used during the generation of search results. For example, a domain name, such as “mikesexpress.com”, can be filtered out of search results by an adult filter, because the word “sex” appears in the string of characters.
- the segmentation engine 120 can be used to determine the operable segmented result for the string of characters “mikesexpress”. If the operable segmented result is determined to be “mikes express”, then the adult filter can use this information to allow an article identifier for the website “mikesexpress.com” to be included in search result sets.
- first and second are used herein merely to differentiate one item from another item.
- the terms first and second are not used to indicate first or second in time, first or second in a list, or other order, unless explicitly noted.
- the “second” may come in time or in a list before the “first”, unless it is otherwise explicitly indicated.
