- Some of the environmental contexts data may be user-specific, such as the location of the user (as determined from the client computer, from a user selection, or other determinations), or the current time or weather at the user's location.
- Other environmental contexts data may not be specific to a user, such as worldwide current events.
- query suggestions such as query rewrites, autocompletions, or both, may be retrieved (block 406 ).
- the query suggestions may be determined from query logs (block 408 ).
- scores for the query rewrites, autocompletions, or both may be retrieved (block 410 ).
- the scores may be previously determined based on analysis of the query logs.
- the scores may provide an indication of the likelihood that a query rewrite or autocomplete is the most popular rewrite or autocomplete for a given search query (e.g., based on the popularity of the query rewrite or autocomplete in the query logs, or the likelihood that a query suggestion is selected by a user when presented to the user).
- the scores for the retrieved query suggestions may be recalculated based on the environmental context data (block 412 ). For example, businesses such as restaurants may have weather-related features, such as terraces, patios, etc.
- a query suggestion that includes the business may be scored, in part, based on the current weather. For example, if the current temperature is above 70° F., the score of query suggestions that include restaurants having patios may be increased.
- the query suggestions may be ranked based on the recalculated scores (block 414 ).
- the scores indicate of the likelihood that a query rewrite or autocomplete is the most popular rewrite or autocomplete for a search query
- query rewrites or autocompletions having higher scores may be ranked above query rewrites or suggestions having lower scores.
- the ranked query rewrites and autocompletions may be provided to a user (block 416 ). For example, the query suggestions may be presented to a user as a user-selectable list.
- a user's selection of a query rewrite or autocomplete may be received (block 418 ) and executed as a search query. Based on this search query, search results may be provided (block 420 ). For example, if a user inputs “how to make peach . . . ” a user may select the autocomplete “how to make peach cobbler” from a list of query suggestions, and results matching this search query may be provided. In another example, if a user inputs “how to make peech tea” a user may select the rewrite “how to make peach tea” from a list of query suggestions, and results matching this search query may be provided.
- a selected query suggestion and its associated environmental context may be stored (block 422 ), such as in the query logs 424 .
- a user's selection of a query suggestion for a particular restaurant may be stored in the log, together with environmental context data such as the temperature and time the selection was made, as well as the restaurant's weather related features (e.g., its patio or terrace).
- the query logs 424 may be used in subsequent query suggestion determinations (block 408 ).
- FIG. 5 depicts a process 500 for scoring query suggestions based on environmental contexts and related features of query suggestions in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Some or all steps of the process 500 may be implemented as executable computer code stored on a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a general purpose computer programmed to execute the code.
- environmental context data may be retrieved, such as from various sources illustrated above in FIG. 4 .
- a query suggestion 504 for a search query, and associated features 506 of the query suggestion 504 may be obtained, such as from query logs used to generate query suggestions.
- a relationship between the environmental context and the associated features 506 may be determined (block 508 ). Such relationships may be stored in a data repository or other structure for retrieval. If a relationship exists between the environmental context and the associated feature of the query suggestion (line 512 ), then the score of the query suggestion may be increased (block 514 ). However, if no relationship exists between the environmental context and the associated feature of the query suggestion (line 516 ), then the process may iterate to the next query suggestion for the search query (block 518 ) without boosting the score for the current query suggestion. For example, if the environmental context is weather, and the query suggestion is not associated with any weather-related features, the score for the query suggestion will not be changed (e.g., increased or decreased) based on the current weather.
- FIG. 6 depicts an example of providing query suggestions based on different search queries in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.
- a process 600 is depicted for proving query suggestions for search query text of “restaurant.”
- the text (“restaurant”) of the search query may be received (block 602 ).
- an environmental context such as the current weather, may be obtained (block 604 ).
- autocompletions may be obtained (block 606 ).
- the autocompletions may be determined from query logs depicting previous queries that included the text “restaurants” (block 608 ). For example, autocompletes may include “restaurant with games,” “restaurant with terrace,” and “restaurant with a view.”
- the scores for the autocompletions may be obtained (block 610 ). As noted above, these scores may be based on the popularity of the suggested search queries as determined from the query logs. The popularity can be measured based on the number of times the suggested search queries were received as search queries regardless of whether they were suggested, or the number of times the suggested search queries were selected when presented as suggested search queries.
- the relationship (if any) between features of the suggested search queries and the environmental context data may be determined (block 612 ). Referring to the example described above, the query suggestion “restaurant with terrace” may be determined to have a relationship with the current weather.
- the scores of the query suggestions may be recalculated. As shown in FIG. 6 , the score of the “restaurant with terrace” query autocomplete may be recalculated (block 614 ) based on the current weather given the relationship between the weather-related feature of “terrace” and the weather. Next, the query autocompletions may be ranked based on the recalculated scores (block 616 ). The ranked query autocompletions may be provided for selection by a user (block 618 ). As shown in FIG.
- the query autocompletions may be ranked in the following order: “Restaurant with terrace”; “Restaurant with a view”; and “Restaurant with games.”
- the query autocomplete “Restaurant with terrace” may be ranked first after recalculating the scores of the query autocompletions.
- a selection of a query autocomplete e.g., “restaurant with terrace,” may be received (block 620 ).
- Query results may be provided (block 622 ) based on the selected search query of “restaurant with terrace.”
- the selection and associated environmental context may be stored in the query logs 626 to provide feedback to the query autocomplete determinations.
- the selected query autocomplete of “restaurant with terrace” and the current weather may be stored (block 624 ), such as in the query logs (block 626 ). The selection may thus increase popularity of the query autocomplete “restaurant with terrace” for the environmental context of current weather.
- a search query of “fan” may be entered by a user.
- an environmental context of current events may be obtained from a news service and may include, for example, the “Super Bowl.”
- Query suggestions for the query “fan” may include a query autocomplete of “fan fiction,” and a query autocomplete of “fan of New York Giants”). Based on the environmental context, the query suggestion score for the query suggestions “fan of New York Giants” may be increased.

- As discussed in more detail below, provided in some embodiments are systems, methods, and computer-readable media for providing query rewrites and autocompletions based on environmental contexts, such as the current time, the current weather, social networking recommendations, the presence at a location of a contact associated with the user, current events, or other contexts. After a user submits a query, the query is received from the user and environmental context data is retrieved. Next query suggestions, such as query rewrites and autocompletions, are retrieved from a query suggestion repository, and scores for each query suggestion are retrieved. Next, the scores are recalculated based on the environmental context data. The recalculation may be based on an association between a query suggestion and the environmental context data, such that query suggestions having such an association have a higher score after the recalculation. The associations may include, for example, a predetermined relationship between an environmental context and a query suggestion, a comparison between the environmental context and the query suggestion (e.g., a string comparison between terms of the query suggestion and the environmental context data), or other associations.
- The query suggestions may be ranked based on the recalculated scores for the query suggestions. Thus, the query rewrites or autocompletions having associations with environmental contexts may have relatively higher scores and may be ranked above the query rewrites or suggestions having relatively lower scores. The ranked query suggestions are then provided for selection by a user.

FIG. 1 depicts asystem 100 for receiving and processing a search query in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , thesystem 100 may include aclient computer 102 of auser 104. Theuser 104 may interact with the client computer to input search queries and perform computer-based searches. Theclient computer 102 may be in communication withservers 106 over anetwork 108, such that theclient computer 102 may transmit data to and receive data from theservers 106. In some embodiments, theclient computer 102 may include thick-clients, thin-clients, or both. Theclient computer 102 may be, for example, computers, such smartphones, tablet computers, laptop computers, desktop computers, etc. In some embodiments, thesystem 100 may includemultiple clients 102. Theservers 106 may include a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Theservers 106 may include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. Theservers 106 may be, for example, computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. Such configurations may use thenetwork 108 for communication or may communicate over other networks. Thenetwork 108 may include any suitable network, such as the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or any other suitable network. - The
servers 106 may include a geographic information system (GIS), a search engine, web services, or any combination of these systems. The servers may accessdata repositories 110. As described further below, thedata repositories 110 may include, for example,query suggestions 112 andenvironmental context data 114. In some embodiments, theservers 106 may include thedata repositories 110, or the one or more of the data repositories may be stored on separate servers. In such embodiments, theclient computer 102 may transmit asearch query 116 to theservers 106. For example, theclient computer 102 may present a search web page or an interactive map to a user, and the user may input a search query on thecomputer 102 to perform the search. After receiving the inputted query, thecomputer 102 may transmit thequery 116 to theservers 106. - The
servers 106 may receive and process thesearch query 116. As described further below, theservers 106 may provide query suggestions, such as query rewrites, query autocompletions, or both, based on thequery 116. As described below, the query suggestions for the query may be determined from thequery suggestions 112 andenvironmental context data 114. After determining query suggestions, theservers 106 transmit the query suggestions to theclient computer 102 for selection by theuser 104. Upon selection of a query suggestion, such as a query rewrite or autocomplete, theservers 106 receive the selection and provide search results based on the selected query suggestion. Theservers 106 may send a response containing the data responsive to the query (i.e., search results) to theclient computer 102. - The search query may include one, two, three, four, or any number of terms in various arrangements. Each term may have one or more characters. As explained below, a query suggestion may be an automatic completion (“autocompletion”) of the query or a rewrite of the query. For example, an autocompletion may add one or more characters or one or more terms to the query. A query rewrite may rewrite a query by replacing one or more terms of the query, e.g., with synonymous terms, or adding synonymous terms to the query.

FIG. 2 depicts aprocess 200 for selecting and refining query suggestions based on environmental context in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 200 may be implemented as executable computer code stored on a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a general purpose computer programmed to execute the code. As described above,search query text 202 is received, such as from theclient computer 102. Thesearch query text 202 may include a portion of a query, such as one or more characters, one or more terms (e.g., phrases), etc. The search query text may include an entire query having one or more characters, one or more terms (e.g., a phrase), etc. Based on thesearch query text 202, query suggestions 204 (e.g., rewrites or autocompletions) may be determined and provided to theclient computer 102. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , the determination ofquery suggestions 204 may be based on query logs 206 andenvironmental contexts data 208. The query logs 206 may include logs of previously executed queries previously submitted by users. A set ofquery suggestions 204 can be retrieved from the query logs 206 based on the receivedquery text 202. For example, the set of query suggestions can consist of all previously submitted queries in query log 206 that match the receivedquery text 202. Alternatively, the set of query suggestions can consist of previously submitted queries that match the received query and that were previously submitted more than a threshold number of times or at an average rate that is greater than a threshold rate. Thequery suggestions 204 may be scored based on information in the query logs (e.g., the number of times the query suggestion was previously received) and the score of each query suggestion can be further based on theenvironmental context data 208. - Next, after providing the query suggestions to a user, a
selection 210 of a query suggestion may be received. For example, multiple autocompletions may be presented to a user, and the user may select one of the autocompletions to complete the query text and execute a search query. Similarly, multiple query rewrites may be presented to a user, and the user may select one of the query rewrites to replace some or all of the query text and execute a search query. In some embodiments, both query rewrites and autocompletions may be provided to a user, and the user may select from among both query rewrites and autocompletions. Search results 212 may then be provided to a user based on the search query from the selected search suggestion. - Additionally, a feedback mechanism may be provided to refine the query suggestions provided to a user for a search query. After a user selects a query suggestion, the selection and the associated
environmental context 214 for the query may be stored in the query logs 206. Thus, as users make various selections of query suggestions that are based on specific environmental contexts, the query text, environmental context, and selected query suggestion may be stored in the logs. Accordingly, subsequent selection of query suggestions for the search query text, environmental context, or both may be based on previously selected search suggestions for the query text, environmental context, or both. -
FIG. 3 depicts a schematic diagram 300 illustrating the retrieval ofenvironmental context data 302 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some embodiments may include some or all of the environmental context data shown inFIG. 3 and described below, whereas other embodiments may include additional environmental context data not shown inFIG. 3 . The illustrated functional blocks shown inFIG. 3 may be implemented on multiple systems and computers, and some of the functional blocks may be implemented on the same system and/or computer. Theenvironmental contexts data 302 may be stored in any suitable data structure, such as one or more databases or other data repositories. Thecontext data 302 may be provided and retrieved from user device, such as user's computer, or other computers or devices (e.g., via the “cloud”). - In some embodiments, the current time 306 (at a user's location) may be retrieved from a
time function 304. For example, a user's location, such as determined from IP address geolocation or other location determinations, may be used by thetime function 304 to determinecurrent time 306. In some embodiments, the user's time zone (such as the time zone setting on the user's computer) may be obtained and thetime function 304 may determine thecurrent time 306 in the time zone. Thecurrent time 306 may be provided asenvironmental contexts data 302 for processing the query suggestions, as described further herein. - In some embodiments, the current weather 308 (e.g., the weather at a user's location) may be retrieved from
weather data 310. Theweather data 310 may be obtained from a weather data service. For example, theweather data 310 for a location may be obtained in real-time based on queries to a weather data service. Thecurrent weather 308 may include any number of indicia of the current weather. For example, thecurrent weather 308 may include temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, wind gust, precipitation, or any other indicia. Thecurrent weather 308, including some or all weather indicia, may be provided asenvironmental contexts data 302. - In some embodiments, the
environmental context data 302 may include social networking recommendations 312. The social networking recommendations may be based on a user's social graph, as retrieved from asocial networking service 314. The recommendations 312 may include recommendations for businesses and services such as restaurants, stores, bars, home repair, auto repair, etc. and public places such as parks, libraries. Thesocial networking service 314 may include a social graph for a user, such as a group of contacts having a relationship with the user in the social networking service. The social graph of thesocial networking service 314 may be symmetric or asymmetric. The recommendations from the contacts in a user's social graph may be retrieved and provided asenvironmental context data 302. Accordingly, because the recommendations are determined from a user's social graph, they may be of particular interest to the user and may be used to generate or promote query suggestions. - Additionally, in some embodiments, the
current location 316 of a user's social contacts, e.g., as determined from a location-basedservice 318, may be included in theenvironmental context data 302. In such embodiments, the location-basedservice 318 may provide indications of the presence (e.g., “check-in”) or absence (e.g., “check-out”) of the user's social contacts at a given entity. For example, upon arrival at an entity such as a restaurant, store, bar, etc., a user's social contact may check-in using the location-basedservice 318. Similarly, upon departure from the entity the user's social contact may check-out using the location-basedservice 318. The check-ins and check-outs indicate the social contact's presence or absence at the entity. When query suggestions are determined, the current locations of a user's social contacts may be provided as environmental context data 302 (e.g., to boost query suggestions related to those locations). - Moreover, in some embodiments,
current events 320 may be provided as environmental context data. Thecurrent events 320 may be provided as various keywords or other descriptive terms, and may include, for example, sporting events, natural disasters, political events, technology events such as product releases or product announcements, etc. In some embodiments, thecurrent events 320 may be specific to a user's location, such as a user's city, state or province, or country. In other embodiments, thecurrent events 320 may be worldwide, and independent of a user's location. Thecurrent events 320 may be retrieved from anews service 322. Thenews service 322 may provide a ranked list of the top current events at a specific date and time, and/or for a particular place and time. -
FIG. 4 depicts aprocess 400 for providing query suggestions based on environmental context data in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 400 may be implemented as executable computer code stored on a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a general purpose computer programmed to execute the code. Initially, as described above, a query may be obtained (block 402). As mentioned above, a user may input a search query into a client computer, and the query may be transmitted over a network to a server. Next, environmental context data may be retrieved (block 404). As described above, the environmental data may include various environmental contexts, such as current time, current weather, current events, social networking recommendations, etc. Some of the environmental contexts data may be user-specific, such as the location of the user (as determined from the client computer, from a user selection, or other determinations), or the current time or weather at the user's location. Other environmental contexts data may not be specific to a user, such as worldwide current events. - Next, query suggestions, such as query rewrites, autocompletions, or both, may be retrieved (block 406). As explained above, the query suggestions may be determined from query logs (block 408). Additionally, scores for the query rewrites, autocompletions, or both may be retrieved (block 410). The scores may be previously determined based on analysis of the query logs. In some embodiments, the scores may provide an indication of the likelihood that a query rewrite or autocomplete is the most popular rewrite or autocomplete for a given search query (e.g., based on the popularity of the query rewrite or autocomplete in the query logs, or the likelihood that a query suggestion is selected by a user when presented to the user).
- Next, the scores for the retrieved query suggestions may be recalculated based on the environmental context data (block 412). For example, businesses such as restaurants may have weather-related features, such as terraces, patios, etc. A query suggestion that includes the business may be scored, in part, based on the current weather. For example, if the current temperature is above 70° F., the score of query suggestions that include restaurants having patios may be increased.
- Next, the query suggestions may be ranked based on the recalculated scores (block 414). In embodiments for which the scores indicate of the likelihood that a query rewrite or autocomplete is the most popular rewrite or autocomplete for a search query, query rewrites or autocompletions having higher scores may be ranked above query rewrites or suggestions having lower scores. Next, the ranked query rewrites and autocompletions may be provided to a user (block 416). For example, the query suggestions may be presented to a user as a user-selectable list.
- Next, a user's selection of a query rewrite or autocomplete may be received (block 418) and executed as a search query. Based on this search query, search results may be provided (block 420). For example, if a user inputs “how to make peach . . . ” a user may select the autocomplete “how to make peach cobbler” from a list of query suggestions, and results matching this search query may be provided. In another example, if a user inputs “how to make peech tea” a user may select the rewrite “how to make peach tea” from a list of query suggestions, and results matching this search query may be provided.
- As mentioned above, selected query suggestions and associated environmental contexts may be logged to provide feedback for subsequent query suggestions. A selected query suggestion and its associated environmental context may be stored (block 422), such as in the query logs 424. For example, in the example discussed above, a user's selection of a query suggestion for a particular restaurant may be stored in the log, together with environmental context data such as the temperature and time the selection was made, as well as the restaurant's weather related features (e.g., its patio or terrace). The query logs 424 may be used in subsequent query suggestion determinations (block 408).
- As described above, the recalculation of scores for various query suggestions may be based on environmental contexts and features of the query suggestion. For example, as explained above, query suggestions that include restaurants may be scored based on a relationship between the weather-related features of the restaurants and the current weather.
FIG. 5 depicts aprocess 500 for scoring query suggestions based on environmental contexts and related features of query suggestions in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 500 may be implemented as executable computer code stored on a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a general purpose computer programmed to execute the code. Initially, as described above, environmental context data may be retrieved, such as from various sources illustrated above inFIG. 4 . Additionally, aquery suggestion 504 for a search query, and associatedfeatures 506 of thequery suggestion 504, may be obtained, such as from query logs used to generate query suggestions. - Next a relationship between the environmental context and the associated features 506 may be determined (block 508). Such relationships may be stored in a data repository or other structure for retrieval. If a relationship exists between the environmental context and the associated feature of the query suggestion (line 512), then the score of the query suggestion may be increased (block 514). However, if no relationship exists between the environmental context and the associated feature of the query suggestion (line 516), then the process may iterate to the next query suggestion for the search query (block 518) without boosting the score for the current query suggestion. For example, if the environmental context is weather, and the query suggestion is not associated with any weather-related features, the score for the query suggestion will not be changed (e.g., increased or decreased) based on the current weather.
-
FIG. 6 depicts an example of providing query suggestions based on different search queries in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Beginning withFIG. 6 , aprocess 600 is depicted for proving query suggestions for search query text of “restaurant.” Initially, the text (“restaurant”) of the search query may be received (block 602). Next, an environmental context, such as the current weather, may be obtained (block 604). Based on the text of the search query, autocompletions may be obtained (block 606). The autocompletions may be determined from query logs depicting previous queries that included the text “restaurants” (block 608). For example, autocompletes may include “restaurant with games,” “restaurant with terrace,” and “restaurant with a view.” - Next, the scores for the autocompletions may be obtained (block 610). As noted above, these scores may be based on the popularity of the suggested search queries as determined from the query logs. The popularity can be measured based on the number of times the suggested search queries were received as search queries regardless of whether they were suggested, or the number of times the suggested search queries were selected when presented as suggested search queries. Next, the relationship (if any) between features of the suggested search queries and the environmental context data may be determined (block 612). Referring to the example described above, the query suggestion “restaurant with terrace” may be determined to have a relationship with the current weather.
- Based on the relationships found between the environmental context and features of the query suggestions, the scores of the query suggestions may be recalculated. As shown in
FIG. 6 , the score of the “restaurant with terrace” query autocomplete may be recalculated (block 614) based on the current weather given the relationship between the weather-related feature of “terrace” and the weather. Next, the query autocompletions may be ranked based on the recalculated scores (block 616). The ranked query autocompletions may be provided for selection by a user (block 618). As shown inFIG. 6 , the query autocompletions may be ranked in the following order: “Restaurant with terrace”; “Restaurant with a view”; and “Restaurant with games.” The query autocomplete “Restaurant with terrace” may be ranked first after recalculating the scores of the query autocompletions. - Next, a selection of a query autocomplete, e.g., “restaurant with terrace,” may be received (block 620). Query results may be provided (block 622) based on the selected search query of “restaurant with terrace.” Additionally, as described above, the selection and associated environmental context may be stored in the query logs 626 to provide feedback to the query autocomplete determinations. Thus, the selected query autocomplete of “restaurant with terrace” and the current weather may be stored (block 624), such as in the query logs (block 626). The selection may thus increase popularity of the query autocomplete “restaurant with terrace” for the environmental context of current weather.
- In another example, a search query of “fan” may be entered by a user.
