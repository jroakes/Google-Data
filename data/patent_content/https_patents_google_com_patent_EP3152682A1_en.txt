- a dynamic current result may be one that is not simply looked up in a lookup table but, rather, is provided based on a current search that is conducted at or about the time that a user views the related content on the first device.
- a content service may be any service configured to provide content (e.g., media, news, entertainment, sport, etc.).
- a content service may be a media content provider that provides various media content (e.g., movies, TV shows, documentaries, etc.) to users that subscribe to the content service.
- the content service may be configured to respond to queries and/or to make recommendations based on user preferences or history.
- a knowledge base may be contain or use semantic-search information gathered from various sources.
- a knowledge base may enable users to use the information contained in the knowledge base to resolve queries without having to navigate to other sources and assemble information themselves.
- a dynamic current result provided by a search engine, content service, knowledge base, or the like may be based on the analysis of a website, forum, social media outlet, application, or the like.
- the analysis may be based on a search frequency, search recency, trend or search or the like.
- search frequency a search threshold may be used to determine whether a given content should be provided as a dynamic current result. If the number of searches that result in the given content exceeds, for example, 30 hits per hour, then the content may be eligible to be provide as a dynamic current result.
- a recency threshold may be used to determine whether a given content should be provided as a dynamic current result. If the number of searches within a given amount of time, for example, the past 30 minutes, exceeds 5 searches, then the content may be provided as a dynamic current result.
- a trend threshold may be used to determine whether a given content should be provided as a dynamic current result. If the change in number of searches for a given content is above, for example, 4 searches an hour such that for a first hour there may be 10 searches and for a subsequent hour there may be 14 searches (i.e., an increase of 4 searches per hour), then the content may be provided as a dynamic current result.
- the analysis may be based on an update frequency or an update recency.
- an update frequency threshold may be used to determine whether a given content should be provided as a dynamic current result. If the amount of times that a given content or content host (e.g., website, forum, social media outlet, application, etc.) has been updated within a time period such that the amount of times exceeds the update threshold then the content may be eligible as a dynamic current content. As a more specific example, if the update threshold is 3 updates a day and the number of times a given content host is updated is 4 times in a day, then the content on the content host may be eligible to be provided as a dynamic current result.
- an update recency threshold may be used to determine whether a given content should be provided as a dynamic current result. If the recency that a given content or content has been updated within a time period such that the time the content or content host was updated is below the threshold, then the content may be eligible as a dynamic current content. As a more specific example, if the update threshold is 3 hours and content host is updated 2 hours prior to a current time, then the content on the content host may be eligible to be provided as a dynamic current result.
- a dynamic current result may be based on one or more user selections or based on a user's historical usage.
- a user selection may be the selection of content by a user via any device such as the user's mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, television, set top box, or the like.
- a user may be viewing a first content on her television at a first time. Based on the user's viewing, she may be provided with information, on her phone, about the actors on the television. The user may select the content on her phone. Based on the selection, subsequent content that correspond to actors within a content may be candidates for dynamic current content as the user may be more likely to select this category of content during future use.
- a user's historical usage may correspond to a user's search history, preferred content, profile, or the like. As an example, a user may frequently visit websites about historical events. Based on this information, content that corresponds to historical events may be a candidate for dynamic current result.
- a dynamic current result may be based on a user type.
- a user type may correspond to a user demographic, a user experience, a user skill level or the like.
- a user type may be based on the user's being a highly technological user. Based on this designation, content that requires a user to interact in a technological manner may be a candidate for a dynamic current content. More specifically, for example, a content may require a user to change her mobile phone settings from silent to loud in order to experience the content. If a user type for the user is determined to be a highly technological user, then that content may be a candidate for a dynamic current result.
- a dynamic current result may be selected based on the selection of the dynamic current result by one or more other users.
- the selection of the dynamic current result by one or more other users may indicate that users of a media item are generally interested in that dynamic current result while viewing the media item or portion of the media item.
- a user A may be provided with a button to view the biography for an actor that is currently on her television screen. User A may select the button and view the biography.
- a user B may be viewing the same scene on her television screen and may be provided with a button to view the same biography of the same actor, based on the selection of the button by user A.
- the selection of a dynamic current result by a user may result in updating a database such that the dynamic current result is more likely to be provided to a subsequent user that views the same content.
- a safety rating of a dynamic current result may be determined and the dynamic current result may only be provided to a user if the safety rating is below a safety threshold.
- the safety threshold may be set by a user or may be determined based on a user's age or preferences. As an example, a parent may set the safety threshold on her child's phone to be a secure threshold.
- a dynamic current result containing profanity may be identified as a candidate result to be provided to the user.
- the safety rating of the dynamic current result may be determined to be unsecure. Accordingly, the dynamic current result containing the profanity may not be provided to the child.
- a user may opt to be exposed to dynamic current results.
- a user may opt to be exposed to dynamic current results by selecting an option on the user's device, requesting dynamic current content, or the like.
- a user may access a settings menu on her mobile device and select a button
- a database may be updated such that dynamic current results are provided to the user based on the database entry.
- both recency of update and update frequency may be used to determine which dynamic current content is to be provided to a user. More specifically, according to this example, a content that only meets the threshold for update recency may not be provided to a user if the same content does not also meet the update frequency threshold.
- a dynamic content result may be provided to a user on a second device.
- the second device may be any device that is distinct from the device that outputs a media content.
- the second device may be a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, computer, external screen, or the like.
- a second device may be any device that a user has access to while being exposed to content on a first device such that receiving dynamic current content on the second device does not directly interfere with the user being exposed to content on the first device.
- dynamic content to provide to a user on a second device may be determined by either the first device or the second device.
- the first or second device may have access to the dynamic content via accessing a storage, a database, a network, a cloud entity, or the like.
