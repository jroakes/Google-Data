Definitions
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, such as image files, audio files, video files, and web pages.
- a search system can identify resources in response to queries submitted by users and provide information about the resources in a manner that is useful to the users. The users can navigate through, e.g., click on, search results to acquire information of interest.
- This specification relates to supporting querying and predictions.
- Implementations of the present disclosure are generally directed to user-specific structured graphs that can be used to support queries submitted by users and/or predictions relevant to users. More particularly, implementations of the present disclosure are directed to providing a user-specific structured graph that is specific to a particular user. Implementations of the present disclosure are further directed to using the user- specific structured graph to provide results in response to one or more queries submitted by the user, and/or to surface data that might be relevant to the user.
- innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include actions of receiving user-specific content, the user-specific content being associated with a user of one or more computer-implemented services, processing the user-specific content using one or more parsers to identify one or more entities and one or more relationships between entities, a parser being specific to a schema, and the one or more entities and the one or more relationships between entities being identified based on the schema, providing one or more user-specific knowledge graphs, a user-specific knowledge graph being specific to the user and including nodes and edges between nodes to define relationships between entities based on the schema, and storing the one or more user-specific knowledge graphs.
- Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- providing one or more user-specific knowledge graphs includes determining that a node representing an entity of the one or more entities and an edge representing a relationship associated with the entity are absent from a user-specific knowledge graph, and adding the node and the edge to the user-specific knowledge graph, the edge connecting the node to another node of the user-specific knowledge graph;
- actions further include: receiving a query, receiving one or more user-specific results that are responsive to the query, the one or more user-specific results being provided based on the one or more user-specific knowledge graphs, and providing the one or more user- specific results for display to the user; an edge is associated with a weight, the weight indicating a relevance of a relationship represented by the edge; a value of the weight increases based on reinforcement of the relationship in subsequent user-specific content; a value of the weight decreases based on lack of reinforcement of the relationship in subsequent user-specific content; a plurality of user-specific knowledge graphs are provided based on the user-specific content, each user-specific knowledge graph being specific to a respective schema; and the user-specific content is provided through use of the one or more computer-implemented services by the user.
- Implementations of the present disclosure enable knowledge about individual users to be captured in a structured manner, enabling results to be provided in response to complex queries, e.g., series of queries, regarding a user.
- the user-specific knowledge graph provides a single canonical representation of the user based on user activity inferred from one or more computer-implemented services.
- user activities could be overlapping, where reconciliation of the user-specific knowledge graph ensures a canonical entry is provided for each activity.
- implementations of the present disclosure joins/integrates utility of a universal knowledge graph, e.g., non-user-specific knowledge graph, and user-specific knowledge graphs.
- user information may be collected or used by the systems discussed here, or the systems discussed here may make use of users information
- users may be given an opportunity to control whether the user information, e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location, is collected, and to control whether and/or how to receive content that may be more relevant to the user.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

- the user-specific knowledge graphs can be used to support querying and predictions.
- the user-specific knowledge graph is provided based on content that is associated with the user.
- the user-specific knowledge graph includes a plurality of nodes and edges between nodes.
- a node represents an entity and an edge represents a relationship between entities.
- Nodes and/or entities of a user-specific knowledge graph can be provided based on the content associated with a respective user, to which the user-specific knowledge graph is specific.
- the user-specific knowledge graph can be provided based on one or more schemas.
- a schema describes how data is structured in the user-specific knowledge graph. Implementations of the present disclosure are discussed in further detail herein with reference to an example schema. It is appreciated, however, that implementations of the present disclosure can be realized using any appropriate schema, and/or multiple schemas.
- a schema defines a structure for information provided in the graph. In this manner, a downstream system, e.g., a search system such as the search system 120, a prediction system, can engage the user-specific knowledge graph based on the schema.
- a domain includes one or more types that share a namespace.
- a namespace is provided as a directory of uniquely named objects, where each object in the namespace has a unique name, e.g., identifier.
- a type denotes an "is a" relationship about a topic, and is used to hold a collection of properties.
- a topic represents an entity, such as a person, place or thing.
- each topic can have one or more types associated therewith.
- a property is associated with a topic and defines a "has a" relationship between the topic and a value of the property.
- the value of the property can include another topic.
- the user-specific knowledge graph can be provided based on content associated with a respective user.
- the content is processed by one or more parsers to populate the user- specific structured graph.
- each parser is specific to a particular schema.
- the content can be processed to provide one or more nodes and/or one or more edges between nodes.
- the content can be processed to add one or more nodes to a user-specific structured graph.
- the content can be processed to add one or more edges between nodes that are already present in the user-specific structured graph.
- content associated with the user can be provided from one or more computer-implemented services.
- the user can be a user of one or more computer-implemented services.
- Example computer- implemented services can include a search service, an electronic mail service, a chat service, a document sharing service, a calendar sharing service, a photo sharing service, a video sharing service, blogging service, a micro-blogging service, a social networking service, a location (location-aware) service, a check-in service and a ratings and review service.
- the content can be provided based on the user's use of one or more of the computer-implemented services.
- the user can send and/or receive electronic mail messages using the electronic mail messages.
- the user can receive and/or distribute posts using the social networking service.
- an edge can be associated with a respective weight.
- the weight indicates a relative strength in the relationship between nodes.
- the weight can be determined based on the content associated with the user, which content underlies provision of the user-specific knowledge graph. For example, the content can provide a single instance of a relationship between nodes, or the content can provide multiple instances of a relationship between nodes.
- an edge that is provided based on a single instance can have a weight that is less than the weight of an edge that is provided based on multiple instances.
- the weight can be within a range that can be defined between and including a minimum value, e.g., 0, and a maximum value, e.g., 1.
- the weight can be dynamic, such that the weight can vary over time based on content associated with the user.
- the weight can be provided based on content associated with the user at a first time.
- the weight can vary based on content or a lack of content associated with the user at a second time.
- the content at the first time can indicate a relationship between nodes. Consequently, an edge between the nodes can be provided and a respective weight can be provided at a first value.
- the second time it can be determined that further content associated with the user, e.g., content that was provided after the first time, indicates another instance of the relationship between the nodes. Consequently, the weight can be increased from the first value to a second value.
- the weight can be decreased from the first value to a second value.
- the weight can decay over time, if the relationship is not reinforced through additional instances in content associated with the user.
- the weight can decay to the minimum value, e.g., 0.
- the edge still remains between the nodes. That is, although the relevance of a particular relationship represented by the edge may become less over time, the existence of the relationship is still a fact that remains over time.
- a plurality of user-specific knowledge graphs can be provided for a particular user.
- each user-specific knowledge graph is specific to a particular schema, e.g., the example schema discussed above.
- content that is associated with the user can be processed to provide a first user-specific knowledge graph that is based on a first schema, and to provide a second user-specific knowledge graph that is based on a second schema.
- the multiple user-specific knowledge graphs based on respective schemas can be provided based on the same content.
- the user-specific knowledge graph represents knowledge about a specific user in a structured manner. That is, the user-specific knowledge graph represents at least a portion of the user's world through content associated with the user through one or more computer-implemented services.
- the knowledge captured in the user-specific knowledge graph can include various aspects of the user's world including, for example, activities, films, food, social connections, e.g., real-world and/or virtual, education, general likes, and general dislikes among many other aspects.
- a user-specific knowledge graph can be distinguished from a user-specific social graph.
- a user-specific social graph can represent social connections between the user and other users, or entities.
- a social graph can refer to a single social graph or multiple interconnected social graphs. Distinct social graphs can be generated for different types of connections a user has. For example, a user can be connected with chat contacts in one social graph, electronic message contacts in a second social graph, and connections (or contacts) from a particular social networking service in a third social graph.
- Each social graph can include edges to additional individuals or entities at higher degrees of separation from the user. These contacts can in turn have additional contacts at another degree of separation from the user.
- a user's connection to someone in a particular social network can then be used to identify additional connections based on that person's connections.
- the user-specific knowledge graph represents the user as a whole and can include aspects of the user's world in addition to social connections.
- the user-specific knowledge graph can provide further knowledge regarding the user and their social connections, e.g., activities done together, likes in common, dislikes in common, which knowledge is not captured in a social graph.
- FIG. 2 depicts an example environment 200 to provide user-specific knowledge graphs.
- the environment 200 includes a user-specific knowledge graph engine 202, a data store 204, e.g., the data store 132 of FIG. 1, and one or more data sources 206.
- the user-specific knowledge graph engine 202 can receive content associated with particular users 210, which content can be provided from one or more of the one or more data sources 206.
- the user-specific knowledge graph engine 202 can be provided in the user-specific knowledge graph system 130 of FIG. 1.
- each data source 206 is specific to a particular computer-implemented service.
- a data source 206 can be associated with a search service, e.g., provided by the search system 120 of FIG. 1.
- a data source can be associated with a computer-implemented social networking service.
- the user-specific knowledge graph engine 202 receives content from one or more of the data sources 206 based on an identifier associated with the user 210.
- the user 210 can be associated with an identifier, which uniquely identifies the user 210 to each of the computer-implemented services.
- the user-specific knowledge graph engine 202 receives content from the one or more data sources 206 based on the identifier.
- content associated with the particular user 210 can be identified within a data source 206, and that content can be provided to the user-specific engine.
- the user-specific knowledge graph engine 202 provides one or more parsers to provide respective user graphs for the particular user 210.
- each parser can be specific to a schema.
- a parser processes content received form the one or more data sources 206 to identify entities and/or relationships between entities based on a respective schema. Nodes and/or edges of a user-specific knowledge graph can be provided based on identified entities and relationships between entities.
- a user-specific knowledge graph for the particular user and the particular schema is already available. Consequently, newly identified entities and/or relationships between entities can be used to revise the already existing user-specific schema, e.g., already stored in the data store 204. For example, it can be determined that multiple entities and a relationship between the multiple entities that have been identified from content associated with the user are already represented in the user-specific knowledge graph, e.g., as nodes and an edge. Consequently, a weight associated with the relationship can be increased, e.g., assuming that the weight is not already at a maximum value.
- multiple entities and a relationship between the multiple entities can be identified from content associated with the user, and it can be determined that an entity of the multiple entities is already represented in the user-specific knowledge graph, e.g., as an existing node. Consequently, a new node can be added to the user-specific knowledge graph to represent another entity of the multiple entities, and an edge between the new node and the existing node can be provided to represent the relationship between the multiple entities.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example portion 300 of an example user-specific knowledge graph. More particularly, the example portion 300 of FIG. 3 can be provided based on the example content, as discussed in detail below.

- respective weights can be associated with each of the edges 330, 332, 334, 336.
- each weight can be assigned a default value, e.g., 0.5.
- the user can post the example post "We had a great time playing tennis with our kids today! to a computer- implemented social networking service, and the post can be associated with geo-location data indicating Mountain View, CA.
- the post can be determined that nodes representing tennis, Mountain View, family and children, as well as respective edges between the nodes are already provided. Consequently, new nodes and/or edges are not added to the example portion 300.
- the example post reinforces the relevance of the various entities and the relationships between the entities to the particular user. Consequently, the respective weights associated with the edges 330, 332, 334, 336 can be incremented, e.g., from 0.5 to 0.6.

- An edge 344 can be provided and represents a "/Vacation/Timing" relationship between the nodes 312, 316.
- respective weights can be associated with each of the edges 338, 340, 342, 344. For example, each weight can be assigned a default value, e.g., 0.5.
- the user can submit the example search query [kids tennis lessons in waikiki] to a search service.
- the example search query reinforces the relevance of the various entities and the relationships between the entities to the particular user. Consequently, the respective weights associated with the edges can be incremented.
- the example search query provides a relationship between the tennis entity and the Waikiki entity. Consequently, an edge 346 can be added and represents a relationship "/Location/Played_In" between the nodes 302, 314.
- the user can receive an electronic message from a tennis club, which electronic message can include "Confirming tennis lessons at The Club of Tennis, Waikiki, HI.”
- electronic message can include "Confirming tennis lessons at The Club of Tennis, Waikiki, HI.”
- it can be determined that that nodes representing tennis, and Waikiki, for example, as well as a respective edge between the nodes are already provided. Consequently, new nodes and/or edges are not added to the example portion 300.
- the example electronic message reinforces the relevance of the various entities and the relationships between the entities to the particular user.
- a respective weight associated with the edge 346 can be incremented.

- the user-specific knowledge graph system 130 can process the user-specific content using one or more parsers to identify one or more entities and/or one or more relationships.
- each parser of the one or more parsers is specific to a schema.
- the user-specific knowledge graph system 130 can determine whether one or more entities and/or one or more relationships have been identified from the user-specific content based on the processing. If it is determined that one or more entities and/or one or more relationships have not been identified, the example process 400 loops back to receive further user- specific content, or to wait for further user-specific content.
- the user-specific knowledge graph system 130 can determine that a user-specific knowledge graph does not yet exist for the particular user and, consequently, existing one or more nodes and/or existing one or more edges that respectively represent the identified one or more entities and/or one or more relationships are not provided.
- the user-specific knowledge graph system 130 can determine that, although, a user-specific knowledge graph does exist for the particular user, existing one or more nodes and/or existing one or more edges that respectively represent at least some of the identified one or more entities and/or one or more relationships are not provided. If it is determined that existing one or more nodes and/or existing one or more edges that respectively represent the identified one or more entities and/or one or more relationships are provided, one or more weights respectively associated with one or more edges can be revised (408). In some examples, a weight can be incremented in response to reinforcement of an existing edge between existing nodes through the user-specific content.
- respective one or more nodes and/or one or more edges are provided (410).
- the user-specific content system 130 can add one or more edges and/or one or more nodes to an existing user-specific knowledge graph to represent one or more entities and/or one or more relationships that were identified from the user-specific content, but were not represented in the existing user-specific knowledge graph.
- One or more weights are assigned (412).
- the user-specific knowledge graph system can assign weights to newly added one or more edges. In some examples, a default weight can be assigned.

- the compound user-specific knowledge graph provides a single representation of multiple user-specific knowledge graphs.
- a first user-specific knowledge graph can include a node representing a first entity, a node representing a second entity and an edge between the nodes representing a relationship between the entities. The edge can be provided based on a first schema that the first user-specific knowledge graph is specific to.
- a second user-specific knowledge graph can include a node representing the first entity, a node representing the second entity and an edge between the nodes representing the relationship between the entities.
- the edge can be provided based on a second schema that the first user-specific knowledge graph is specific to, the second schema being different from the first schema.
- a compound user-specific knowledge graph can be provided to represent the first user-specific knowledge graph and the second user-specific knowledge graph.
- the compound user-specific knowledge graph can include a node representing the first entity, a node representing the second entity, a first edge between the nodes representing the relationship between the entities based on the first schema, and a second edge between the nodes representing the relationship between the entities based on the second schema.
- the compound user-specific knowledge graph can include multiple edges between nodes, each edge being based on a respective schema.
- Implementations of the present disclosure are further directed to using the user- specific knowledge graph to provide results in response to one or more queries submitted by a user, and/or to surface data that might be relevant to the user.
- the user can submit a search query to a search system, e.g., the search system 120 of FIG. 1, and the search system can provide search results that are responsive to the search query.
- search results can include user-specific search results, e.g., the user-specific search results of FIG. 1, which are provided based on a user-specific knowledge graph that is specific to the user.
- a user-specific knowledge graph can include the example portion 300 of FIG. 3.
- the user associated with the user-specific knowledge graph can submit the example query [what should I do with the kids].
- one or more sub- queries can be determined from the query, and can be used to query the user-specific knowledge graph.
- example sub-queries can include [common activities] and [activities with kids].
- tennis can be one or one or more activities that are returned in response to the sub-query [common activities].
- Other example activities that could be returned in response to the sub-query [common activities] can include "horror movies" and "happy hour” to provide an example set that includes tennis, horror movies and happy hour.
- tennis can be one of one or more activities that are returned in response to the sub-query [activities with kids].
- Other example activities that could be returned in response to the sub-query [activities with kids] can include "playground” and "zoo" to provide an example set that includes tennis, playground and zoo.
- tennis is provided in both sets of responsive activities. Consequently, tennis can be provided as a user-specific search result in response to the query [what should I do with my kids].
- the user-specific knowledge graph can be used to predict, for example, one or more activities that the user is likely to participate in, and/or one or more locations where the user is likely to travel.
- a prediction system can automatically, e.g., absent a user request/query, query the user-specific knowledge graph with one or more queries, or a series of queries.
- An example series of queries can include [what are the user's most common weekend activities], [which of these weekend activities are usually undertaken with kids], and [how likely is it for the user to spend this weekend with his kids].
- results of the queries can be joined to provide a prediction, which prediction can be displayed to the user, e.g., activities/places the user will likely be interested in for the coming weekend.
- user-specific querying and/or predictions can be provided to the user based on weights of the user-specific knowledge graph.
- a set of user-specific search results can be provided based on the user-specific knowledge graph.
- user-specific search results can be included in the set based on respective weights. For example, if the weight of an edge relating the activity to the user exceeds a threshold weight, the activity is included in the set. As another example, if the weight of an edge relating the activity to the user does not exceed a threshold weight, the activity is not included in the set. In this manner, less common activities, e.g., activities that may be of less interest to the user are not returned as user-specific search results.
- user-specific search results in the set of user-specific search results can be provided to the user in rank order based on weights. In this manner, user-specific search results that may be of more interest to the user can be displayed more prominently.
