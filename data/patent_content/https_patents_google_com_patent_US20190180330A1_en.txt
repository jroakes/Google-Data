Definitions
- aspects and implementations of the present disclosure relate to data processing, and more specifically, to delivering content and advertisements to client media players.
- Media players may present advertisements to users in conjunction with requested content (e.g., video clips, etc.). Selection of a particular advertisement for presentation may be determined by an auction, in which advertisers compete for placement of their advertisements.
- a first request for a non-premium content item by a first media player executing on a first client device is received.
- a processing device determines a winning bid for a first auction pertaining to the first request, where the winning bid for the first auction is based on an advertiser-specified bid value for advertisement placement in non-premium content.
- An advertisement associated with the winning bid of the first auction is caused to be provided to the first media player for presentation with the non-premium content item.
- a second request for a premium content item by a second media player executing on a second client device is received, and the processing device determines a winning bid for a second auction pertaining to the second request, where the winning bid for the second auction is based on the advertiser-specified bid value and on an advertiser-specified bid modifier for advertisement placement in premium content.
- An advertisement associated with the winning bid of the second auction is caused to be provided to the second media player for presentation with the premium content item.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary system architecture, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 depicts an illustrative graphical user interface (GUI), in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure.
- GUI graphical user interface
- FIG. 3A depicts a flow diagram of aspects of a method for determining an advertisement to deliver to a client media player requesting a content item.
- FIG. 3B depicts a flow diagram of aspects of a method for facilitating delivery of an advertisement to a client media player requesting a content item.
- FIG. 4 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative computer system operating in accordance with aspects and implementations of the present disclosure.
- a content item e.g., a video clip, an audio clip, an image, etc.
- a content item may be designated as premium content (e.g., via a metadata field or attribute, etc.) based on one or more factors such as the author of the content item, the subject matter of the content item, a person appearing in the content item, the number of views of the content item, and so forth.
- a content item may be designated as premium content if it is associated with a prominent entity (e.g., a highly regarded actor, director, politician, writer, etc.) or a prominent event (e.g., a major sporting event, an award-winning performance, etc.), and is therefore presumed to exude prestige and/or attract a much higher level of interest from end users than regular, non-premium content that does not have such associations.
- a prominent entity e.g., a highly regarded actor, director, politician, writer, etc.
- a prominent event e.g., a major sporting event, an award-winning performance, etc.
- Advertisements are often purchased via audience targeting. For example, in the case of a content sharing platform, it may be desirable to advertisers for their advertisements to be targeted to users of the content sharing platform based on a user's age, gender, geolocation, interests, and so forth. In addition to reaching the desired audience, however, advertisers also care about the particular content in which the advertisement is presented. Consequently, advertisers may value premium content (e.g., an award-winning video, a popular sporting event, etc.) due to a perceived “halo effect” of being associated with that premium content.
- premium content e.g., an award-winning video, a popular sporting event, etc.
- Premium content is by its very nature a scarce commodity, as it commands large audiences and possesses positive brand affinity. Consequently, if an advertiser explicitly targets premium content in addition to targeting particular users, the reach of their advertisement campaign may be dramatically reduced (e.g., very few eligible impressions).
- aspects and implementations of the present disclosure enable advertisers to achieve a balance of audience targeting and premium content targeting, without sacrificing reach.
- advertisers submit a bid value for advertisement placement in non-premium content (e.g., $10, etc.), and a bid modifier for advertisement placement in premium content, thereby enabling the bid to be revised upward for premium content.
- the bid modifier may be a multiplicative factor to be applied to the bid value (e.g., 1.5, 2.0, 160%, etc.), while in some other aspects the bid modifier might be an additive delta value (e.g., bid value+10, bid value+20, etc.), while in yet other examples the bid modifier might be an arbitrary function (e.g., 2 ⁇ +5, min ⁇ 3 ⁇ , $50 ⁇ , etc.) that is formulated by the advertiser, and might be applied to the bid value via a function pointer.
- a multiplicative factor to be applied to the bid value e.g., 1.5, 2.0, 160%, etc.
- the bid modifier might be an additive delta value (e.g., bid value+10, bid value+20, etc.)
- the bid modifier might be an arbitrary function (e.g., 2 ⁇ +5, min ⁇ 3 ⁇ , $50 ⁇ , etc.) that is formulated by the advertiser, and might be applied to the bid value via a function pointer.
- a winning bid is determined via auction, where the auction bids are the advertiser-specified bid values for placement in non-premium content.
- a media player requests a premium content item (e.g., a non-premium video clip, a non-premium audio clip, etc.) from the content sharing platform, a winning bid is determined via auction, where the auction bids are based on both the advertiser-specified bid values for placement in non-premium content, and the advertiser-specified bid modifiers for placement in premium content.
- the advertiser's auction bid for placing an ad in non-premium content will be $10
- the advertiser's auction bid for placing an ad in premium content will be $25.
- a winning bid is determined for the auction, and an advertisement associated with the winning bid is provided to the media player for presentation along with the premium content item.
- the advertisement may be presented prior to the content item, while in some other examples the advertisement may be presented at a certain point within the content item.
- the advertisement may be a graphic overlay that is superimposed on a video content item.
- the revenue generated for a content item is shared with a provider of the content item (e.g., a creator of the content item, the owner of a channel including the content item, etc.).
- a provider of the content item e.g., a creator of the content item, the owner of a channel including the content item, etc.

Abstract
A system and method are disclosed for selecting advertisements for premium and non-premium content and delivering the advertisements and content to client media players. In one implementation, a request is received for a premium content item by a media player. A winning bid is determined for an auction pertaining to the request, where the winning bid is based on an advertiser-specified bid value and on an advertiser-specified bid modifier for advertisement placement in premium content. An advertisement associated with the winning bid is provided to the second media player for presentation with the premium content item.
Description
- Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure relate to data processing, and more specifically, to delivering content and advertisements to client media players.
- Media players may present advertisements to users in conjunction with requested content (e.g., video clips, etc.). Selection of a particular advertisement for presentation may be determined by an auction, in which advertisers compete for placement of their advertisements.
- The following presents a simplified summary of various aspects of this disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its purpose is to present some concepts of this disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
- In an aspect of the present disclosure, a first request for a non-premium content item by a first media player executing on a first client device is received. A processing device determines a winning bid for a first auction pertaining to the first request, where the winning bid for the first auction is based on an advertiser-specified bid value for advertisement placement in non-premium content. An advertisement associated with the winning bid of the first auction is caused to be provided to the first media player for presentation with the non-premium content item. A second request for a premium content item by a second media player executing on a second client device is received, and the processing device determines a winning bid for a second auction pertaining to the second request, where the winning bid for the second auction is based on the advertiser-specified bid value and on an advertiser-specified bid modifier for advertisement placement in premium content. An advertisement associated with the winning bid of the second auction is caused to be provided to the second media player for presentation with the premium content item.
- Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure will be understood more fully from the detailed description given below and from the accompanying drawings of various aspects and implementations of the disclosure, which, however, should not be taken to limit the disclosure to the specific aspects or implementations, but are for explanation and understanding only.

FIG. 4 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative computer system operating in accordance with aspects and implementations of the present disclosure. - Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure are disclosed for selecting advertisements for premium and non-premium content and delivering the advertisements and content to client media players. In some examples, a content item (e.g., a video clip, an audio clip, an image, etc.) may be designated as premium content (e.g., via a metadata field or attribute, etc.) based on one or more factors such as the author of the content item, the subject matter of the content item, a person appearing in the content item, the number of views of the content item, and so forth. For example, a content item may be designated as premium content if it is associated with a prominent entity (e.g., a highly regarded actor, director, politician, writer, etc.) or a prominent event (e.g., a major sporting event, an award-winning performance, etc.), and is therefore presumed to exude prestige and/or attract a much higher level of interest from end users than regular, non-premium content that does not have such associations.
- Advertisements are often purchased via audience targeting. For example, in the case of a content sharing platform, it may be desirable to advertisers for their advertisements to be targeted to users of the content sharing platform based on a user's age, gender, geolocation, interests, and so forth. In addition to reaching the desired audience, however, advertisers also care about the particular content in which the advertisement is presented. Consequently, advertisers may value premium content (e.g., an award-winning video, a popular sporting event, etc.) due to a perceived “halo effect” of being associated with that premium content.
- Premium content, however, is by its very nature a scarce commodity, as it commands large audiences and possesses positive brand affinity. Consequently, if an advertiser explicitly targets premium content in addition to targeting particular users, the reach of their advertisement campaign may be dramatically reduced (e.g., very few eligible impressions).
- Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure enable advertisers to achieve a balance of audience targeting and premium content targeting, without sacrificing reach. In one implementation, advertisers submit a bid value for advertisement placement in non-premium content (e.g., $10, etc.), and a bid modifier for advertisement placement in premium content, thereby enabling the bid to be revised upward for premium content. In some aspects, the bid modifier may be a multiplicative factor to be applied to the bid value (e.g., 1.5, 2.0, 160%, etc.), while in some other aspects the bid modifier might be an additive delta value (e.g., bid value+10, bid value+20, etc.), while in yet other examples the bid modifier might be an arbitrary function (e.g., 2×+5, min{3×, $50}, etc.) that is formulated by the advertiser, and might be applied to the bid value via a function pointer.
- When a media player executing on a client device (e.g., a smartphone, a personal computer, etc.) requests a non-premium content item from the content sharing platform, a winning bid is determined via auction, where the auction bids are the advertiser-specified bid values for placement in non-premium content. When a media player requests a premium content item (e.g., a non-premium video clip, a non-premium audio clip, etc.) from the content sharing platform, a winning bid is determined via auction, where the auction bids are based on both the advertiser-specified bid values for placement in non-premium content, and the advertiser-specified bid modifiers for placement in premium content. For example, if an advertiser specifies a bid value of $10 for non-premium content and a bid modifier of 2.5 for premium content, the advertiser's auction bid for placing an ad in non-premium content will be $10, and the advertiser's auction bid for placing an ad in premium content will be $25.
- For both non-premium and premium content, a winning bid is determined for the auction, and an advertisement associated with the winning bid is provided to the media player for presentation along with the premium content item. In some examples in which both the content item and the advertisement are video clips, the advertisement may be presented prior to the content item, while in some other examples the advertisement may be presented at a certain point within the content item. In yet other examples, the advertisement may be a graphic overlay that is superimposed on a video content item.
- Subsequently, the revenue generated for a content item is shared with a provider of the content item (e.g., a creator of the content item, the owner of a channel including the content item, etc.). By using bid modifiers for advertisement placement in premium content, providers of premium content are rewarded and encouraged to distribute their content via the content sharing platform.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates anexample system architecture 100, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Thesystem architecture 100 includes aserver machine 115, aserver machine 116, aserver machine 117, acontent store 120, anadvertisement store 130, user client machines 102-1 through 102-N, and advertiser client machines 160-1 through 160-M connected to anetwork 104, where M and N are positive integers. Network 104 may be a public network (e.g., the Internet), a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN)), or a combination thereof. -
Content store 120 is a persistent storage that is capable of storing content items (e.g., video clips, audio clips, images, etc.) as well as data structures to tag, organize, and index the media items.Content store 120 may be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage based disks, tapes or hard drives, NAS, SAN, and so forth. In some implementations,content store 120 may be a network-attached file server, while in otherembodiments content store 120 may be some other type of persistent storage such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, and so forth, that may be hosted by theserver machine 115 or one or more different machines coupled to theserver machine 115 via thenetwork 104. The content items stored in thecontent store 120 may include user-generated media items that are uploaded by client machines, as well as media items from service providers such as news organizations, publishers, libraries and so forth. In some implementations,media store 120 may be provided by a third-party service, while in some otherimplementations media store 120 may be maintained by the same entity maintainingserver machine 115. - Server machine 115 (hosting content server 140) and
media store 120 may be part of a content sharing platform that allows a user to consume, upload, search for, approve of (“like”), dislike, and/or comment on media items. The content sharing platform may also include a website that may be used to provide a user with access to the media items. The content sharing platform may include any type of content delivery network providing access to content and/or media items. - The content sharing platform may include multiple channels (e.g., channels A through Z). A channel can be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic or theme. The data content can be digital content chosen by a user, digital content made available by a user, digital content uploaded by a user, digital content chosen by a content provider, digital content chosen by a broadcaster, etc. For example, a channel X can include videos Y and Z. A channel can be associated with an owner, who is a user that can perform actions on the channel.
- Different activities can be associated with the channel based on the owner's actions, such as the owner making digital content available on the channel, the owner selecting (e.g., liking) digital content associated with another channel, the owner commenting on digital content associated with another channel, etc. The activities associated with the channel can be collected into an activity feed for the channel. Users, other than the owner of the channel, can subscribe to one or more channels in which they are interested. Once a user subscribes to a channel, the user can be presented with information from the channel's activity feed. An activity feed may be a list of recent activity associated with the user and occurring on the social network. If a user subscribes to multiple channels, the activity feed for each channel to which the user is subscribed can be combined into a syndicated activity feed. Information from the syndicated activity feed can be presented to the user. Although channels are described as one implementation of a content sharing platform, implementations of the disclosure are not limited to content sharing platforms that provide content items via a channel model. In particular, according to aspects of the present disclosure, the content sharing platform can provide users with access to content items that part of particular channels and/or to content items that are not part of any channels (e.g., independent content items or content items that are part of certain playlists or other content item collections). The content sharing platform may store the content items using the
content store 120. - The content sharing platform may include or be otherwise associated with a mobile component that allows users to connect to, share information, and/or interact with each other using one or more mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablet computers, laptop computers, wearable computing devices, etc.) and/or any other suitable devices. For example, the mobile component may enable telephony communication, Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messaging, text chat, video chat, and/or any other communication between users, and may present to a user a listing (e.g., activity feed, feed, stream, wall, etc.) of objects (e.g., posts, content items (e.g., videos, images, audios, etc.), status updates, favorability indications, tags, messages, etc.) provided by other users of the mobile platform. The mobile component may also include a content sharing aspect that allows users to upload, view, tag, share, and/or perform any other function on content, such as text content, video content, image content, audio content, etc. Other users of the content sharing platform may comment on the shared content, discover new content, locate updates, share content, and otherwise interact with the provided content.
-
Advertisement store 130 is a persistent storage that is capable of storing advertisements (e.g., video clip ads, audio clip ads, image overlays, etc.) as well as data structures to tag, organize, and index the media items.Advertisement store 130 may be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage based disks, tapes or hard drives, NAS, SAN, and so forth. In some implementations,advertisement store 130 may be a network-attached file server, while in otherembodiments content store 120 may be some other type of persistent storage such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, and so forth, that may be hosted byserver machine 116 or one or more different machines coupled to theserver machine 116 via thenetwork 104.Advertisement store 130 and/orserver machine 116 hostingad server 141 may be part of the content sharing platform, or may be part of an independent system or systems that can communicate with the content sharing platform vianetwork 104. - The user client machines 102-1 through 102-N may be personal computers (PCs), laptops, mobile phones, tablet computers, set top boxes, televisions, video game consoles, digital assistants or any other computing devices. Each user client machine 102-i, where i is an integer between 1 and N inclusive, runs a media player 103-i
- that may be (or be part of) an application that allows a user to view content, such as images, videos, web pages, documents, etc. For example, the
media player 103 may be part of a web browser that can access, retrieve, present, and/or navigate content (e.g., web pages such as Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) pages, digital media items, etc.) served by a web server. Themedia player 103 may render, display, and/or present the content (e.g., a web page, a media viewer) to a user. -
Media players 103 may be provided to client devices 102A through 102N by theserver 115 and/or the content sharing platform. For example,media players 103 may be embedded media players (e.g., Flash® players or HTMLS players) that are embedded in web pages provided by the content sharing platform. In another example, themedia players 103 may be (or be part of) applications (mobile applications or “apps”) that are downloaded from theserver 115. - In one embodiment, the
media player 103 is capable of submitting requests for user-selected content items (e.g., transmitting requests vianetwork 104 tocontent server 140 ofserver machine 115, etc.), of submitting requests for advertisements to be presented with content items (e.g., transmitting requests vianetwork 104 toad server 141 ofserver machine 116, etc.), of receiving and presenting content items, and of receiving and presenting advertisements. - In general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed by the content server 240 can also be performed on the user client machines 102-1 through 102-N in other embodiments if appropriate. In addition, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The
content server 140 can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces, and thus is not limited to use in websites. - Each of
server machines Server machine 115 includes acontent server 140 that is capable of receiving requests for content items from media players 103 (e.g., via a webpage, via an application, etc.).Server machine 116 includes anad server 141 that is capable of receiving requests for advertisements. In some examples, the advertisement requests may be submitted by themedia players 103, while in some other examples the advertisements requests may be submitted bycontent server 140. In one embodiment,ad server 141 is capable of receiving messages fromauction manager 142 that identify advertisements stored inadvertisement store 130 to be presented with content items. In some examples,ad server 141 may deliver the advertisements tomedia players 103, while in some other embodiments, the advertisements may be delivered bycontent server 140 tomedia players 103 in conjunction with content items. -
Server machine 117 may include anauction manager 142 that is capable of receiving bid values and bid modifiers from advertiser client machines 160-1 through 160-M, of running auctions using the advertiser-provided bid values for ad placement in non-premium content items, and of running auctions using both the advertiser-provided bid values and the advertiser-provided bid modifiers for ad placement in premium content items. It should be noted that in some other implementations,content server 140,ad server 141, andauction manager 142 may be hosted by a single server machine, rather than onrespsective server machines - The advertiser client machines 160-1 through 160-M may be personal computers (PCs), laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, or any other computing devices. Each advertiser client machine 160-i, where i is an integer between 1 and M inclusive, is capable of presenting a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables an advertiser to provide bidding data for placing ads in non-premium and premium content (e.g., a bid value and a bid modifier), and audience targeting data (e.g., data pertaining to user demographics, user interests, etc.). The
advertiser client machines 160 are also capable of transmitting the advertiser-provided data vianetwork 104 to one or both ofad server 141 andauction manager 142. In some examples the GUI may be embedded within a webpage, while in some other examples the GUI may be part of an application (or “app”) onadvertiser client machine 160 that is independent of a web browser. An illustrative GUI for obtaining bidding data and audience targeting data from advertisers is described in detail below with respect toFIG. 2 . - Although implementations of the disclosure are discussed in terms of content sharing platforms, implementations may also be generally applied to any type of social network providing connections between users or to any type of content delivery platform providing content to end users. In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content sharing platform collects user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content sharing platform, and/or
server machines system 100. -
FIG. 2 depicts an illustrative graphical user interface (GUI) 200 for obtaining information from an advertiser, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. As noted above, in someembodiments GUI 200 may be presented via a webpage in a browser, while in someother embodiments GUI 200 may be presented in a dedicated application. - As shown in
FIG. 2 ,GUI 200 comprises afirst section 210 pertaining to bidding on advertisement placement, and asecond section 220 pertaining to audience targeting. In one embodiment,bidding section 210 includes a first text field in which an advertiser can specify a bid value for non-premium content, denominated in dollars (e.g., $50, etc.), and a second text field in which the advertiser can specify a bid modifier for premium content. In some examples, the bid modifier might be a multiplier expressed as a coefficient (e.g., 1.5), while in some other examples the bid modifier might be a multiplier expressed as a percentage (e.g., 150%), while in yet other examples the bid modifier might be a delta value denominated in dollars (e.g., $20), while in still other examples the bid modifier might be an arbitrary function expressed symbolically (e.g., 2x+$10). It should be noted that when the bid modifier is an arbitrary function, an advertiser may specify the function using a symbolic formula or equation builder in some examples, while in some other examples the advertiser may specify the function via a string of symbols entered directly into the corresponding text field. - In one embodiment, targeting
section 220 includes one or more graphical widgets (e.g., text fields, radio buttons, drop-down lists, etc.) that enable an advertiser to specify audience targeting parameters (e.g., gender, an age category, etc.). It should be noted that in some implementations, the data in the bidding and targeting sections may be applied to all advertisements associated with the advertiser, while in some other implementations the bidding and targeting sections may be specified on an individual basis for each of a plurality of advertisements associated with the advertiser, such that one advertisement might have different bid/bid modifier/targeting data than another advertisement. As discussed above, users of the content sharing platform media players are notified of the types of information collected about them (e.g., gender, age, viewing history, etc.), and are provided the opportunity to choose not to have such information collected and/or shared. -
FIG. 3A depicts a flow diagram of aspects of amethod 300 for determining an advertisement to deliver to a client media player requesting a content item. The method is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination thereof. In one implementation, the method is performed byserver machine 116 ofFIG. 1 , while in some other implementations, one or more blocks ofFIG. 3A may be performed by another machine not depicted in the figures. - For simplicity of explanation, methods are depicted and described as a series of acts. However, acts in accordance with this disclosure can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methods in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In addition, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methods could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the methods disclosed in this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computing devices. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device or storage media.
- At
block 301, bid values for non-premium content and bid modifiers for premium content (e.g., content provided by a prestigious content author, content in which famous actors appear, content that has a high degree of virality, content provided by premium channels, etc.) are received from one or more advertisers. In accordance with one aspect, the bid values and bid modifiers are received byad server 141 fromadvertisement clients 160, vianetwork 104. In one example, the bid values and bid modifiers are stored in a data store associated withad server 141. - Subsequently, at
block 302, an advertisement for a content item can be requested. In accordance with some examples, a media player 103-i running on a client device 102-i may submit a request for the content item to the content sharing platform and/orcontent server 140, which may forward a corresponding ad request toad server 141. In some other examples, the media player may submit two separate requests, one tocontent server 140 for the requested content item, and one toad server 141 for an advertisement. The ad request may identify the requested content item (e.g., characteristics of the requested content item including an indicator specifying whether the requested content item is a premium content item or non-premium content item, an indicator specifying whether the requested content item is part of a channel that provides premium content or non-premium content, etc.), characteristics of a requesting user (e.g., age, gender, viewing history, geographic location, etc.), and so forth. - At
block 303, advertisements are selected based on the characteristics of the requested content item and/or characteristics of the requesting user, and for each selected advertisement, a corresponding advertiser's bid value is retrieved. Atblock 304, execution branches based on whether the request content item is non-premium or premium. If the content item is non-premium, execution proceeds to block 305, otherwise execution continues atblock 306. - At
block 305, advertisers' bid values for non-premium content are submitted to an auction for determining an advertisement to deliver to the requesting media player. Atblock 306, bids for premium content are submitted to an auction for determining an advertisement to deliver to the requesting media player, where each bid is based on an advertiser's bid value and bid modifier (e.g., bid value*bid modifier, etc.). - At
block 307, an identifier of a winning bid is received, and an advertisement associated with the winning bid is provided for presentation with the requested content item. In one example, the advertisement is provided to requesting client device 102-i directly or via the content sharing platform and/orcontent server 140. -
FIG. 3B depicts a flow diagram of aspects of amethod 350 for facilitating delivery of an advertisement to a client media player requesting a content item. The method is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination thereof. In one implementation, the method is performed by one or more ofserver machines FIG. 1 , while in some other implementations, one or more blocks ofFIG. 3B may be performed by another machine not depicted in the figures. - At
block 308, a request by a media player for a particular content item is received. The request may be by a media player 103-i running on a user client 102-i. In one implementation, the request may be received bycontent server 140, andcontent server 140 may forward a corresponding ad request toad server 141. The ad request may identify the requested content item (e.g., characteristics of the requested content item including an indicator specifying whether the requested content item is a premium content item or non-premium content item, an indicator specifying whether the requested content item is part of a channel that provides premium content or non-premium content, etc.), characteristics of a requesting user, etc. In some other examples, the media player may submit two separate requests, one tocontent server 140 for the requested content item, and one toad server 141 for an advertisement, and eithercontent server 140 or the media player can provide the above information about the requested content item toad server 141. - At
block 309, it may be determined whether the requested content item is a premium content item or a non-premium content item. In some implementations, this information on whether the requested content item is a premium content item or a non-premium content item may be provided to the ad server which can then submit relevant advertisers' bids to an auction associated with the requested content item. Execution further branches based on whether the requested content item is non-premium or premium. If the content item is non-premium, execution proceeds to block 310, otherwise execution continues atblock 311. - At
block 310, a winning bid for advertisement placement in non-premium content is determined, where the winning bid is based on an advertiser's bid value. Afterblock 310, execution proceeds to block 312. - At
block 311, a winning bid for advertisement placement in premium content is determined, where the winning bid is based on an advertiser's bid value and bid modifier (e.g., bid value*bid modifier, etc.). - In one embodiment, an auction is conducted (using either the bids for advertisement placement in non-premium content or the bids for advertisement placement in premium content), a winning bid is determined, and an advertisement associated with the winning bid is determined. In accordance with one aspect, the auction is conducted and the winning bid is determined by
auction server 142. It should be noted that in some implementations, the auction may be based on one or more factors in addition to the values of the bids, rather than the highest bid always winning. Such additional factors might include metadata associated with the requested content item, data associated with the user's client device (e.g., geolocation, the type of client device, etc.), data associated with the user (e.g., age, gender, etc.), and so forth. As noted above, users of media players are notified of the types of information collected about them (e.g., gender, age, viewing history, geographic location, etc.), and are provided the opportunity to choose not to have such information collected and/or shared. When a user chooses not to have such information collected, this information will not be available for use in the auction. - At
block 312, the content item and the advertisement determined by the auction are provided to the requesting media player.
