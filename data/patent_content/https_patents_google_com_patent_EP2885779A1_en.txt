- the disclosed subject technology relates to a method for generating a content based, custom labeled map.
- the method includes receiving a request for a map, including a geographic area to be displayed in the map and a type of content item to be displayed in the map;
- the method also includes determining, for each of the plurality of orientation points, one or more pieces of content to be associated with each orientation point. Each of the one or more pieces of content has a ranking. The method further includes ranking each of the plurality of orientation points based at least in part on the ranks of the one or more pieces of content associated with each orientation point, and generating a map to display at the locations of the plurality of orientation points the one or more pieces of content respectively associated with each orientation point at a level of prominence that is based on the ranking of each orientation point.
- the disclosed subject technology further relates to a system for generating a content based, custom labeled map.
- the system includes one or more processor and one or more memories containing processor-executable instructions. When executed by the one or more processor, the processor-executable instructions causes the system to receive a request for a map, including a geographic area to be displayed in the map and a type of content item to be displayed in the map, and determine, based on a ranking of locations in the geographical area, a plurality of orientation points to display on the map.
- the processor-executable instructions also causes the system to determine, based on a ranking of locations in the geographical area, a plurality of orientation points to display on the map, and determine, for each of the plurality of orientation points, one or more pieces of content to be associated with each orientation point, where each of the one or more pieces of content has a ranking.
- the processor-executable instructions further causes the system to rank each of the plurality of orientation points based at least in part on the ranks of the one or more pieces of content associated with each orientation point, and generate a map to display at the locations of the plurality of orientation points the one or more pieces of content respectively associated with each orientation point at a level of prominence that is based on the ranking of each orientation point and to display a label indicating the locations of the plurality of orientation points.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system for custom labeling a map based on content.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example client and server from the system of FIG. 1 according to certain aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example process for custom labeling a map based on content.
- FIG. 4a is an illustration of a map as it relates to aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 4b is an illustration of a map as it relates to aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.
- the disclosed subject technology describes systems and techniques for labeling a map with content.
- the disclosed subject technology first identifies orientation points that correspond to prominent locations on the map.
- the orientation points may be ranked based on different criteria (e.g., population or popularity), and different orientation points may appear at different zoom levels of the map based on their ranking.
- Pieces of content are also obtained that allow for customization of the map.
- Content can include weather information, photographs, video, or specific event based information (e.g., election results) that is to be displayed on the map.
- the pieces of content may be associated with a location (e.g., weather information may originate from a weather station having a physical location).
- the pieces of content may be associated with respective ones of the orientation points in order to generate a map of content information displayed at the location of the orientation points.
- Content information may be associated with the orientation points based on one or more criteria, including proximity of location (e.g., each piece of content may be associated with the closest orientation point). Multiple pieces of content may be associated with a single orientation point (e.g., multiple photo's may be associated with NYC) or a single piece of content may be associated with multiple orientation points (e.g., information from a weather station at JFK International airport may be associated with several nearby cities). Pieces of content may also be associated with orientation points based on the weight or ranking of the pieces of content. The ranking may be based, e.g., on the accuracy of the content, popularity of the content, or other criteria.
- the orientation points may then be re-ranked based on the rankings or weights of the pieces of content that are associated with them. Finally, the pieces of content can be displayed at the orientation points based on the ranking or re-ranking of the orientation points.
- a displayed piece of content may include a label indicating the location of the orientation point with which the piece of content is associated.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for generating a custom labeled, content based map.
- the system 100 includes clients 110 and servers 130 connected over a network 150.
- the system 100 is comprised of client(s) 1 10, server(s) 130 and the network 150 in any combination or configuration that allows for content based custom labeling of a map, including implementations with multiple servers 130.

- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example client and server from the system 100 of FIG. 1 according to certain aspects of the subject technology.
- the client 1 10 and the server 130 are connected over the network 150 via respective communications modules 218 and 238 and are configured to interface with the network 150 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to other devices on the network.
- the client 1 10 and the server 130 are connected over the network 150 via respective communications modules 218 and 238 and are configured to interface with the network 150 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to other devices on the network.
- the client 1 10 and the server 130 are connected over the network 150 via respective communications modules 218 and 238 and are configured to interface with the network 150 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to other devices on the network.
- the communications modules 218 and 238 are configured to interface with the network 150 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to other devices on the network.
- communications modules 218 and 238 can be, for example, modems or Ethernet cards.
- the client 1 10 includes a processor 212, a communications module 218, and a memory 220 that may include a map labeling module 224.
- the processor 212 of the client 1 10 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor 212, instructions received from software in memory 220, or a combination of both.
- the input device 216 may provide textual information to processor 212 which is processed by a map labeling module 224 stored in memory 220. The textual information may then be sent through network 150 via
- communications module 218 to server 130, which receives the information through
- Map labeling module 224 may include a web browser and software providing custom map applications for use with client 1 10. Some features of the map labeling module 224 may be accessible by the client 1 10 without communicating with server 130. For instance, custom maps that have been previously displayed on client 1 10 may be saved to the client 110 for future display on output device 214.
- Server 130 includes a processor 236, a communications module 238, and a memory 232 that may include a map labeling module 234.
- Processor 236 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor 236, instructions received from software in memory 232, or a combination of both. [0025] Processor 236 processes information from map labeling module 234 and sends information through communications module 238, through network 150, to client 1 10 to be displayed on output device 214.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example process 300 for generating a content based, custom labeled map.
- the process 300 disclosed in FIG. 3 may be executed, e.g., by one or more of client 110 and server 130 of FIG. 2.
- process 300 of FIG. 3 is described with reference to FIG. 2, the process 300 is not limited to such a configuration and can be applied to other systems and configurations.
- the process begins at S310 with the receipt of a request for a content labeled map.
- the request may be received when a user enters a zip code or the name of a city into an input device 216 of a client 1 10 running a mapping application, thereby indicating the geographic area for which a map is desired.
- the user may also enter the type of content the user wishes to have displayed on the map based on choices provided by the map application.
- Types of content may include weather information, photos, video, statistical information, or event specific information such as voting results in an election.
- Statistical information may include population density, disease outbreak information, energy usage, or the like.
- Event specific information may be information about current events, such as the results of a bicycle race or marathon, the amount of money raised by each school in a school district fundraiser, or the like.
- the server 130 determines a plurality of orientation points on the map.
- An orientation point may correspond to a particular location expressed as a longitude and latitude, or a location of a city, a country, a continent, a body of water, a business, a town, an intersection, a geographic landmark, a historic landmark, a cultural landmark, a monument, or the like.
- Each orientation point includes a ranking, which may be based on one or more factors (e.g., population, popularity, etc,) of the orientation point. For orientation points that correspond to cities or towns, for example, the orientation points may be ranked based on a combination of population and popularity. Thus, cities and towns that are more popular and that have a larger population are ranked higher as orientation points.
- the popularity of orientation points can be measured in any number of ways, including the number of search queries received by the mapping application that include the orientation points. Popularity is deemed to be higher as more search queries are made for the orientation points.
- the ranking of the orientation points may also be based on a user profile.
- an orientation point is ranked higher when the user profile indicates a user connection to or interest in the orientation point.
- orientation points may be ranked higher based on user profile or related information when the orientation points appear in the user profile as the user's home address, work address, or current address or when the user's profile stores information associating the user with the orientation points appearing, e.g., as vacation destinations, locations commonly appearing in search queries, or locations at where the user has previously been (e.g., locations at which the user has checked in using a social networking service).
- Each piece of information in the user profile associating the user with an orientation point may be given a predetermined weight, reflecting the interest level of the user with respect to the orientation point.
- a user profile may indicate that the work address of a user requesting a content labeled map is Mountain View, California. In such case, Mountain View may rank higher as an orientation point than other nearby locations, such as San Jose, California, even though San Jose has a larger population and may be more popular (e.g., receive more search queries).
- the ranking of the orientation points may affect their display on the map.
- the proximity of highly ranked orientation points may also affect their display on the map.
- the mapping application may require a predetermined minimum distance between the orientation points displayed on the map, and the orientation points may be selected for display in a descending order of their ranks, while conforming to the minimum distance between orientation points.
- each of the ranked orientation points in the list of orientation points is examined in descending order until all the ranked orientation points in the list have been analyzed and are either selected for display on the map, or discarded for failing to conform to the predetermined minimum distance
- the minimum distance can be predetermined based on the expected sizes of pieces of content to be associated with the orientation points, the expected length of labels identifying the orientation points, or both. Specifically, the minimum distance can be predetermined such that the distance between two neighboring orientation points selected for display on the map is sufficient to accommodate the pieces of content to be associated with the orientation points, the labels that may be displayed with the orientation points, or both. For example, if the pieces of content are images, the predetermined minimum distance can be some multiple of the default size of an image thumbnail to be associated with the orientation points displayed on the map (e.g., 2X or 3X the size of a thumbnail). Likewise, if the pieces of content are weather icons, the minimum distance can be some multiple of the default size of a weather icon.
- the minimum distance may be different for different directions of the map. For example, different minimum distances may be determined for the horizontal direction of the map and the vertical direction of the map. Further, the selection of the ranked orientation points for display on the map may be performed again when the zoom level of the map changes, and the predetermined minimum distance may depend on the zoom level of the map.
- step S330 the server 130 obtains content for inclusion in the map.
- the type of content included for display on the map may be determined by user selection. For example, the user may want to see weather information, local news, voting results, or photos that are associated with the map's orientation points. A single type of content may be displayed at each orientation point, or alternatively, multiple types of content may be displayed at each orientation point.
- Weather information may include temperature, humidity, a forecast, current conditions, atmospheric conditions, heat index, and the like.
- Voting results may include the number of votes associated with each of a plurality of political parties, the number of votes cast for each candidate in a particular location, the winner of the vote at the particular location, the winning party at the particular location, or the like.
- each piece of content may be associated with a location.
- weather information may be associated with the location of the weather station at which the information was recorded.
- Voting information may be associated with the location at which votes were taken or tallied.
- Photographs and videos may be associated with the locations at which they were taken. The locations may be user specified or automatically determined. The locations of photographs and videos may also be determined from the locations of monuments or geographic areas that are the subject of the photograph, or from the location of a city, town, or geographic region in which the photograph was taken.
- Pieces of content may have weights assigned to them, and may be ranked based on their respective weights.
- the weights may indicate the accuracy, popularity, age, or the like of the respective pieces of content. For example, a photograph that has received several comments or that has been viewed often may receive a larger weight than other photographs that have not been commented on or viewed. Photographs may also be weighted based on their age, or based on the length of time they have been publicly available. Information from a weather station that is consistently accurate may be assigned a larger weight than information from a weather station that is consistently inaccurate.
- the pieces of content may also be weighted based on the frequency with which information from a provider of the content is updated. For instance, weather conditions from a weather station that provides minute to minute updates may be given a higher weight than weather conditions from a weather station that only updates the information every six hours.
- multiple pieces of content may be associated with a single orientation point. For instance, 30 photographs may be associated with an orientation point indicating the geographic location of the Stonehenge monument.
- a single piece of content may be associated with multiple orientation points.
- weather information from a single weather station may be associated with multiple orientation points corresponding to the towns surrounding the weather station.
- the server 130 associates at least one piece of content with each of the orientation points selected for display on the map. For example, in a map for displaying weather conditions, the server 130 can associate weather information obtained from a weather station near Chicago with an orientation point corresponding to Chicago. If there are five weather stations with locations surrounding Chicago, a single weather station can be selected for association with the Chicago orientation point.
- the single weather station can be selected based on its proximity to Chicago, its accuracy, its popularity or frequency of use, the frequency with which it provides updates, or a combination of these and other factors. For instance, information from the weather station that is physically closest to the city of Chicago may be assigned to the orientation point for Chicago. Alternatively, information from the most accurate or highest ranked weather station within a 3 mile radius of the City of Chicago may be assigned to the orientation point for Chicago. In some implementations, multiple pieces of content can be combined, and the combined information can be associated with an orientation point. For example, the weather information (e.g., temperature) from the five weather stations surrounding Chicago can be combined and associated with the city of Chicago. When multiple pieces of content associated with a single orientation point are combined, the combined information may be a weighted average that is based on the weights of the individual pieces of content.
- the weather information e.g., temperature
- the server 130 provides a map displaying information from the selected content items that are associated with the selected orientation points to client 1 10.
- the map may also include a label identifying the selected orientation points at which the selected content items are displayed.
- the labels may be in the form of text, icons, boundary lines or the like.
- content information for a map displaying the weather can include the current temperature or an icon indicating the current weather condition (e.g., a bright sun indicating a clear sky) at the locations of each of the orientation points.
- the orientation points may be labeled to identify them (e.g., to indicate the name of a city, a town, a monument, a body of water, a famous location, or the like).
- the map may be shown at specific zoom levels based on the density or number of orientation points or pieces of content displayed. If the zoom level is changed, the number of orientation points or pieces of content displayed on the map may also change. Pieces of content that are no long displayed on the map may be displayed in a different portion of the map or next to the map.
- FIG. 4a is an illustration of a custom labeled, content based map.
- Map 405 displays a world map that has been customized to display weather information.
- Pieces of content 415 and 425 constitute different types of weather information that can be displayed on map 405 at orientation point 435.
- Piece of content 415 is an icon illustrating the current weather conditions at the orientation point.
- Piece of content 425 displays the current temperature at the orientation point.
- the textual label of orientation point 435 e.g., the label "Seattle, WA" may indicate the location of the orientation point 435.
- Pieces of content 415 and 425 and the label of orientation point 435 may constitute part of the base map 405 or may be a separate layer over the base map 405.
- the orientation points for which the associated weather information is displayed on the map 405 are selected based on a ranking of orientation points and a predetermined minimum distance between the orientation points displayed on the map. As discussed above with reference to FIG. 3, the orientation points are ranked based on various factors, such as, for example, population and popularity associated with the orientation points, and user profiles. The orientation points are displayed on the map based on their rank, subject to satisfying a predetermined minimum distance from other orientation points already displayed on the map as explained above. For example, map 405 shows various orientation points corresponding to different cities that have been selected for display on the map. Based on the ranking of orientation points as described above, New York was ranked the highest and was first selected for display.
- Los Angeles was ranked the next highest, and was selected for display since the distance between Los Angeles and New York is greater than the minimum distance threshold.
- London, England was ranked the next highest after Los Angeles, and was selected for display on the map 405 since the distance between London and New York (i.e., the closest displayed orientation point) is greater than the minimum distance threshold.
- the next highest ranked orientation point after London may have been San Francisco, CA. However, since San Francisco is too close to Los Angeles, which is a higher ranked orientation point that is already selected for display (i.e., the distance between the two cities is less than the minimum distance threshold), San Francisco is not selected for display on the map 405. Similarly, other ranked orientation points are selected for display or rejected for display on the map using the ranking and minimum distance threshold criteria.
- FIG. 4b is another illustration of a custom labeled, content based map.
- Map 407 displays photographs of landmarks taken in South Eastern Australia.
- Piece of content 417 is a thumbnail icon of a photograph that has been associated with an orientation point 437.
- Piece of content 427 provides information describing the photograph 417, such as the location of the photograph, a description of the photograph, or the title of the photograph.
- the information associated with piece of content 427 (e.g., its location, or the date and time it was taken) may be entered by a user or may be automatically determined by a digital camera or digital photography application.
- Multiple photographs may be associated with a single orientation point in the map 407. For example, each orientation point may be associated with the 5 highest ranked photographs taken near that orientation point.
- the icon displayed on map 407 may be that of the highest ranked photograph or the most recent photograph or the photograph that is closest to the orientation point, or any combination of these and other related factors.
- the textual label of orientation point 437 (e.g., the label "Arumpo, NSW") indicates the location corresponding to the orientation point 437.
- the rank of an orientation point may determine the size of the piece of content as it is displayed on the map. For instance, orientation point 437 may have a higher rank than orientation point 457. As a result, the picture icon associated with orientation point 437 may be larger and more prominently displayed on the map than the picture icon associated with orientation point 457.
- the rank of an orientation point or the weight of a piece of content associated with the orientation point may determine whether a label for the orientation point is displayed at a particular zoom level of the map, may determine the number of pieces of content or the types of pieces of content that are displayed at a particular zoom level of the map, or may determine whether any piece of content or orientation point is displayed at all at a particular zoom level of the map.
- Label 447 indicates additional information that may be displayed on the map in concert with orientation points and associated pieces of content in a manner that provides visibility for the label without obstructing or interfering with the display of the orientation points or their associated pieces of content.
- the label 447 may appear on top of lower ranked pieces of content or orientation points, or where no orientation points and associated pieces of content appear on the map. Additional location information may be associated with specific pieces of content or orientation points.
- Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium).
- processing unit(s) When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions.
- processing unit(s) e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units
- Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc.
- the term "software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor.
- multiple software aspects of the subject technology can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject technology.
- multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs.
- any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject technology.
- the software programs when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- a computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
- a computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system.
- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds 50373 other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code).
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
