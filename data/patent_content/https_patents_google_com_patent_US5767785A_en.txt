Definitions
- This invention relates in general to contiguous logic and more specifically to use of contiguous logic in selecting a particular selective call protocol for transmission of information.
- An aspect of the present invention is an apparatus for selecting, for a next transmission, a batch of pending messages among a plurality of batches of pending messages, wherein each of the plurality of batches has a corresponding selective call protocol for use in transmitting the batch, the apparatus comprising:
- a first memory arranged to store, for each of the plurality of batches, historical data, comprising an airtime efficiency rating of the selective call protocol corresponding to the batch, a latency measurement of the batch, and a message queue profile of the batch;
- a second memory arranged to store for each of the plurality of batches of pending messages, current information comprising at least an associated priority of the batch, synchronization requirement of the corresponding protocol, and allowable transmission time for sending the batch;
- a sorter coupled to the first and second memories and arranged to classify the historical data and the current information so as to select an optimum batch among the plurality of batches for the next transmission.
- radio frequency manager for selecting, for a next transmission, a batch of pending messages among a plurality of batches of pending messages, wherein each of the plurality of batches has a corresponding selective call protocol for use in transmitting the batch, the radio frequency manager comprising:
- a first memory arranged to store, for each of the plurality of batches, historical data comprising an airtime efficiency rating of the selective call protocol corresponding to the batch, a latency measurement of the batch, and a message queue profile of the batch;
- a second memory arranged to store for each of the plurality of batches of pending messages, current information comprising at least an associated priority of the batch, synchronization requirement of the corresponding protocol, and allowable transmission time for sending the batch;
- a sorter coupled to the first and second memories and arranged to classify the historical data and the current information using fuzzy logic so as to select an optimum batch for the next transmission, and, alternatively, to select a second optimum batch for the next transmission of the selective call messages if the optimum batch is not available
- the sorter comprises a fuzzifier for generating membership values for historical and current input conditions, a rule base for applying a set of predetermined rules to the current input conditions to perform a mapping with the historical conditions, and a defuzzifier for generating a non-fuzzy prediction recommendation from the mapping, and for generating the optimum batch and, alternatively, for generating the second optimum batch;
- a plurality of processing elements including an input processing element for receiving bias settings for airtime efficiency, latency, priority, and battery savings;
- Another aspect of the present invention is a method for selecting, for a next transmission, a batch of pending messages among a plurality of batches of pending messages, wherein each of the plurality of batches has a corresponding selective call protocol for use in transmitting the batch, comprising the steps of:
- FIG. 1 is an adaptive system for choosing a selective call protocol in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a plot of a membership function for an Efficiency characteristic of a selected protocol in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a plot of a membership function for a Latency characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 4 is a plot of a membership function for a Pending Buffer Utilization characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a plot of a membership function for a Page Pending Trend characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 6 is a plot of a membership function for a Priority characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 7 is a plot of a membership function for FLEX Sync Required in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 8 is a plot of an output function for a Transmit Need characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 9 is a linguistic rule-base in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 10 is a flow chart of a method of choosing a selective call protocol in accordance with the present invention.
- crisp inputs are measured and assigned fuzzy membership values as part of the fuzzification step, which are applied as conditions to the rules in the rule-base.
- the rules then specify what actions are to be taken, although in fuzzy terms. Fuzzy actions from typically two or more rules are combined and transformed back into executable system outputs.
- this process is similar to the use of a Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse to transform time domain signals into the frequency domain, to process the resulting frequencies, and then to transform the results back into the time domain.
- the added expense of transforming between time and frequency domains is justified because the system model is easier to understand and manipulate in terms of frequencies.
- a contiguous logic system "transforms" signals from the “crisp domain” to the “fuzzy domain”, makes decisions based on these fuzzy values and knowledge of the desired system operation cast in fuzzy terms (rules), and then transforms the results back into the crisp domain for execution.
- the justification is, as with frequency domain processing, that the system model is easier to understand and manipulate in the fuzzy domain than in the crisp domain.
- This basic fuzzy rule-based structure can be used in choosing a selective call protocol among a plurality of protocols. By allowing for flexibility in the definition of fuzzy logic operators, and especially in how action combination/defuzzification is performed, the breadth of application is even further increased.
- an adaptive system 10 for choosing a selective call protocol is shown in accordance with the present invention.
- the system 10 includes a system controller 12 or radio frequency manager that uses a contiguous logic controller 11 or sorter to determine which protocol to use.
- the contiguous logic controller 11 or sorter preferably comprises a fuzzifier 14, a rule-based element 16 or inference engine and a defuzzifier 18.
- the sorter 11 preferably classifies historical data and current information so as to select an optimum protocol among a plurality of protocols available for the next transmission of the selective call messages and alternatively select a second optimum protocol for the next transmission if the optimum protocol is not available.
- the fuzzifier 14 generates membership values for historical and current input conditions while the rule-based element 16 applies a set of predetermined rules of the current input conditions to perform a mapping with the historical conditions.
- the defuzzifier 18 preferably generates a non-fuzzy predicted recommendation from the mapping, and for generating the optimum protocol or alternatively for generating a second optimum protocol.
- the contiguous logic controller or sorter 11 simplifies the decision making process for the system controller 12 in determining whether to choose one protocol or another for transmission of a message through a transmitter 20.
- the sorter 11 uses the fuzzifier 14 as an input processing element for receiving biases for airtime efficiency, latency, priority, battery savings among other biases.
- the sorter 11 uses the defuzzifier 18 as an output processing element for outputing the optimum protocol and finally, the rule-based element 16 is used as an intermediate processing element for coupling the input processing element with the output processing element.
- the system 10 includes an operator to modify the rule-based element 16 and further preferably provides for built-in limits to prevent such modifications from exceeding safeguarded situations. The modifications can be achieved using a graphical input such as the interface 17 shown in FIG. 1.
- the assumption is made that the system controller 12 only needs to choose between two protocols for simplicity.
- the paging protocols used in the examples shown are FLEX® and POCSAG, but other protocols in any combination could potentially be used such as pACT, APOC, ERMES, or GOLAY.
- the radio frequency manager or system controller 12 preferably comprises a first memory 13 for storing historical data on messages previously sent, the historical data comprising for each protocol an airtime efficiency rating, a latency measurement, and a message queue profile. Of course, other historical data can be tracked as suitably required.
- the radio frequency manager or system controller 12 also preferably comprises a second memory 15 for storing a plurality of pending messages, each of the pending messages having current information comprising at least an associated priority, synchronization requirement, and allowable transmission time for the sending of the pending messages.
- FIGS. 2-7 show plots of membership functions for different characteristics corresponding to a selected batch of pending messages or protocol therefor, the characteristics used in the fuzzifier 14 to determine a degree of membership for the selected protocol in defined sets of each of the characteristics, given a crisp input value.
- Measured crisp input values are "fuzzified", using membership functions, into fuzzy truth values or degrees of membership. For instance, a FLEX message having a measured efficiency of 65%, would have a degree of membership of 0.15 in the set "HIGH” while also having a degree of membership of 0.27 in the set “LOW” in accordance with the membership function shown in FIG. 2.
- These are then applied as conditions to the rules contained in the rule-base of FIG. 9, with triggered rules specifying necessary actions, again as fuzzy truth values. For instance, see rule stating "IF flex -- latency IS high AND flex -- efficiency IS high THEN flex -- xmit -- need IS high.” This along with other actions are combined and “defuzzified” into crisp, executable system outputs.
- FIG. 2 is a plot of a membership function reflecting an Efficiency characteristic of a selected protocol in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a plot of a membership function reflecting a Latency characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 6 is a plot of a membership function reflecting a Priority characteristic of a selected batch of pending messages in accordance with the present invention. Messages with higher priorities should in general be sent prior to lower ones. This may not always happen however, even in efficient systems. If a particular priority page defines the other pages to be sent, a lower priority may be blocked, while still lower priority pages which are not blocked are sent. Preemptive priority (same examples as extreme latency cases) are a special case causing most other paging rules to become invalid until the page is sent.
- FIG. 7 is a plot of a membership function for FLEX Sync Required in accordance with the present invention.
- Another factor is the relative state of the system. During low RF utilization periods, efficiency may not be an important factor. When the system becomes heavily loaded however, latency may become a more important issue.
- the ideal system would take into account all the previous requirements in a form that is easy to understand and adjust, yet is robust and extensible.
- the present invention can closely approach the ideal system having sufficient inputs.
- the embodiment disclosed only considers choosing between two protocols: POCSAG and FLEXTM. As seen, the invention is easily extensible to an arbitrary number of different protocols.
- statistics relating to the batching and queuing of each protocol can generate inputs for the decision making process.
- a potential set preferably includes efficiency, latency, pendency (FIG. 4), pendency trend (FIG. 5), priority and synchronization.
- efficiency will show the fraction of time used for actual data transmission.
- Statistics on latency will show the average length of time pages are remaining in the queues before being sent.
- Statistics on pendency will would show the number of pages actually remaining in the queues for a given protocol type.
- Statistics on a pendency trend is derived from the number of messages pending during a specified time interval. A figure of merit indicating the increase and reduction in the size of the queue is therefore derived.
- Statistics on priority would show the priority assigned to a page either at input, or incremented by the system because of excessive individual residence in a queue.
- a contiguous logic set for a "need" to transmit a particular protocol which serves as an output set as shown in FIG. 8.
- Rules are then defined relating the inputs to the output set or sets.
- the rules are easily defined linguistically as shown in FIG. 9. The rules are then executed based on the statistics as they exist at each protocol choosing. Whichever protocol has the higher "need" determines the choice of the protocol used to transmit a particular message.
- the rules can be defined in other forms other than linguistically.
- the rules could be defined as a matrix of sets or the rules could utilize a neural net (see Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems, by Bart Kosko 1992) to refine the rules as the system operates in a real setting.
- Contiguous logic systems use neural systems to learn fuzzy rules from examples or to tune the rules.
- the net learns the fuzzy rules by adapting its dynamic structure.
- the rules emerge as the equilibrium states of the neural dynamic system.
- FIG. 10 illustrates a flow chart of a method 100 of choosing a selective call protocol among a plurality of selective call protocols in accordance with the present invention.
- a plurality of inputs are identified for use in a choosing a selective call protocol including inputs for airtime efficiency, latency, message queue profile, and subscriber unit battery savings profile.
- contiguous logic sets are defined or created for each of the inputs identified.
- a contiguous logic set for the desired output is created.
- rules are defined relating the contiguous logic sets for each input with the contiguous logic set for the desired output.
- statistics are maintained based on information received from the inputs.
- the rules are executed at step 112 when a choice of one of the plurality of selective call protocols is required based on the statistics maintained.
- the selective call protocol is selected with the highest need as determined by the rules.
- information is transmitted using the selective call protocol selected to have the highest need.
- the method 100 could further comprise the step 118 of modifying the relationships between the contiguous logic sets for each input and the contiguous logic set for the desired output by defining an inference engine using a linguistic rule base.
- the present invention preferably uses contiguous logic to define the decision making variables, wherein there can be consideration of all the variables affecting the decision process at all times.
- a customer such as a service provider can access, define, or refine weights which allow biasing of the decision making process, without leading to undesirable operating characteristics.
- use of linguistic rules can be used to determine the near optimum decision.
