Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to computer based voting applications, and more specifically, to a computer network based conditional voting system.
- ballots offer voters a limited choice, typically of one or more of the following: 1) vote Yes or No, and sometimes Indifferent and/or Abstain; 2) select one or more of multiple choices from a list; 3) write-in a desired selection; or 4) prioritize a list of alternatives.
- Example 1 Person A may not be well informed on the issue, but knows that person B is, and has a high degree of confidence in person B's judgment. Person A may therefore wish to vote "the same as B votes", whether or not A knows what B's vote is.
- traditional voting systems the only way A can vote with B is to consult with B before the vote takes place to find out how B is voting. But if B should change his vote at the last moment, or if A has no way of contacting B, or if B has not yet decided his vote when A and B are able to discuss the matter, then A cannot guarantee that his vote is the same as B's.
- A may wish to vote the way the "majority of B, C and D vote".
- the communication and logistical problems are three times as complicated as A merely voting with B.
- Example 2 Person A's primary goal may be to support the position of a person B (perhaps the employer or spouse of person A). A may therefore choose to vote whichever way B votes on a wide variety of matters. To achieve this end with conventional voting systems, A would need to consult with B on every single matter, a time-consuming and perhaps impossible requirement.
- Example 3 Persons A and B have agreed to trade votes on different issues. On issues 1, 3, 5, and 7, A will vote the same way as B. On issues 2, 4, 6, and 8, B will vote the same way as A. Again, to achieve this end with conventional voting systems, extensive and time-consuming coordination between A and B would be required.
- Example 4 Person A's primary goal is to support the majority's view. Person A may therefore choose to vote whichever way the majority votes. To achieve this end with conventional voting systems, A must either guess or conduct a poll of other voters before the vote, either of which could be inaccurate or could change, to assess the majority's vote before the voting takes place.
- Example 5 Person A does not particularly support an issue, but would vote in favor of it if all of persons B, G, M, P, S, W, and Z voted in favor of it. To achieve this end with conventional voting systems, would require contacting all of those individuals before the voting took place. (This example is similar to the majority of B, C and D in example 1 above.)
- Example 6 above is a case of what is more generally called the "common goods” problem.
- Conventional voting systems are particularly inadequate for these problems.
- "Common goods”, such as public parks, libraries, a clean environment, labor unions, lighthouses, fire departments, or a counter-attack on a belligerent aggressor nation, are beneficial to all, but all have some cost.
- "Common goods” can be abused by "free riders”. A “free rider” is someone or something that enjoys the benefit of the common good without helping to pay for it.
- a method and apparatus for a computer network based conditional voting system.
- the system is used by two or more persons to arrive at a decision and allows the users to vote either unconditionally (i.e., yes, no, or abstain) or conditionally on the votes of others within the voting group.
- Conditional votes can be dependent upon the votes of specific individuals, a specific group of individuals, a non-specific subset of the group, the group as a whole, upon independent events, or any combination of the above. Votes need not be weighted equally.
- the preferred embodiment uses a vote processor, a voting administrator, and one or more voting units.
- the vote processor is a computer which coordinates the overall voting process including soliciting and accepting input from the voting units and then tabulating and displaying the results.
- the vote administrator inputs or approves the vote proposal and terms of the vote into the vote processor.
- the voting units connected to the network by any means, are of various design including desktop mountable, handheld, and mobile. In the preferred embodiment the voting units' sole task is providing input/output (I/O) for voting while in an alternative embodiment, the voting units are general purpose devices with multiple functions, only one of which is voting.
- one or more parties submit and/or modify a proposal requiring a vote.
- input from each voter is solicited and accepted through the individual voting units.
- the voting may be either unconditional or conditional.
- the terms and conditions expressed by the vote administrator determine what form the conditional input can take.
- all input must be submitted by a first deadline.
- the vote processor then evaluates the conditional votes according to the terms of the vote, and tabulates the results.
- the results are displayed to the group of voters at which time a second vote is allowed.
- the vote processor cycles through the process of soliciting, accepting, evaluating, processing, and displaying the results until a final deadline is reached.

- FIGS. 1 and 2 show two different configurations of the conditional voting system disclosed in the present invention.
- FIG. 1 shows a "star” configuration
- FIG. 2 shows a "peer-peer” configuration. Any combination of these configurations is also possible.
- the voting units 14, 16, 18, and 20 and a vote administrator system 26 are networked to one or more vote processors 12.
- the vote processor(s) are one or more computers on which processing of votes take place.
- the vote processor(s) coordinate the voting process, solicit and accept input from the voting units, tabulate results, and feed back information to the voting units. If the network does not employ such a computer, as in FIG. 2, one or more of the voting units can handle these functions.
- the voting unit may be a desktop unit 14, a portable, handheld unit 16, a mobile unit 18 for moving vehicle, water, air or space craft, or it may be embedded in a computer 20. Any number of voting units of any type are allowed. Each voting unit may either be a dedicated device, with the sole task of providing I/O for voting, or it may be a general purpose device (such as a personal computer or intelligent TV set) with multiple functions, one of which is voting. Each voting unit includes a keyboard, keypad or similar data entry device for vote input, and an information display for output.
- Each voting unit is typically used by an independent decision-maker.
- This decision-maker may either be a person, a group of people voting as one, a computer program, or a group of computer programs acting as a single decision-making entity. It is also possible for multiple persons or programs to share the same voting unit and act as independent decision-makers. In this case, the voting system must be able to accept and recognize the input of multiple voters from that voting unit.
- a voting unit If a voting unit is to be used by one or more persons, the unit requires a keyboard, keypad, or other data entry device for vote input, and an information display for output. If a voting unit is to be used by one or more computer programs, the unit requires a programming interface from which the unit can accept input and to which it can write output.
- the vote administrator may be either a person or a program. If it is a person, vote administrator system 26 must include a keyboard or other data entry device and a display, to allow the vote administrator to input the vote proposal and terms of the vote to the system. If the vote administrator is a program, a programming interface is required between the program and the voting system for the same purpose. If the network does not employ a separate vote administrator system, as in FIG. 2, one of the voting units may perform this function.
- the network 22 (FIG. 1) or the network 24 (FIG. 2) may be based on any form of local or wide area network, including cable, leased lines, switched lines, wireless, or any combination thereof.
- the network may be shared by other devices and applications, or dedicated to the voting system.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of the preferred embodiment of the invention.
- voting begins when an individual, the proposal originator, develops one or more vote proposals.
- a vote proposal may take many forms. It may be able to be voted on affirmatively or negatively, or it may contain multiple alternatives that can be prioritized, that is, ranked, by voters.
- a vote administrator is a person or program charged with specifying terms and conditions of a voting. The vote administrator may be the same as, or different from, the proposal originator. Either the proposal originator or the vote administrator must enter the proposal into the system in electronic form (step A). In the preferred embodiment the proposal is entered by keyboard. If the proposal is entered by the originator, the system makes it available electronically to the vote administrator, for example on a computer screen.
- the vote administrator specifies the terms and conditions for the votes (step B), such as who may vote, voting deadline(s), and constraints, if any, on allowed vote types.
- the voting system then notifies members of the group through the voting units or through other means that there are one or more proposals to be voted on (step C).
- each voter reviews the proposals along with any related remarks or justifications provided by the originator.
- the voters themselves can then comment on each proposal (step D), and send these comments through the network to all of the voters or any subset of the voters.
- the voters vote on the proposal (step E), either unconditionally (yes, no, abstain), or conditionally, depending upon what vote types were allowed by the vote administrator (see different types below). If a voter does not vote by a deadline, the voting system registers the voter as a no vote.
- All votes do not have to be weighted the same. If specified by the vote administrator, some votes may be weighted differently from each other. The default weighting of a vote is 1.0. If the vote administrator weights voter x's vote by the factor W(x), 0 ⁇ W(x), then voter x's vote will be treated as W(x) separate votes in final tabulations of all of the votes.
- the system then processes the votes to compute their values (represented as signals).
- a processed vote may have either a unique computed value, multiple values, or no meaningful value (i.e., no solution).
- An unconditional vote always has a unique value--either yes, no or abstain--but a conditional vote may have either a unique value, multiple values, or no meaningful value.
- the vote terms determine, among other things, how multiple values and no meaningful values of votes are handled. For example, if the computed value of a vote is either yes or no, the terms may specify that "yes" will always be selected and presented as output.
- the terms may specify that both values must be presented as output. If a vote has no meaningful computed value, the terms may specify that this fact be presented as output, or they may specify that the voter who casts that vote change his or her vote. Votes that have multiple computed values are called herein indeterminate. Votes that have no meaningful values or solutions are called herein unresolvable.
- the output or results provided by the system may take any of several forms. If all of the votes have unique computed values, the results may simply be a total of the number of yeses, nos, abstains, and no votes. If some of the votes have multiple computed values, the terms will specify which value or values of these votes will be selected. These values are then included in a tally or tallies of the values of the votes with unique values. For example, suppose that the computed value of vote #1 is uniquely yes, the computed value of vote #2 is uniquely yes, and the computed values of votes #3 and #4 are either (yes and yes), or (no and no).
- the terms specify that the value "yes” is always chosen for a vote with multiple computed values (assuming that one of the computed values is yes), then the tally in this case would be 4 yeses and no nos. If, on the other hand, the terms specify that all computed values of a vote must be presented, then two separate tallies--4 yeses and no nos, and 2 yeses and 2 nos--would be reported. The terms may further specify that the set or list of all computed values by voter be reported. With the first set of terms above, there would be a single set or list. With the second set of terms above, there would be two such sets or lists. If some of the votes have no meaningful solutions, they would be omitted from the tallies of yeses, nos, and abstains.
- Results may take other forms as well.
- Results may include a listing of the conditional votes themselves, or as described below, static or animated graphics that show the degree of consensus in the group, either at a point in time or as it changes over time. These results may further help the group move toward consensus.
- Step F is divided into three (3) stages, which are illustrated in FIGS. 9A-B and 10A-E.
- step G Many votings are iterative (step G), that is, voters cast their votes, see the results, perhaps modify their votes and comments, and vote again.
- the voting system again tabulates and presents the results. This process is repeated until a particular result or deadline is reached.
- FIG. 4 is a table illustrating three categories of votes. Type 1 votes are unconditional votes with no dependencies: yes, no, abstain, no vote. Types 2 and 3 are conditional.
- Type 2 votes have group dependencies (conditions) only; they are dependent only on the voting of the group as a whole (e.g., "I vote yes if and only if 50% or more of the group votes yes"), not of the votes of specific individuals. As far as group dependencies are concerned, individual voters are indistinguishable from one another. Type 2 votes are especially important for moving the group towards consensus.
- each voter can express a group condition in terms of the total number of voters, including himself/herself, or in terms of the rest of the voters, excluding himself/herself.
- a group condition can be also expressed either in terms of percentages (e.g., 50% of the group) or in units (e.g., 10 or more votes).
- Type 3 votes are dependent on the votes of specific individuals in the group (e.g., "I vote yes if and only if A, B and C vote yes”). Type 3 votes may also have group dependencies (e.g., "I vote yes if and only if A votes yes, and if 50% or more of the group votes yes”). Type 3 votes, in effect, may be conditional on any logical statements L and L' about the voters.
- the general form of a type 3 vote is: "Yes, if L is true; else no, if L' is true; else abstain.”
- the general form of a type 3 vote is: "Rank order #1, if L is true; rank order #2, if L" is true; rank order #3, if L'" is true; rank order #4, if L"" is true, etc.”
- type 3 votes are: (i) voting the same as another person's vote; (ii) voting the opposite of another person's vote; (iii) voting the way the majority of parties x, y, and z vote; and (iv) voting yes if at least 50% of the group, including x, y, and z vote yes.
- the conditions of a vote may themselves be conditional or unconditional, as in the following two examples:
- voter #2 votes yes if and only if voter #3 votes yes, conditionally or unconditionally, and voter #3 votes yes unconditionally
- voter #1 would vote no. This is because in the first case #1's vote was conditioned on 2 vote being unconditional, which it wasn't.
- voter #1's vote would be yes since its condition allows for voter #2's yes vote to be either conditional (which it is) or unconditional.
- condition is not specific as to whether it is conditional or unconditional, it is assumed to be conditional. For example, in "Voter A votes yes if B votes yes", it is assumed that what is important to A is that the final determined value of B's vote is yes, rather than how B arrived at it. If it is important to A that B vote yes unconditionally, this should be specified in A's condition.
- Voter #1 votes yes if and only if 60% or more vote: yes unconditionally (an unconditional condition).
- Voter #1 votes yes if and only if 60% or more vote yes (conditionally or unconditionally).
- voter #1's vote would be no, since only #3 voted yes unconditionally.
- One vote out of three is less than the required 60%.
- voter #1's vote would be yes. Not only do voters #2's and #3's votes meet #1's condition, but #1's own yes vote helps meet #1's condition.
- #1's vote is called recursive with a group dependency only.
- Voter #1 votes yes if two or more vote yes
- Voter #2 votes yes if two or more vote yes.
- Voter #3 votes no (unconditionally).
- vote #1 relies on both vote #2 and itself to meet its condition; vote #2, in turn, relies on both vote #1 and itself.
- #1's and #2's votes could be either both yes or both no.
- These cases are resolvable but are indeterminate, that is, they have multiple solutions (determined in stage 3 of the voting system). In general, allowing voters to vote the same way as each other can lead to multiple solutions. In the simplest case, if A votes the same way as B, and B votes the same way as A, the two votes could be either Yes-Yes or No-No.
- the terms set by the vote administrator determine whether the system presents or reports all or a subset of the multiple solutions, when they arise.
- the default assumption where a group of votes has multiple solutions is usually the one with the most yeses.
- the vote administrator may specify any of the following output alternatives: i) present all solutions; ii) present all solutions that meet certain criteria, such as all solutions with three or more yeses; or iii) present only those solutions with either the most yeses or the most nos; or iv) present an "average" of all solutions.
- the system can recommend to voters whose votes cause the multiple solutions how their votes can be modified to eliminate multiple solutions.
- the system reports whose votes contain no solution, either to only the individuals casting those votes or to the group as a whole, depending upon the terms of the vote.
- One or both of the voters need to change their votes to make a solution possible.
- a partial solution is a subset of all of the votes that have a solution.
- the voting system identifies the partial solutions with the most votes, and identifies the unresolvable votes.
- a group of votes may contain some votes with multiple values and others that are unresolvable.
- the voting system can handle any set of conditions on the group as a whole or on individual members of the group, no matter how complex or intertwined.
- the system can determine which vote or votes are most or least critical in obtaining a particular result.
- One way to do this is by tabulating the number of times particular votes are referenced as conditions in others' votes.
- the number of times a vote is used in conditions negatively may be subtracted from the number of times the vote is used in conditions positively to arrive at the vote's net positive impact on a particular result.
- Certain votes with only group dependencies can help build consensus and overcome the common goods/free rider problem. Called consensus building votes, they allow a voter to vote in favor of a proposal, such as a common goods proposal, if and only if a specified percentage of the entire group supports it. For example: "I will support the building of a public park in our neighborhood (and contribute my share of the cost) if and only if 80% of the voters similarly support it.” If at least 80% of the group vote similarly, the park will be approved. Those voters will have the assurance that at least 80% of the group will contribute their share.
- the general form of the consensus building vote type is; "I vote yes if greater than or equal to x% of the group vote yes; else, I vote no.”
- Another form of the consensus building vote type, most appropriate if all members of the group are casting votes that are either of this type or unconditional is; "I vote yes if greater than or equal to x% of the group vote yes, if greater than or equal to y% vote yes; else I vote no," where 0 ⁇ x ⁇ 100 and 0 ⁇ y ⁇ x.
- the consensus building vote type allows a voter to commit to what may be a risky position only if a certain number or percent of the rest of the group similarly commit, reducing the risk to all of the voters.
- the voting system can provide a novel graphical display of the degree of agreement or disagreement among the voters.
- the consensus building chart helps the group move towards and reach consensus. It may also be possible to produce the chart if some of the votes are neither unconditional nor consensus building. Even if the chart is not requested as output, the system typically performs the sorting and comparisons needed to draw the chart to value consensus building votes. If more than one solution is possible, the chart identifies the solution with the largest number of yeses.
- the consensus building chart allows a group to see how close or far away it is from achieving consensus, or from achieving a coalition of a particular size. If a voting has successive iterations, the graph may vary with each iteration. In that case, the graph can be updated or played back in real time, allowing voters to review an animated history of the group's preferences as they have evolved, to visually gauge the momentum towards consensus, or to pinpoint turning points or major events in the group's dynamics.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a consensus building chart with three successive iterations; y 1 , y 2 , and y 3 . The figure shows how the acceptance of the proposal has changed with each successive vote, indicating that at least some of the individual voters have modified their votes. Similarly, if y 1 , y 2 , and y 3 were to indicate three different proposals, then a chart looking like FIG. 5 could be used to gauge the relative acceptance of each distinct proposal.
- the chart orders the voters available (x axis) to support a proposal by the total number or percent of voters they require (y axis), including themselves, to support the proposal. Where the number of voters available equals or exceeds the number of voters required, those voters' votes can be correctly determined to be yes votes. These voters are said either to support the proposal or to form a coalition favoring the proposal.
- Amy (cautiously) supports a proposal if and only if five (5) or more people in the group, including herself, support it (maximum of one dissenter).
- Bill a strong advocate, supports the proposal in any event (no one other than himself is required for his support).
- FIG. 6 is a table illustrating the above information. Ordering the voters by their conditions as described above, Bill and Charlie would be ordered #1 and #2; Dave, #3; Amy, #4; Ed, #5 and Frank, #6 (FIG. 7). If Charlie subsequently raised his requirement from one person to three, he would shift from #2 to #3, and Dave would shift from #3 to #2. In FIG. 7 this ordering is called "x".
- the system then plots the number of members needed (y) to form a coalition as a function of the ordered members (x). If the number of members required (y) is less than or equal to the number of members available (x), a coalition can form.
- the members of the coalition are those members of the group for whom y(x) ⁇ x (FIG. 8).
- a coalition can form. If y(x)>x for all values of x, no ones' conditions are met, and no coalition can form.
- the supporting coalition will include all voters x c whose values of x are smaller than x max , where x max is the largest value of x for which y(x max ) ⁇ x max .
- the supporting coalition may well include values of x c for which y(x c )>x c . But as long as x c ⁇ x max , and y(x max ) ⁇ x max , x c 's vote can be correctly interpreted as a yes (there may be other solutions as well).
- FIGS. 9A-B and 10A-E detail the three stages of step F in FIG. 3 (step E from FIG. 3 is shown in FIGS. 9A and 10A to provide a frame of reference).
- FIGS. 10A-E are a more detailed version of FIGS. 9A-B.
- the purposes of the three stages are as follows:
- Stage 1 (steps H and I)--Assess all unconditional votes (type 1 votes--yes, no, abstain, no vote) and all votes directly or indirectly dependent on those unconditional votes only (some type 2 and 3 votes).
- Stage 2 (steps J through L in FIG. 9A; steps P through T in FIG. 10B)--Iteratively determine 1) consensus building vote types and 2) votes dependent on all previously determined votes. Repeat these two steps until no more new votes can be determined.
- step H the system examines the votes in whatever order they happen to be in, and identifies the unconditional ones (yes, no, abstain, no-vote). As the system examines each vote, it also evaluates any conditional votes that have become determinable as a result of unconditional votes now determined. Votes so determined are conditional votes that are dependent only on the unconditional votes. Then the system passes through the list again and evaluates all new votes that are dependent only on the ones previously determined, either conditional or unconditional. This process is repeated until an iteration occurs on which no new votes are determined. If all votes in the group have been determined by this process (step I), the system is finished and the results are displayed. If all votes have not been determined, we proceed to stage 2 (step J in FIG. 9A; P in FIG. 9B).
- a group of 5 people vote as follows. (Note that although the vote types are indicated, the system does not need to recognize or categorize them as such.)
- the system can first order the votes from simplest to most complex conditions. By doing so, fewer passes may be required. For example, the system could first order the above votes as follows:
- New #2 (old #2): Yes if (new) #1 votes yes, else no;
- New #3 (old #3): Yes if (new) #5 votes yes, else no;
- New #5 (old #4): Yes if ⁇ 4 people vote yes, else no.
- stage 2 At the beginning of stage 2 (J in FIG. 9A, P in FIG. 10B), the system first checks whether there are any votes not yet determined of the form:
- the system computes the consensus building chart (J in both FIGS. 9A and 10B) for as many votes as fit the chart format, to determine as many consensus building votes as possible.
- step Q Since a new vote, #5, was determined (step Q), and since all votes have not yet been determined (step R), the system performs step K, which is identical to the second part of step H (FIGS. 9A and 10A).
- step K evaluates any votes dependent only on votes previously determined.
- step K we determine #3 (yes) from the newly determined #5 vote (yes). The solution with the most number of yeses (all yeses) has now been determined. If requested, the system draws the consensus building chart and presents it to the voters. (If the voting terms specify finding other solutions as well as the one with the most number of yeses, the system will proceed with stage 3 to search for other solutions.)
- stage 3 is reached only if undetermined votes remain after stages 1 and 2.
- u be the number of undetermined votes at the end of stage 2.
- the system generates (step W) and tries (step X) the 2 u possible combinations of u votes: (Y,Y . . . Y); (Y,Y . . . N); . . . (N,N . . . N).
- step W the system generates (step W) and tries (step X) the 2 u possible combinations of u votes: (Y,Y . . . Y); (Y,Y . . . N); . . . (N,N . . . N).
- step X the 2 u possible combinations of u votes: (Y,Y . . . Y); (Y,Y . . . N); . . . (N,N . . . N).
- These combinations are called group trial assumptions or, if they satisfy all
- stage 3 There are two nested main logic loops in stage 3, a larger outer loop and a smaller inner loop.
- the outer loop tests a particular group trial assumption. This outer loop starts after step X and ends at step MM (FIG. 10E), at which point counter i is incremented for the next group trial assumption. (Counter i is initialized in step X).
- the inner loop tests a single undetermined vote within the larger group trial. This inner loop starts at step AA and ends at step EE, at which point counter j is incremented for the next undetermined vote within the larger group trial. (Counter j is initialized in step Y). If u is the number of undetermined votes, there will be up to u circuits of the inner loop for each circuit of the outer loop.
- Step AA tests whether the conditions of a particular undetermined vote are met by the current group trial assumption. If so, control passes to BB, where the vote is marked as valid. If not, control passes to CC, where the vote is marked as unresolvable for this group trial.
- Step LL checks whether there are any more group trials to be tested. If so, i is incremented (MM) and the next trial is tested. If not, step NN checks whether any complete solutions were found. If so, the system displays the complete solutions specified by the terms of the vote (PP). If none were complete, the system determines (as described in examples #3 and #4 below) primary and secondary unresolvable votes (QQ) and displays the best partial solution(s).
- the following example of a group of eight voters requires going through stages 1 through 3 of the voting system. To avoid multiple iterations in stage 1, the votes have been ordered in an optimal way. This does not affect the result.
- the group votes are as follows:
- FIG. 13 shows the step at which each vote is determined.
- the bold votes (Y) indicate new votes determined in that step.
- a check mark () indicates that the vote condition was met by the group trial assumption, while an x (X) indicates that the condition was not met.
- the ValidSolution flag is set equal to 1 (GG).
- the solution for voters #7 and #8 is combined with the results for the previously determined votes #1 through #6 (denoted ⁇ D ⁇ in step HH) and stored. After the remaining trial assumption 4 is tried (unsuccessfully), the unique solution (seven yeses, one no) is displayed as specified by the voting terms.
- the 2 4 16 group trials evaluated are (Y,Y,Y,Y) through (N,N,N,N). Of these, (Y,Y,Y,Y) and (N,N,N,N) are the two complete valid solutions. Most likely, (Y,Y,Y,Y) would be the preferred solution.
- #5 vote as the majority of (#2, #3, and #4)
- Votes #1 and #2 are opposite each other, and the remaining votes all depend on those conflicting votes.
- the set of votes is assessed entirely in stage 3.
- votes #1 and #2 are primary unresolvable votes, and that there are no partial solutions. Either voter #1 or voter #2, or both, must change their votes so as not to be opposed to each others' votes to make even a partial solution possible.
- Votes #1 and #2 are unresolvable, and votes #3 and #4 have multiple solutions.
- the set of votes is assessed entirely in stage 3.
- FIG. 17 shows these eight trials, and identifies votes #1 and #2 as the unresolvable kernel.
- the unresolvable votes are marked by a strikethrough (-), the yes votes by a Y, and the no votes by a N.
- the votes are checked for dependency on the unresolved votes, which would also be unresolvable. There are no such votes. Assuming the best result is the one with the most yeses, then the best result would be:
- the vote administrator Before a voting can occur, the terms and conditions under which it is to take place must be set. This is the job of vote administrator 26.
- the vote administrator may be the same or different from the proposal originator.
- the vote administrator specifies the following:
- Proposition Statement of the proposal or question on which the group is voting.
- Acceptance criteria What constitutes acceptance of the proposition? Greater than 50%? Two-thirds majority? Unanimous? Any percentage can be specified. If the purpose of the vote to identify the largest coalition(s) that support the proposal, acceptance criteria are optional. If used, acceptance criteria can specify the minimum number or percent of members that must be in the coalition for the overall group to acknowledge/accept the coalition. The system will typically identify the largest coalition or coalitions (if there are more than one of equal or near equal size) that supports the proposal.
- Vote iterations and deadline A conditional voting will typically be an iterative process with feedback provided.
- the iterations may be either of two types:
- Discrete--A succession of discrete, scheduled votes are conducted, usually at regular intervals, until a certain deadline is reached. Updated vote results are provided to the users immediately after each iteration. Voters may change their votes any number of times before each scheduled vote without effecting the feedback of that vote; only the vote cast at the scheduled voting time effects the feedback. Similarly, voters may change their votes any number of times in the scheduled votes before the final vote is conducted. Only the vote cast in the final voting is counted. The administrator may specify that votes be cast near simultaneously, within some narrow specified time interval.
- Allowability of modified proposals The administrator 26 can specify whether modifications of an original proposal/question may be put forward by members of the group, and if so, under what circumstances. Modifications can be allowed only if first approved by:
- Unconditional yes, no, abstain and no-vote comprise the simplest set of votes. If conditional votes are also allowed, they may include: 1) conditional only on the votes of people who vote unconditionally; 2) conditional only on the number of votes cast the same way, conditionally or unconditionally; 3) conditional on the votes of specific people cast the same way, conditionally or unconditionally (e.g. I will vote yes if and only if at least two of A, B and C vote yes); 4) conditional on either the number of people or specific people voting either the same way or the opposite way, with or without qualification (e.g. if A votes yes, I will vote no; if A votes no, I will vote yes); 5) any combination of the above. In addition to simple yes, no, and abstain votes with or without conditions, allowed votes may include prioritized lists of alternatives, with or without conditions.
- Vote weightings whether all votes will be weighted equally or some votes weighted differently from each other. The default weighting of a vote is 1.0. If voter x's vote is weighted by the factor W(x), 0 ⁇ W(x), then voter x's vote will be treated as W(x) separate votes in final tabulations of all of the votes.
- Blocking Whether voters can "block” other voters from including the former's votes in the latter's conditions.
- Additional information such as the breakdown of votes by various voter categories, can also be displayed.
- Output confidentiality Whether the voters are to be fully identified, end-result identified, fully anonymous, labelled, or probabilistically anonymous.
- “Fully identified” means that all votes, including the conditions upon which the votes are based, are available to everyone.
- End-result identified means that the final result (yes, no, abstain, indeterminate, and non-vote) of everyone's vote is identified with that voter, but not the conditions the voter specified which led to the final result.
- “Fully anonymous” means that only simple vote tallies--the number of yes, no, abstain, and indeterminate votes, and the number of non-voters--are made available to everyone.
- Probabilistically anonymous means that the vote administrator can specify a probability P, 0 ⁇ P ⁇ 1.
- the vote information made available to the voters is the same as “fully anonymous” or “labelled”, depending upon the choice of the administrator, with probability 1-P, and is the same as "fully identified” with probability P.
- the probability P may be applied either to the voting group as a whole, or to voters individually and independently, depending upon the choice of the administrator.
- the vote administrator can also specify whether any of these confidentiality alternatives may be overridden by individual voters, for example, whether an end user's vote is allowed to remain anonymous even if the general setting is "fully identified.”
