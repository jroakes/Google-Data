- the method can include the data processing system providing, responsive to the request from the computing device, the audio track of the digital component object to the computing device for output via a speaker of the computing device.
- the data processing system can construct a baseline audio track of the digital component object with the text rendered by the digital voice.
- the data processing system can generate, based on the digital component object, non-spoken audio cues.
- the data processing system can combine the non-spoken audio cues with the baseline audio form of the digital component object to generate an audio track of the digital component object.
- the data processing system can provide the audio track of the digital component object to the computing device for output via a speaker of the computing device.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of a system to generate audio tracks, in accordance with an implementation.
- This technical solution is generally directed to generating audio tracks.
- the systems and methods of the technical solution can process visual content to generate an audio track with spoke and non-spoken audio cues.
- certain types of computing devices may provide an audio-only interface (e.g., receive voice input from a user, process the input, and provide audio or spoken output via a digital voice).
- Certain computing devices may primarily use an audio user interface, or may primarily use an audio interface under certain circumstances.
- a user of a mobile computing device may primarily use an audio-only interface while driving a vehicle, running, or listening to a streaming music service.
- a data processing system can provide audio digital component objects (e.g., audio content items).
- the data processing system can select an audio content item established or provided by a third-party audio content provider.
- the data processing system can provide the audio content items in response to a request for content from the user or based on another trigger event.
- content items established by the third-party content provider may not be audio content items.
- the data processing system may determine to select such a content item based on matching criteria such as keywords, relevancy or other factors.
- the data processing system may be unable to provide the content item to the computing device because the computing device only has an audio-based interface.
- the data processing system can cause inefficient or wasted computing utilization or a negative user experience by providing the visual content item and causing the computing device to render the visual content item using a display of the computing device.
- a display may waste battery power on a mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone, smart watch, or other wearable device).
- the data processing system by providing visual content where audio content is preferred, or being unable to provide the most relevant content item because it is only available in a visual format, may result in wasted computing resource utilization by a mobile computing device or degraded user experience.
- Systems and methods of the present technical solution can use natural language processing and models trained using machine learning techniques and historical data to select a format (e.g., audio only, audio-visual format, and modes of interaction based on type of computing device and current context of computing device), automatically generate text based on visual content item and associated metadata, select an appropriate digital voice print for generated spoken text, and select and provide non-spoken audio cues along with the spoken text.
- a format e.g., audio only, audio-visual format, and modes of interaction based on type of computing device and current context of computing device
- a computing device can be configured with both a visual user interface (e.g., a display screen with a touch screen for user input) and an audio-based user interface (e.g., microphone and speaker).
- the computing device can currently be streaming music for output via a speaker associated with the computing device.
- the data processing system can select a third-party content item using information associated with a request, a query, or the streaming music.
- the selected third-party content item can be a visual content item (e.g., an image that can include text).
- the data processing system can select this visual content item based on keywords associated with the request, query, or streaming music.
- the selected visual content item can be a highest ranking content item determined based on a real-time content selection process in which content items can be ranked based at least on a relevancy score.
- the data processing system can determine that the computing device is configured with a visual user interface (e.g., display screen and touch screen input), and an audio user interface (e.g., speaker for output and microphone for input). However, the data processing system can further determine based on the current functionality of the computing device that the interface that is primarily being used currently is an audio-based interface.
- the data processing system can determine that although the computing device is configured with both visual and audio interfaces, that the primary interface currently being used is the audio interface and that generating an audio content item based on the visual content item to provide for rendering by the content item would reduce battery consumption by the computing device or wasted computing resources (e.g., provide the audio content item along with the streaming music instead of waking up a display of the computing device) and improve the user experience provided by the computing device (e.g., provide the audio content item in a non-distracting manner).
- This technical solution therefore, can seamlessly transition content items between different modalities to reduce battery or computing resource utilization, while improving user interface functionality and user experience.
- the data processing system can determine an insertion time in the audio music stream.
- the data processing system can further dynamically determine whether to accompany the audio content item with any visual indicator, and what types of interactivity to configure for the content item.
- the network 105 can be used to access information resources such as web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource locators that can be presented, output, rendered, or displayed on at least one computing device 140 , such as a laptop, desktop, tablet, personal digital assistant, smart phone, portable computers, or speaker.
- a user of the computing device 140 can access information or data provided by a 3P digital content provider device 160 .
- the computing device 140 can include a display device 146 and a speaker (e.g., transducer driven by an audio driver 150 ).
- the computing device 140 may or may not include a display; for example, the computing device may include limited types of user interfaces, such as a microphone and speaker (e.g., a smart speaker). In some cases, the primary user interface of the computing device 140 may be a microphone and speaker.
- the computing device 140 can interface with or be included in a voice-based computing environment.
- the network 105 can be used by the data processing system 102 to access information resources such as applications, web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource locators that can be presented, output, rendered, or displayed by the client computing device 140 .

- the data processing system 102 can include at least one computation resource, server, processor or memory.
- the data processing system 102 can include a plurality of computation resources or servers located in at least one data center.
- the data processing system 102 can include multiple, logically-grouped servers and facilitate distributed computing techniques.
- the logical group of servers may be referred to as a data center, server farm or a machine farm.
- the servers can also be geographically dispersed.
- a data center or machine farm may be administered as a single entity, or the machine farm can include a plurality of machine farms.
- the servers within each machine farm can be heterogeneous—one or more of the servers or machines can operate according to one or more type of operating system platform.
- Servers in the machine farm can be stored in high-density rack systems, along with associated storage systems, and located in an enterprise data center. For example, consolidating the servers in this way may improve system manageability, data security, the physical security of the system, and system performance by locating servers and high performance storage systems on localized high performance networks. Centralization of all or some of the data processing system 102 components, including servers and storage systems, and coupling them with advanced system management tools allows more efficient use of server resources, which saves power and processing requirements and reduces bandwidth usage.

FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a general architecture for a computer system that can be employed to implement elements of the system depicted inFIG. 1 and method depicted inFIG. 2 . - Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and implementations of, methods, apparatus, and systems of generating audio tracks. For example, the methods, apparatus, and systems can generate an audio track from visual content. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways.
- This technical solution is generally directed to generating audio tracks. The systems and methods of the technical solution can process visual content to generate an audio track with spoke and non-spoken audio cues. For example, certain types of computing devices may provide an audio-only interface (e.g., receive voice input from a user, process the input, and provide audio or spoken output via a digital voice). Certain computing devices may primarily use an audio user interface, or may primarily use an audio interface under certain circumstances. For example, a user of a mobile computing device may primarily use an audio-only interface while driving a vehicle, running, or listening to a streaming music service. When the primary interface is audio-based, a data processing system can provide audio digital component objects (e.g., audio content items). For example, the data processing system can select an audio content item established or provided by a third-party audio content provider. The data processing system can provide the audio content items in response to a request for content from the user or based on another trigger event. However, content items established by the third-party content provider may not be audio content items. The data processing system may determine to select such a content item based on matching criteria such as keywords, relevancy or other factors. However, the data processing system may be unable to provide the content item to the computing device because the computing device only has an audio-based interface. Or, in some cases, if the computing device primarily utilizes an audio interface, or the audio interface is the most efficient interface, then the data processing system can cause inefficient or wasted computing utilization or a negative user experience by providing the visual content item and causing the computing device to render the visual content item using a display of the computing device. Using the display may waste battery power on a mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone, smart watch, or other wearable device). Thus, the data processing system, by providing visual content where audio content is preferred, or being unable to provide the most relevant content item because it is only available in a visual format, may result in wasted computing resource utilization by a mobile computing device or degraded user experience.
- Further, it can be technically challenging to generate a content item in a different format due to various technical problems including, for example, determining the format in which to generate the content item, how to generate the spoken text accurately for a visual content item that may or may not include any text, selecting an appropriate voice for the generated spoken text, and adding non-spoken audio cues. Systems and methods of the present technical solution can use natural language processing and models trained using machine learning techniques and historical data to select a format (e.g., audio only, audio-visual format, and modes of interaction based on type of computing device and current context of computing device), automatically generate text based on visual content item and associated metadata, select an appropriate digital voice print for generated spoken text, and select and provide non-spoken audio cues along with the spoken text.
- For example, a computing device can be configured with both a visual user interface (e.g., a display screen with a touch screen for user input) and an audio-based user interface (e.g., microphone and speaker). The computing device can currently be streaming music for output via a speaker associated with the computing device. The data processing system can select a third-party content item using information associated with a request, a query, or the streaming music. The selected third-party content item can be a visual content item (e.g., an image that can include text). The data processing system can select this visual content item based on keywords associated with the request, query, or streaming music. For example, the selected visual content item can be a highest ranking content item determined based on a real-time content selection process in which content items can be ranked based at least on a relevancy score. The data processing system can determine that the computing device is configured with a visual user interface (e.g., display screen and touch screen input), and an audio user interface (e.g., speaker for output and microphone for input). However, the data processing system can further determine based on the current functionality of the computing device that the interface that is primarily being used currently is an audio-based interface. Thus, the data processing system can determine that although the computing device is configured with both visual and audio interfaces, that the primary interface currently being used is the audio interface and that generating an audio content item based on the visual content item to provide for rendering by the content item would reduce battery consumption by the computing device or wasted computing resources (e.g., provide the audio content item along with the streaming music instead of waking up a display of the computing device) and improve the user experience provided by the computing device (e.g., provide the audio content item in a non-distracting manner). This technical solution, therefore, can seamlessly transition content items between different modalities to reduce battery or computing resource utilization, while improving user interface functionality and user experience.
- Upon creating an audio content item, the data processing system can determine an insertion time in the audio music stream. The data processing system can further dynamically determine whether to accompany the audio content item with any visual indicator, and what types of interactivity to configure for the content item.

For example, via the network 105 a user of thecomputing device 140 can access information or data provided by a 3P digitalcontent provider device 160. Thecomputing device 140 can include adisplay device 146 and a speaker (e.g., transducer driven by an audio driver 150). Thecomputing device 140 may or may not include a display; for example, the computing device may include limited types of user interfaces, such as a microphone and speaker (e.g., a smart speaker). In some cases, the primary user interface of thecomputing device 140 may be a microphone and speaker. Thecomputing device 140 can interface with or be included in a voice-based computing environment. - The
network 105 can be used by thedata processing system 102 to access information resources such as applications, web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource locators that can be presented, output, rendered, or displayed by theclient computing device 140.

data processing system 102 can include at least one logic device such as a computing device having a processor to communicate via thenetwork 105. Thedata processing system 102 can include at least one computation resource, server, processor or memory. For example, thedata processing system 102 can include a plurality of computation resources or servers located in at least one data center. Thedata processing system 102 can include multiple, logically-grouped servers and facilitate distributed computing techniques. The logical group of servers may be referred to as a data center, server farm or a machine farm. The servers can also be geographically dispersed. A data center or machine farm may be administered as a single entity, or the machine farm can include a plurality of machine farms. The servers within each machine farm can be heterogeneous—one or more of the servers or machines can operate according to one or more type of operating system platform. - Servers in the machine farm can be stored in high-density rack systems, along with associated storage systems, and located in an enterprise data center. For example, consolidating the servers in this way may improve system manageability, data security, the physical security of the system, and system performance by locating servers and high performance storage systems on localized high performance networks. Centralization of all or some of the
data processing system 102 components, including servers and storage systems, and coupling them with advanced system management tools allows more efficient use of server resources, which saves power and processing requirements and reduces bandwidth usage. - The

Converting a content item can refer to or include generating a new content item in a different format (e.g., generating an audio track from a visual content item, or generating an audio-visual content item from a visual-only content item). The new content item may or may not include portions of the original content item.

Thevoice model 126 can also be trained using performance information associated with the historical content items. - The
action model 128 can include a model trained using themachine learning engine 122 that can determine, for a content item, a type of action or interaction.

Thedata processing system 102 can use theaction model 128 to determine or predict a likely interaction with the content item, and then configure the content item for the predicted interaction. Theaction model 128 can also include categories of content items that map to predetermined actions. - The

The input audio signal can be “Digital assistant, I need someone to do my laundry and my dry cleaning.” Apre-processor 142 of theclient computing device 140 can detect a wakeup word, hot word, or trigger keyword in the input audio signal, such as “Digital assistant”. The pre-processor 142 can detect the wakeup word, hot word, or trigger keyword by comparing an audio signature or waveform in the input audio signal with a model audio signature or waveform that corresponds to the trigger keyword. The pre-processor 142 can determine that the input audio signal includes a wakeup word, hot word, or trigger keyword that indicates that the input audio signal is to be processed by the naturallanguage processor component 106. Responsive to detecting hot word, wakeup word, or trigger keyword, the pre-processor 142 can determine, authorize, route, forward, or other provide the detected input audio signal to thedata processing system 102 for processing by the naturallanguage processor component 106. - The natural
language processor component 106 can receive the input audio signal and apply a semantic processing technique, or other natural language processing technique, to the input audio signal comprising the sentence to identify trigger phrases “do my laundry” and “do my dry cleaning”. In some cases, the naturallanguage processor component 106 can provide data packets corresponding to the input audio signal to thedata processing system 102 to cause the naturallanguage processor component 106 to process the input audio signal.

The real-time content selection process can be performed during a communication session with theclient computing device 140, or within a time interval after the communication session is terminated. The real-time content selection process can refer to or include an online content item auction. - To select digital components for presentation in a voice-based environment, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via an NLP component of the natural language processor component 106) can parse the input audio signal to identify queries, keywords, and use the keywords and other content selection criteria to select a matching digital component. The
content selector component 108 can select the digital component object based on keywords associated with content rendered by theapplication 152 executing on thecomputing device 140 device prior to the request. Thedata processing system 102 can select the matching digital component based on a broad match, exact match, or phrase match. For example, thecontent selector component 108 can analyze, parse, or otherwise process subject matter of candidate digital components to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate digital components correspond to the subject matter of the keywords or phrases of the input audio signal detected by the microphone of theclient computing device 140. Thecontent selector component 108 may identify, analyze, or recognize voice, audio, terms, characters, text, symbols, or images of the candidate digital components using an image processing technique, character recognition technique, natural language processing technique, or database lookup. The candidate digital components may include metadata indicative of the subject matter of the candidate digital components, in which case thecontent selector component 108 may process the metadata to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate digital component corresponds to the input audio signal. - 3P
digital content providers 160 may provide additional indicators when setting up a content campaign that includes digital components. The content provider may provide information at the content campaign or content group level that thecontent selector component 108 may identify by performing a lookup using information about the candidate digital component. For example, the candidate digital component may include a unique identifier, which may map to a content group, content campaign, or content provider. Thecontent selector component 108 may determine, based on information stored in content campaign data structure indata repository 124, information about the 3P digitalcontent provider device 160. - The format or modality of the digital component object selected by the
content selector component 108 can be visual, audio-visual, or audio-only. A digital component object having a visual-only format can be an image or image with text. A digital component object having an audio-only format can be an audio track. A digital component object having an audio-visual format can be a video clip. Digital component objects can be configured for different types of interaction based on the format of the digital component object. For example, a visual-only digital component object can be configured for interaction via keyboard, mouse or touch screen input (e.g., to select a hyperlink embedded in the digital component object). An audio-only digital component object can be configured for interaction via voice input (e.g., configured to detect a predetermined keyword to perform an action). - However, the format of the digital component object selected by the
content selector component 108 may not be compatible with thecomputing device 140 or may not be optimized for presentation by thecomputing device 140. In some cases, thedata processing system 102 can filter for digital component objects that are compatible or optimized for thecomputing device 140. Filtering based on format or modality can result in selecting a digital component object having a format that is be compatible or optimized for thecomputing device 140. Filtering based on format or modality may prevent the selection of digital component objects that may be relevant or a better match with the content selection criteria because the format of the digital component objects may not be compatible or optimized for thecomputing device 140. For example, if thecomputing device 140 is a smart speaker that lacks adisplay device 146, then visual content items may be filtered out or prevented from selection, limiting the selections to audio-only content items. In the event visual content items contained keywords that were a better match with the content selection criteria than the selected audio-only content item, thedata processing system 102 may be unable to provide the top matching content item. By not providing the top matching content item, thedata processing system 102 may be wasting computing resource consumption, network bandwidth, or battery power of thecomputing device 140 by providing an irrelevant content item for presentation. - Thus, this technical solution can select the best matching digital component object based on content selection criteria and regardless of format, and then convert the digital component object into a format that is optimized or compatible with the
computing device 140. By not removing or preventing content items from being selected due to format or modality, this technical solution can select a highest ranking content item based on relevancy and other content selection criteria, and then convert, in real-time, the content item to the desired format. - To do so, the
data processing system 102 can include acontent conversion component 110 designed, constructed and operational to generate a digital component object in a format that is different from the original format of the digital component object provided by the 3P digitalcontent provider device 160. The 3P digitalcontent provider device 160 can provide an original content item in a first format, and thedata processing system 102 can generate a second content item in a second format that is based on the original content item. For example, thecontent selector component 108 can select, based on the request or content selection criteria, a digital component object having a visual output format. Thecontent conversion component 110 can determine that thecomputing device 140 lacks a display device, but has an audio interface. Thecontent conversion component 110 can then generate a new digital component object having an audio-only format. Thecontent conversion component 110 can use metadata associated with the digital component object to generate the new digital component object with the audio-only format. Thecontent conversion component 110 can select a format for the new content item, generate text based on the original content item, select a voice for the new content item, generate non-spoken audio cues for the new content item, generate actions used to interact with the new content item, and then generate the new content item to provide to thecomputing device 140. - The
content conversion component 110 can include aformat selector 112 designed, constructed and operational to select a format with which to generate a digital component object based on the digital component object selected by thecontent selector component 108. Theformat selector 112 can use various techniques or factors to determine a format into which to convert the digital component object. Factors can include, for example, a type ofcomputing device 140, available interfaces of thecomputing device 140, remaining battery power of thecomputing device 140, location of thecomputing device 140, a mode of transportation (e.g., driving, train, airplane, walking, running, biking, or stationary) associated with thecomputing device 140, a type ofapplication 152 executing in the foreground on thecomputing device 140, a state of thecomputing device 140, or other factors. In some cases, factors can include user activity such as cooking, working, or relaxing. Thedata processing system 102 can determine a user is cooking based on the time of day or recent search activity (e.g., looking for a recipe). Thedata processing system 102 can determine whether a user is working based on time of day, day of week, and location (e.g., place of business). Thedata processing system 102 can determine whether the user is relaxing based on time of day, location, and activity on the computing device 140 (e.g., streaming a movie). - The
format selector 112 can select the format to which to convert the selected digital component object based on a type ofcomputing device 140. Theformat selector 112 can receive information about the type of thecomputing device 140 along with the request for content. For example, the request for content provided by thecomputing device 140 can indicate a type of thecomputing device 140. In cases in which a request for content is not received, theformat selector 112 can determine the type of thecomputing device 140 based on account information or profile information associated with thecomputing device 140, or information received from theapplication 152 executing on thecomputing device 140. In some cases, theformat selector 112 can query thecomputing device 140 for information about the type of thecomputing device 140. Example types ofcomputing devices 140 can include laptop, tablet, smart watch, wearable device, smartphone, smart speaker, smart television, or an internet-of-things device (e.g., a smart appliance or smart light). The type of device can indicate types of interfaces (e.g., visual output interface, audio output interface, audio input interface, touch input interface, or keyboard and mouse interface) available on thecomputing device 140. For example, if the type ofcomputing device 140 is a smart speaker, then thedata processing system 102 can determine that the primary interface for thecomputing device 140 is an audio interface, and that thecomputing device 140 lacks a display device. Theformat selector 112 can determine, responsive to the primary interface for the type of device being an audio-only interface, to convert the original visual digital component object into an audio-only format digital component object. In another example, if the type of computing device is a smart television, then thedata processing system 102 can determine that the primary interface is an audio-visual interface. Theformat selector 112, responsive to determining that the primary interface is an audio visual interface, can determine to convert the original visual-only digital component object into an audio-visual digital component object. By converting the digital component object into the primary format for the type ofcomputing device 140, thedata processing system 102 can optimize rendering or presentation of the digital component object on thecomputing device 140. Optimizing the rendering or presentation can refer to outputting the digital component object using the primary user interface or primary combination of user interfaces of thecomputing device 140. - The
format selector 112 can select the format for the conversion based on the available interfaces of thecomputing device 140. The type ofcomputing device 140 can indicate the types of interfaces thecomputing device 140 includes. However, one or more of the interfaces may be unavailable, in which case, theformat selector 112 can identify an available interface and then convert the digital component object into the format corresponding to the available interface. For example, acomputing device 140 can output audio such as streaming digital music while disabling or turning off adisplay device 146, which can reduce power consumption. In this example, theformat selector 112 can determine that the visual interface is currently unavailable because thedisplay device 146 has been turned off, but can determine that the audio output interface is available because it is currently outputting audio. In another example, theformat selector 112 can determine that the audio interface is unavailable if the audio has been muted, and determine that the visual output interface available if thedisplay device 146 is actively providing visual output. Thus, if the audio interface is unavailable, theformat selector 112 can select a visual output format for the digital component object; if the visual interface is unavailable, theformat selector 112 can select an audio output format for the digital component object. If neither the visual or audio output interfaces are available, theformat selector 112 can terminate content conversion and block delivery of the digital component object so as to avoid wasted computing resource utilization and network bandwidth utilization. - The
format selector 112 can determine the output interface based on the remaining battery power of thecomputing device 140. For example, if the remaining batter power is under a threshold (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% or some other threshold), then theformat selector 112 can determine to select a format that utilizes the least amount of energy to render, such as audio output which can consume less energy as compared to a display device. - The
format selector 112 can select the format for the digital component object based on the mode of transportation of thecomputing device 140. Example modes of transportation can include driving, train, airplane, walking, running, biking, or stationary (e.g., not moving or no transportation). Theformat selector 112 can select an audio-only output format if the mode of transportation is driving, running, or biking so as to avoid distracting the user and avoid wasted energy consumption since a user may not be able to perceive visual output in those modes of transportation. If the mode of transportation is walking, stationary, public transportation, or airplane, then theformat selector 112 can select a visual output or an audio-visual output format because a visual output may not distract the user and the user is likely able to perceive the visual output. - The
format selector 112 can select the format for the digital component object based on a type ofapplication 152 executing in the foreground on thecomputing device 140. If the primary output interface of theapplication 152 is audio-only, such as a digitalmusic streaming application 152, then theformat selector 112 can select an audio-output format, for example. If the primary output interface of theapplication 152 is a visual-only format, then theformat selector 112 can select a visual-only output. If the primary output interface of theapplication 152 is a combination of audio-visual output, such as in a digitalvideo streaming application 152, then theformat selector 112 can select an audio-visual output format for the digital component object. - The
format selector 112 can select the format for the digital component object based on the type ofcomputing device 140 being a digital assistant device, or based on thecomputing device 140 executing anapplication 152 comprising a digital assistant application. A digital assistant application can refer to or include a virtual assistant. The digital assistant application can include a software agent that can perform tasks or services based on commands or questions. Thedigital assistant application 152 can be configured to receive and process natural language input (e.g., spoken by a user), and then perform tasks, actions or provide responsive to the input. Theformat selector 112 can determine, responsive to the type ofapplication 152 orcomputing device 140 being a digital assistant, to select an audio-only format for the digital component object because a primary interface of thedigital assistant application 152 can be a voice-based (or audio based) interface. - The
content conversion component 110 can include atext generator 114 designed, constructed and operational to generate text based on the digital component object. For example, responsive to theformat selector 112 determining to convert a visual digital component object into an audio-only digital component object, thetext generator 114 can process the digital component object to generate text that can be output via audio. To generate the text based on the visual component object, thetext generator 114 can parse text in the visual component, apply an image processing technique to process the visual digital component object, or apply an optical character recognition technique. Thetext generator 114 can obtain metadata associated with the visual component object and parse or process the metadata to generate the text. The metadata can include, for example, product specifications or a product description. Thus, thetext generator 114 can use, for example, tuples of text in the visual digital component, a hyperlink or uniform resource locator embedded in the digital component object, a link to a product, or the product description. - The
text generator 114 can input the tuples of text obtained from the visual digital component, metadata or corresponding links into a natural language generation model to generate text. Thetext generator 114 can include, be configured with, or access a natural language generation engine or component. Natural language generation can refer to a process that transforms structured data into natural language. Thetext generator 114, using natural language generation, can generate text that can be read out by a text-to-speech system. - The
text generator 114, configured with a natural language generation technique, can generate the text in multiple stages, such as: content determination (e.g., deciding what information to mention in the text); document structuring (e.g., overall organization of the information to convey); aggregation (e.g., merging of similar sentences to improve readability and naturalness); lexical choice (e.g., putting words to the concepts); referring expression generation (e.g., creating referring expressions that identify objects and regions); and realization (e.g., creating the actual text, which can be correct according to the rules of syntax, morphology, and orthography). - The
text generator 114 can perform natural language generation by training a statistical model using machine learning, such as on a large corpus of human-written texts. The machine learning can process human-written text corresponding to digital component objects provided by 3P digitalcontent provider devices 160, for example, in order to train the model. - The
text generator 114 can use a sequence-to-sequence model to generate the text. A sequence-to-sequence model can include two parts, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder and decoder can be two different neural network models combined into one network. The neural network can be a recurrent neural network (“RNN”), such as long short-term memory (“LSTM”) blocks. The encoder portion of the network can be configured to understand the input sequence (e.g., tuples corresponding to text in the visual digital component, a hyperlink or uniform resource locator embedded in the digital component object, a link to a product, or the product description), and then create a smaller dimensional representation of the input. The encoder can forward this representation to a decoder network which can be configured to generate a sequence that represents the output. The decoder can generate words one by one in each time step of the decoder's iteration. - The
text generator 114 can use a generative adversarial network (“GAN”) to generate the text. A GAN can refer to a generator network that is trained to produce realistic samples by introducing an adversary (e.g., a discriminator network) that is configured to detect if a generated text is “real” or “fake”. For example, the discriminator can be a dynamically-updated evaluation metric used to tune the generator. The generator and discriminator in a GAN can continuously improve until an equilibrium point is reached. - Thus, the
text generator 114 can generate text based on a visual digital component object using a natural language generation technique. Thecontent conversion component 110 can select a digital voice print to use to output the text as speech. Thecontent conversion component 110 can include avoice selector 116 designed, constructed and operational to select a digital voice to render the text. Thecontent conversion component 110 can select the digital voice based on the context of the digital component object or based on the generated text. Thevoice selector 116 can select a digital voice that matches the type of digital component object or context of the text. For example, thevoice selector 116 can select a different digital voice for an advertisement for a pillow as compared to an advertisement for an action movie - To select a digital voice print to generate an audio track for the text generated by the
text generator 114, thevoice selector 116 can use avoice model 126 trained by themachine learning engine 122 using historical data. The historical data used to train thevoice model 126 can include, for example, audio digital component objects created by 3P digital content providers for presentation via acomputing device 140 or other mediums. The historical data can include metadata or contextual information associated with each of the audio digital component objects created by 3P digital content providers. The metadata or contextual information can include, for example, topics, concepts, keywords, geographic locations, brand names, vertical category, product categories, service categories, or other information that describes aspects of the audio digital component object. The historical data can include performance information associated with the audio digital component object. The performance information can indicate whether an end user interacted with the audio digital component, such as a selection or conversion on the audio digital component object. - For example, the historical digital components can include radio advertisements (e.g., broadcast radio or digital streaming radio stations), television advertisements (e.g., broadcast or cable television, or digital streaming television channels) that were created by 3P content providers for broadcast on televisions, radios, or computing
devices 140. These historical digital components can include audio and visual components if they are being presented on a television. The metadata or contextual information associated with the television advertisements can include a type of product (e.g., automobile, travel, consumer electronics, or food), type of service (e.g., tax services, phone service, internet service, restaurant, delivery service, or household services), descriptive information about the product or service, information about the company or entity providing the product or service, geographic location in which the advertisement is to be provided (e.g., state, geographic region, city, or zip code), or other keywords. Thus, the historical data can include the audio track corresponding to the audio (or audio-video) 3P digital component object as well as metadata associated with the audio track. An example data structure storing historical 3P digital component objects is illustrated in Table 1. -
TABLE 1 Illustrative Example of Historical Data Unique Product/ ID Audio File Service Vertical Location Brand Description 1 Audio_1.mp3 Product Automotive USA Company_A Luxury sports car 2 Audio_2.mp3 Service Banking New Company_B Low England interest rate credit card offer - Table 1 provides an illustrative example of historical data used by the
machine learning engine 122 to train thevoice model 126 used by thevoice selector 116 to select a digital voice to use to render the text generated bytext generator 114. As illustrated in Table 1, each historical 3P digital component object can include an audio track (e.g., Audio_1.mp3 and Audio_2.mp3), an indication of whether the advertisement is for a product or service, an indication of the vertical market (e.g., automotive or banking), an indication of the location in which the advertisement is provided (e.g., national USA, or geographic region such as New England), a brand or provider of the advertisement (e.g., Company_A or Company_B), and additional description or keywords associated with the digital component object (e.g., luxury sports car, or low interest rate credit card offer). The audio file can be in any format, including, for example, .wav, .mp3, .aac, or any other audio format. In some cases, the historical digital component objects can include both audio and video, in which case the audio file format can refer to an audio and visual file format such as .mp4, .mov, .wmv, .flv, or other file formats. - The
data processing system 102 can pre-process the historical digital component data to put the data in a format suitable for themachine learning engine 122 to process the data to train thevoice model 126. For example, thevoice selector 116 ormachine learning engine 122 can be configured with an audio processing technique or parsing technique to process the historical digital component data to identify features in the data. Features can include, for example, audio characteristics in the audio file, product/service, vertical category, keywords from the description, or other information. Example audio characteristics can include gender of the voice, age range of the voice, pitch, frequency, amplitude or volume, intonations, dialect, language, accent, rate at which words are spoken, or other characteristics. - The
machine learning engine 122 can use any machine learning or statistical technique to analyze the historical data and train thevoice model 126. Themachine learning engine 122 can be configured with learning techniques or functions that can build a model based on sample data or training data (e.g., the historical digital component objects) in order to make predictions or decisions. Themachine learning engine 122 can be configured with supervised or unsupervised learning techniques, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, self-learning, feature learning, sparse dictionary learning, or association rules. To perform machine learning, themachine learning engine 122 can create thevoice model 126 trained on training data. The model can be based on, for example, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, regression analysis, Bayesian networks, or genetic algorithms. - The
voice selector 116, upon receiving the text generated by thetext generator 114 based on the visual digital component, can use the text along with the metadata associated with the visual digital component to select a digital voice print using thevoice model 126 trained via themachine learning engine 122. For example, thedata processing system 102 can select, via avoice model 126, the digital voice based on context of the digital component object. The context can include or refer to or include the text, the metadata or other information associated with the digital component object. The context can refer to or include information associated with thecomputing device 140. In some cases, thevoice selector 116 can select the digital voice based on the context of thecomputing device 140, such as mode of transportation, location, preferences, performance information or other information associated with thecomputing device 140. - The
voice selector 116 can input the context of the digital component object into avoice model 126 to generate a voice characteristics vector, and then select the digital voice to render the text. The text and metadata can indicate information about the product, service, vertical category, keywords, or other information that can be input into thevoice model 126. The input to thevoice model 126 can be the text generated based on the visual digital component, or a combination of the text and the metadata of the visual digital component. The output of thevoice model 126 can be a voice characteristics vector that predicts characteristics of the digital voice print to use to render the text. The output can indicate a gender of the digital voice print (e.g., male or female), intonations (e.g., intonations can change for each syllable in the text), accent, phonation, pitch, loudness, speech rate, tone, texture, loudness, or other information. The output of thevoice model 126 can include other voice types such as bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo-soprano and soprano. - The
voice selector 116 can compare the voice characteristics vector output by thevoice model 126 with available digital voice prints stored in thedata repository 124 to identify a matching digital voice print, or closest matching digital voice print. Digital voice prints can be categorized based on gender, accent, phonation, pitch, loudness, speech rate or other information. Thevoice selector 116 can compare the output of thevoice model 126 with the stored or available digital voice prints to select a closest matching digital voice print to use to render the text. Thevoice selector 116 can weight the characteristics to select the matching voice print. For example, a characteristic such as gender can be weighted more heavily than a characteristic such as accent. A characteristic such as speech rate can be weighted more heavily than a characteristic such as accent. In some cases, thevoice selector 116 can select the digital voice that matches the most characteristics. Thevoice selector 116 can use any matching technique to select the digital voice print based on the output of thevoice model 126. - The selected digital voice print can include a unique identifier that identifies the digital voice print. The digital voice print can include information the
content conversion component 110 can use to perform text-to-speech. The digital voice print can include instructions for a text-to-speech engine. Thecontent conversion component 110 can use any type of text-to-speech technology to render the text using the voice characteristics indicated by the digital voice print. For example, thecontent conversion component 110 can use neural network techniques to render the text using a human-like voice defined by the digital voice print. - The
content conversion component 110 can generate a baseline audio track of the text rendered using the text-to-speech technique and based on the selected digital voice print. For example, thecontent conversion component 110 can include anaudio cue generator 118 designed, constructed and operational to construct a baseline audio track of the digital component object with the text rendered by the digital voice. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use a text-to-speech engine to render or synthesize the text in accordance with the digital voice. - The
content conversion component 110 can determine to add non-spoken audio cues to the baseline audio track. Theaudio cue generator 118 can be designed, configured and operational to generate non-spoken audio cues to add to the baseline audio track. Non-spoken cues can include or refer to sound effects. Non-spoken can include, for example, the sound of ocean waves, wind, leaves rustling, automobile engine, driving, airplane takeoff, crowd cheering, sports, action movie effects (e.g., high speed car chase, helicopters, etc.), running, biking, or other sound effects. Thus, non-spoken audio cues can refer to sounds or sound effects that lacks speech with words or numbers (e.g., spoken words). - The
audio cue generator 118 can generate one or more non-spoken audio cues based on the text or metadata of the digital component object. Theaudio cue generator 118 can generate one or more non-spoken audio cues based on the digital voice selected for the text. Theaudio cue generator 118 can select the non-spoken audio cues based on the context of the computing device 140 (e.g., mode of transportation, type of computing device, type ofapplication 152 executing in the foreground of thecomputing device 140, content being presented in theapplication 152, or request received from the computing device 140). - The
audio cue generator 118 can select one or more non-spoken audio cues to add to the baseline audio track using anaudio cues model 134 or audio cues data store. Theaudio cues 134 data store can include sound effects that are tagged with metadata, such as an indicator of that the sound effect is. For example, a sound effect for an ocean wave can be tagged with a description of the sound effect, such as “ocean weave.” Theaudio cues 134 data store can include multiple types of ocean wave sound effects and include corresponding tags or descriptions distinguishing between each ocean wave. - In some cases, the audio cues can be configured or optimized for characteristics in the digital voices. Certain audio cues may be optimized for presentation as a background sound effect for a digital voice having a certain voice characteristic vector. An optimized sound effect can refer to a sound effect that can be rendered along with the rendering of the text with the digital voice without obstructing or distracting from the text, with the goal of the text being comprehendible by the user, thereby providing an improved user interface. For example, a sound effect with the same frequency and amplitude as the digital voice may make it challenging to perceive, discern or distinguish the digital voice over the sound effect, which can result in a degraded user experience and wasted computing resource utilization by providing output that is ineffective.
- The
audio cue generator 118 can perform image recognition on the visual digital component to identify a visual object in the digital component object. Theaudio cue generator 118 can ignore any text associated with the visual digital component, and perform image recognition to detect objects. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use any image processing technique or object detection technique. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use a model trained by themachine learning engine 122 and based on a training data set comprising images of objects that are tagged with a description of the object. Themachine learning engine 122 can train a model with the training data so that theaudio cue generator 118 can use the model to detect an object in a new image that is input into the model. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use the trained model to detect an image in a visual digital component object. Thus, theaudio cue generator 118 can perform image recognition on the visual digital component object to identify a visual object in the digital component object. Theaudio cue generator 118 can select, from the non-spokenaudio cues 134 stored in thedata repository 124, the non-spoken audio cue corresponding to the visual object. - The
audio cue generator 118 can also identify objects by accessing a link embedded in the visual digital component, such as a link to a landing web page corresponding to the digital component object. Theaudio cue generator 118 can parse the web page to identify visual objects as well as additional contextual information, keywords or metadata. Theaudio cue generator 118 can select audio cues based on the objects, contextual information, keywords or metadata. For example, the text of the landing webpage can include keywords “beach, vacation, cruise.” Theaudio cue generator 118 can select audio cues corresponding to one or more of the keywords. - If the
audio cue generator 118 identify multiple candidate audio cues based on the images in the visual object or other keywords or contextual information associated with metadata of the visual digital component or web pages linked to the digital component, theaudio cue generator 118 can select one or more non-spoken audio cues. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use a policy to determine how many non-spoken audio cues to select. The policy can be to select all identified audio cues, randomly select a predetermined number of audio cues, alternate through the different audio cues throughout the audio track, overlay or mix one or more audio cues, or select a predetermined number of highest ranking audio cues. - For example, the
audio cue generator 118 can identify the most prominent object in the visual digital component, and select an audio cue corresponding to the most prominent object. Prominence of an object can refer to the size of the object in the visual digital component (e.g., the biggest object in the visual digital component can be the most prominent object). Prominence can be based on the object being in the foreground of the image as opposed to being in the background. Theaudio cue generator 118 can identify the object in the visual digital component that is most relevant to the text generated by thetext generator 114. Relevancy can be determined based on the description of the object and the text. For example, if the generated text includes the name of the object or keywords in the description of the object, then the object may be determined to be relevant to the text. Theaudio cue generator 118 can determine the keywords or concepts that are most relevant to the text, and select those keywords for the audio cue. - The
audio cue generator 118 can rank the objects based on prominence, relevancy, or both prominence and relevancy. Theaudio cue generator 118 can determine to select one or more audio cues based on the rank. For example, theaudio cue generator 118 can select the highest ranking audio cue, the top two highest ranking cues, the top three highest ranking cues, or some other number of audio cues. - In some cases, the
audio cue generator 118 can take filter out, remove, or prevent an audio cue from being added to the baseline audio track based on the audio cue distracting from the text rendered by the digital voice. For example, theaudio cue generator 118 can identify multiple visual objects in the digital component object via an image recognition technique. Theaudio cue generator 118 can identify, based on the metadata (e.g., metadata provided by the 3P digitalcontent provider device 160 or keywords associated with a landing page corresponding to a link in the digital component object) and the text multiple non-spoken audio cues. Theaudio cue generator 118 can determine a matching score for each of the visual objects that indicates a level of match between each of the visual objects and the metadata. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use any matching technique to determine the matching score, such as relevancy, broad, phrase or exact matches. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use technique similar to thecontent selector component 108 to determine the matching score. Theaudio cue generator 118 can rank the non-spoken audio cues based on the matching score. In some cases, theaudio cue generator 118 can select the highest one or more ranking audio cues. - In some cases, the
audio cue generator 118 can select a highest ranking one or more audio cues that does not interfere, conflate, obstruct, or otherwise negatively impact the text synthesized using the digital voice. For example, theaudio cue generator 118 can determine a level of audio interference between each of the non-spoken audio cues and the digital voice selected to render the text. The level of interference can be determined using one or more factors, such as amplitude, frequency, pitch, or timing, for example. In an illustrative example, a sound effect having the same frequency and amplitude as the synthesized text may cause a high level of interference that would prevent an end use from accurately perceiving the rendered text. In another example, the sound of a loud crash can distract from the text. However, the sound of a gentle breeze at a lower amplitude throughout the spoken audio track may not distract from the text. - To determine the level of interference, the
audio cue generator 118 can determine the amount of interference caused by the non-spoken audio cue to the synthesized text. The amount can be a percentage of the text, a continuous duration, or a decibel level relative to the text. In some cases, the interference can be based on a signal-to-noise ratio or a ratio of text signal to non-spoken audio cue signal. The level of interference can be indicated using a grade (e.g., low, medium, or high), or numerical value (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 10 or any other scale where one end of the scale represent no interference and the opposite end of the scale represent total interference). Total interference can refer to destructive interference that may completely cancel out the synthesized text. - In some cases, the
audio cue generator 118 can determine the level of interference by combining the audio waveforms corresponding to the synthesized text and the non-spoken audio cues and then processing the combined signal to determine whether an end user would be able to perceive the synthesized text. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use an audio processing technique similar to theinterface 104 or naturallanguage processor component 106 to validate, verify, or determine whether the synthesized text can be accurately perceived by thedata processing system 102 itself, which can indicate whether an end user would be able to also actively perceive the audio track. - Upon identifying the audio cues that have a level of interference that is less than a predetermined threshold (e.g., low interference, an interference score of less than 5, 6, 7 or other metric), the
audio cue generator 118 can select the highest ranking non-spoken audio cues having the level of audio interference less than the threshold. - The
audio cue generator 118 can combine the selected non-spoken audio cues with the baseline audio track to generate an audio track of the digital component object. The audio track can correspond to an audio-only digital component object based on the visual digital component object. Theaudio cue generator 118 can use any audio mixing technique to combine the non-spoken cues with the baseline audio track. For example, theaudio cue generator 118 can overlay the non-spoken audio cues over the baseline audio track, add the non-spoken audio cues as background audios, intersperse the non-spoken audio cues before or after the synthesized text, or in between the synthesized text. Thedata processing system 102 can include a digital mixing component configured to combine, change the dynamics, equalize or other change properties of two or more input audio signals to generate an audio track. Thedata processing system 102 can receive the non-spoken audio cues and the baseline audio track and sum the two signals to generate a combined audio track. Thedata processing system 102 can combine the input audio signals using a digital mixing process, thereby avoiding the introduction of unwanted noise or distortion. - Thus, once a baseline audio format is synthesized, the
data processing system 102 can perform a second generation step of inserting non-spoken audio cues or backing tracks that can be determined from the metadata. For example, if the visual digital component looks like a beach resort with palm trees, then thedata processing system 102 can synthesize audio of waves and wind moving tree leaves, and add the synthesized audio to the text-to-speech baseline audio track to generate an audio track. - In some cases, the
action generator 136 can add predetermined or fixed audio to the baseline audio track or generated audio track with the non-spoken cues. For example, thedata processing system 102 can determine, using a heuristic or rule-based technique, to add a phrase such as “Learn more about this on our website.” This can prompt the user to then independently perform an action independent of the digital component object. Thedata processing system 102 can determine to automatically add the fixed audio based on historical performance information, the length of time of the audio track, or based on a configuration or setting (e.g., default setting set by an administrator of thedata processing system 102, or a setting that can be provided by the 3P digital content provider device 160). In some cases, the fixed audio can include a prompt for voice input, such as “Would you like to learn more about this on our website?” Thedata processing system 102 can configure the audio digital component object to detect a trigger word in the response to the prompt, such as “yes” in this case, in order to then automatically perform a digital action corresponding to the prompt. - The
data processing system 102 can provide the generated audio track to thecomputing device 140 to cause thecomputing device 140 to output or present the audio track via the speaker (e.g., transducer 144). In some cases, thedata processing system 102 can add actionable commands to the audio track. Thecontent conversion component 110 can include anaction generator 136 designed, configured and operational to add a trigger word to the audio track. The trigger word can facilitate interacting with the audio track. The pre-processor 142 can listen for the trigger word, and then perform an action responsive to the trigger word. The trigger word can become a new wakeup or hot word that remains active for a predetermined time interval, such as during playback of the audio track and a predetermined amount of time after the audio track (e.g., 1 second, 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds or other appropriate time interval). Responsive to detection of the trigger word in an input audio signal detected by the microphone (e.g., sensor 148) of thecomputing device 140,data processing system 102 or thecomputing device 140 can perform a digital action corresponding to the trigger word. - In an illustrative example, the audio track can include an advertisement to purchase cruise tickets and take a vacation to an island with a beach. The audio track can include a prompt, such as “Would you like to know the price of the cruise tickets?” The trigger word can be “yes”, or “what is the price”, “how much does it cost” or some other variation that conveys an intent by the user to request the price of the tickets. The
data processing system 102 can provide the trigger word to thecomputing device 140 orpre-processor 142 of thecomputing device 140 so that the pre-processor 142 can detect the trigger keyword in a subsequent voice input provided by the user. Responsive to detecting the trigger word in the voice input, the pre-processor 142 can forward the voice input to thedata processing system 102. TheNLP component 106 can parse the voice input and perform an action corresponding to the voice input, such as directed the user to a landing page associated with the digital component presented to the user or otherwise accessing and providing the requested information. - The trigger keyword can be linked to various digital actions. Example digital actions can include providing information, launching an application, launching a navigation application, playing music or video, ordering a product or service, controlling an appliance, controlling a lighting device, controlling an internet-of-things enabled device, ordering food from a restaurant, making a reservation, ordering a ride share, booking a ticket to a movie, booking flight tickets, controlling a smart television, or other digital action.
- The
action generator 136 can use one or more techniques to select an action for the digital component object. Theaction generator 136 can use a heuristic technique to select an action from a set of predetermined actions. Theaction generator 136 can use anaction model 128 configured to receive the generated text as input and output a predicted action. - For example, the
action generator 136 can determine a category of the digital component object. The category can refer to a vertical category, such as automobile, banking, sports, clothing, etc. Theaction generator 136 can perform a lookup or query a database with the category to retrieve one or more trigger words and digital actions established for the category. The database can include a mapping of categories to trigger keyword and digital actions. Table 2 illustrates an example mapping of categories to trigger words and actions. -
TABLE 2 Illustrative Example of Mapping of Categories to Trigger Words and Digital Actions Category Trigger Words Digital Actions Ride Yes; Ride; order a ride; go Launch a ride share Share to application on the computing device 140; order the ride to pick the user up. Travel Book a flight; check flight Provide options to book price; how much to go to flight; launch a flight [city]; when is the next booking application; search flight to [city] for flights and provide results; Vehicle How much does the car cost; Access landing page of Shopping what options are available content item provider; for the car; where is the provide requested nearest dealership; information; launch navigation application with directions to nearest auto dealership - Table 2 illustrates an example mapping of categories to trigger words and digital actions. As illustrated in Table 2, categories can include ride share, travel, and vehicle shopping. The
action generator 136 can determine the category of the selected digital component object based on the text generated for the digital component object, metadata associated with the digital component object, or parsing data associated with links embedded in the digital component object. In some cases, the 3P digitalcontent provider device 160 can provide the category information along with the metadata. In some cases, theaction generator 136 can use a semantic processing technique to determine the category based on the information associated with the digital component object. - The
action generator 136, upon identifying or determining the category for the digital component object, can perform a lookup or query the mapping (e.g., Table 2). Theaction generator 136 an retrieve, from the mapping, one or more trigger words corresponding to one or more digital actions associated with the category. For example, if theaction generator 136 identifies the category as “Ride Share”, theaction generator 136 can retrieve, responsive to the query or lookup, trigger keywords “Yes”, “Ride”, “order a ride”, or “go to”. Theaction generator 136 can further identify digital actions: launch a ride share application on thecomputing device 140; or order the ride to pick the user up. Theaction generator 136 can configure the audio digital component object with instructions to detect all of the trigger keywords and perform the corresponding digital actions responsive to detection of the trigger keyword. - In some cases, the
action generator 136 can determine to add one or more, but not all, of the retrieved trigger keywords and digital actions to the digital component object. For example, theaction generator 136 can rank, using adigital action model 128 trained based on historical performance of trigger keywords, the trigger words based on the context of the digital component object and the type of the client device. Theaction generator 136 can select a highest ranking trigger keyword to add to the audio track. - The
action model 128 can be trained bymachine learning engine 122 using training data. The training data can include historical performance information associated with the trigger keyword. The historical performance information can include, for each trigger keyword, whether the trigger keywords resulted in an interaction (e.g., did thecomputing device 140 detect the trigger keyword in a voice input received subsequent to presentation of the audio track), context information associated with the digital component object (e.g., category, keywords, concepts, or state in an interaction flow), and context information of the interaction. The context of thecomputing device 140 can include, for example, the type of computing device 140 (e.g., mobile device, laptop device, smartphone, or smart speaker), available interfaces of thecomputing device 140, mode of transportation (e.g., walking, driving, stationary, biking, etc.), or location of thecomputing device 140. For example, if the mode of transportation is running, biking, or driving, thedata processing system 102 can select a type of interaction that may not require visual or touch input, and can result in audio output in order to improve the user experience. - The
machine learning engine 122 can train theaction model 128 based on this training data such that theaction model 128 can predict a trigger keyword that is most likely to result in an interaction based on the context of the digital component object and thecomputing device 140. Thus, theaction generator 136 can customize or tailor the action to add to the digital component object in a real-time process to provide the trigger keyword that is most likely to result in an interaction. By limiting the number of trigger keywords to those that are most likely to result in an interaction as determined by theaction model 128, theaction generator 136 can improve the likelihood that the pre-processor 142 orNLP component 106 accurately and reliably detects the trigger keyword, while reducing the likelihood that the user of thecomputing device 140 inadvertently causes performance of an unwanted action. Further, by limiting the number of trigger words, theaction generator 136 can reduce network bandwidth communication and computing resource utilization by reducing the number commands or data packets transmitted vianetwork 105, as well as reducing the number of trigger words the pre-processor 142 processes. - The
data processing system 102 can provide the audio track of the digital component object to thecomputing device 140 for output via a speaker of thecomputing device 140. In some cases, thedata processing system 102 can determine an insertion point for the audio track of the digital component object. An insertion point can refer to a point in time relative to an audio output of thecomputing device 140. The audio output can correspond to digital streaming music, or other audio (or audio-visual) output provided via anapplication 152 executing on thecomputing device 140. Thedata processing system 102 can determine an insertion time so as to prevent obfuscation or distortion of the main audio content being output by thecomputing device 140, while improving the user experience and likelihood that the generated audio track is perceived by the end user and ultimately receives an interaction. - The
data processing system 102 can include acontent insertion component 120 designed, constructed and operational to identify an insertion point for the audio track. Thecontent insertion component 120 can identify an insertion point for the audio track in a digital media stream output by thecomputing device 140. Thecontent insertion component 120 can identify the insertion point using aninsertion model 130. Themachine learning engine 122 can train theinsertion model 130 using historical performance data. The historical performance data can include or be referred to as training data. The historical performance data used to train theinsertion model 130 can include data about historical insertion points for audio tracks inserted in digital media streams. The data can indicate when the audio track was inserted, contextual information about the audio track, contextual information about the digital media stream, whether the user interacted with the audio track, how the user interacted with the audio track (e.g., what action the user took, or whether the interaction was positive or negative), or contextual information about the computing device 140 (e.g., type of computing device, available interfaces of the computing device, or location of the computing device). - The
machine learning engine 122 can train theinsertion model 130 using this training data. Themachine learning engine 122 can use any technique to train theinsertion model 130 so that theinsertion model 130 can be used to predict when to insert the audio track generated based on the visual digital component object in a digital content stream (e.g., streaming music, news, podcasts, videos, or other media) - The
content insertion component 120 can identify, based on ainsertion model 130 trained using historical performance data, an insertion point. The insertion point can be, for example, after a current streamlining media segment and prior to the beginning of the next segment. Each segment can correspond to another song. In another example, such as a podcast, thecontent insertion component 120 can determine, using theinsertion model 130, to insert the audio track during a segment. Thecontent insertion component 120 can insert the audio track after the segment begins and before the segment ends. For example, the segment can have a duration of 30 minutes, and thecontent insertion component 120 can determine, using theinsertion model 130, to insert the audio track after 15 minutes of the segment playing. - The
content insertion component 120 can determine a custom insertion point based on the current context (e.g., context of the generated audio track, streaming media, and computing device 140). Thecontent insertion component 120 can determine the custom insertion point in real-time. Thecontent insertion component 120 can determine a different insertion point for afirst computing device 140 as compared to asecond computing device 140 if the first and second computing devices are different types of computing devices (e.g., laptop versus smart speaker). Thecontent insertion component 120 can determine different insertion points for thefirst computing device 140 and thesecond computing device 140 based on a mode of transportation associated with the different computing devices (e.g., walking versus driving versus stationary). - The
content insertion component 120 can determine to insert the audio track proximate to a keyword, term or concept in the digital media stream. Thecontent insertion component 120 can monitor the digital media stream to detect a trigger word in the digital media stream that is relevant to the audio track, and then determine to insert the audio-only digital component object subsequent to or responsive to the trigger word detected in the digital media stream. - The
content insertion component 120 can obtain a copy of the segment of the digital media stream from the 3Pelectronic resource server 162. Thecontent insertion component 120 can parse the segment of the digital media stream to identify all tokens (e.g., keywords, topics, or concepts) and sentences in the segment. Thecontent insertion component 120 can determine a relevancy score for each tokens and sentence to determine how relevant the token or sentence is to the digital component object. Thecontent insertion component 120 can select the token having the highest relevancy score, and then provide the audio-only digital component object for insertion adjacent to the selected token (e.g., before or after the token is presented). - In some cases, the
content insertion component 120 can identify all tokens in the segment of digital media and execute a Monte Carlo simulation in which the audio track is inserted adjacent to each token. Thecontent insertion component 120 can input the variations into a neural network engine to determine which insertion point sounds the best. The neural network can be trained based on training data that includes human rated audio tracks inserted in digital media streams using a machine learning technique. For example, thecontent insertion component 120 can use theinsertion model 130 to determine an insertion point. The training data can include human raters that grade digital media streams with audio tracks at an insertion point. Grades can be binary, such as good or bad, or can be a score on a scale (e.g., 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the best sounding track and 0 indicating the worst sounding track, for example). - In some cases, the
content insertion component 120 can use a heuristic technique to determine an insertion point for the generated audio track. The heuristic technique can be different based on the type of digital media stream. If the content of the digital media stream is songs, then the heuristic rule can be to insert the generated audio track after the song is done playing. If the content of the digital media stream is a podcast, then the heuristic rule can be to insert the audio track after a sentence containing a relevant token. - Upon selecting an insertion point, the
data processing system 102 can provide an instruction to thecomputing device 140 to cause thecomputing device 140 to render the audio track at the insertion point in the digital media stream. -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of a method of generating audio tracks, in accordance with an implementation. Themethod 200 can be performed by one or more system, component or module depicted inFIG. 1 or 3 , including, for example, a data processing system, interface, content selector component, natural language processor component, content conversion component, or computing device. Atdecision block 202, a data processing system can determine whether an input signal has been received. The input signal can correspond to voice input detected by a computing device remote from the data processing system. The input signal can include data packets conveying an audio input signal, such as voice input detected by a microphone of the computing device. The data processing system can receive the input signal via an interface of the data processing system. The data processing system can receive the input signal from a computing device via a network. - If, at
decision block 202, the data processing system determine that an input signal was received, the data processing system can proceed toACT 204 to parse the input signal and detect a request. The data processing system can use a natural language processing technique to parse the input signal and detect one or more keywords, terms, concepts, phrases or other information in the input signal. - The data processing system can proceed to decision block 206 to determine whether to select content. Selecting content can refer to performing a real-time content selection process to select digital component objects provided by third-party digital component providers. Selecting content can refer to performing a real-time online auction using content selection criteria provided by the third-party digital component providers.
- The data processing system can determine, at
decision block 206, to select content if the data processing system detects a request for content atACT 204 in the input signal. In the event the data processing system determines, atdecision block 202, that an input signal was not received, the data processing system can also decide to select content atdecision block 206. For example, the data processing system can proactively determine to perform an online content selection process and push a digital component object to the computing device without receiving an explicit request for digital component objects from the computing device. The data processing system can identify a presentation opportunity (e.g., in between media segments or songs) in a digital music stream output by the computing device and automatically determine to provide a digital component object at this opportunity. Thus, in some cases the data processing system can receive a request for content and then perform the content selection process, while in other cases the data processing system may not receive a content but proactively determine to perform the content selection process. In the even the data processing system receives a request for content, the request can be for main content (e.g., search results responsive to a query in the input audio signal), and the data processing system can perform the online auction to select supplementary content (e.g., digital component objects corresponding to advertisements) that can be responsive to the request, but different from the organic search results that are directly responsive to the input query. - If, at
decision block 206, the data processing system determines not to perform the content selection process to select a digital component object of a 3P digital component provider, the data processing system can return to decision block 202 to determine whether an input signal was received. If, however, the data processing system determines, atdecision block 206, to select content, the data processing system can proceed toACT 208 to execute a content selection process to select content. The data processing system (e.g., via a content selector component) can select a digital component object using content selection criteria or other contextual information associated with the input request, computing device, or digital streaming content. - The data processing system can select digital component objects having a format, such as a visual-only digital component object configured for display via a display device of the computing device, an audio-only digital component object configured for playback via a speaker of the computing device, or an audio-visual digital component that is configured for output via both the display and speaker of the computing device.
- At
decision block 210, the data processing system can determine whether to convert the selected digital component into a different format. For example, if the selected digital component object is in a visual-only format, the data processing system can determine whether to provide the digital component object to the computing device in the visual format for presentation via a display device of the computing device, or to convert the digital component object into a different format for presentation via a different output interface of the computing device, such as a speaker. - The data processing system (e.g., a format selector) can determine whether to convert the digital component object. The data processing system can make the determination based on the available interfaces of the computing device, the primary interfaces of the computing device, the context of the computing device (e.g., mode of transportation), the type of computing device or other factors. If, at
decision block 210, the data processing system determines not to convert the selected digital component object into a different format, the data processing system can proceed toACT 212 and transmit the selected digital component object in its original format to the computing device. - If, however, the data processing system determines, at
decision block 210, to convert the digital component object into a different format, the data processing system can proceed toACT 214 to generate text. For example, if the original format is a visual-only format, and the data processing system determines to convert the digital component into an audio-only format, the data processing system can proceed toACT 214 to generate text for the visual digital component object. The data processing system (e.g., via a text generator) can use a natural language generation technique to generate the text based on the visual digital component object. The data processing system can generate the text based on only the visual content of the digital component object. The visual content can refer to images. In some cases, the data processing system can generate text based on metadata associated with the visual digital component object. - At
ACT 216, the data processing system can select a digital voice to use to synthesize or render the text. The data processing system can use the selected digital voice to perform a text-to-speech conversion of the generated text. The data processing system can select the digital voice based on the generated text, context information associated with the digital component object (e.g., keywords, topics, concepts, vertical category), metadata, context information associated with the computing device. The data processing system can use a model trained based on a machine learning technique and historical data to select the digital voice to use to synthesize the generated text. For example, the data processing system can input into the model the contextual information associated with the digital component object (e.g., metadata) and the model can output a voice characteristics vector. The voice characteristics vector can indicate a gender, speech rate, intonations, loudness, or other characteristics. - The data processing system can select a digital voice that matches the voice characteristics vector. The data processing system can construct a baseline audio track using the selected digital voice. The data processing system can construct the baseline audio track as indicated by the voice characteristics vector. For example, the digital voice can include fixed characteristics, such as gender, as well as dynamic characteristics, such as speech rate, intonations, or loudness. The dynamic characteristics can vary on a per-syllable basis. The data processing system can use a text-to-speech engine configured to synthesize the text using the fixed and dynamic characteristics corresponding to the voice characteristics vector on a per-syllable basis.
- At
ACT 218, the data processing system can generate a non-spoken audio cue. The data processing system can combine the non-spoken audio cue with the baseline audio track generated atACT 216. To generate the non-spoken audio cue, the data processing system (e.g., via an audio cue generator) can identify objects in the visual digital component. The data processing system can only identify visual components. The data processing system can identify both visual and text-components (e.g., metadata associated with the digital component object). Upon identifying the objects, the data processing system can identify audio cues that identify or indicate the object. For example, if the data processing system identifies ocean waves and palm trees, the data processing system can select wave sounds and the sound of a breeze going through leaves. - The data processing system can combine the selected audio cues with the baseline audio track using any audio mixing technique. The data processing system can add the non-spoken audio cues at a portion of the baseline audio track or throughout the audio track. The data processing system can add the non-spoken audio cues to the baseline track in a manner that does not distort or obfuscate the spoken text in the baseline audio track, thereby improving the user experience. In some cases, the data processing system can simulate the combined audio track and test the quality. For example, the data processing system can simulate receiving the combined audio track and performing natural language processing on the combined audio track. The data processing system can validate whether the NLP component of the data processing system was able to accurately detect the spoken text by comparing the parsed text with the text generated by the text generator of the data processing system. If the data processing system is unable to accurately decipher the text in the combined audio track, the data processing system can determine that the non-spoken audio cues would have a negative impact on the spoken text and preclude an end user from accurately identifying the spoken text. Thus, in an effort to improve the user experience, the data processing system can remove one or more of the non-spoken audio cues, and then re-generate and re-test the combined audio track. The data processing system can perform this removal of non-spoken audio cues and re-generation and re-testing until the data processing system can accurately interpret the spoken text. Responsive to determining that the spoken text in the combined audio track would be perceptible, the data processing system can approve the combined audio track for presentation.
- In some cases, the data processing system can transmit the combined audio track to the computing device for presentation. In some cases, the data processing system can proceed to
ACT 220 to determine an insertion point for the audio track. The data processing system can use an insertion model trained via a machine learning technique and historical data to determine where to insert the audio track in a digital media stream being output by the computing device. The data processing system can determine an insertion point that reduces computing resource utilization, network bandwidth consumption, avoids latency or delays in the digital media stream, or improves the user experience. For example, the data processing system can determine to insert the audio track at the beginning, during, or after a segment of the digital media stream. - Upon determining an insertion point, the data processing system can proceed to
ACT 222 and provide the converted content (or audio-only digital component object) to the computing device to cause the computing device to render, play, or otherwise present the converted digital component. In some cases, the data processing system can configure the converted digital component to invoke, initiate, or perform digital actions. For example, the data processing system can provide instruction to configure the computing device or data processing system to detect trigger words in subsequent voice input from a user, and then perform a digital action responsive to the trigger words. - In some cases, the data processing system may not receive a request for content. For example, the data processing system can proactively identify keywords associated with digital streaming content rendered by a computing device. The data processing system can determine, at
decision block 206, to select content responsive to the keywords. The data processing system can then select, based on the keywords, a digital component object having a visual output format. The data processing system can determine, based on a type of the computing device, to convert the digital component object into an audio output format. The data processing system can generate, responsive to the determination to convert the digital component object into the audio output format, text for the digital component object. The data processing system can select, based on context of the digital component object, a digital voice to render the text. The data processing system can construct a baseline audio track of the digital component object with the text rendered by the digital voice. The data processing system can generate, based on the digital component object, non-spoken audio cues. The data processing system can combine the non-spoken audio cues with the baseline audio form of the digital component object to generate an audio track of the digital component object. The data processing system can provide the audio track of the digital component object to the computing device for output via a speaker of the computing device. -

The computer system orcomputing device 300 can include or be used to implement thesystem 100, or its components such as thedata processing system 102. Thecomputing system 300 includes a bus 305 or other communication component for communicating information and aprocessor 310 or processing circuit coupled to the bus 305 for processing information. Thecomputing system 300 can also include one ormore processors 310 or processing circuits coupled to the bus for processing information.

The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system such as
system 100 orsystem 300 can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network (e.g., the network 105). The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., data packets representing a digital component) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server (e.g., received by theinterface 104 of the data processing system 102). - While operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, such operations are not required to be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and all illustrated operations are not required to be performed. Actions described herein can be performed in a different order.
