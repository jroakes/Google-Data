Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of directories and groupings in a geo-spatial environment.
- A directory (e.g., a school directory, a service club directory, a church directory, etc.) may be distributed to members of a group (e.g., a group of parents, members of a community group, etc.) in printed form (e.g., a pamphlet, a booklet, a paper, etc.). The directory may include addresses, phone numbers and/or electronic contact information of the members of the group. Members of the group may trust each other for recommendations, advice, and tips because of a shared association with a physical place (e.g., a school, a church, etc.). Members of the group may wish to meet with each other on occasion to carpool (and/or walk) to a central meeting place (e.g., a school, a church, etc.). However, members represented in the directory may not know how close other members are from each other. In addition, members of the group may not receive communications and/or tips from other members of the group.
- A method, apparatus and system of directories and groupings in a geo-spatial environment are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes automatically placing communication information associated with a set of neighbors in a geo-spatial area into a group, mapping the set of neighbors in a geo-spatial map that simultaneously renders a set of pushpins representing each location of the set of neighbors to each other, and enabling a moderator and users of the group to provide additional information on each of the set of neighbors such that data associated with the set of neighbors is accessible by those of the set of neighbors who subscribe to the group.
- In addition, the method may include providing a multi-modal interface such that the communication information enables communication through a plurality of modes including phone, fax, SMS, email, printed mail, and/or face to face meetings between the set of neighbors. The method may also include aggregating a geo-spatial group index having the group and other groups acquired through a set of internet portals when the moderator ports the other groups through the internet portals into a geo-spatial social network. The data includes a visual representation of the set of pushpins simultaneously displayed in the geo-spatial map. Each of the set of pushpins is tied to a set of multi-modal contact information provided through users and the moderator.
- The method may also include providing an interface such that the moderator is able to limit access and/or editability of the multi-modal contact information. The multi-modal contact information may be integrated into the geo-spatial social network through a printed directory (e.g., may include a school directory, a church directory, a service club directory, a student directory, a block watch directory and/or a neighborhood directory, etc.) automatically transferred into the group.
- In another aspect, a method of performing a search includes obtaining a keyword from a member of a community network, obtaining a location associated with the member, obtaining a plurality of profiles in the community network corresponding to the keyword and the location, and displaying the plurality of profiles on a geo-spatial map. In addition, the method may include obtaining a search radius from the member, and adjusting the profiles using the search radius. The method may also include obtaining a group name from the member, creating a group using the group name, and associating the profiles with the group.
- The method may further include displaying the group on the geo-spatial map. The method may also include displaying a mass profile edit option associated with the profiles to the member. Each of the profiles may be any one of a claimed profile and an unclaimed profile. In addition, each of the profiles may be associated with a person, a business, and/or an organization, etc.
- In yet another aspect, a community network includes a member repository including a plurality of members, a geo-spatial repository including a plurality of locations on a geo-spatial map, a member management module configured to obtain member data (e.g., may include one of the locations) associated with each of the members, and a member recommendation module configured to obtain a keyword and a location from one of the members, obtain a subset of profiles corresponding to the keyword and the location, and display the subset of the profiles on the geo-spatial map. The member recommendation module may further be configured to obtain a search radius from the one of the members, and adjust the subset of the profiles using the search radius.
- The community network may also include a group management module configured to obtain a group name from the one of the members, create a group using the group name, and associate the subset of the profiles with the group. The group management module may be configured to display the group on the geo-spatial map. The member recommendation module may also be configured to display a mass profile edit option associated with the subset of the profiles to the one of the members. Each of the profiles may be any one of a claimed profile and an unclaimed profile. In addition, the profiles may be associated with a person, a business, and/or an organization.
- In a further aspect, a method of managing a community network includes obtaining member data associated with a member of the community network, determining a location of the member based on the member data, storing the member data in a member repository, obtaining a plurality of profiles based on the member data and the location, and recommending the profiles to the member.
- In addition, the method may include displaying the profiles on a geo-spatial map. The method may further include obtaining a login and password associated with a group from the member, and importing the group (e.g., may be provided using an external service) using the login and password. Each of the profiles may be any one of a claimed profile and an unclaimed profile.
- The methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects, and may be executed in a form of a machine-readable medium embodying a set of instructions that, when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

community network 100 may be a network formed by association of themembers 104A-N having user profiles in thecommunity 102. The user profiles may include information such as names, addresses, contact information (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, etc.), pictures, and/or other personal information. Thecommunity 102 may be a group ofmembers 104A-N residing in a specific region. For example, the specific region may be a local neighborhood, a suburb, a village, a city, a county, a state, a nation, and/or a group of nations, etc. - The
members 104A-N may include persons, businesses and/or organizations associated with specific geographic locations in thecommunity 102. In an alternate embodiment, themembers 104A-N may reside in multiple regions (e.g., multiple cities, states, countries, etc.). Themembers 104A-N may be connected through the community network 100 (e.g., accessible through a network connection such as the internet, a telecommunication network, etc.). The member management module 106 may obtain member data associated with themembers 104A-N of thecommunity 102. For example, the member data may include names, ages, professions, locations and/or address data associated with themembers 104A-N. The member data may be displayed in the user profiles of themembers 104A-N. - The
member recommendation module 108 may obtain a keyword from themembers 104A-N. Themember recommendation module 108 may also obtain a location associated with themembers 104A-N. Themember recommendation module 108 may then obtain a group ofmembers 104A-N corresponding to the keyword and the location. In one embodiment, the group ofmembers 104A-N may be displayed on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIGS. 2A , 2B, 2C and 2D). - In addition, the
