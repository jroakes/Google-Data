[0001] The present disclosure slates generally to mer hant recommendations, and more particularly to a. method for using social network connections to recommend merchants and products.
BAC GEOiiNf)
[0002] The number of merchants available in the .online marketplace has grown tremendously. Consumers and other users can search tor products to purchase online and cats: be presented with thousands of merchants offering the products being searched. Many of these merchants are offering products and services at great prices and with attractive options, such as warranties or accessories. Users can search for the fewest priced offer from the marry merchants and identity the merchant providing the offer, [0003] Unfortunately* with so mauy merchants in the online marketplace* it is virtually impossible for a. user to be acquainted wi h every merchant. The user may be hesitant to make a purchase fr m an unknown merchant despite the attractiveness of the offer. The user m y fear that the merchant is fraudulent or unethical , For example, the merchant may sell an inferior or counterfeit product* refuse returns or warranty repairs, ship orders slowly, or in. any other way be an unfavorable merchant
[0004] Currently, some search engines, shopping websites, and other entities offer trusted merchant programs. A trusted merchant program can offer to a user a list, approval, badge, or other indication that a -merchant is trusted. The merchant can. become trusted through a process of the trusted merchant program based ou attributes such as customer ratings, shipping times, and other suitable attributes.
[0005] While a conventional, trusted merchant program may give the user so e generic assurance that the merchant is not fraud aleni, the conventional trusted merchant program, cannot assure a. user on a. personalised basis that acquaintances or other contacts of the user approve o the merchant. Nor can the conventional, trusted merchant give a user specific example of successful purchases completed by friends and family of the user.
[0006] A computer-implemented method for using social network connections to recommend merchants and products is described. The method comprises receiving, using one or more computer devices, transaction data from, a plurality of transactions, the transaction data comprising, tor each of the transactions, ft identity of a customer and Information relating to the experience of the c ustomer with the corresponding transaction ; receiving a request from a user computing device associated with a user, the request comprising a identify of a merchant or a product; Searching social graph inforoi&tion of the user to identify any instances of at least one customer identified in the transaction data and having a -par icular transaction that is related to- the nrerenani o the product in the request; extracting each experience corresponding to the- dentified social, graph Instances of the at least one customer identified in the transaction data and having a particular transaction: that is related to the merchant or the product in the request; and communicating Information regarding each extracted experience t the user computing device for pieseotation on the user computing device,
[0007] A computer program product that i installed on a server located in. a trusted merchant system for using social network connections to recommend merchants and products also is described. The computer program product includes a non-transitory eoraputer-readahie storage device having computer-readable program instructions stored therein. The computer-readable program instructions include computer program instructions for receiving transa.cii.ors data from a plurality of transactions, the transaction data comprising, for each, of the transactions, an identity of a customer and information relating to the experience of the customer with the corresponding transaction ; receiving a request from a user computing device associated with a user, the request comprising an Identity of a merchant or a product; searching social graph information of the user to identify' an instances of at least one customer identified in. the transaction data and having a particular transaction that is related to the merchant or the product in the request; extracting each experience corresponding to the identified social graph Instances of the at least one customer identified in the transaction data and having a particular transaction that is related to the merchant or the product in the request; and

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE E A PL EMBODIM NTS
Overview
[0014] The example embodiments described herein provide a. trusted, merchant system that can employ a user's social graph to recommend merchants and/or products. The social graph of a user refers to all of a user's contacts, friends, family, colleagues, and other members of a user's online network. The social graph not only determines the members of a user's network but also determines bo the members are related and bow closely the members are related.
[0015] A user can conduct as Internet searc for a product or a merchant on -a user network device. As used, throughout the s ecificat on, the term ^pr ducts" should be drierpre ed to kcln&e tangible and intangible products, as well as services. The search can comprise any type of Internet search. For example, th user can enter a keyword in a search engine for a merchant or a product. Oft a merchant website, a user can search for a particular product. A user may alternatively fellow a link to a. merchant or a particular product for sale on the merchant website. Any suitable manner of locating a website for a merchant or a product can be utilized,
[0016] After arriving at a rnerehaui site or on. a product pag on a merchant site, the user device is provided instructions by the website to request a status from the trusted merch nt system. The user network device initiates a contact with the trusted merchant system over the network and makes the request,
[0017] The trusted merchant system can receive the request from the user dev e and determine if the merchant is a trusted merchant, The trusted merchant system can. additionally or alternatively determine if the product i a trusted product.
[0018] Additionally or alternatively,, the user can review a list of trusted ere!iauts on a website or other suitable location, associated with a trusted merchant system. For example, the trusted merchant system can display a. list of all trusted merchants, all trusted merchants in. a certain, merchant category, ait trusted merchants in a certain location, all trusted merchants corresponding to a web search or shopping search, or all trusted merchants in any other suitable configuration. In. another example, the user or the user device ca request the trusted merchant status while viewing content, an advertisement, or other offer concerning a merchant or a product. The trusted merchant status of a merchant can be requested and/or presented to a user on a user device In an suitable location and at any suitable time.
1001 ] To determine the stains of a merchant, the trusted merchant system, determines if the merchant is registered with, the trusted merchant system.. The merchant can sign, up to the program, and request a trusted merchant stains. The trusted -merchant system can obtain, merchant data such as product categories, locations* wehpage characteristics, shipping programs, customer service data, and other suitable data that will allow the trusted merchant system to characterize the merchant.
[0020] Based on the characteristics of the merchant, the trusted merchant system, can impose a grading s stem or other benc marks for the merchant. 'Different categories of •merchant may have different grading systems for different aspects of the merchants. For example, an aspect of the merchant that the trusted merchant system cm. log and evaluate is the on-time shipping of product. For a merchant that ships an inexpensive commodity, such as paper goods or pet supplies, a shipping time of more than 3 days can be considered to he a delayed shipment,. For a merchant that is shipping a more complex product such as home appliances or laboratory■equipment, a shipping time of 14 days ca still he considered to be a, reasonable sh pping time,
[0021 ] The merc ant ' altows the trusted -merchant ystem to log the shipping of products and. other aspects of the business, such, as reviews by customers, customer service Issues, returns, complaints, resolution of complai s, and other suitable aspects. Using the: logged data, the trusted merchant system can build a profile of the merchant and compare the profile and features of the profi le to a set of standards, thresholds, or other grading systems to determine if the merchan has earned a trusted merchant status.
[0022] !u alternate embodiments, certain, data for a. merchant cau he logged without the permission, of the merchant. For example,: solicited surveys, reviews, or other suitable data may be collected about a merchant to further evaluate the merchant The merchant may further 'be evaluated in the trusted merchant system without joining the program or requesting an evaluation,
[00.23] 'The trusted -merchant system, can former associate a specific grade to the status of the merchant. For example, the statu can be a letter grade such as A> A-t , B, or other grade letter. The status can he a descriptive text status such as "Trusted Merchant," "Superior Merchant/' "Marginal Merchant," or other suitable text. The status can. be a number score such as a 0-100 scoring system. The status can he 5-star, 4~siar, 3~star, or other star rating. Any other suitable status system can he utilized.
[0024] When the trusted merchant system receives request from a user device to provide a trusted merchant status, the trusted merchan system assesses the grade of the merchant from the database. The threshold, grade of the merchant that is required to be presented to the user as a trusted merchant can he configured hy the user, the .rusted merchant system, the website, the merchant, or other suitable party. For example, the
user can request that only merchants scoring above a threshold grade, such as a B-K should be presented as a trusted merchan In another example, the merchant can recp.sest that only when the grade of the merchant is an A or .higher should the grade be presented to a user. Multiple criteria can be used to determine whether to present, the trusted merchant assessment to the user.
[0025] If the status of the merchant meets or exceeds the grade threshold, then the merchant is identified as a trusted merchant, and the trusted, merchant system communicates the trusted, merchant status to the user network device for display in connection with the merchant's web page . If the status of the .merchant d es no meet or exceed the grade threshold, then the merchant is not identified as a trusted merchant
[0026] A process similar to the trusted merchant identification, can be conducted t determine if a product Is trusted. Based m · i e · pe formance of the product, reviews, returns, or other characteristics of a product, then a product may be identified, as a trusted product. The product and the merchant trusted status can be combined to identify a trusted product being offered by a trusted merchant. The grades or score of the merchant and. the product can be listed .separately, combined, veraged, added together, or otherwise presented to the user device.
[0027] The user network' device req uests of the trusted merchant system, if one or more members of the social graph of the user have an established experience with, the merchant or the product The trusted merchant system provides the user device with a represen tat ion, of the experi ences of the social graph connec tions.
[0028] The trusted merchant system logs experience of customers with certain merchants or groups of merchants. The customers can register with the trusted merchant system or can otherwise have the experiences logged. The trusted merchant system cars, receive experiences of the customer, such a shipping times, returns, customer service response times, reviews, recommendations, or other suitable experience indicators.
[0029] The experiences of the customers are categorized by the trusted merchant syst m and stored in a database on. the trusted merchant system,. The different characteristics of the experience can he stored n. different categories, for example, the time taken for a product to be shipped might he in a shipping database associated with the merchant or product. In another example, a review of a merchant may be quantified,
such as by t e number of st rs awarded by the customer, aad stored in a review database associated with die merchan Other aspects may be stored m appropriate databases.
[0030] Upon receipt of a request from & user network device, the trusted merchant system accesses the social graph of the user and searches for social graph connections that are represented in the database. The social graph, can. be any combination of social, networks of the user, contact databases of the user, lists of email co resporsdersts of the user, lists of trequeni transaction, counter-parties of the user,, and any other suitable social graph data. In an alternate example embodiment, other attributes connecting the user to other enstomers ma be employed. For example, the trusted merchant system may search for users sharing a similar location, working in a similar career, or other suitable attributes,
[003.1 ] The trusted mereha.nl system identities members of the social, graph of the user that are in the database associated with a merchant or a product That is, if a person in the social, graph, of the user has an experience logged at the merchant associated with the request, then the trusted merchant system can identify the experience,
[0032] The trusted merchant system further associates a specific grade to the status of the experience. For example, the experience of the customer can be a letter grade such as A, A-r, 8, or other letter grade,. The experience can. be a descriptive text status such as ""Good Experience," "Superior Experience," "Marginal Experience," or other suitable text. The status can be a. number score such as a 0-100 scoring system. Any other suitable experience s stem can be utilized,
[0033] The trusted, merchant system associates the experience grade with, data from the experience such as n umber of days to ship, number of returns, time required to respond to an. issue, or other data.
[0034] When the trusted merchant system receives a request .from, user device to provide a social graph contact experience, the trusted merchant system accesses the grade of the experience from, the database. The threshold grade of the experience that, is required, to be presented to the user as a social graph contact experience can be configured by the user, the trusted merchant system, the website, the merchant, or other suitable party. For example,, the user can. request that only experiences scoring above a threshold grade, such as a. BT, should be presented a.s a recommendation. Alternatively,
the user may request•presentation of lower scores from their social graph to provide art indication of the. e erience of other risers in the social graph. In another example, the merchant can request that only when, the grade of the experience is s A or higher should the grade be presented to itser,.
0035J If the status of the experience .resets, or exceeds the grade threshold, the the •experience is identified as a recommendat on. If the status of the experience does not meet or exceed the grad threshold, then the experience is not identified a a recommendation.
[0036] The trusted merchant system transmits the trusted m rchant stat s and/or the social graph contact experiences to the user device. The status and experience can be displayed to the user as a badge, popup window, banner, -or other suitable display. The 'display can he incorporated as part of the webpage of the merchant or t he prod uct or ax a separate webpage or other suitable display,
[0037] hi an. example embodiment, the trusted m rchant status can. he displayed as a badge on the webpage of a merchant. T e badge can display the fact that the merchant is .a trusted merchant and can additionally displa characteristics of the merchant, that contribute to the trusted -merchant status. For example,, the badge can display the percentage of shipments tha are o time or shipped within, a configured time frame such as within 1 week. The badge can displ y the number of positive reviews received by the merchant. Any other suitable data can be displayed,
[0038] Additionally or alternati ely, in the example embodiment, the badge can display the experience of a social graph contact of the user. For example, the badge may display a message, such as "Three, of your friends received their orders in three business days," In another example, the badge may display a message such as "Your friend, Bob Williams, gave this product four stars.59 Any suitable summary, statement, rating, grade, or other data of the experience of a social graph coniaet of the user can be utilized.
[0039] The badge may display the trusted merchant status and. the experience of a social graph contact of the user in a single display or in mnltipie displays. The user, the merchant, the trusted merchant system, or an suitable party may configure the displays based on user preferences,, the configuration of the website, the data to be presented, or any suitable configuration criteria.
[0040] Is another e ample embodiment, the trusted merch n system can use the experience of a social graph contact, to adjust, he grade of the merchant or product For example, if a -merchant .has an. A grade, but the experience of multiple social graph .contacts i$ siegative, then the trusted merchant system, might lower the grade of the merchant The lowered grade may he below the threshold and thus the badge i not transmitted to the user device. In another example, the trusted merchant system can still display the badge and irs.eh.sde the negative experiences of a social graph contacts, in another example, if the merchant grade is poor, but tbe experiences of multiple, social graph contacts1 is great, then th trusted merchant system -may Increase the grade of the merchant,
[0041 ] in an example embodiment, the trusted merchant system only displays positive results tor the trusted merchant assessment .and for the experiences of a social graph contact. That is, only grades over a threshold are: displayed and low grades are withheld, in an alternate example, all grades are displayed,
[0042] In an example embodiment, the displays can combine the merchant grade and the experiences of a social graph contact lor a merchant and a product being offered by the merchant That is the display can combine, average, add, or in. an other suitable manner present the displays for the merchant in combination with the product. For example, the display can present, an average score of A~ for the merchant and the product and further display that the merchant has three positive reviews from social graph contacts of the user and that, the product has one positive revie .from a social graph contact. Any suitable combination of displays can be utilized.
[0043] The functionality of tbe example embodiments will be explained in more detail in. the following description, read in conjunction with tbe figures illustrating the program low.

Exam le Processes
[0060] The components of the example operating environment 100 are described hereinafter with reference to the example met o s illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.
[0061] Figure 2 is a block Sow diagram depicting a method 200 for using social network connections to recommend merchants and products, in. accordance with certain example embodiments.
[0062] With, reference to Figures 1 and. 2S. in block 205, a user 1.01 can conduct an. Internet search for a product or a merchant system 130 on a user network device 1 10. As used throughout the specificati n, the term ""products" should be interpreted to include tangible and intangible products, as well as services. The search can comprise any type
S 3
of Internet search. For example, the user 101 can enter a keyword in a search engine for a merchant system 130 or a product. On a merchant website 133, a user 101 can search for a particular product. A user 101 may alternatively follow a link to a merchan system 130 or a particular product for sale oft die merchant website 133. Any suitable manner of locating a website 133 for a merchant or a product can be utilized.
[0063] in block- 210, the user .01 proceeds to a merchant website 133 by following a link, .advertisement, or other suitable process to arrive at merchant website 133. After arriving at a merchant website 133 or on product page on a merchant website 1 3, the user device 1 J 0 Is provided, instructions by th website 133 fo request a; status from the trusted merchant system i 60.
[0064] Additionally or alternati vely, the user 1 1 can. review a list of trusted merchants on a website or other suitable location associated wit a trusted merchant system 160, For example, the: trusted merchant system 160 can display a list of ah trusted, merchants, ail trusted merchants in a certain: merchant category, ah trusted merchants in a certain, location, all trusted merchants corresponding to web search or shopping search, or all trusted merchants in any other suitable configuration. In another example, the user .101 or the user device 1 10 can request the trusted merchant status while viewing an advertisement or other offer from merchant system 130 or for a product. The trusted merchant status of a merchant 130 can be requested and/or presented to a user 1 1 on a user device 1 10 in any suitable location and at any suitable time.
[0065] In block 215, the user network device 1 10 initiates a contact with the trusted merchant system 160 over the network 105 and makes the request The request can be transmitted by any available com unication, method, such as an internet connection, over the network 05, email, text, instant message, or any other suitable communication rnzthed.
[0066] in block 220, the trusted -merchant system .160 receives the request foam the user device 1.10 and determines if the merchant system 130 is a trusted merchant. The trusted merchant system 160 can additionally or alternatively determine If the product is a trusted product The details of block 220 are described m greater detail in the method 220 in Figure 3,
[0067] Tatnmg now to the method 220 in Figure 3, in block 305, a. merchant s stem 130 signs up ¾ the program and requests a trusted merchant st tus:. The merchant system 130 can register online, via email in person., or via any other suitable manner.
[0068] In alternate embodiments, certain data for a merchant system 30 can be logged without the permission, of the merchant system 130. For example, solicited surveys, reviews, or other su table dat may be collected about a merchant syste 130 to further evaluate the. merchant s stem .! 30, The merchant system. 130 may further be evaluated m the trusted merchant system 1 0 without joining the program, or recjuesting a evaluation .
[0069] In- block 310, the trusted merchant system 160 obtains merchant data such as product categories, locations, webpage ehara.ctarisiies, shipping programs, customer service data, and other suitable data that will allow the trusted merchant system 160 to character e the merchant. The trusted merchant system 160 can gather historical data from the merchant syste 130 and monitor future merchant operations for assessment.
[0070] i block 315. based on the characteristics of the merchant, the trusted, merchant s s em 160 compare the performance of the merchan system 130 t eshold performance level and imposes a grading system or other benchmark for the merchant system. 130, Different categories of merchant system 130 may have different grading systems, For example, one aspect of the merchant system 130 that the trusted, merchant system 160 can log and evaluate is the on time shipping of product For merchant system 130 that ships an inexpensive commodity, such as paper goods or pet supplies, a sh pin time of more than 3 days can be considered to be a delayed shipment For a merchant system 1.30 tha is shipping a more complex product such as home appliances or laboratory equipment, a shipping time of 14 days can still, be considered to be a reasonable shipping time.
[007.1] The -merchant system. 130 can allo the trusted merchant system 160 to log the shipping of product and other aspects of the business such as reviews by customers, customer service issues, returns, complaints, resolution of complaints, and other suitable aspects.
[0072] In block 320, the trusted, merchant system 160 assigns a. trusted merchant grade to the -merchant system. .1.30» 'Using the logged data, the trusted merchant system. 160 can build a profile of the merchant system. 130 and compare the profile and features of the
I S
profile to a set of standards, thresholds, or other grading; systems to determine if the merchant system J 30 has earned a trusted nierehant s tus,
[0073] The trusted merchant system 1 0 can associate a specific grade to the status of the merchan system 130. For example, the status can he a letter grade such as A, A+, B, o other letter grade. The status can he a descriptive text status such as "Trusted Merchant5', "'Superior Merchant", "Marginal Merchant", or other suitable text. The status can be a number score such as a 0-100 scoring system. An other suitable status system can he utilized.
[0074] In block 325, the trusted merchant system 16 receives a request from a trser device J 10 or other device to provide a trusted merchant status. When the trusted merch nt system. 160 receives a request from a user device 1 10 to provide a trusted •merchant status, the trusted, merchant system 160 can. assess the grade of the merchant front the database.
[0075] In block 330, the trusted merchant system. 160 determines if the trusted, merchant grade is over a threshold. The threshold grade of a .merchant system 1 0 that is required to be presented to the user 101 as a trusted merchant can be configured by the user 1 1 , the trusted merchant system 160, the website, the merchant, or other suitable party. For example, the user 101 can request that only merchants scoring above a threshold grade, such as a B-r, should he presented as a trusted merchant. Irs another example, the merchant system 130 can request that only when the grade of the merchant system. .1.30 is an. A or higher should the grade he presented to a user 101.
[0076] If the status of the merchant sy stem 130 meet or exceed the grade threshold, then the method .215 follows the "YES" branch of block 330 to block 335. if the status of the merchant system 130 does not meet, or exceed the grade threshold, then the method 215 follows the "NO" branch of block 330 to block 340.
[0077] following the YES branch of block 330 to block 335, the merchant system 130 is identified as a trusted merchant,. Following the NO branch of block 330 to block 340, the status of the merchant system 1305. the merchant system 130 is not identified as a trusted merchant. The trusted, merchant status of the merchant system. 130 can be logged on the trusted merchant system 160 in a merchant account, on a database, or on any other logging system.
[0078] A process, similar to the trusted .merchant identification can be conducted to determine if 'a product Is trusted. Based on die performance of the product reviews, •returns, or other characteristics of a product, then a product may he identified as a trusted product. The trusted merchan status can be combined to identify a trusted product being offered by a trusted merchant. The grades or scores of the merchant system 130 and the product can be listed separately, combined, averaged, added together, or otherwise presented to the user device 1.10,
[0079] From block 330 and block 335, the method 215 returns to block 220 of Figure 2.
[0080] Returning to Figure 2, in block 225, dig trusted merchant s stem determines if contacts from the social graph of the user 1 1 have experiences with the merchant system. 130 or the product . The details of block 225 are described in greater deta il in the method 225 in Figure 4.
[0081 ] Turning .now to the method 225 in Figure 4, in block 405, the trusted, merchant system 160 logs experiences of customers with, certain, merchant systems 130 or groups of merchants. The customers can register with the trusted merchant system 160 or can otherwise have die experiences logged.. The trusted .merchant system. 160 can. receive experiences of d e customer such as shipping times, returns, customer service response times, reviews, recommendations, or other suitable experience indicators.
[0082] In block 410, the experiences of the customers are categorized by the trusted merchant system 160 arid stored i a database on the t us ed merchant system 160. The different characteristics of the experience can be stored in different, categories. For example, the time taken for a product to he shipped might be in a shipping database associated with the merchant system. 130 or product, in another example, a review of a merchant system 130 may he quantified, such as by the number of star awarded by the customer, and. stored in a review database associated wit die merc ant system 130, Other aspects may be stored in appropriate databases,
[0083] In block. 415S the trusted m chant system 160 receives a request from a user device to provide social contact recommendation . Upon, receipt o a request and permission from the user 101, the trusted, merchant system 160 can access the social graph of the user 101 and search, for social graph connections that are represented in. the database. The social graph can be any combination of social networks of the user 101,
contact databases of the user 101 , lists of email correspondents of the user 10 L lists of frequent hatisaetion counter-parties of the user 101 , and any other s« stable social graph data. The trusted merchant system 0 can request a list of social graph networks and data from the user 101 and request access from the user 101 to the social g aph. The user 10,1 may provide permission, of authorization, or in. any other suitable maimer allow the trusted merchant system 160 access to the social graph data. Alternatively, the permission, ma be given explicitl at any point in t e relationship of the user 101 and the trusted merchant system 160, For example, the permission may be requested and given when the user 101 joins s opping website, registers an email account* opens a financial account, or performs any action with a system associated with the trusted merchant system. 160,
[0084] The one or more social network website 153 that, the user 101 employs can be any web-Oased community that allows users to interact over the Internet with others who typically share a common interest. Examples of the social, network website 153 that the user 101 may belong to or interact with may include, hut would not be limited to, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE■}-,. or I., INK E DIN.
[0085] The social network system 150 can provide the trusted, merchant system 160 with a list of members of the us 's online community. The social network system 150 can identify Mends and contacts that can he used to recommend a merchant system 130 and establish the strength the connection wit the user 101 , The strength of the connection, can be determined by factors that ma apply to the structure of each, particular social network system 150. For example, a social network system 150 such as FACE BOOK, may categorize numbers of the community as "friends" or "friends of ends" and L!NKEDi may categorise members as first, second, or third degree contacts.
[00-86] A contact application 1 16 in the social graph of the user 101 can be any program, or application on the itser device 1 10 or accessible by the user device 1 0 thai maintains a list of contacts of the use that the trusted merchant system 1.60 may access. Examples of contact applications 1 16 might include, but not he limited to, email applications, text applications, instant messaging, calenda invite lists, or contact databases such as OUTLOOK or ACT, The contacts, from a contact application 1 16 may
be prior imcd by factors such as frequenc .of communication with user 1 1, the number of contact applications on winch a particular contact appears, or any other prioritizing fa tors which may be extracted from the applicat ons,
[0087] In block 420, the trusted merchant system 160 can identify members of the social graph of the user 10.1 that are in the database associated with a merchant system 130 or a product. That s, if a person the social graph of the user 101 has an. experience logged at the merchant system 130 associated with, the request, then the rusted merchant system. 160 can...identify the experience,
[0088] The trusted merchant system 160 can further associate a specific grade to the status of the experience. .For example, the experience of the customer can he a fetter grade such as A, A.+ , B, or other letter grade. The experience can he a descriptive text status such. &S: " iood Experience", "Superior Experience", "Marginal Experience", or other suitable text. The status can he a number score such as a 0-100 scorin system. Any other - suitable experience system can be utilized.
[00^9] The trusted merchant system 160 can associate the experience grade with data from the experience such .as number of days to ship, number of returns, time required to respond to a customer service issue, or other data,
[0090] In block 425, the trusted merchant system 1 0 determines if one or more of the experiences of the members of the social graph of the user 101 meet the qualifications to be recommendations. When the trusted merchant system 160 receives a request from a user device 110 to provide a social graph contact experience, the trusted rn.ercha.nt s stem 160 can acces the grade of the experience from, the database. The threshold grade of the experience thai is required to be presented, to the user I' 0.1 as a social graph contact experience can he configured by the user .101 , the trusted merchant system 1.60, the website, the merchant system 130, or other suitable party. For example, the user 101 can reques thai only experiences scoring above a threshold grade, such as a B-t, should be presented, as a recommendation.. In another example, the merchant system 130 can. request thai only when the grade of the experience i an A or higher should the grade be presented to a user 101.
[0091 ] If the status of one or more of the experiences meets or exceeds the grade threshold, then the method 225 follows the "YES" branch of block 425 to block 430. if
the status of one or more of the experience does act meet or exceed the grade threshold, hen t e method 225 fellows the "NO" branch ef block 425 to block 43 >
[0092] Fott wing the YES branch to block 435, the one or more experiences of the social connection are identified as recom endations.
[0093] Following the NO branch to block 430, the one or more experience of the social connection are not identified as reeormiiendatlons.
[0094] From block 430 and block 435. the method.225 returns to block 230 of Figure 2.
[0095] Returning to Figure 2, hr block 230, the trusted merchant system 160 transmits the trusted merchant status and/or the social graph contact experiences to the user device 1 10, The status and experience can be displayed to the user 101 as a badge, popup window, anner, or other suitable display. The display can. be incorporated as part of the wehpage 133 ofHhc merchant system 1.30 or the product or as a separate wehpage or other suitable display,
[0096] In. an. example embodiment, the trusted merchan status can be displayed as a badge on the webpage ! 33 of merchant system ! 30. The badge can display the fact that tbe erc ant, system. 130 is a trusted merchant and. can additionally display characteristics of the merchant system. 130 that contribute to the trusted merchant status.. For example, the badge can display the percentage of shipments that are on time or shipped within, a configured time frame, such as within 1 week. The badge can display the number of positive reviews received by the merchant system 130. Any other suitable data can be displayed,
[0097] Additionally or alternative, in the example embodiment, the badge can display the experience of a social graph contact of the user 101. For example, the badge may- display a message such as 'Three of your friends received their orders in three business days." In another example, the badge may displa a message such as "Your t iend. Bob Williams, gave this product four stars." Any suitable summary, statement, rating* grade, or other data of the experience of a social graph contact of the irser 101 can be utilized , [0098] The badge may display the trusted merchant status and. the experience of a social graph, contact of the user 101 in a single display or in. multiple displays. The user 1.01, the merchant system 130. the trusted merchant system 160, or an suitable party
may configure the d spl ys based on user 1 1 preferences, the configuration of the website 133, the data to be presented, or any suitable e nfig ratiers criteria.
[0099] In. another example embodiment, the trusted merchant system 160 can use the experience of a social graph contact to adjust the grade of the merchant system 130 or product. For example, if a merchant system 1.30 has an A. grade, but the experience of multiple social graph contacts is negative, then the trusted merchant system 160 might lower the grade of the merchant system 130, The 'lowered grade may e below the threshold and thus the badge is not transmitted to the user device 1. 1.0, In another exaruple, the trusted merchant system 16 cm still display the badge and include the negative experiences of a social graph contacts, in another example, if the merchant system. 130 grade is poor, hot the experiences of multiple social graph contacts is great, then the trusted merchant system 160 cars, increase the grade of the merchant system 130.
[00100] in an example embodiment, the trusted merchant system 160 onl displays positiv results for the trusted merchant assessment and for th experiences of a social graph contact, That is, only grades over a threshold are displayed and low grades are withheld. In an alternate example, all grades are displayed,
[0 101 ] In an example embodiment, the displays can combine the grade of the merchant system 130 and. the experiences of a social graph contact for a merchant system. 130 and a product being offered by the -merchant system 130. That is the display can combine, average, add, or any in any other suitable manner present the displays for the merchant .system. 130 in. combination with, the product. For example, the display can present an a verage score of A- for the merchant system 130 aad the product and further display that the merchant system 130 has three positive reviews from social graph, contacts of the users and the product has one positive review from a social graph contact. Any suitable combination of displa s can be utilized.
[00102] from block 230, the method 200 ends.
