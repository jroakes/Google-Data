Less amount modification parameter value pair in conjunction value.For example, if shown content item is baseball game, can increase by high level and use
In exist participant combination (person of such as participating in A, B and C) labelling in corresponding parameter value to it is also possible to increase, but
Increase for the corresponding parameter value pair in the personal labelling of each participant by smaller value.This can allow for generally only with its
Other people watch content, but themselves personal participant seldom watching content creates personalization profiles.The individual of these reasonings
Value in profile can lower to represent that measurement lacks credibility or confidence level.In other embodiments, clear and definite confidence level
Score can be associated with each profile.The confidence score being used for the profile combining participant can be risen to more individual than being used for
The higher rank of the confidence score of each profile of people participant, a profile after reflecting reasoning rather than clearly determining.
If no there is signal or device identifier being detected in step 404, or the request quilt in response to measuring apparatus
Receive, then measuring apparatus may be in reasoning period 401B.Therefore, in step 410, measuring apparatus can generate for showing
Show the labelling of content item.In step 412, measuring apparatus can retrieve the labelling or reasoning profile for participant, and in step
Rapid 414 it may be determined that the labelling of participant or reasoning profile whether with the indicia matched for content item.As described above, determining
Mark whether to mate and can include in two parametrization bit strings execution logic double condition and whether determine the summation of result
Higher than threshold value；Determine the distance between in hyperspace two points and determine whether this distance is less than threshold value；Determine two
Whether the amount intersecting multidimensional region is more than threshold value, or any other these method.If labelling mismatches, to other marks each
Note or reasoning profile, can be with repeat step 412-414.In other embodiment, to each labelling or reasoning profile, permissible
Repeat step 412-414 is to determine best match (for example, the sum of highest logic double condition；Beeline between point, highest
Intersection region amount etc.).As described above, in some embodiments, to everyone participant and the combination to participant, permissible
Create single labelling.When personal preference is likely to the preference (although standing to trade off) combining with the participant including individual
When similar, then personal and combine both labellings can in a way with the indicia matched for content item.By identification
Best match, inference machine can determine personal individualism still more likely participant combination exist.
If indicia matched, then in step 416, measuring apparatus can record and be associated with matched indicia or reasoning profile
