- a search system retrieves a set of search results, and presents those results to a user. For example, an internet search engine retrieves a set of links to webpages based on a received search query. Ranking and ordering of the search results to identify and highlight the most relevant data increases the usefulness of the search system.
- a search system may use any number of techniques to rank search results.
- the search system determines any number of metrics for each search result in a set of search results, and combines the metrics to determine a score. The search system uses the score to rank the search results, and the ranking may be used to order a list of search results, to identify a portion of the search results for present, to determine further processing steps, for any other suitable purpose, or any combination thereof.
- the system makes use of four particular metrics: a relatedness metric, a notable entity type metric, a contribution metric, and a prize metric.
- entity types may include organizational structures, groupings, and defining characteristics associated with an entity.
- entity node “George Washington” may be connected to the entity type node “President.”
- an entity reference is an identifier, e.g., text; or other information that refers to an entity.
- an entity may be the physical embodiment of George Washington, while an entity reference is an abstract concept that refers to George Washington.
- entity reference may correspond to an entity.
- search results are retrieved from a data structure.
- the data structure also contains data regarding relationships between topics, links, contextual information, and other information related to the search results that the system may use to determine the ranking metrics.
- the data structure may contain an unordered list of movies, along with the awards and reviews for each respective movie. The search system may use the awards and reviews to determine a ranking of the list, and may present the search results using that ranking.
- An illustrative metric is, for example, a relatedness metric.
- the relatedness metric is determined based on the co-occurrence of an entity reference contained in a search query with the entity type of the entity reference on web pages.
- An entity type may be a defining characteristic and/or categorization of an entity. For example, where the search query contains the entity reference“Empire State Building,” which is determined to be of the entity type“Skyscraper,” the co-occurrence of the text “Empire State Building” and “Skyscraper” in webpages may determine the relatedness metric.
- Another illustrative metric is, for example, a notable entity type metric.
- the value of the notable entity type metric is a global popularity metric divided by a notable entity type rank.
- the notable entity type rank indicates the position of an entity type in a notable entity type list.
- Another illustrative metric is, for example, a contribution metric.
- the contribution metric is based on critical reviews, fame rankings, and other information.
- rankings are weighted such that the highest values contribute most heavily to the metric.
- Another illustrative metric is, for example, a prize metric.
- the prize metric is based on an entity's awards and prizes. For example, a movie may have been awarded a variety of awards such as Oscars and Golden Globes, each with a particular value. In some implementations, the prize metric is weighted such that the highest values contribute most heavily to the metric.
- a score is determined by combining the metrics.
- the system uses a weighted combination of the metrics, where weights are assigned to each of the metrics based on the category or entity type of search results.
- search results are ranked based on the score.
- search results are presented in an order based on the ranking.
- further processing of search results is performed based on the ranking.
- the above described metrics and to combine the metrics are merely examples and that the search system may use any suitable metric or combination of metrics to rank search results. It will also be understood that the search system may use any suitable weighting technique to combine metrics.

- the ordered list of S values is ordered from the highest reviewed contributions to the lowest reviewed contributions and notated S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S k .
- the equation for C includes a weighting function, such that a relatively higher weight is applied to a contributor's highly reviewed contributions and a relatively lower weight is applied to a contributor's lower reviewed contributions.
- an actor's highest rated movies will have the greatest contribution to that actor's fame metric, while low ranking movies will have little impact.
- this equation and technique are merely an example and that the search system may use any suitable technique, weighted equation, unweighted equation, or combination thereof, for computing a fame metric and/or a contribution metric.

- the prize metric P may be more useful in determining the relevance of a movie than the relevance of a person where there are fewer prizes awarded.
- the weight associated with prize metric P in the movie domain may be greater than the weight associated with prize metric P in the people domain.
- the notable entity type metric N may be more meaningful and thus assigned a greater weight for entities of the “People” domain and less useful for entities as assigned a lesser weight for entities of the “Movie” domain, because the entity type of a movie, e.g., genre, does not necessarily give much information about its comparative relevance, while the entity type of a person, e.g., U.S. President, gives more information as to comparative relevance.
- a weight is determined for each metric. Weights may include a single scalar value, more complex weighting functions, positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, any other suitable value or function, or any combination thereof.
- a metric may be assigned a weight of 1 when the system assigns it a 100% contribution to the score, and may be assigned a weight of 0 a metric is assigned a 0% contribution to the score.
- its domain-specific weight may be 0.
- the high value of a metric is considered detrimental to the relevance of an entity reference in a particular domain, its domain-specific weight may be negative.
- the search system determines a weight a associated with the related entities metric R, a weight b associated with the notable entity typemetric N, a weight c associated with the contribution metric C, and a weight d associated with the prize metric P.
- the weights are determined experimentally, may be based on system settings, predetermined parameters, aggregated user selections of entity references and/or data associated with entity references, any other suitable parameters, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, the weights may be predetermined in the search system and retrieved in response to receiving a search query.
- the determination for S may include a different weighting function.
- the determination for S may include multiply dependent weights and metrics, such that the impact of the value of one weight or metric is dependent upon the value of another weight or metric.
- the equation may include any suitable mathematical technique such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integrals, derivatives, summations, products, exponents, dot products, cross products, matrices, any other suitable technique, or any combination thereof.

It will be understood that this example of a graph is merely an example and that any suitable size or arrangement of nodes and edges may be employed.
- nodes in a knowledge graph can be grouped into several categories.
- Nodes may represent entities, organizational data such as entity types and properties, literal values, and models of relationships between other nodes.
- entity references, entity types, properties, and other suitable content is created, defined, redefined, altered, or otherwise generated by any suitable technique.
- content may be generated by manual user input, by automatic responses to user interactions, by importation of data from external sources, by any other suitable technique, or any combination thereof.
- one or more nodes representing that node may be added.
- a user may manually add information and organizational structures.
- a node of a knowledge graph may represent an entity.
- An entity is a thing or concept that is singular, unique, well-defined and distinguishable.
- an entity may be a person, place, item, idea, abstract concept, concrete element, other suitable thing, or any combination thereof.
- Nodes are unique, in that no two nodes refer to the same thing or concept.
- entities include things or concepts represented linguistically by nouns. For example, the color “Blue,” the city “San Francisco,” and the imaginary animal “Unicorn” may each be entities.
- An entity generally refers to the concept of the entity.
- the entity “New York City” refers to the physical city
- the knowledge graph uses a concept of the physical city as represented by, for example, an element in a data structure, the name of the entity, any other suitable element, or any combination thereof.
- the knowledge graph contains an entity reference, and not the physical embodiment of the entity.
- an entity may be the physical embodiment of George Washington, while an entity reference is an abstract concept that refers to George Washington.
- the entity “New York City” refers to the physical city, and the knowledge graph uses a concept of the physical city as represented by, for example, an element in a data structure, the name of the entity, any other suitable element, or any combination thereof.
- the term entity as used herein may correspond to an entity reference
- the term entity reference as used herein may correspond to an entity.
- a node representing organizational data may be included in a knowledge graph. These may be referred to herein as entity type nodes. As used herein, an entity type node may refer to a node in a knowledge graph, while an entity type may refer to the concept represented by an entity type node. An entity type may be a defining characteristic of an entity reference.
- entity type node Y may be connected to an entity reference node X by an “Is A” edge or link, discussed further below, such that the graph represents the information “The Entity X Is Type Y.”
- entity reference node “George Washington” may be connected to the entity type node “President.”
- An entity reference node may be connected to multiple entity type nodes, for example, “George Washington” may also be connected to entity type node “Person” and to entity type node “Military Commander.”
- the entity type node “City” may be connected to entity reference nodes “New York City” and “San Francisco.”
- the concept “Tall People,” although incompletely defined, for example the knowledge graph may not necessarily include a strict definition of “tall,” may exist as an entity type node in the knowledge graph anyway.
- the presence and meaning of the entity type node “Tall People,” and other entity type nodes may be based on user interaction.
- an entity type node may include or be connected to data about: a list of properties associated with that entity type node, the domain to which that entity type node belongs, descriptions, values, any other suitable information, or any combination thereof.
- a domain refers to a collection of related entity types.
- the domain “Film” may include, for example, the entity types “Actor,” “Director,” “Filming Location,” “Movie,” any other suitable entity type, or any combination thereof.
- entities are associated with types in more than one domain.
- the entity reference node “Benjamin Franklin” may be connected with the entity type node “Politician” in the domain “Government” as well as the entity type node “Inventor” in the domain “Business”.
- properties associated with entity reference nodes or entity type nodes may also be represented as nodes.
- nodes representing the property “Population” or “Location” may be connected to the entity type node “City.”
- the combination and/or arrangement of an entity type and its properties is referred to as a schema.
- schemas are stored in tables or other suitable data structures associated with an entity type node.
- the knowledge graph may be self-defining or bootstrapping, such that it includes particular nodes and edges that define the concept of nodes, edges, and the graph itself.
- the knowledge graph may contain an entity reference node “Knowledge Graph” that is connected to property nodes that describe a knowledge graph's properties such as “Has Nodes” and “Has Edges.”
- literals may be associated with a particular entity reference in a terminal node by an edge defining the relationship.
- literals may refer to values and/or strings of information.
- literals may include dates, names, and/or numbers.
- the entity reference node “San Francisco” may be connected to a terminal node containing the literal “815,000” by an edge annotated with the property “Has Population.”
- terminal nodes may contain a reference or link to long text strings and other information stored in one or more documents external to the knowledge graph.
- literals are stored as nodes in the knowledge graph.
- literals are stored in the knowledge graph but are not assigned a unique identification reference as described below, and are not capable of being associated with multiple entities.
- literal type nodes may define a type of literal, for example “Date/Time,” “Number,” or “GPS Coordinates.”
- the grouping of an edge and two nodes is referred to as a triple.
- the triple represents the relationship between the nodes, or in some implementations, between the node and itself.
- higher order relationships are modeled, such as quaternary and n-ary relationships, where n is an integer greater than 2.
- information modeling the relationship is stored in a node, which may be referred to as a mediator node.
- the information “Person X Donates Artifact Y To Museum Z” is stored in a mediator node connected entity reference nodes to X, Y, and Z, where each edge identifies the role of each respective connected entity reference node.
- the knowledge graph may include information for differentiation and disambiguation of terms and/or entities.
- differentiation refers to the many-to-one situation where multiple names are associated with a single entity.
- disambiguation refers to the one-to-many situation where the same name is associated with multiple entities.
- nodes may be assigned a unique identification reference.
- the unique identification reference may be an alphanumeric string, a name, a number, a binary code, any other suitable identifier, or any combination thereof.
- the unique identification reference may allow the search system to assign unique references to nodes with the same or similar textual identifiers.
- the unique identifiers and other techniques are used in differentiation, disambiguation, or both.
- a node may be associated with multiple terms or differentiation aliases in which the terms are associated with the same entity.
- the terms “George Washington,” “Geo. Washington, “President Washington,” and “President George Washington” may all be associated with a single entity, and thus with a single entity reference node in the knowledge graph. This may in some implementations provide differentiation and simplification in the knowledge graph.
- multiple nodes with the same or similar names are defined by their unique identification references, by associated nodes in the knowledge graph, by any other suitable information, or any combination thereof. For example, there may be an entity reference node related to the city “Philadelphia,” an entity reference node related to the movie “Philadelphia,” and an entity reference node related to the cream cheese brand “Philadelphia.” Each of these nodes may have a unique identification reference, stored for example as a number, for disambiguation within the knowledge graph. In some implementations, disambiguation in the knowledge graph is provided by the connections and relationships between multiple nodes.
- the city “New York” may be disambiguated from the state “New York” because the city is connected to an entity type “City” and the state is connected to an entity type “State.”
- a node may be defined by associated types, by other entities connected to it by particular properties, by its name, by any other suitable information, or any combination thereof. These connections may be useful in disambiguating, for example, the node “Georgia” that is connected to the node “United States” may be understood represent the U.S. State, while the node “Georgia” connected to the nodes “Asia” and “Eastern Europe” may be understood to represent the country in eastern Europe.
- a node may include or connect to data defining one or more attributes.
- the attributes may define a particular characteristic of the node.
- the particular attributes of a node may depend on what the node represents.
- an entity reference node may include or connect to; a unique identification reference, a list of entity types associated with the node, a list of differentiation aliases for the node, data associated with the entity reference, a textual description of the entity reference, links to a textual description of the entity reference, other suitable information, or any combination thereof.
- nodes may contain a reference or link to long text strings and other information stored in one or more documents external to the knowledge graph.
- the storage technique may depend on the particular information. For example, a unique identification reference may be stored within the node, a short information string may be stored in a terminal node as a literal, and a long description of an entity reference may be stored in an external document linked to by a reference in the knowledge graph.
- An edge in a knowledge graph may represent a semantic connection defining a relationship between two nodes.
- the edge may represent a prepositional statement such as “Is A,” “Has A,” “Is Of A Type,” “Has Property,” “Has Value,” any other suitable statement, or any combination thereof.
- the entity reference node of a particular person may be connected by a “Date Of birth” edge to a terminal node containing a literal of his or her specific date of birth.
- the properties defined by edge connections of an entity reference may relate to nodes connected to the type of that entity reference.
- the entity type node “Movie” may be connected to entity reference nodes “Actor” and “Director,” and a particular movie may be connected by an edge property “Has Actor” to an entity reference node representing a particular actor.
- nodes and edges define the relationship between an entity type node and its properties, thus defining a schema.
- an edge may connect an entity type node to a node associated with a property, which may be referred to as a property node.
- Entities of the type may be connected to nodes defining particular values of those properties.
- the entity type node “Person” may be connected to property node “Date of birth” and a node “Height.”
- the node “Date of birth” may be connected to the literal type node “Date/Time,” indicating that literals associated with “Date of birth” include date/time information.
- the entity reference node “George Washington” may be connected by an “Is A” edge to the entity type node representing “Person,” thus indicating an entity type of the entity reference, and may also be connected to a literal “Feb. 22, 1732” by the edge “Has Date Of birth,” thus defining a property of the entity reference.
- the knowledge graph defines both entity types and properties associated with a particular entity reference by connecting to other nodes.
- “Feb. 22, 1732” may be a node, such that it is connected to other events occurring on that date.
- the date may be further connected to a year node, a month node, and a day of node. It will be understood that this information may be stored in any suitable combination of literals, nodes, terminal nodes, interconnected entities, any other suitable arrangement, or any combination thereof.

Abstract
Description
in which P(E) is the probability of finding entity reference E in a text corpus, e.g. one or more webpages, and P(ErREj) is the probability of finding both the entity reference E and the related entity reference REj, indexed by index j, in the text corpus. Another illustrative expression for determining co-occurrence C(ErREj) is shown by Eq. 2:
in which N(E) is the number of instances of entity reference E in a text corpus, e.g. one or more webpages, N(REj) is the number of instances of related entity reference REj in the text corpus, e.g. one or more webpages, and N(E,REj) is the number of instances of both the entity reference E and the related entity reference REj the text corpus. In some implementations, the one or more processors may normalize, scale, shift, or otherwise alter the co-occurrence value to convert them into relatedness metrics. It will be understood that the aforementioned equations are merely an example and that any suitable equation, technique, other suitable processing, or any combination thereof, may be used to determine a co-occurrence value, a relatedness metric, or any combination thereof.
where G is a global popularity metric and n is a notable entity type rank. In some implementations, the global popularity metric G includes, for example, a ranking value based on aggregated user selections of entity references and/or data associated with entity references. In an example, a global popularity metric includes the likeliness that a particular search result generated in response to a similar search query will be selected by a random user for further browsing. The global popularity metric may also include the number of links to a particular search result, the number of links from a particular search result, the number of visits to a particular search result, any other suitable statistical information related to site visits and connectedness, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, the global popularity metric may include a ranking that would be used to order results by a web search engine.
A particular short story may have global popularity metric 20 and notable entity type rank 8, and thus have notable entity typemetric
In some implementations, where entities are associated with more than one entity type, a notable entity type metric may be determined based on a combination of the entity types, based on the more popular entity type, based on the least popular entity type, based on any other suitable technique, or any combination thereof.
where Sn is a review value of a particular contribution n of a set of k contributions, β is a constant that is an element of the inclusive set 0 to 1, and n is a ranking of the particular contributions. This definition of C is expressed such that the contribution metric C is equal to the quotient of dividing the summation of the product of each individual contribution multiplied by the constant β raised to the power of that contributions rank in an ordered list, by the summation of constant β raised to each power of contributions rank in an ordered list. In some implementations, the ordered list of S values is ordered from the highest reviewed contributions to the lowest reviewed contributions and notated S0, S1, S2, . . . , Sk. In some implementations, the equation for C includes a weighting function, such that a relatively higher weight is applied to a contributor's highly reviewed contributions and a relatively lower weight is applied to a contributor's lower reviewed contributions. For example, an actor's highest rated movies will have the greatest contribution to that actor's fame metric, while low ranking movies will have little impact. It will be understood that this equation and technique are merely an example and that the search system may use any suitable technique, weighted equation, unweighted equation, or combination thereof, for computing a fame metric and/or a contribution metric.
where An is be the prize metric of a particular prize n of a set of k prize, δ is a constant that is an element of the inclusive set 0 to 1, and n is a ranking of the particular prizes. This definition of P is expressed such that the prize metric P is equal to the quotient of dividing a summation of the product of each individual prize multiplied by the constant δ raised to the power of that contribution's rank in an ordered list, by the summation of constant δ raised to each power of prize rank in an ordered list. The ordered list of P values may be arranged such that the prizes are ordered from highest value to lowest value and notated A0, A1, A2, . . . , Ak. In some implementations, the equation for P applies a relatively higher weight to an entity reference's more significant awards and a relatively lower weight to a less significant awards. In some implementations, significance values are determined based on a popularity metric, predetermined information, historical information, aggregated user selections of entity references and/or data associated with entity references, any other suitable parameters, or any combination thereof. In an example, a movie's prize with the highest significance will have the largest impact on its P, while a less significant prize will have a less significant impact.
S=(a|R)+(b|N)+(C|C)+(d|P) (6)
such that the score is a summation of the products of the metrics and their associated weights. It will be understood that this particular calculation of a score is merely an example and that any suitable calculation may be used. For example, the determination for S may include a different weighting function. In another example, the determination for S may include multiply dependent weights and metrics, such that the impact of the value of one weight or metric is dependent upon the value of another weight or metric. The equation may include any suitable mathematical technique such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integrals, derivatives, summations, products, exponents, dot products, cross products, matrices, any other suitable technique, or any combination thereof.
