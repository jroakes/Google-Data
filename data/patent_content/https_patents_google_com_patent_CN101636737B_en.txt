Embodiment
Figure 1A illustrates the exemplary search service, and the service of this exemplary search has search service front-end 110, results mixer 120, be used to the mobile search engine 150 searching for the universal search engine 130 of generic resource 140 and be used to search for mobile resources 160.
Figure 1B illustrates the example user interface of the exemplary search service of presenting to the user (" mobile subscriber ") who uses the mobile device that comprises the mobile phone that for example moves the WAP browser.The user is through website 180 and search service interface.The user is with search inquiry inputted search inquiry input area 182.The user can select in the following radio button, and each radio button is associated with the type of the resource that will search for: web radio button 184, image radio button 186, locally storing radio button 188, mobile web radio button 190 or mobile news radio button 192.If there is not button to be selected, the web search is default selection.After the inputted search inquiry, the user clicks " search " button 194 and searches for according to the inquiry of input and the resource to be searched of any selection with initiation.In some embodiments, can ask that add or dissimilar search, and the search that can ask a plurality of types, for example use check box to replace radio button.In some embodiments, the search to mobile resources is default selection.In some embodiments, user interface does not comprise radio button and the selection of the type of treating searching resource is not provided for the user.The user submits search inquiry to and receives according to the Search Results of the inquiry of input with the multiple resource that can search for (for example, moving webpage, generic web pages or the like).
Search service front-end is to be in particular the mobile subscriber to be designed for the mobile device request Search Results (for example, search service provides with the result to user-friendly form to mobile device) into them.The mobile subscriber can want to discern generic resource, mobile resources (page that for example, creates with wireless markup language (" WML ")) or both results.Though search service designs for the mobile subscriber, it can be used for example non-moving user's use of the non-mobile device of personal desktop computer.
Each resource by Search Results identification is to obtain from specific corpus.For example, why mobile resources is called as mobile resources is to obtain from moving corpus because of them, and generic resource is obtained from the general-purpose web corpus.Addressable resource is grouped into a plurality of corpus usually and is used for index and search on web, and any one resource can be found in one or more corpus.In the context of search engine, different corpus is associated with different scoring algorithms usually, because for resource being carried out the useful factor of rank usually according to the character of resource and difference.
Fig. 2 is the diagram mobile subscriber to the operation of example of service with to the process flow diagram of the use of service.
Said search service front-end receives mobile subscriber's inquiry (step 205).Search service is the mobile subscriber through the source of detecting inquiry with User Recognition usually.Mobile subscriber's inquiry derives from any of various moving sources of mobile device for example.
In some embodiments, search service front-end provides the Search Results that is linked to the general-purpose web resource to move friendly mode.More specifically; Even being designed by the web browser that on personal computer, moves usually, typical webpage appears; When the mobile subscriber passed through the search result link accessed web page, if the page also is not with mobile friendly form, in fact the mobile subscriber received to move the page of friendly form.Click search result link, rather than obtain webpage, invoke code converter in fact, this code converter conversion webpage and send webpage rather than the parent page of being changed to the user.
The mobile subscriber possibly want search to move and generic resource, but possibly submit the search inquiry of this intention of nonrecognition to, perhaps submits the only search inquiry of the resource of a type of request search by error to.Search service can be inferred user's intention and the Search Results that expectation is provided through inquiry sensing universal search engine and mobile search engine with the user.The mobile search engine can be searched for various types of mobile resources, or it can be engine of one or several search specific resources, and said specific resources for example moves news or mobile shop.
Said search service is directed to universal search engine (step 210) with mobile subscriber's inquiry.Universal search engine is carried out search and is produced generic search results (step 215).These results can comprise except the resource of conventional HTML (HTML) the document, comprise for example PDF (portable document format) document, word processing file, the displaying document based on lantern slide, animation, image, audio media files, audio-visual media file, extend markup language (XML) document and have the page of server side scripting.
Universal search engine is each calculating search result quality score (step 220) of its Search Results.Use search result quality score, universal search engine is to generic search results rank (step 225).In other embodiments, results mixer is to the generic search results rank.
Search service also will be inquired about and point to mobile search engine (step 230).The mobile search engine is carried out search and is produced one or more mobile search results (step 235).As generic search results, these results can comprise the resource except that the WML document, comprise for example xHTML (extendible HTML) document and cHTML (compact HTML) document.
The mobile search engine is each calculating search result quality score (step 240) of its Search Results.In order to calculate score value, the mobile search engine uses and employed algorithm of universal search engine or different scoring algorithm or the formula of formula.Use search result quality score, the mobile search engine is to mobile search results rank (step 245).In other embodiments, results mixer is to the mobile search results rank.
Results mixer will move to mix with generic search results and make the user receive single compound the appearing in response to the Search Results of search inquiry.
As shown in Figure 3, in some embodiments, results mixer at first determines whether to appear any mobile search results.Whether it can be for example comes to do like this (step 302) greater than number of thresholds through the quantity of the mobile search results of confirming to be produced by search inquiry.If the quantity of mobile search results is too little, results mixer draws the conclusion fully relevant with user's search inquiry of coming to nothing so.When using this method, results mixer will be only enough presents mobile search results (step 304) greatly the time in the quantity of mobile search results.
Number of thresholds can be absolute quantity or number percent.For example, number percent can be represented by the mobile search results of results mixer reception and the number percent of the number of combinations of the mobile and generic search results that is received.
Results mixer determines whether to revise mobile search results quality score (step 250).Depend on confirming of it, results mixer will or will not revised mobile search results quality score (step 255).Revising score value possibly be necessary for making mobile search results quality score and generic search result quality scores match, and is necessary for the serviceability that appears that improves the Search Results that mixes perhaps.
Can use one or more signals to confirm; These one or more signals comprise that whether inquiry is " moving " inquiry, the Search Results quantity that whether surpasses threshold scores, mobile search results, the attribute of the mobile resources in search, found, the attribute of the generic resource of perhaps in search, finding.In some embodiments, when results mixer is used above a signal, it will use signal and revise the mobile search results quality score with nonlinear mode.
In some embodiments, according to the one or more words in the search inquiry, results mixer is categorized as search inquiry " moving ", that is, whether it possibly be intended to the search (step 306) to the mobile resources of the for example page.If results mixer will increase the search result quality score (step 308) of mobile search results.For example, if search inquiry comprises term " the tinkle of bells ", results mixer can confirm that such inquiry possibly be intended to the search to mobile resources, the couplet because speech " the tinkle of bells " and mobile device are closely related.In this case, results mixer will increase the mobile search results quality score.It can for example come to do like this through the number that whole mobile search results quality score multiply by greater than 1.In addition or as an alternative, in some embodiments, possibly not be intended to the search to mobile resources if search inquiry is determined, results mixer will reduce the mobile search results quality score.
In order search inquiry to be categorized as " moving ", results mixer is used query classifier in some embodiments.In some embodiments, sorter uses discrete search log, and this discrete search log is collected respectively and referred in particular to the inquiry of search generic resource and refer in particular to the inquiry of searching for mobile resources.Search log comprises inquiry, and can comprise the Search Results that is associated with each inquiry.Search log is used statistical study, and query classifier confirms that what inquiry is " moving " inquiry, i.e. the search mobile resources is pointed in what inquiry usually.Confirm that according to this query classifier can be categorized as given search inquiry mobile or not be.
Query classifier may be implemented as naive Bayesian (
In some embodiments, in order to determine whether to revise the mobile search results quality score, results mixer is perhaps used the attribute (step 310) by the resource of mobile search results identification separately except that the other factors of having described.
For example, for each mobile search results that is linked to the webpage that links with the downloadable content that is used for mobile device, results mixer can increase corresponding search result quality score.A reason that increases score value is that to be considered to for mobile device or mobile subscriber usually be high-quality result to the mobile search results of the webpage that is associated with the downloadable content that is used for mobile device of identification.
Like another example, results mixer can use the language (" query language ") that creates inquiry to determine whether to revise any mobile search results quality score.In order to confirm the language of inquiry; Results mixer can request for utilization number is No.60/793; 677, autograph is any in the method for describing in the U.S. Patent application of " QueryLanguage Identification (query language identification) ", and this application is incorporated in this by reference in full.Results mixer compares the language of each mobile resources that the language and the mobile search results of inquiry are discerned.Results mixer can be uniformly or based on each result's specific language to according to relatively revising each search result quality score, increase same-language result's score value and reducing different language result's score value.
In some embodiments, results mixer can reduce the search result quality score of whole mobile search results when having mobile search results seldom.A reason of doing like this is that then mobile search results unlikely is correlated with if there is seldom mobile search results.
In some embodiments, in order to determine whether to revise the mobile search results quality score, results mixer is perhaps used the attribute by the resource of generic search results identification individually except that the other factors of having described.For example, if generic search results and mobile search results each all discern the resource that is positioned at same domain (for example, " cnn.com "), results mixer will increase the score value of mobile search results.A reason of doing like this be if mobile search results identification with by the resource of the resource sharing same domain of generic search results identification mobile search results more maybe with inquire about relevant.
In some embodiments, results mixer is used one or more threshold scores to decide and how to be revised each mobile search results quality score (step 312).For example, when using two threshold scores, results mixer will multiply by a value to the mobile search results quality score that only surpasses a threshold scores, and will multiply by different values to the mobile search results quality score that surpasses two threshold scores.Through different multipliers being applied to surpass the score value of different threshold values, results mixer can be transformed to the score value more suitable with generic search result quality scores with the mobile search results quality score.As an alternative, results mixer can be carried out other mathematic(al) manipulation that is different from mere multiplication, and results mixer can be used the threshold scores of varying number.
For example, the scope of mobile search results quality score can be from 1 to 100, and the scope of generic search result quality scores can be from 1000 to 5000.In this example, suppose move and the scope of generic search result quality scores between do not have linear dependence.More specifically, mobile score value 50 is unsuitable with generic score 3000.Results mixer will use threshold value between the sub-range of moving score value, (for example to distinguish; Threshold value 20 and 80 is associated with sub-range 1-20,21-80 and 81-100) and between the sub-range of generic score, distinguish (for example, threshold value 3000 and 4500 is associated with sub-range 1000-3000,3001-4500 and 4501-5000).In addition, for the reason of following explanation, each sub-range of moving score value is associated with a sub-interval of generic score.The mobile score value that results mixer is modified in interior mobile score value of a sub-interval so that modification drops in the sub-range of the generic score that is associated with the said sub-range of moving score value.
For the sub-range that will move score value is associated with the sub-range of generic score, system uses the assessment grading.The assessment grading is the grading (for example, " coupling fully ", " useful ", " uncorrelated ") of being assigned by the people who respectively sample results is graded according to the grading standard.Sample results can be discerned and changed into the webpage that moves friendly form by code converter.System receives sample results after sample queries is pointed to search engine.Sample queries belongs to that a plurality of possible sample queries are concentrated, and one in each query set and several different classes of (for example, " navigation ", " Downloadable ", " information ", " special topic " or the like) is associated.System is the mobile search engine, for universal search engine and in some cases for moving and universal search engine is created sample query set.
The scope that system will receive the mobile score value of an assessment grading be associated with the scope of the generic score that receives the same evaluation grading (that is the mobile score value that, receives " useful " grading is associated with the generic score that reception " useful " is graded).
Results mixer uses threshold scores to confirm what sub-range mobile score value belongs to.Said system confirms what threshold scores will be results mixer will use.According to confirming these threshold scores in assessment grading that is used for sample results and the association that is used between the search result quality score of sample results.For example, for score value scope 1 to 100 with for the sample query set that is directed to the mobile search engine, the score value that drops in 1 to 20 scope can be interrelated with " uncorrelated " grading; The score value that drops in 21 to 80 the scope can be interrelated with " useful " grading; And the score value that drops in 81 to 100 the scope can be interrelated with " meeting fully " grading.Inquiry with length (for example, the quantity of word in search inquiry) is associated with lower score value usually, and therefore lower threshold scores is created in long inquiry usually.
After revising the mobile search results quality score, results mixer is used said score value will move with the generic search results rank to become single rank order (step 260).
According to these ranks, Search Results is mixed (step 265) to results mixer so that both can appear in the single tabulation of Search Results.
Results mixer also removes duplicate search results (step 270).
Duplicate can be for example possibly be discerned each with generic search results and is positioned at these two webpages of different URL (" URL ") and occurs because when two webpages only are different editions each other, move.For example, to locate as generic web pages at URL " http://www.bbc.co.uk " be obtainable and to locate as moving webpage at URL " http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile " be obtainable to the webpage of " BBC ".Two webpages are quoted content much at one, but with different forms (that is, move webpage with mobile friendly format design, and generic web pages not being).In other cases, duplicate is with same format and has essentially identical content.
In each case, results mixer selects in the duplicate search results to appear, and removes another and make it does not presented to the user.Because search service designs for the mobile subscriber, so results mixer will select to keep mobile search results to have precedence over generic search results.If generic search results has the rank higher than mobile search results, results mixer will move on to mobile search results the position of the shared order of generic search results that removes.In some embodiments, the higher search result quality score of generic search results is associated results mixer with moving perhaps with mobile search results.
The result that search service front-end presents mixing gives user's (step 275).Rank is confirmed the order that the result will be appeared.
