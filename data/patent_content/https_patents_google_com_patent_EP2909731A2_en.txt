- a content owner may share a content item by requesting a reference (e.g., a uniform resource identifier (URI) or other link) to the content item from the cloud-based service and sharing the reference with others.
- the content owner may share the reference by, for example, sending an email or other message (e.g., a text message, an online chat message) with the reference to one or more recipients, by creating a post on a social networking site, or by publishing the reference in other content (e.g., a website or traditional print media).
- Other users wishing to access the content item must receive the reference and use the reference to locate the content item.
- search engines may have web crawlers that are configured to
- a web crawler may not be able to locate a public content item that stored on a cloud-based service unless the web crawler has come across a reference to the public content item in one of the web pages the web crawler has crawled. If the reference (e.g., the URI or location) to the public content item has not been published on another website, the web crawler may not ever discover the public content item.
- the reference e.g., the URI or location
- Various aspects of the subject technology relate to identifying a reference to a content item stored by a first service (e.g., cloud-based service) and providing the reference to a second service (e.g., search engine).

- the system may generate a list of the content items and transmit the list to one or more other services so that the content items may be made available to the different users of the other services (e.g., users a search engine).
- the list of content items may be in various forms, such as an XML file, a sitemap file, or any other file type that may be posted on a website or transmitted to other services (e.g., pinging or directly submitting a sitemap to the other services).
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example network environment 100 in which a system for detecting sharing properties of a content item located on a cloud-based service may exist, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a client-server network environment 100, other aspects of the subject technology may include other configurations including, for example, peer-to-peer environments.
- the network environment may include a client device 105 connected to one or more servers 120 via a network 150 such as the Internet.
- the client device 105 may be any machine or computing device capable of communicating with the other devices, systems, or servers.
- Possible client devices 105 may include, for example, mobile devices (e.g., tablet computers, smart phones, or personal digital assistants), laptops, desktop computers, or any other computing devices (e.g., smart-displays, global positioning system devices, etc.).
- the one or more servers 120 may each be a computing system having a processor, a memory, and communications capabilities. Furthermore, multiple servers 120 may be at the same location or at different locations and communicate with one another through the network 150 or a different network.
- the one or more servers 120 may host various systems configured to provide services to the client device 105.
- a server or a cluster of servers may host a search engine configured to receive search queries from a user of the client device 105, identify a set of search results, and provide the search results to the user.
- the servers 120 or clusters of servers may also host various cloud-based services configured to store documents, audio files, images, or other content items. Users may use the client device 105 to upload the content items, access the content items, edit the content items, or share the content items with others.
- Example cloud-based services may include cloud storage services, content sharing services (e.g., file sharing or photo sharing websites), social networking services, or any other services where digital content may be uploaded to a server and shared with others.
- the 120 or a cluster of servers may also host a system configured to identified content items stored on one or more cloud-based services that are shared with the public and provide references to the content items to one or more search engines.
- One such system is described below with respect to FIG. 2.
- the one or more search engines may use the references to the content items to locate the content items, index them, and make them available for searching by users.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example system 200 configured to determine the sharing properties of content items stored on one or more cloud-based services, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- the system 200 may include an interface module 205, a sharing module 210, an update module 215, and a reporting module 220. In other aspects, however, the system 200 may include additional modules, fewer modules, or different modules.
- the interface module 205 is configured to contact a cloud-based service and access information about content items stored on the cloud-based service. For example, the interface module 205 may access references to content items stored by the cloud-based service and the sharing properties for those content items.
- the sharing properties for each content item may be accessed from, for example, an access control list (ACL) associated with the content item that indicates which entities (e.g., particular users, groups of users, the general public, etc.) are authorized to perform a particular control action (e.g., access, create, view, edit, delete, etc.).
- ACL access control list
- the sharing module 210 may determine, based on the sharing properties of the content items, content items that are available to the public (e.g., the general public is allowed to perform at least one control action such as access the content item) and generate a list of content items available to the public.
- the list of public content items may be in various forms, such as an XML file, a sitemap or site index file, or any other data type.
- each public content item may have an associated entry in the list of public content items that includes information about the public content item that may be helpful to a search engine.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example definition 300 of an entry for a list of public content items, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- Each entry in the list of public content items may include, for example, the location of the content item (e.g., a reference or URI for the content item) as well as an indication of the protocol needed to access the content item, the last date and time the content item was modified (which may include modifications to its sharing properties), an indication of how frequently the content item is changed or updated, and a priority value that indicates how important the content item is relative to other content items on stored by the cloud-based service.
- the location of the content item e.g., a reference or URI for the content item
- an indication of the protocol needed to access the content item e.g., the last date and time the content item was modified (which may include modifications to its sharing properties)
- an indication of how frequently the content item is changed or updated e.g., a priority value that indicates how important the content item is relative to other content items on stored by the cloud-based service.
- the reporting module 220 may be configured to provide the list of public content items to one or more search engines.
- providing the list of public content items may include posting the list of public content items or a file (e.g., a sitemap file) that includes the list on a website.
- providing the list to search engines includes transmitting the file to a search engine (e.g., pinging or directly submitting a sitemap file to a search engine) either on its own accord or in response to a request from the search engine.
- the system 200 may also be configured to detect updates to the sharing properties of public content items stored on the cloud-based service and inform a search engine whether a private content item has become public or whether a public content item has become private. For example, when a user changes the sharing properties of the content item, the ACL for the content item may be updated.
- the update module 215 may be configured to detect the updates to the ACLs associated with the content items stored on the cloud-based service and determine whether the each update is to make an associated content item public or to make the associated content item private. Based on the determination, the reporting module 220 may update the list of public content items (e.g., an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file or sitemap file) and provide the updated list of public content items to the search engine. In other aspects, instead of providing the updated list, the reporting module 220 may provide the search engine with updates to the list of public content items (e.g., the changes to the previously provided list of public content items).
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- the updated list of public content items may be provided to the search engine when an update to a ACL occurs that effects the existing list of public content items.
- the updated list may be provided when a certain number of updates to ACLs of content items have occurred (e.g., 1000 updates to ACLs of content items on the cloud-based server), periodically (e.g., every hour), or a combination of schemes.
- FIG. 4A is a flow chart illustrating an example process 400 for creating a list of public content items, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. Although the steps in process 400 are shown in a particular order, certain steps may be performed in different orders or at the same time. In addition, although the process steps of FIG. 4A are described with reference to the components of the system 200 in FIG. 2, the steps are not limited to being performed these components.
- the interface module 205 may contact one or more servers that host a cloud-based service and retrieve references (e.g., a location or a URI) to content items stored by the cloud-based service as well as the sharing properties of those content items.
- the interface module 205 may contact the one or more servers over a network (e.g., the Internet or a local area network) or, in some aspects, the interface module 205 may be hosted by the same one or more servers as the cloud-based service and the interface module 205 may retrieve the information without the use of the network.
- a network e.g., the Internet or a local area network
- the sharing module 210 may determine which content items stored on the cloud-based service are public at step 410 and, at step 415, generate a list of public content items based on the determination.
- the list of public content items may contain an entry for each public content item that includes the reference that may be used to access the public content item.
- the list of public content items may be in the form of a sitemap, an XML file, or any other data structure or file type that may be used by a search engine.
- the reporting module 220 may make the list of public content items available to a search engine by, for example, publishing the list of public content items on a website that is accessible to a search engine, by transmitting the list of public content items directly to the search engines, or by providing the list of public content items to the search engine when requested.
- the system 200 may also be configured to detect new content items and/or changes to sharing properties of content items and update the list of public content items.
- the updated list (or updates to the list) may then be provided to one or more search engines.
- FIG. 4B is a flow chart illustrating an example process 425 for detecting the sharing properties of a newly uploaded content item on a cloud-based service, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. Although the steps in process 425 are shown in a particular order, certain steps may be performed in different orders or at the same time. In addition, although the process steps of FIG. 4B are described with reference to the components of the system 200 in FIG. 2, the steps are not limited to being performed these components.
- the system 200 may maintain a list of public content items stored by a cloud- based service.
- the system 200 may detect the newly uploaded content item and update the list of public content items if the newly uploaded content item is to be shared with the general public.
- a cloud- based service may notify the system 200 when a new content item has been uploaded.
- the interface module 205 may receive the uploaded content item itself or a reference to the content item along with sharing properties (e.g., an ACL) for the content item.
- the system 200 may determine whether the sharing properties for the content item indicate that the content item is to be shared with the public at step 435. If the sharing properties indicate that the content item is to be shared with the public, at step 440, the update module 215 may create an entry corresponding to the newly uploaded content item and insert the entry into the list of public content items. If the sharing properties do not indicate that the content item is to be shared with the public, the update module 215 will not update the list of public content items (see step 445 in FIG. 4B).
- the content item and/or the sharing properties for the content item may be altered after the content item has been uploaded to the cloud-based service by, for example, a user, a content owner, or system administrator.
- the system 200 may detect the change to the content item and determine if an update to the list of public content items should be made in order to keep the list of public content items up-to-date.
- FIG. 4C is a flow chart illustrating an example process 450 for detecting changes to a content item and providing an updated list of public content items, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- steps in process 450 are shown in a particular order, certain steps may be performed in different orders or at the same time.
- process steps of FIG. 4C are described with reference to the components of the system 200 in FIG. 2, the steps are not limited to being performed these components.
- the system 200 may detect the changes to the sharing properties of the content items stored by the cloud-based service when the sharing properties are altered by the content owner or some other party (e.g., a system administrator).
- the content owner or some other party e.g., a system administrator
- one or more could-based services may provide the system 200 with a feed of references to content items that have had their sharing properties altered as well as access to access control lists (ACLs) for those content items.
- ACLs access control lists
- the interface module 205 may receive a reference to a content item that has been altered or has had its sharing properties altered.
- the update module 215 may determine, at step 460, whether the sharing properties of the content item have been altered to allow sharing of the content item with the general public. If one or more of the sharing properties have been altered to allow sharing with the general public, the update module 215 may update the list of public content items. For example, at step 465, if the ACL for the content item indicates that the content item is available to the public, the update module 215 may create an entry for the content item at step 465 and add the entry into the list of public content item at step 470, if one does not already exist. If an entry for the content item is already in the list of public content items, the update module 215 may update the entry (e.g., update the "Last Modified" element in the entry, see the example entry definition 300 in FIG. 3).
- the update module 215 may also determine whether the sharing properties of the content item have been altered to prohibit the sharing of the content item with the general public based on the ACL for the content item. If the ACL for the content item indicates that the content item is private or not available to the public, the update module 215, at step 485, may remove an entry for the content item from the list of public content items, if the entry exists. If the sharing properties where not altered to prohibit the sharing of the content item with the general public, the update module 215 does not need to update the list of public content items to keep the list of public content items up-to-date (see step 490 of FIG. 4C).
- the reporting module 220 may provide the updated list of public content items to a search engine at step 495.
- the reporting module 220 may submit the list of public content items to the search engine or publishing the list of public content items as a sitemap on a website.
- the location of the sitemap may be included in a robots.txt file in the root of a web site hierarchy (e.g., www.example.com/robots.txt).
- the search engine may index newly public content items and remove the availability newly nonpublic content items for searches.
- the search engine may be able to more quickly determine which content items stored by the cloud-based service are available for indexing and which content items are no longer public. Accordingly, the search engines may be able to have newly public content items available for searching and not include content items that are no longer public in search results.
- the update module 215 may receive a feed of references to content items and access control lists (ACLs) that correspond to content items that have had their sharing properties altered.
- the feed may correspond to content items that have been altered in general, which may include changes to the content item itself, to the sharing properties of the content items, or to any other information about the content items.
- content items may be organized on the cloud-based service in a hierarchy. Accordingly, if a content owner or administrator changes the sharing properties for a content item, in some aspects, sharing properties for child content items that descend from the content item may also be changed in the same way.
- the list of content items may be updated in response to sharing properties of content items may be altered in any other way.
- the sharing properties in an access control list (ACL) of a content item may be altered to allow one set of users to access the content item, to prohibit another set of users to access the content item, a combination of these, or any other change in the ACL of the content item.
- ACL access control list
- the list of content items may be updated.
- the updated list of content items may be used by a second service to provide a users of the second service with access to content items stored by the first service.
- the users of the second service are only be allowed access to the content items if the users would be allowed by the first service to access the content items. Accordingly, the second service will not grant users access to content items if the users do not already have authorization from the first service to access the content items.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an example computer system 500 with which any of the devices, servers, or systems discussed herein may be implemented, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
