Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communications systems and in particular, to a method and apparatus for managing channels in a communications system. Still more particularly, the present invention is directed towards a method and apparatus for managing channel quality in cable telephony system through measuring the quality of channels and assigning channels based on the measurements of channel quality.
- Communications systems such as a cable communications system, provide for data transmission using one or more radio frequency channels.
- the onset of interference at a particular frequency may be sudden, and possibly catastrophic, rendering the particular frequency, also called a "channel,” unusable.
- interference in the form of ingress noise in a single incident can cause interference to several channels.
- This type of ingress noise or interference can be caused by wireless systems, such as cellular, as well as other types of equipment radiation, such as commercial and industrial equipment.
- various communications units using the cable communications system may require different levels of channel quality, depending on the type of data transmissions they use. For example, data transmissions for interactive multi-media services require a higher channel quality than data transmission carrying typical analog voice conversations. Accordingly, the interference in one channel used by a communications unit may be acceptable while the same interference is unacceptable for another communications unit.

- Quality metrics are measured for uplink channels in both busy and idle states and for downlink channels in busy states in a cable telephony communications system.
- uplink refers to communications transmitted from a subscriber unit in the field to the cable head end, while “downlink” reefers to communications transmitted from the head end to a subscriber unit(s) in the field.
- Quality metrics are the measurement of the quality of the radio frequency (RF) signal for a channel. Identification of channel quality, initiation of channel (link) transfers, and allocation of traffic channels are then based on these measured quality metrics.
- RF radio frequency

The description then sets forth the types of quality metrics measured and a description of how the quality metrics are used according to the present invention. Thereafter, an explanation of the processes involved in obtaining quality metrics and managing channels in a communications system is provided.
- Communications system 100 is an example of a basic cable system architecture that is a hybrid cable system using a combination of fiber and coaxial cable to distribute subscriber services to customer premises equipment.
- communications system 100 may consist entirely of coaxial cable as well as other configurations.
- a cable branch will serve a distribution area shared by a community of subscribers.
- communications system 100 is a cable telephony communications system that provides telephone services along with cable television services on a coaxial fiber-optic cable television infrastructure.
- Communications system 100 includes a cable control unit (CCU) 102 or some other base communications unit that is connected to subscribers 104 by a distribution network 106 and a combiner 108.
- Combiner 108 has an input for video sources 110.
- CCU 102 also includes cable port transceivers (CPXs) 112, which are connected to combiner 108. These cable port transceivers generate downstream carrier channels in communications system 100.
- Combiner 108 receives modulated RF channels from video sources 110 and from CPXs 112 in CCU 102 and sums these signals together to be sent over distribution network 106.
- CPXs 112 are controlled by a controller 114, which provides all functions necessary to support the data link portion of the system.
- the headend typically includes CCU 102, combiner 108, and video sources 110.
- Digital switch 116 may be in a remote location from the headend or may be located at the headend itself. These components are the headend equipment responsible for providing access and management of services to a cable branch in communications system 100. Controller 114 in CCU 102 is connected to switch 116 through digital carrier facilities, such as T1 or E1, which is in turn connected to a public switching telephone network (PSTN) 118. Switch 116 may be, for example, a class 5 TELCO switch.
- Each fiber node 124 has a connection to at least one cable branch 126.
- cable branch 126 is comprised of coaxial cable and includes trunk amplifiers 128, which are bi-directional amplifiers in the depicted example.
- bi-directional line extenders 130 are located near taps 132, which are connected to cable access units (CAUs) 134 located at subscriber 104. These CAUs are also called "subscriber communications units”.
- Each cable branch 126 includes one or more serving areas.
- CCU 102 is used to provide telephony, integrated services digital network (ISDN) services, digital video, interactive video, or interactive multimedia in communications system 100. Additionally, CCU 102 controls the cable spectrum, infrastructure resources, and services for all CAUs in a serving area, as well as managing multiple serving areas.
- CAUs 134 provide telephone, ISDN, digital video, interactive video, interactive multimedia, and television services at subscriber premises. Typically, a CAU is mounted on the side of the subscriber's home, or in an unobtrusive place, such as a basement or attic. The CAU manages the uplink and downlink communications paths and transports cable television channels to the subscriber's television.
- Cable access units such as CAUs 134, scan the downstream to acquire frame synchronization with a system broadcast channel (SBC).
- SBC system broadcast channel
- the preferred system employs Time Division Multiple Access provisioning which means that each RF carrier is divided into several time slots, each time slot being available as a channel, for example, a SBC, a Traffic Channel (TCH), or a System Access Channel (SAC), as detailed further below.
- the SBC occupies a time slot in one of the channels in each cable branch of the cable communications system.
- Frame synchronization is acquired by means of a known digital correlation process.
- the system access channel (SAC) and the traffic channel (TCH) also are used in time slots. SACs are used for requesting access to the network and for making TCH assignments.
- TCHs are the channels that carry the phone calls, or other data communications desired by the subscriber.
- CPX 112 includes upstream burst receiver 202, A/D converters 204 and 206, upstream DSP 208, microprocessor 210, downstream DSP 212, and downstream transmitter 214.
- upstream burst receiver 202 receives a time division multiple access (TDMA) burst from a CAU and down converts the burst to baseband quadrature I and Q signals.
- TDMA time division multiple access
- a "burst" is a fixed transmission of data in bits bearing information.
- the burst is ⁇ /4--DQPSK modulated.
- These baseband I and Q signals are converted to a digital signal by analog to digital (A/D) converters 204 and 206 and processed by upstream digital signal processor (DSP) 208.
- A/D converters 204 and 206 are 8-bit A/D converters.
- Upstream DSP 208 sends the processed information to microprocessor 210.
- microprocessor 210 is connected to a microprocessor in controller 114, which is described in more detail in FIG. 2B below.
- Upstream DSP 208 sends pulse code modulated (PCM) information back to controller 114 on an upstream PCM highway bus while downstream DSP 212 receives PCM information from controller 114 via downstream PCM highway bus.
- PCM pulse code modulated
- Microprocessor 210 sends messages back to the CAU through downstream DSP 212 and downstream TDM transmitter 214, which is connected to the communications network in which the CAU is located. Microprocessor 210 also sends and receives high-level messages, such as control information, to and from controller 114 through communications bus 220.
- Upstream DSP 208, microprocessor 210, and downstream DSP 212 make up a processing unit in CPX 112 in FIG. 2A.
- This microprocessor and the DSPs in CPX 112 form part of a processing unit in CCU 102.
- Controller 114 includes a line interface 224, a time slot interchange 226, and a microprocessor 228.
- Line interface 224 provides a communications interface with digital switch 116 in FIG. 1, which may be a local digital switch through T1/E1 interfaces 230.
- controller 114 provides control functions for individual CPXs, such as CPXs 112 within the CCU 102 through communications buses 232 and microprocessor 228.
- PCM signals are time division multiplexed (TDM) and grouped as sequential time slots on the T1/E1 signals received at line interface 224.
- the signals are decoded within line interface 224 and separated into individual time slots of PCM data and sent to time slot interchange 226, which provides cross-point switching among its input and outputs.
- Microprocessor 228 controls the "mapping" of the input/output time slots, which are then concentrated into individual PCM highway data buses 232, which are connected to CPXs in a CCU.
- time slot interchange 226 is connected to upstream DSP 208 and downstream DSP 212 in FIG. 2A using PCM highway data buses 232.
- Microprocessor 228 controls line interface 224 and time slot interchange 226. Additionally, microprocessor 228 sends control information to the CPXs, using communications buses 234. More specifically, microprocessor 228 in FIG. 2A has a connection to microprocessor 210 in FIG. 2A via buses 234.
- the signals received from the CCU are in a frequency range from about 50 MHz to 750 MHz and converted to a low intermediate frequency (IF) by digital receiver 254. From this form, digital receiver 254 translates the low frequency IF to a baseband ⁇ /4 DPQSK modulated signal. Next, the signal is demodulated to obtain bits from the signal. Thereafter, data/clock recovery 256 takes the bits from digital receiver 254 and separates the bits to send to processing unit 258 or pulse code modulated (PCM) coder/decoder (codec) 260. Control information is sent to processing unit 258 while user data is sent to PCM codec 260, which converts the user data into an analog form.
- PCM pulse code modulated
- RAM random access memory
- ROM read only memory
- the RAM and ROM contain data and instructions coding for processes performed by the microprocessors or DSPs within processing unit 258.
- User information is converted by PCM codec 260 to an analog form and sent to subscriber loop interface (SLIC) 262.
- SLIC 262 provides basic telephony functions, such as indicating whether a telephone is ringing or off hook, or whether loop closure has occurred. Additionally, SLIC 262 separates duplex signals into a send signal and a receive signal. SLIC 262 and the functions performed by it are well known to those who are skilled in the art.
- Ring generator 264 actually provides the voltage used to cause the telephone to ring.
- Transmit data framing 266 takes raw speech data and puts this data into the burst for transmission to the CCU.
- transmit data framing 266 includes the necessary synchronization information and calculates the cyclic redundancy code (CRC) for error checking, which is placed into the error portion of the TDMA frame.
- Transmit data framing 266 is controlled by processing unit 258 and sends signals in synchronization with the downlink transmissions. This synchronization in transmit data framing 266 is controlled by data/clock recovery 256.
- uplink and downlink transmissions to and from CAU 134 are synchronized.
- the data is transmitted by digital transmitter (modulator) 268 to RF interfacing and control 252 and back to the CCU as an uplink transmission.
- Data carried across distribution network 106 in FIG. 1 may include both voice and non-voice data, such as integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital video, phone data, interactive video, or interactive multimedia services.
- ISDN integrated services digital network
- the transport technology used for the cable telephony exchange service is trunked.
- a cable telephony traffic channel is not dedicated to one particular user, but is available to all users on the basis of a request for service. Such an arrangement is called multiple access or subscriber loop concentration.
- a particular channel is assigned to a subscriber, it is assigned for the duration of a call.
- the temporary assignment to the subscriber is revoked and the channel is made available for a subsequent service request. Consequently, it is possible for a CCU to serve many more subscribers than the channels available in a cable branch. Additionally, the spectrum allocated for the CCU may be used for a different group of subscribers in every cable branch of the cable network.
- the cable telephony communications system divides up the radio frequency (RF) spectrum for use with multiple subscribers such that no individual subscriber has a dedicated frequency range.
- RF spectrum 300 includes uplink spectrum 302 and downlink spectrum 304.
- uplink spectrum 302 covers a range from 5 MHz to 42 MHz while downlink spectrum 304 covers a range from 50 MHz to 750 MHz.
- the spectrums are further subdivided into channels that are each 6 MHz in width.
- downlink spectrum 304 includes 120 channels with each channel being 6 MHz in width.
- the depicted example shows an uplink spectrum 302 of 5 to 42 MHz and a downlink spectrum 304 from 50 to 750 MHz with each channel having a width of 6 MHz, other spectrums and channel widths may be used according to the present invention.
- Communications system 100 is divided up into areas with separate signal paths in which the RF spectrum allocated for the cable telephony service may be used again for a different group of subscribers in each cable branch of the distribution network 106.
- a large number of conventional television channels for example 80 channels, each 6 MHz in width
- other communications are provided in the reverse.
- a portion of the downlink spectrum and an equal or larger portion in the uplink spectrum are dedicated to a plurality of trunked traffic channels serving a large number of subscribers having telephone and/or other two way service.
- a number of RF channels are deployed.
- RF channels are spaced 600 KHz apart and each channel contains 8 digitally encoded time division multiplexed information bearing channels. Active channels are operated in pairs with one in the uplink segment of the allocation associated with each one in the downlink segments. This association provides for frequency division duplex (FDD) operations.
- FDD frequency division duplex
- communications system 100 provides for time division multiplexing in which a number of channels are derived from the transmission medium by dividing the access to the medium into sequential "time slots".
- superframe 400 includes 8 frames with each frame having 8 time slots.
- CCU channel 402 includes frames 404 and 406 while CAU channel 408 includes frames 410 and 412.
- Each frame has a length of 2.5 milliseconds, which are divided into 8 time slots, forming 8 digitally encoded time division multiplexed (TDM) information bearing channels.
- TDM time division multiplexed
- downlink burst 414 in time slot 1 in frame 406 includes a synchronization channel (SYC) 416, a control channel (CC) 418, a slow channel (SC) 420, a fast channel (FC) channel 422, and an error control channel (EC) 424.
- SYC 416 is a synchronization channel used for frame synchronization.
- CC 418 is used to indicate word errors, signaling, and power control.
- SC 420 is used for signaling, and FC 422 is used for both user data and signaling.
- EC 424 is used for error detection.
- Uplink burst 426 in time slot 2 in frame 412 includes differential encoder bits (DE) 428, synchronization channel (SYC) 430, CC 432, SC 434, FC 436, and EC 438.
- SYC 416 in downlink burst 414 contains 25 bits
- SYC 430 in uplink burst 426 contains 14 bits
- CC 418 in downlink burst 414 includes 9 bits while CC 432 in uplink burst 426 contains 2 bits.
- Both SC 420 and SC 434 contain 26 bits.
- Downlink burst 414 contains a total of 240 bits and is 312.5 microseconds long
- uplink burst 426 contains 224 bits and is 291.67 microseconds long.
- the SC includes 26 bits
- the FC includes 160 bits
- the EC contains 20 bits.
- CCU channel 402 is a downlink channel transmitted in a frequency range from 50 MHz to 750 MHz while CAU channel 408 is an uplink channel transmitted in a range from 5 MHz to 42 MHz according to the present invention.
- a data transmission within these channels is sent as a "burst", which is a fixed length transmission of data, such as a transmission of a group of bits.
- a burst is 224 bits per time slot in CAU channel 408 and 240 bits per time slot in CCU channel 402.
- Downlink burst 440 includes a superframe number in bits 1 through 3, indicating which one of the 8 sequential frames constitutes a superframe. Frames are marked cyclically from 0 ("000") to 7 ("111") in bits 1 through 3. The value identifies a frame's position within the sperframe and is called the frame number. As can be seen, the least significant bit of the frame is transmitted first. Bits 4 through 6 of the control channel mark time slots within a given frame. These time slots are marked sequentially from 0 ("000") to 7 (“111"). The least significant bit is transmitted first.
- Bit number 7 is reserved for some later use according to the present invention.
- Bit number 8 is the word error indicator and is set as a "1" when an error has occurred and a "0" when no error has occurred.
- Bit number 9 in downlink burst 440 is the fast channel indicator, which indicates whether the fast channel contains signaling information or user information.
- Each time slot in both the uplink and downlink transmissions is used for various types of channels such as a system broadcast channel (SBC), a system access channel (SAC), or a traffic channel (TCH).
- SBC and SAC are system channels.
- SBCs broadcast system information in downlink transmissions to all CAUs monitoring the SBCs.
- a CAU locates the SBC and listens to the SBC for information of general interest to all devices attached to a CAU.
- the SBC identifies general system identifiers and capabilities; security information used for authentication and encipherment; and location of channel frequencies, SBCs, and SACs. Multiple SBCs are used to provide redundancy in communications system.
- Communications system 100 is accessed by a CAU using the SAC.
- a CAU is assigned a TCH with which to perform signaling protocols.
- a CAU When a CAU is registered, it will reacquire the SBC and listen for notification of incoming calls.
- the SAC is a physical channel employed to gain access to the communications system and obtain a TCH or reconnect to a TCH. Multiple SACs are used to provide both redundancy and to reduce contention between multiple CAUs requesting access to communications system 100.
- TCHs provide user services on communications system 100 and may be requested and assigned for varying rates of data transmission. TCHs are either busy (in use) or idle (not in use).
- Communications system 100 includes mechanisms to deal with the interference present in distribution network 106 in FIG. 1.
- the onset of interference at a particular frequency may be sudden, and possibly catastrophic, rendering the channel totally unusable.
- a mechanism in communications system 100 is provided for detecting the onset of interference and switching to another channel to avoid the interference. The process of switching from one channel to another channel is referred to as an alternate link transfer (ALT).
- communications system 100 also includes a process for assigning traffic channels to various CAUs based on the quality of channels within communications system 100.
- Quality metrics are used to measure channel quality and to assign channels and to trigger ALTs.
- Word errors, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and attenuation relative to power level (ARPL) values are quality metrics detected and measured according to the present invention.
- SNR, word errors, and ARPL values are measured on busy uplink channels, and word errors are measured on busy downlink channels.
- Busy downlink quality defects are indicated by the report of a word error in a corresponding uplink channel.
- Attenuation relative to power level values are measured on idle uplink channels according to the present invention.
- Quality metrics are used to determine when to perform an ALT.
- Quality metrics are also used to determine channel quality and to rank channels in the communications system. The channel rankings are used to assign channels based on the quality required by a CAU requesting a channel.
- a quality metric outside of an acceptable range is a quality defect and is used to recognize the onset of an impending burst of interference and to trigger an ALT to avoid the interference.
- a quality defect is also called a "quality metric defect" (QM-D).
- QM-D quality metric defect
- This switching of channels results in temporary quality degradation.
- the number of ALTs that are performed should be minimized.
- a certain amount of time must pass before another ALT can be performed.
- the initial assignment of channels and the selection of channels as the target of ALTs should be performed to minimize the probability of an ALT occurring.
- a quality metric ranking (QM-R) value is a value that provides a historic measure (decaying average) of a channel's quality, which is then used to discriminate between available channels when selecting a channel for assignment or as the target of an ALT.
- the present invention associates a QM-R value with every channel in communications system 100.
- the quality metrics are typically collected by DSPs in CPXs 112 and forwarded to controller 114. This data is used as criteria to select a traffic channel for assignment.
- every TDMA frame contains an error channel and a word error indicator (WEI).
- the error channel contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
- CRC cyclic redundancy check
- the WEI bit is set by the CAU or CPX to signal that an error was detected in a previous burst by a failed CRC.
- Downlink word errors are determined when a CAU receives a burst in a given frame of the downlink.
- the CAU formulates the correct value of the WEI bit and incorporates it into the uplink burst that is sent in a corresponding time slot and frame within the next superframe.
- Uplink word errors are determined when a CPX receives a burst in a given frame of the uplink, where upon the CPX checks the CRC to determine if a word error has occurred. If a word error is detected, the WEI is set.
- CPXs in a CCU measure the received signal strength in every time slot, active or idle.
- This received signal strength indicator measures the signal power and is calibrated to provide the number of decibels of signal attenuation relative to the maximum linear input of the receiver, before signal clipping.
- This calibrated value is called the attenuation relative to power level (ARPL) value.
- An ARPL reading of 0 dB indicates that the received power level of the transmitted CAU burst is at the maximum level. Any increase in CAU power would result in a distorted signal being received.
- a reading of 6 dB indicates that the received burst power is 6 dB below the maximum level.
- the ARPL has a dynamic range of 40 dB in the depicted example.
- ARPL quality metrics Although ARPL measurements are made on bursts received on TCHs, ARPL quality metrics also are gathered on idle uplink TCHs.
- the measurement of ARPL on idle uplink channels is a useful feature to the management of channels in the presence of interference.
- ingress noise is a much more significant problem in the upstream than downstream channels (when interference occurs on a channel, an ALT will be performed, moving the channel to an idle state). If idle channels cannot be ranked, then it is impossible to make an intelligent selection of a channel for assignment or as the target of an ALT.
- ARPLs are power attenuation levels received at a CCU.
- ARPL measurements on idle TCHs of an uplink channel are used to detect the onset of interference according to the present invention.
- FIG. 5 a flowchart of a process for obtaining a power attenuation level from a signal received at a CCU is depicted according to the present invention.
- This process also may be used to measure idle channels by measuring the signal strength of time slots even though no burst or signal is received at the CCU from a CAU.
- a similar process also may be used to measure power attenuation levels at the CAU to obtain ARPL values for busy downlink channels.
- the process begins by receiving a complex digital signal from A/D converters (step 500). Thereafter, symbol timing is recovered (step 502) and the vector magnitude of the complex signal is calculated (step 504).
- the vector magnitude is calculated using an approximation to: ##EQU1## where the approximation is
- 0.3364 * MIN (
- the average vector magnitude which is a linear 7-bit value, is converted to a logarithmic number using a lookup table procedure (step 506).
- the logarithmic number is scaled to represent the amount of attenuation in decibels relative to the maximum input of the A/D converter before clipping (step 508) with the process terminating thereafter.
- the scaled logarithmic number representing the amount of attenuation in decibels determined in step 508 is the ARPL.
- the determination of SNR utilizes received signal strength measurements, such as ARPL measurements in FIG. 5, which are collected on busy and idle time slots of an active uplink channel by the DSPs on the CPX assigned to an active channel frequency.
- the ARPL indicator On an active time slot, the ARPL indicator actually measures signal plus noise power. Under normal operating conditions, however, the signal power is much greater than the noise power and the noise contribution may be ignored. On an idle time slot the ARPL indicator measures only noise power.
- the SNR quality metric is determined by the difference between the noise power reading of an idle channel (ARPLidle) and the signal plus noise power reading of an active channel (ARPLactive):
- the ARPL of an active time slot is the ARPL reading of the currently assigned TCH time slot.
- the ARPL of an idle time slot is the ARPL reading from the most recent idle time slot on the same frequency as the active TCH.
- the ARPLidle parameter is a variable unique to each CPX receiver which is initialized (maximum attenuation level or 40 dB) on each new upstream frequency assignment and updated and maintained for the duration of the call, i.e. until the upstream frequency is released. Whenever an idle time slot occurs on that frequency, the ARPLidle parameter is updated with the new ARPL reading, This parameter is global to all active time slots on that assigned frequency and is used in the calculation of the SNR.
- time slots 0 through 6 are idle.
- the ARPLidle parameter is initialized to 40 dB.
- the ARPL reading in all of the idle time slots is 24 dB, meaning that the noise power level is 24 dB below the maximum input of the receiver.
- time slot 0 is received, the ARPLidle parameter will become 24 dB.
- time slots 2 through 6 the parameter is updated.
- the SNR for time slot 7 is computed with a result of 19 dB (24 dB-5 dB).
- This technique of estimating SNR is dependent upon the traffic density of an assigned channel, in particular, the case where all time slots are in use. However, in this situation, other channel quality metrics, such as burst CRC errors, may be used in determining link transfers.
- a record is used for each frame to determine if a defect has occurred during a frame interval of a channel.
- a record of the four most recent quality defects are maintained for each uplink and downlink channel assigned to a CPX. This record includes an entry for each time slot, which contains an indication of whether a quality defect has occurred.
- the CCU counts the number of errored frames that occur within a 4,800 frame window (a 12 second period). If 2 consecutive frames or 4 or more cumulative frames are in error in the 4800 frame window, a link transfer is performed to move to a new channel with less noise.
- a link transfer is performed to move to a new channel with less noise.
- the quality defect interval (QD-I) is the interval between the occurrence of quality defects.
- the quality metric ranking value is a historic average of the QD-I.
- a historic measure of channel quality is calculated using a decaying average as follows:
- the decay rate is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. If decay rate is 0.8, the calculation is as follows:
- a higher decay rate results in a QM-R measurement that is more sensitive to the current QD-I and responds more quickly to changes in channel quality.
- a lower decay rate results in a more stable QM-R measurement that is less sensitive to the current QD-I and more sensitive to the historic QM-R measures.
- a set of channel qualities are supported from which a subscriber may select a desired channel quality class. Each set is based upon the type of data transmission or service provided in the communication system. Different types of data transmissions may be more or less sensitive to channel quality.
- a subscriber may be a person making the selection, a CAU, or a computer program executing on a data processing system that is connected to communications system 100.
- Each channel quality class is defined by high and low QM-R value which defines the range of QM-R values for the class.
- the number of channel quality classes supported and the QM-R values, which define each of the channel quality classes, depends upon the particular communications system and the particular implementation.
- Table 600 contains four classes, 1 through 4. Each class in table 600 contains QM-R values, also called "quality values", in the range of 0 to 9, with 0 indicating the lowest quality channel and 9 indicating the highest quality channel. Each subscriber is able to select the channel quality classes to which it will subscribe. Each class includes an high quality value and low quality value. Each request from a CAU, contains one channel quality class based on the particular type of service requested. The high quality value specifies the optimal channel quality requested by the subscriber. The low quality value specifies the minimal channel quality required by the subscriber. Of course those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that other class numbers or values may be used according to the present invention.
- Channel quality classes may be entered for each subscriber through an interface at the headend or created at the time of the initial creation of the subscriber record according to the present invention. These values are typically sent to the CCU, where they are stored in a database for use in assigning traffic channels in the depicted example. Of course, those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that channel quality classes may be provided to a subscriber through other means other than through the CCU.
- the channel quality classes for the associated subscriber are retrieved from the database and downloaded to the CAU.
- Registration is a process in which the CAU lets communications system 100 know that the CAU is on the system. The registration process involves an exchange of information between the CAU and the CCU, which includes channel quality classes. These values are then included by the CAU in every channel request.
- Each request from a CAU includes a channel quality class, which specifies an high quality value and a low quality value.
- Controller 114 in CCU 102 performs traffic channel management. Controller 114 maintains a list of traffic channels available for use and associates traffic channels into sets based upon the QM-R of the associated channel. A quality class table is used by controller 114 to perform traffic channel management.
- Quality class table 602 includes an entry for each quality class supported by communications system 100. Each quality class table entry includes a list of channel records whose QM-R values are within the ranges defining the channel quality classes, as illustrated in FIG. 6A.
- quality class table 602 includes channel quality classes 1-4.
- Quality class table 602 includes channel record lists 604-618. Each of these channel records contain current QM-R value for the channel along with the busy-idle status of each channel. Each time a new QM-R value is calculated for a channel, the channel record will be reassigned to possibly a different quality class within the quality class table.
- FIG. 6C a depiction of how channel records assignments can be changed in response to receiving a new QM-R report is depicted according to the present invention.
- Records 606, 608, and 614, in quality class table 602 have been reassigned to different classes in response to new values received in a QM-R report by the CCU.
- a diagram of a channel record is depicted according to the present invention in FIG. 6D.
- Channel record 650 includes a QM-R value in entry 652. Available bandwidth is indicated in entry 654.
- Entries 656-670 include entries for time slots 0-7 that indicate whether a particular time slot is idle or busy. Entries 656-670 also may indicate whether a quality defect has occurred for the corresponding time slot.
- a request for a TCH When a request for a TCH is received, it is satisfied by an idle TCH on a channel corresponding to the high quality requirements specified in the channel request. If the class is empty or no idle TCHs are available on a channel in this class, a search is made for an idle TCH. The search examines the channel record list of successively lower quality classes. The search terminates when a channel is found or all the quality classes whose quality exceeds the low channel quality requirements specified in the channel request have been searched. Only if all the classes between the high and low channel quality requirements are empty will a "better" channel than the high quality channel requirement be allocated. If no TCH is available which meets the low quality service requirement, the channel request will be denied because of an unavailability of resources of the specified quality.
- the subscriber has the option of using a lower quality channel if one is available.
- a channel Once a channel has been selected for allocation as a TCH, it is marked as busy in the corresponding channel record, such as channel record 650 in FIG. 6D.
- the channel record corresponding to the channel is marked as idle.
- a TCH of class 3 is assigned because one is available.
- a channel request having a high channel class of 1 and a low channel class of 2 results in a TCH 1 being assigned.
- Receiving a request with a high channel class of 2 and a low channel class of 2 will normally result in a TCH of class 2 being assigned if one is available. In the depicted example, no channel is available.
- a channel from the next higher class available, i.e. class 1 is assigned.
- a channel request with a high channel class of 2 and a low channel class of 3 results in a TCH of class 3 being assigned.
- FIG. 7 a high level flowchart of a process for managing TCHs in a communications system (such as communications system 100 in FIG. 1) is depicted according to the present invention.
- the flowchart depicts the process followed by a processor in controller 114 in FIG. 1.
- Controller 114 waits for and handles various reports and requests from CPXs.
- a quality metric ranking (QM-R) value is used to rank channels.
- the QM-R is based on ARPL quality, SNR values, and WEI.
- a QM-R value is periodically calculated in the CCU for a downlink and uplink channel by a busy CPX (a CPX with at least one busy TCH).
- a busy CPX a CPX with at least one busy TCH.
- QM-Ds Quality metric defects
- QM-Ds are used to trigger an ALT due to interference.
- QM-Ds are detected using the occurrence of word errors in a data transmission during a selected period of time, measuring ARPL levels, or determining SNR levels.
- CPXs 112 receive various uplink data transmissions, including requests for TCHs, which are sent to controller 114 for processing as illustrated in FIG. 1. CPXs 112 also generate quality metric reports that are sent to controller 1 14.
- the process begins by waiting for input from a CPX, such as CPXs 112 in FIG. 1 (step 700).
- a quality ranking metric (QM-R) report the channels are reranked (step 702) with the process terminating thereafter.
- QM-R quality ranking metric
- a TCH request from a CPX a TCH is selected and channel assignment is performed (step 704) with the process terminating thereafter.
- QM-D quality metric defect
- a new TCH is selected and an ALT is performed (step 706) with the process terminating thereafter.
- a state diagram of a CPX is depicted according to the present invention.
- the CPX scans all frequencies in the serving area and collects QM-R values.
- the CPX collects QM-R values on the assigned channel and detects and reports when the QM-D triggers an ALT.
- a CPX will transition from Idle State A1 to Busy State A2 when the CCU assigns a TCH to the channel associated with the particular CPX. If all of the calls on a CPX end and the CPX does not contain any system channels, the CPX will then transition from Busy State A2 back to Idle State A1.
- CPXs that have system channels, such as SBCs and SACs are never in Idle State A1.
- Idle CPX processing is used to determine attenuation relative to power levels (ARPLs), which are used in ranking candidate channels for TCH assignments.
- the CPX reads the list of frequencies for RF channels in the serving area (step 900). The first frequency in the list is selected (step 902). Thereafter, the CPX tunes to the selected frequency on the list (step 904). An ARPL is calculated for the channel that has been tuned to by the CPX (step 906). The ARPL value is stored for the channel (step 908) and a determination is then made as to whether the frequency is the last frequency on the list (step 910). If the frequency is not the last frequency, the process selects the next frequency on the list (step 912) and returns to step 904.
- ARPLs power levels
- the channels are ranked based on ARPL values (QM-R values in the depicted example) where a zero indicates a poor quality channel and a high value indicates a high quality channel (step 914). Thereafter, the rank ordered channel list is forwarded to the CCU (step 916) with the process terminating thereafter.
- ARPL values QM-R values in the depicted example
- Busy CPX processing is employed to determine the presence of word errors and SNR and ARPL values on uplink channels and word errors on downlink channels. These values are used to determine whether an ALT should occur and to rank channels for assigning TCHs.
- the process begins by the CCU starting to decode the frame, beginning with time slot zero (step 1000). A determination is made as to whether the time slot is being used (step 1002). If the time slot is not being used, the process records an ARPL value for use in determining SNR values (step 1004).
- the process increments the time slot by one (step 1006). A determination is made as to whether this time slot is the last time slot (step 1008). If the incremented time slot is not the last time slot, the process returns to step 1002 as described above. Upon reaching the last time slot, the process then checks to see if a QM-D has triggered an indication that an ALT is needed for the uplink (UL) channel (step 1010). In the depicted example, a QM-D triggers an indication that an ALT is needed for an uplink channel when two consecutive QM-Ds are detected or four QM-Ds occur within a selected period of time for an uplink channel.
- the process then checks to see if a QM-D has triggered an indication that an ALT is needed for the downlink (DL) channel (step 1012).
- a QM-D triggers an indication that an ALT is needed for a downlink channel when two consecutive QM-Ds occur or when four QM-Ds in a frame occur within a selected period of time for the downlink channel.
- a QM-D trigger report is sent to the CCU to indicate that an ALT should be performed.
- the process then sends a UL QM-D trigger report to the CCU (step 1014) with the process then proceeding to step 1012 as previously described.
- step 1012 if QM-D has triggered an indication that an ALT is needed for the DL channel, the process sends a DL QM-D trigger report to the CCU step 1016 and then updates the QM-R value (step 1018). The process proceeds directly to step 1018 from step 1012 if a QM-D triggering an indication that an ALT is needed has not occurred. From step 1018, the process determines whether it is time to send the QM-R value to the CCU (step 1020). If it is not time to send the QM-R value to the CCU, the process returns to step 1000. Otherwise, the process sends the QM-R report to the CCU for UL and DL channels (step 1022) prior to returning to step 1000.
- the process determines whether the word error indicator (WEI) has been set in the uplink frame (step 1024). If the WEI has been set, the process marks the previous downlink frame as being defective (step 1026).
- WEI word error indicator
- step 1028 a determination is made as to whether a CRC error has occurred in the uplink frame.
- the process proceeds directly from step 1024 to step 1028 if the WEI is not set in the uplink frame.
- the process determines whether the ARPL is out of range (step 1030). If the ARPL is not out of range, a determination is made as to whether the SNR value is out of range (step 1032). If the SNR value is not out of range, the process proceeds to step 1006 as described above.
- the uplink frame is marked as defective (step 1034).
- the process also proceeds directly to step 1034 from step 1028 if a CRC error occurred in the uplink. Additionally, the process proceeds to step 1034 and marks the frame as defective if the ARPL is out of range in step 1030.
- a frame is marked as defective when a single time slot contains a WEI that has been sent to indicate an error in the time slot. Frames also may be marked as defective after two or more time slots in a frame have been indicated as defective. This type of marking occurs when a channel has two or more active time slots according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- Traffic channels are assigned using candidate channels that have been ranked by quality and by the bandwidth available within each channel.
- the quality ranking of candidate channels may be based on ARPL values and ranked as described above in FIG. 9.
- other values or other combinations of values in addition to ARPL values may be used to rank channels. For example, the number of word errors occurring within a time period and the SNR values also may be used in ranking channel quality.
- FIG. 11 a flowchart of a process for assigning traffic channels is depicted according to the present invention.
- This flowchart illustrates the process performed by a CCU when it receives a channel request and selects a channel for assignment.
- This process is dependent upon the channel class subscription that the CAU has specified.
- the channel quality class defines the quality of the channel required by the CAU. For example, certain services, such as video phones, are more sensitive to channel quality than other services, such as voice and, therefore, require a higher quality channel.
- the channel quality class includes a high quality value and a low quality value.
- the high quality value is the value the subscriber would like to receive. This value represents the channel quality at which optimal performance is achieved as perceived by the user of the channel. Use of channel with a higher quality than this, however, will not result in the perception of better quality to the user of the channel.
- a low quality value represents the minimum channel quality the user will accept. Use of a channel with a quality below what is represented by this value will result in a degradation of quality, as perceived by the user, that is unacceptable.
- the use of channel with a quality between these two values results in a quality, as perceived by the user, that is within the normal accepted range. For example, the voice quality may not be "high fidelity", but is comparable to what is generally provided by a telephony system and with which the user is satisfied.
- the quality classes that are supported by the system would be generally be defined by the service providers according to the types of services they intent to provide. The subscriber would then be allowed to choose a quality class based upon the type of service it is receiving without knowing what the underlying channel qualities are. For example, a subscriber would simply select a quality class for video telephony or voice telephony, not a quality class with a bit error rate (BER) of 10 -6 .
- BER bit error rate
- the process begins by the CCU receiving a TCH request specifying a channel quality class, degraded channel acceptability, and bandwidth requirement (step 1100).
- the band width requirement indicates how many TDMA time slots a subscriber needs simultaneously (at the quality requested) for the type of communications intended (e.g. video phone needs more time slots than audio only),
- the high quality value and the low quality value are obtained from the quality class table (step 1102).
- the quality class table is a table specifying a high quality value and a low quality value, such as table 600 in FIG. 6A. Alternatively, the high quality value and the low quality value may be sent directly to the CCU.
- a determination is then made as to whether channels are present on the list with specified high quality that has sufficient bandwidth (step 1104). If a channel is present meeting the specified high quality value having sufficient bandwidth, the process marks the specified bandwidth amount of the bandwidth on the selected channel as busy and assigns this bandwidth to the CAU (step 1106) with the process terminating thereafter.
- step 1108 if a channel is not present on the list that has the specified high quality with sufficient bandwidth, a determination is then made to whether a channel on the list has sufficient bandwidth and a quality between the high and low quality values of the quality class (step 1108). If two or more channels are found in a range defined by the high and low quality values, the higher quality channel is selected. If this determination is yes, the process then proceeds to step 1106 as previously described. With reference again to step 1108, if a channel having sufficient bandwidth and a quality within the range defined by the high and low quality values of the quality class is absent, a determination is made as to whether a channel, having sufficient bandwidth available and whose quality is higher than the high quality value of the quality class, is available (step 1110). If a higher quality channel is available, the process then proceeds to assign the bandwidth to the CAU, as described in step 1106 above. Otherwise, the process makes a determination as to whether a degraded channel is acceptable (step 1112).
- the channel request specifies whether a degraded channel will be acceptable. If a degraded channel is acceptable, the process then determines whether a degraded channel is present on the channel list that has sufficient bandwidth (step 1114). If such a degraded channel is present, the process then proceeds to assign the bandwidth to the CAU as described in step 1106. Otherwise, the CCU denies the request (step 1116) with the process terminating thereafter. With reference again to step 1112, if a degraded channel is not acceptable, the process also proceeds to step 1116 to deny the request.
- the subscriber selects a channel quality class based on the current call. Based upon the interface that originates the connection the channel quality class is determined.
- the interface is a device connected to the CAU.
- an interface may be a telephone or a video conferencing system.
- Each time the subscriber makes a call the subscriber determines what quality it requires and includes that information in the call request. The quality required will change from call to call based upon the type of service being provided.
- the CAU will have a standard telephony interface to the phone in the home and separate interfaces for ISDN lines or to a video phone.
- the subscriber selection of channel quality class is static. The subscriber is informed of its channel quality class when it registers. This is the class the subscriber will use.
- the CAU may be used to provide either standard telephony services, facsimile services, or combinations of service types. For a home business with two phone lines, one a dedicated facsimile line and another that is a standard phone line, each line would be assigned the same quality class.
- a flowchart of a process for assigning a channel to a CAU begins by selecting a TCH for assignment (step 1200). Thereafter, the process sends a message to the CAU informing it of the TCH that is being assigned (step 1202) and the selected channel is connected to the appropriate network time slot using the time slot interchange (TSI) (step 1204) with the process terminating thereafter.
- TCH time slot interchange
- FIG. 13 a flowchart of a process followed by a CAU requesting and being assigned a TCH is depicted according to the present invention.
- the process begins by the CAU receiving a set of quality classes from the CCU (step 1300).
- the process detects an interface needing a channel for data transmissions (step 1302).
- the CAU selects a channel quality class from the set of channel quality classes based on the interface requiring a channel (step 1304). For example, the telephone interface, the ISDN interface, or the video phone interface generates the input which triggers the request.
- a TCH request is then formulated and transmitted to the CCU (step 1306). Thereafter, the CAU waits for a response in the CCU (step 1308).
- a determination is made as to whether a TCH has been assigned (step 1310). If the request has been denied, the process determines whether a new request has been made for a channel (step 1312). If a new request has not been made, the process returns to step 1312. Otherwise, the process returns to step 1302. With reference again to step 1310, upon receiving a TCH assignment, the CAU tunes to the assigned frequency and begins its communication or data transfers (step 1314) with the process proceeding to step 1312 to determine whether a request has been made for an additional channel, as described about.
- the processes depicted in the diagrams and flowcharts in FIGS. 5-13 may be implemented by those of ordinary skill in the art within the hardware illustrated in FIGS. 1-2C.
- the processes of the present invention also may be implemented in a storage device that is readable by processors within the hardware depicted above, wherein the storage device encodes executable instructions of the processes of the present invention.
- the program storage device may take various forms including, for example, but not limited to, a hard disk drive, an optical disk, a ROM, and EPROM, or a RAM, which are known to those skilled in the art.
- the processes stored on a storage device are dormant until activated by using the storage device with a processor, such as a microprocessor or a DSP.
- a processor such as a microprocessor or a DSP.
- the processes for managing channels on a communication system may be coded as instructions stored in a hard disk drive or an optical disk. Connecting the hard disk drive with the optical disk to the processor in the CCU allows the processor to execute these instructions and manage channels on the communications system.
- the present invention provides an improved communications system by providing a method for initiating ALTs and assigning traffic channels by collecting quality metrics in uplink and downlink channels.
- the present invention provides an improved method and apparatus for initiating ALTs by collecting data on word errors, SNR, and ARPLs as quality metrics for determining ALTs. Additionally, the collected quality metrics are used to determine the channel quality of the channels, which are in turn used to assign channels to various CAUs requesting a TCH.
- the present invention provides an advantage over other methods for assigning channels in that channels are assigned to meet the range of channels defined by the minimum or optimum channel quality associated with a channel quality class and only assigning channels with a greater quality than requested when other acceptable channels are absent.
