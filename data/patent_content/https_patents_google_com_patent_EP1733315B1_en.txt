Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to Internet technology, and more particularly, to electronic mail (email) technology.
- EP0886228 discloses a computerized distributed mail system in which a plurality of client computers are connected to each other via a network. Each client computer is configured to execute client mail application programs.
- a mail service system is also connected to the network. The system is for executing server mail programs on server computers.
- the mail service system includes an index server for storing mail messages in message files, and for storing a full-text index of the mail messages.
- the system includes means for accessing the mail messages by the plurality of client computers by searching the full-text index using queries
- Email applications have become a common tool in both business and personal communication.
- a significant factor in the widespread adoption of email technology is the relative ease with which individuals may communicate using email.
- An individual may quickly communicate a message to one or more individuals by simply inputting the message and the recipients' email address into an email application and clicking a mouse button.
- email is so attractive is that the messages are typically delivered within seconds of being sent.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary network on which email messaging may occur.
- each of the computer clients Client A 120, Client B 121, Client C 122, and Client D 123, are coupled to a network 100,
- This network may be a private network, a public network such as the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the computer clients 120, 121, 122, 123) are able to communicate with each other through virtual connections over network 100. These virtual connections allow the clients (120, 121, 122 and 123) to send and receive electronic mail messages from the other clients.
- web mail applications which display a user's email inbox and the corresponding email messages in a web page environment.
- One of the advantages of web mail applications is that the user may access their email from any location that provides access to the World Wide Web.
- a user logs into their email account they are typically presented with an inbox view that provides a list of the various email messages the user has received.
- a request is sent to a web server requesting the selected message.
- the server responds with the email message which is displayed to the user as a new web page.
- the web page displaying the message includes one or more response options.
- response options include Reply, Reply-to-All and Forward. These response options are usually presented to the user as links or buttons that the user may select.
- Reply allows the user to reply to the originator of the message.
- Reply-to-All allows the user to reply to all of the recipients of the message.
- the Forward option allows the user to forward the email to a user who was not one of the original recipients of the message.
- a request is sent to a remote email server requesting the reply web page corresponding to the selected response option.
- This page typically includes a text box for inputting the reply message and one or more address fields for inserting the recipient addresses.
- the server When the user selects the Reply or Reply-to-All option, the server typically inserts the appropriate recipient address information into the address fields.
- a user typically must choose the response option at the time he decides to respond to the email. If the user later changes his mind and wants to select a different response option, he cannot do so from the reply web page returned by the server. In order to select a different response option, the user would have to return to the original message web page. This process may result in multiple requests to the server which increases web traffic and adds additional latency to the user experience. If the user provides part or all of a response message into the reply web page before changing his mind on the response options, the user would lose the message unless he copied the message before returning to the original message and pasted it into the new reply web page returned by the server upon selecting the new response option.

- client-side email applications such as Microsoft Outlook.
- a new message window is created including the recipient addresses associated with the response option.
- the user if the user wishes to change to a different response option, the user must close the window and select a different response option.
- These applications do not provide the user with a mechanism to dynamically change the response option for his message.
- the user if the user has provided part or all of a message prior to deciding to select a different response option, the user must either copy the message and paste it into the new reply window, or must manually enter the additional recipient addresses,
- the present invention provides a computer-implemented method as set forth in Claim 1.
- a reply form may be provided as an interface to respond to an email message.
- the reply form may comprise a text box for inputting a response message and a recipient email address box for inputting the email addresses of the intended recipients of the response message.
- a plurality of response options may be provided with the reply form. When a user selects a response option, the recipient addresses of the response message may be dynamically updated with the email addresses associated with the response option.
- Email transmission characteristics include but are not limited to the recipient addresses of the response message, security parameters, quality of service characteristics or the priority level assigned to the response message.
- the recipient addresses of a response message may be dynamically updated in response to a user selection of one of a plurality of response options.
- a reply form associated with a received email message may be displayed to a user.
- the reply form may include multiple response options, a text box for inputting the response message and one or more address fields for adding and or editing the email addresses of the intended recipients of the response message.
- the recipient addresses of the response message may be dynamically populated based upon the selected response option.
- FIG. 2A illustrates an exemplary reply form 200 according to one example of the invention.
- Reply form 200 may provide an interface for the user to respond to a previously received email message 210.
- Reply form 200 may be located within the same window or document (e.g. web page) as the received email message.
- Reply form 200 may include a content area, such as text box 220, for typing or otherwise inputting the response message, a subject box 230 for entering a subject for the response message, and one or more recipient address boxes for inserting the email addresses of the recipients to which the user wishes to send the response message.
- reply form 200 may include two recipient address boxes, 240 and 250.
- Reply form 200 may also include resize options that allow the user to dynamically resize reply form 200 or text box 220.
- resize buttons 235 and 245 may be selected by the user to increase or reduce the number of lines of text available in reply form 200 or text box 220.
- Software code may detect a user selection of resize button 235 or 245 and may dynamically add or subtract a predefined number of lines of text from text box 220 within reply form 200.
- a control corner 225 may be provided to the user which the user may select and drag across the screen to increase the size of reply form 200 or text box 220.
- Reply form 200 may also include multiple response options. In one example, reply form 200 may include three response options, Reply 260 Reply-to-All 270 and Forward 280.
- email message 210 is the message the user is responding to using reply form 200. As illustrated in Figure 2A , email message 210 was sent to the user from Tim@example.com . In addition, Tim copied, denoted by "Cc:,” Brad@example.com and Greg@example.com . Thus, Brad, Greg and the user each received a copy of email message 210.
- Reply form 200 may be generated to allow the user to respond to email message 210 and may be displayed in the same window or document (e.g. web page) as email message 210. In an alternative example, reply form 200 may be displayed in a separate window or frame from email address 210. In one example, illustrated in Figure 2B , a minimized reply form 215 may be inserted below email message 210. Minimized reply form 215 may include response options 260, 270 and 280 as discussed herein along with a small text box 217.
- software code may detect the user selection or click and dynamically insert reply form 200 and/or an expanded text box 220 in place of minimized reply form 215 with minimized text box 217.
- the software may expand the minimized reply form 215 by dynamically inserting additional lines into the text box 217 of minimized reply form 215.
- response options 260, 270 and 280 may be presented as virtual tabs or links so that the user may toggle between response options.
- a client computer may not be required to make a server request in response to the user selecting these tabs.
- software such as javascript
- the client computer may not be required to make a server request in response to the user selecting these tabs.
- software such as javascript
- the client computer may not be required to make a server request in response to the user selecting these tabs.
- software such as javascript
- the user may type or enter a response to the email message 210 and define the characteristics of the response, such as the recipients of the response, without making a specific server request for the response or a response form.
- This reduction in client-server communication may provide a more efficient email platform in which latency, which is typically caused by generating an email response window and populating the corresponding recipient address field, may be reduced.
- Software located on the client computer may also provide a more efficient email response mechanism for the user by allowing the user to toggle through the virtual tabs while maintaining content within the text box 220.
- the user may initially select the Reply tab 260 and enter a response to the email message 210 within the text box 220. Thereafter, the user may toggle from the Reply tab 260 to the Reply-to-All tab 270. The content within the text box 220 may remain after this toggle without any user action.
- software on the client computer modifies the characteristics of the email response (i.e., changes from Reply response to Reply-to-All response) without erasing or modifying the content with the email response.
- Reply 260 is the selected response option. In one example, Reply 260 is the default response option displayed to the user.
- Reply option 260 may be defined to reply to the sender of the original email message 210.
- Tim@example.com sent the email message 210 to which the user is responding so his email address is included in recipient address box 240 since the Reply 260 option is selected.
- the response message will not be sent to Brad@example.com or Greg@example.com because they were not the original sender of email message 210 and thus are not associated with the Reply 260 option.
- the user may input a response message in text box 220 by clicking text box 220 and inputting the text through a keyboard or other input device.
- Figure 2C illustrates reply form 200 with a response message in text box 220.
- the response message in text box 220 may not be affected if the user toggles between the various response options.
- the user may toggle between the various response options in order to change the recipient addresses for the response message. For example, if the user wishes to send the message to Tim, Greg and Brad, the user may select the Reply-to-All option 270 within reply form 200. In one example, Reply-to-All option 270 is defined to send the response message to all of the recipients of email message 210.
- Reply-to-All option 270 software code may detect the selection and dynamically update address boxes 240 and 250 to include the email addresses of the recipients associated with the selected response option.
- the software code may populate recipient address box 240 with Tim@example.com and may populate address box 250 with Greg@example.com and Brad@example.com .
- Each of these email addresses is associated with the Reply-to-All 270 option since it is defined to respond to each recipient of email message 210.
- the software code may be embedded within the source code that defines reply form 200.
- the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window (not shown in Figure 2A ).
- the software code may be configured to monitor and/or receive data regarding user selections within reply form 200.
- the software code may parse email message 210 to identify the various recipient email addresses. Based on the location within the email message 210 header, the software code may identify which email addresses to associate with each response option. For example, while parsing email message 210, the software code may identify email addresses located in the "Cc:" field and may assign these addresses to the Reply-to-All option 270. As a result, when a user selects Reply-to-All 270, the software code may populate recipient address box 250 of reply form 200 with the recipient email addresses parsed from the "Cc:" field of email message 210.
- the software code may identify the email addresses located in the "From:" field of email message 210.
- the software code may associate these email addresses with the Reply 260 and Reply-to-All 270 options.
- the "From:" field email addresses may be associated with each response option since both are defined to respond to the sender of the original email message 210.
- the software code may populate recipient text box 240 of reply form 200 with the email addresses parsed from the "From:" field of email message 210.
- JavaScript or another scripting language may be used to implement the present invention.
- the software code may be embedded within the source code that defines reply form 200.
- the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window.
- a tear off link or button 290 may be included with reply form 200.
- reply form 200 may be torn off of its original display in the same window as email message 210 and displayed in a separate window.
- Figure 2D illustrates reply form 295 displayed in a window separate from email message 210.
- email message 210 may still be displayed in the original window located within web browser 296. This embodiment of the invention is advantageous because it allows the user to input a response message into reply form 295 while being able to navigate the web browser to a new web page.
- reply form 200 when reply form 200 is torn away from the original display window, a new reply form 200 may be inserted below email message 210, allowing the user to draft a second response message separate from the response message being input into the reply form 295 that was torn away from the original display window.
- FIG. 3A illustrates reply form 200 with the recipient addresses updated in response to the user selection of the Reply-to-All 270 option according to one example of the invention.
- the Reply-to-All 270 option may be defined to send the reply message input into reply form 200 to all of the recipients of email message 210.
- the recipients associated with Reply-to-All option include Tim@example.com , Brad@example.com and Greg@example.com .
- the software code dynamically updated address boxes 240 and 250 with the recipient addresses associated with Reply-to-All option 270.
- the user may click or otherwise select Send button 290 to send the message input to reply form 200 to the recipients specified in address boxes 240 and 250.
- software code may detect the user selection of the send button and initiate the transfer of the message to a remote server for delivery to the specified recipients.
- the software code may be embedded within the source code that defines reply form 200.
- the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window.
- the message may be sent without navigating the user to another web page. In other words, during the process of toggling between response options and sending the message, the same reply form 200 may be displayed to the user.
- a confirmation message indicating that the message has been sent may be inserted in place of the reply form when the message has been sent.
- the software code may be configured to remove the contents of text box 220 after the user has clicked on the send button and the message delivery has been initiated.
- the same reply form 200 may be displayed to the user with the contents of the text box deleted. As a result, the user may immediately begin creating a second response email.
- reply form 200 maintains the same response option as the previously sent response message.
- the Reply-to-All 270 option remains the selected response option.
- reply form 200 may automatically toggle back to the default Reply option 260 after a response message has been sent. In either case, the user may again toggle between the various response options by simply selecting one of the other response options.
- a reply form 400 may be provided to a user with multiple response options provided to the user as a plurality of response buttons 410, 420, 430 and 440 that also initiate the sending of the message.
- Reply form 400 may include a subject box 230 and a text box 220 for inputting a response message.
- response button 410 may represent the reply option.
- software code may initiate the sending of the message input into text box 220 to the sender of the original message 210.
- Tim@example.com .
- Response button 420 may represent the reply-to-all option.
- software code may initiate the sending of the message input into text box 220 to all of the recipients of the original message 210. In this example, the message would be sent to Tim@example.com , Brad@example.com and Greg@example.com .
- software code may dynamically insert the To: and Cc: address boxes 240 and 250 into reply form 400 along with a Send button as illustrated in Figure 4B .
- address boxes 240 and 250 may be populated with the recipient addresses associated with a reply-to-all option. The user may edit the addresses, add new addresses or delete one or more addresses from address boxes 240 and 250.
- software code may insert the To: and Cc: address boxes 240 and 250 into reply form 200 along with a Send button as illustrated in Figure 4B .
- address boxes 240 and 250 may be left empty, allowing the user to input the intended recipients.
- the software code may also include the text of the original message 210 in text box 220 along with a forward header.
- the forward header may include information identifying the sender of message 210, the date message 210 was sent, the subject of message 210 and the recipients of message 210.

EP0886228 discloses a computerized distributed mail system in which a plurality of client computers are connected to each other via a network. Each client computer is configured to execute client mail application programs. A mail service system is also connected to the network. The system is for executing server mail programs on server computers. The mail service system includes an index server for storing mail messages in message files, and for storing a full-text index of the mail messages. In addition, the system includes means for accessing the mail messages by the plurality of client computers by searching the full-text index using queries - The importance of email technology in society today is well known. Email applications have become a common tool in both business and personal communication. A significant factor in the widespread adoption of email technology is the relative ease with which individuals may communicate using email. An individual may quickly communicate a message to one or more individuals by simply inputting the message and the recipients' email address into an email application and clicking a mouse button. One of the primary reasons email is so attractive is that the messages are typically delivered within seconds of being sent.

Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary network on which email messaging may occur. As shown, each of the computer clients,Client A 120,Client B 121,Client C 122, andClient D 123, are coupled to anetwork 100, This network may be a private network, a public network such as the Internet, or a combination thereof. The computer clients (120, 121, 122, 123) are able to communicate with each other through virtual connections overnetwork 100. These virtual connections allow the clients (120, 121, 122 and 123) to send and receive electronic mail messages from the other clients. - Many email users access their email through web mail applications which display a user's email inbox and the corresponding email messages in a web page environment. One of the advantages of web mail applications is that the user may access their email from any location that provides access to the World Wide Web. When a user logs into their email account, they are typically presented with an inbox view that provides a list of the various email messages the user has received. When the user selects a particular email message, for example, by clicking on the message within the list, a request is sent to a web server requesting the selected message. The server responds with the email message which is displayed to the user as a new web page.
- Typically, the web page displaying the message includes one or more response options. Examples of response options include Reply, Reply-to-All and Forward. These response options are usually presented to the user as links or buttons that the user may select. Reply allows the user to reply to the originator of the message. Reply-to-All allows the user to reply to all of the recipients of the message. The Forward option allows the user to forward the email to a user who was not one of the original recipients of the message.
- When a user selects one of the response options in a web based email application, a request is sent to a remote email server requesting the reply web page corresponding to the selected response option. This page typically includes a text box for inputting the reply message and one or more address fields for inserting the recipient addresses. When the user selects the Reply or Reply-to-All option, the server typically inserts the appropriate recipient address information into the address fields.
- Typically, a user must choose the response option at the time he decides to respond to the email. If the user later changes his mind and wants to select a different response option, he cannot do so from the reply web page returned by the server. In order to select a different response option, the user would have to return to the original message web page. This process may result in multiple requests to the server which increases web traffic and adds additional latency to the user experience. If the user provides part or all of a response message into the reply web page before changing his mind on the response options, the user would lose the message unless he copied the message before returning to the original message and pasted it into the new reply web page returned by the server upon selecting the new response option.
- These same limitations are also present in client-side email applications such as Microsoft Outlook. When the user selects a particular response option, a new message window is created including the recipient addresses associated with the response option. However, if the user wishes to change to a different response option, the user must close the window and select a different response option. These applications do not provide the user with a mechanism to dynamically change the response option for his message. As a result, if the user has provided part or all of a message prior to deciding to select a different response option, the user must either copy the message and paste it into the new reply window, or must manually enter the additional recipient addresses,
- Accordingly, what is desirable are improved systems and methods for addressing the above-described limitations of prior systems.
- The present invention provides a computer-implemented method as set forth in Claim 1.
- In one embodiment, a reply form may be provided as an interface to respond to an email message.

Figure 2A illustrates anexemplary reply form 200 according to one example of the invention.Reply form 200 may provide an interface for the user to respond to a previously receivedemail message 210.Reply form 200 may be located within the same window or document (e.g. web page) as the received email message.Reply form 200 may include a content area, such astext box 220, for typing or otherwise inputting the response message, asubject box 230 for entering a subject for the response message, and one or more recipient address boxes for inserting the email addresses of the recipients to which the user wishes to send the response message. In the example illustrated infigure 2A ,reply form 200 may include two recipient address boxes, 240 and 250.Reply form 200 may also include resize options that allow the user to dynamically resizereply form 200 ortext box 220. In one exampleresize buttons reply form 200 ortext box 220. Software code may detect a user selection ofresize button text box 220 withinreply form 200. Alternatively, acontrol corner 225 may be provided to the user which the user may select and drag across the screen to increase the size ofreply form 200 ortext box 220.Reply form 200 may also include multiple response options. In one example,reply form 200 may include three response options, Reply 260 Reply-to-All 270 andForward 280. - In one example,
email message 210 is the message the user is responding to usingreply form 200. As illustrated inFigure 2A ,email message 210 was sent to the user from Tim@example.com. In addition, Tim copied, denoted by "Cc:," Brad@example.com and Greg@example.com. Thus, Brad, Greg and the user each received a copy ofemail message 210. -
Reply form 200 may be generated to allow the user to respond toemail message 210 and may be displayed in the same window or document (e.g. web page) asemail message 210. In an alternative example,reply form 200 may be displayed in a separate window or frame fromemail address 210. In one example, illustrated inFigure 2B , a minimizedreply form 215 may be inserted belowemail message 210. Minimizedreply form 215 may includeresponse options small text box 217. In response to a user selection of one of the response options or in response to a user click in thetext box 217, software code may detect the user selection or click and dynamically insertreply form 200 and/or an expandedtext box 220 in place of minimizedreply form 215 with minimizedtext box 217. In yet another example, the software may expand the minimizedreply form 215 by dynamically inserting additional lines into thetext box 217 of minimizedreply form 215. - In the example illstrated in
Figure 2A ,response options address boxes 240 and/or 250 with the addresses corresponding to the selected response option. Thus, the user may type or enter a response to theemail message 210 and define the characteristics of the response, such as the recipients of the response, without making a specific server request for the response or a response form. This reduction in client-server communication may provide a more efficient email platform in which latency, which is typically caused by generating an email response window and populating the corresponding recipient address field, may be reduced. - Software located on the client computer may also provide a more efficient email response mechanism for the user by allowing the user to toggle through the virtual tabs while maintaining content within the
text box 220. For example, the user may initially select theReply tab 260 and enter a response to theemail message 210 within thetext box 220. Thereafter, the user may toggle from theReply tab 260 to the Reply-to-All tab 270. The content within thetext box 220 may remain after this toggle without any user action. According to on example, software on the client computer modifies the characteristics of the email response (i.e., changes from Reply response to Reply-to-All response) without erasing or modifying the content with the email response. - In the example illustrated in
Figure 2A , Reply 260 is the selected response option. In one example, Reply 260 is the default response option displayed to the user. - In one example,
Reply option 260 may be defined to reply to the sender of theoriginal email message 210. In the example illustrated inFigure 2A , Tim@example.com sent theemail message 210 to which the user is responding so his email address is included inrecipient address box 240 since theReply 260 option is selected. In comparison, the response message will not be sent to Brad@example.com or Greg@example.com because they were not the original sender ofemail message 210 and thus are not associated with theReply 260 option. - In one example, the user may input a response message in
text box 220 by clickingtext box 220 and inputting the text through a keyboard or other input device.Figure 2C , illustratesreply form 200 with a response message intext box 220. The response message intext box 220 may not be affected if the user toggles between the various response options. - As mentioned above, the user may toggle between the various response options in order to change the recipient addresses for the response message. For example, if the user wishes to send the message to Tim, Greg and Brad, the user may select the Reply-to-
All option 270 withinreply form 200. In one example, Reply-to-All option 270 is defined to send the response message to all of the recipients ofemail message 210. - When the user selects Reply-to-
All option 270, software code may detect the selection and dynamically updateaddress boxes recipient address box 240 with Tim@example.com and may populateaddress box 250 with Greg@example.com and Brad@example.com. Each of these email addresses is associated with the Reply-to-All 270 option since it is defined to respond to each recipient ofemail message 210. In one example, the software code may be embedded within the source code that definesreply form 200. In an alternative example, the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window (not shown inFigure 2A ). - The software code may be configured to monitor and/or receive data regarding user selections within
reply form 200. In one example, the software code may parseemail message 210 to identify the various recipient email addresses. Based on the location within theemail message 210 header, the software code may identify which email addresses to associate with each response option. For example, while parsingemail message 210, the software code may identify email addresses located in the "Cc:" field and may assign these addresses to the Reply-to-All option 270. As a result, when a user selects Reply-to-All 270, the software code may populaterecipient address box 250 ofreply form 200 with the recipient email addresses parsed from the "Cc:" field ofemail message 210. - In another example; while parsing
email message 210, the software code may identify the email addresses located in the "From:" field ofemail message 210. The software code may associate these email addresses with theReply 260 and Reply-to-All 270 options. The "From:" field email addresses may be associated with each response option since both are defined to respond to the sender of theoriginal email message 210. As a result, when the user selects either of these response options, the software code may populaterecipient text box 240 ofreply form 200 with the email addresses parsed from the "From:" field ofemail message 210. - One skilled in the art will recognize that there are a number of ways to implement the software code described above. In one embodiment, JavaScript or another scripting language may be used to implement the present invention. In one example, the software code may be embedded within the source code that defines
reply form 200. In an alternative example, the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window. - In one embodiment of the invention illustrated in
Figure 2C , a tear off link orbutton 290 may be included withreply form 200. When a user clicks or otherwise selects tear offbutton 290,reply form 200 may be torn off of its original display in the same window asemail message 210 and displayed in a separate window.Figure 2D illustratesreply form 295 displayed in a window separate fromemail message 210. In one embodiment,email message 210 may still be displayed in the original window located withinweb browser 296. This embodiment of the invention is advantageous because it allows the user to input a response message intoreply form 295 while being able to navigate the web browser to a new web page. In another embodiment, whenreply form 200 is torn away from the original display window, anew reply form 200 may be inserted belowemail message 210, allowing the user to draft a second response message separate from the response message being input into thereply form 295 that was torn away from the original display window. -
Figure 3A illustratesreply form 200 with the recipient addresses updated in response to the user selection of the Reply-to-All 270 option according to one example of the invention. As discussed above, the Reply-to-All 270 option may be defined to send the reply message input intoreply form 200 to all of the recipients ofemail message 210. In the example illustrated, the recipients associated with Reply-to-All option include Tim@example.com, Brad@example.com and Greg@example.com. When the Reply-to-All option 270 was selected by the user, the software code dynamically updatedaddress boxes All option 270. - In one example of the invention, the user may click or otherwise
select Send button 290 to send the message input to replyform 200 to the recipients specified inaddress boxes reply form 200. In an alternative example, the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window. In one embodiment, the message may be sent without navigating the user to another web page. In other words, during the process of toggling between response options and sending the message, thesame reply form 200 may be displayed to the user. - In one example of the invention, a confirmation message indicating that the message has been sent may be inserted in place of the reply form when the message has been sent. In another example, the software code may be configured to remove the contents of
text box 220 after the user has clicked on the send button and the message delivery has been initiated. As illustrated inFigure 3B , thesame reply form 200 may be displayed to the user with the contents of the text box deleted. As a result, the user may immediately begin creating a second response email. In one example,reply form 200 maintains the same response option as the previously sent response message. In the example illustrated, the Reply-to-All 270 option remains the selected response option. In an alternative example,reply form 200 may automatically toggle back to thedefault Reply option 260 after a response message has been sent. In either case, the user may again toggle between the various response options by simply selecting one of the other response options. - One skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to virtual tabs and that there are a number of other ways to display
response options Figure 4 , areply form 400 may be provided to a user with multiple response options provided to the user as a plurality ofresponse buttons Reply form 400 may include asubject box 230 and atext box 220 for inputting a response message. - In one example,
response button 410 may represent the reply option. When the user selectsresponse button 410, software code may initiate the sending of the message input intotext box 220 to the sender of theoriginal message 210. In this example, Tim@example.com.Response button 420 may represent the reply-to-all option. When the user selectsresponse button 420, software code may initiate the sending of the message input intotext box 220 to all of the recipients of theoriginal message 210. In this example, the message would be sent to Tim@example.com, Brad@example.com and Greg@example.com. - In yet another example, when the user selects the Edit Recipients response
button 430, software code may dynamically insert the To: and Cc:address boxes reply form 400 along with a Send button as illustrated inFigure 4B . In one embodiment,address boxes address boxes - Similarly, when the user selects the
Forward response button 440, software code may insert the To: and Cc:address boxes reply form 200 along with a Send button as illustrated inFigure 4B . However, in this example,address boxes original message 210 intext box 220 along with a forward header. The forward header may include information identifying the sender ofmessage 210, thedate message 210 was sent, the subject ofmessage 210 and the recipients ofmessage 210. -
Figure 5 illustratesmultiple email messages email thread 500. Below eachemail message reply link email thread 500. The user may select one of the reply mechanisms to respond to the associated email message withinemail thread 500. In the embodiment illustrated inFigure 5 , reply links 515, 525 or 535 are provided to respond to the email message associated with the reply link. Software code may detect a user selection of the reply link and insert areply form 200 below the message to which the user wants to respond. In one embodiment, the software code may be embedded within the source code that definesemail thread 500. In an alternative embodiment, the software code may be embedded within a hidden frame or second window within the web browser. - In another embodiment, when a user selects reply link 525 a
reply form 200 is inserted belowemail message 520 as illustrated inFigure 6A . In yet another embodiment of the invention, the user may click onmultiple reply links - In a further embodiment of the invention, a reply link may be provided for each response option supported. For example, a reply link may be provided for
Reply 260 option, Reply-to-All 270 option and Forward 280 option. When the user selects one of the response options, areply form 200 may be dynamically inserted below the email message associated with the reply link. Software code may populateaddress boxes reply form 200 as described above. - In an alternative embodiment, the reply links located below each email message within
email thread 500 may be replaced with minimized reply forms 215 illustrated inFigure 2B . As discussed above, in response to a user selection of one of the response options or in response to a user click in the text box of minimizedreply form 215, software code may detect the user selection or click and dynamically insertreply form 200 and/or an expandedtext box 220 in place of minimizedreply form 215 with minimizedtext box 217. In yet another embodiment, the software may expand the minimizedreply form 215 by dynamically inserting additional lines into thetext box 217 of minimizedreply form 215. The user may select multiple minimized reply forms 215 withinemail thread 500, allowing the user respond to multiple email messages withinemail thread 500 at the same time. - In one example of the invention illustrated in
Figure 6B , when a user selects the send button withinreply form 200 ofemail thread 500, the text of the reply message may be inserted into the thread view. As illustrated in this embodiment, the messages withinthread 500 may be indented or otherwise distinguished to provide the user with a visual representation of each message withinemail thread 500. -
Figure 7 illustrates amethod 700 for updating the recipient addresses of a response email in response to user selection of a response option according to one example of the invention. Instep 710, a reply form for responding to a first electronic mail (email) message may be provided to a user. The reply form may include a text box for inputting the response message and one or more address boxes for inputting the addresses of the intended recipients of the response message. - In
step 720, a plurality of response options may be provided to the user. The response options may be part of the reply form or may in some way be associated with the reply form. In one example, the response options include the Reply option, the Reply-to-All option, and the Forward option. There are a number of ways in which the response options may be presented to the user, including presenting the response options as virtual tabs, links and or buttons. Each response option may be associated with a subset of the recipients of the email message to which the user is responding. - In
step 730, a user selection of one of the plurality of response options may be detected. In one example, software code detects the selection of one of the response options. The software code may determine which recipient addresses are associated with the selected response option, In one example, the first email message may be parsed to locate the various recipients and sender of the first email message. These email addresses may be associated with various response options. - In
step 740, the recipient addresses of the response message are updated in response to the selected response option. In one example, software code may dynamically update or replace the recipient email addresses of the reply form with the recipient addresses associated with the selected response option. This may consist of removing email addresses from the reply form that are not associated with the selected response option. This may also consist of populating the reply form with recipient email addresses that are associated with the selected response option. - While the present invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications may be provided. For example, though the invention has been discussed with reference to various response options, one skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to these response options. Other response options may be defined that are part of the present invention. In addition, there are numerous programming languages, including JavaScript, that may be used to implement the invention. Variations upon and modifications to the embodiments are provided for by the present invention, which is limited only by the following claims.
