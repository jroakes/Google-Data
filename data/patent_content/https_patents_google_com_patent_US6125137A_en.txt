Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for performing a signal search in a coherent wireless communication system.
- DS-CDMA direct sequence code division multiple access
- TIA IS-95B Telecommunications Industry Association Interim Standard 95B
- the coded communication signals used in the DS-CDMA system comprise spread spectrum signals which are transmitted in a common 1.25 MHz bandwidth channel between mobile stations and base transceiver stations (BTS) located at base sites of the wireless communication system.
- BTS base transceiver stations
- Each 1.25 MHz bandwidth portion of the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, or 1.25 MHz bandwidth channel carries spread spectrum signals centered around a particular carrier frequency and is commonly referred to as a narrowband DS-CDMA channel.
- RF radio-frequency
- Recovery of the spread spectrum signals by the BTS is enabled via the use of non-coherent demodulation techniques.
- a mobile communication signal transmitted from a mobile station to a BTS may be reflected off of nearby scatterers, such as buildings, and result in multipath propagation of the transmitted signal. These reflections produce replicas, typically referred to as multipath replicas, of the originally transmitted signal which arrive at a base site receiver with various power levels at various times. The power levels are determined by propagation distances traveled by the multipath replicas.
- the originally transmitted signal and its multipath replicas are filtered, despread, recombined and decoded to yield the desired voice or data signal.
- narrowband interference The ability of a spread spectrum system to resist noise interference, commonly referred to as narrowband interference, is determined in part by the processing gain of the system.
- Wideband CDMA system configurations inherently possess a higher processing gain (a ratio of occupied bandwidth to an information rate), when compared to narrowband CDMA systems.
- the higher processing gain has the advantage of increased noise immunity as well as higher signal resolution due to additional multipath components available in wideband CDMA systems.
- multipath component, or signal searching in a wideband wireless communication system is less effective when compared with multipath component searching in an narrowband (IS-95) wireless communication system.
- a high energy single signal typically resolved in an IS-95 wireless communication system becomes multiple low energy signals, resolved in a wideband wireless communication system.
- a wideband wireless communication system has a lower multipath signal detection probability due to less available signal energy per multipath signal.
- a reduced chip period for a given search window yields a larger number of pn offsets to be searched. Consequently, the probability that a pn-offset within the search window may be erroneously detected is increased, thereby yielding a higher overall probability of false alarms.
- a multipath searcher with substantially more sensitivity is required in a wideband wireless communication system in order to overcome the problems associated with lower multipath signal detection and higher false alarms in the BTS.
- FIG. 1 depicts a typical prior art wideband CDMA wireless communication system 100.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a prior art multipath signal searcher 200 used to identify time offsets associated with mobile communication signals and their multipath replicas.
- FIG. 3 is a partial block diagram of a prior art RAKE receiver used to demodulate the mobile communication signal at the time offsets selected by multipath signal searcher 200.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a base station receiver assembly 400 which includes multipath signal searcher 200, RAKE receiver 300 and an energy adjustment generator 490, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- This approach employs a multipath searcher in communication with a base site RAKE receiver.
- the multipath searcher utilizes a comparison metric, or symbol match count, and an existing energy metric to adjust tracking operation in the base site RAKE receiver.
- a base station receiver assembly 400 for tracking a mobile communication signal which operates in a coherent code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communication system conveying a mobile communication signal
- the base station receiver assembly 400 includes a multipath signal searcher 200, a receiver 300, and an energy adjustment generator 490.
- the energy adjustment generator 490 operates to combine an energy metric 241, resulting from multipath signal searcher 200, with a symbol match count 447 in order to generate a signal 448.
- Signal 448 is composed of an adjusted energy value that represents an improved energy metric when compared to an energy metric possible in prior art multipath signal searchers such as multipath searcher 200.
- Symbol match count 447 provides the additional information necessary to provide the improved energy metric that subsequently directs the selection of pn-offsets used in receiver finger demodulation.
- Symbol match count 447 is the result of a comparison of a number of times an output from multipath signal searcher 200 and an output from receiver 300 are identical. It is therefore representative of a likelihood that a time offset selected by finger manager 260 corresponds to a valid time offset of mobile communication signal 107.
- FIG. 1 depicts a typical prior art coherent CDMA wireless communication system 100.
- Coherent CDMA wireless communication system 100 preferably comprises a direct spread code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) cellular communication system, although a multi-carrier CDMA cellular communication system may be suitable.
- DS-CDMA direct spread code division multiple access
- Coherent CDMA wireless communication system 100 includes base sites 101, 106, 105 providing service to coverage areas 122, 124, and 126 respectively, and one or more mobile stations although only one mobile station 103 is shown.
- Base sites 101, 105 and 106 include, among other things, a processor 140 and a memory 150.
- Base site 101 includes a transceiver (not shown) which transmits coded communication signals to, and receives coded communication signals from, mobile station 103 via an antenna 102.
- a receiver preferably a RAKE receiver within the transceiver provides tracking capability of incoming multipath coded communication signals from mobile stations, the construction and operation of RAKE receivers being well known in the art.
- mobile station 103 includes a transceiver that transmits coded communication signals to, and receives coded communication signals from, base site 101 within a coverage area 122.
- Coded communication signals transmitted from mobile station 103 are comprised of a pilot signal and a data signal.
- the pilot signal which enables use of coherent demodulation techniques by a base site is comprised of a bit stream represented by +1's, while the data signal representative of voice, video, or data, is comprised of a bit stream represented by +1's and -1's.
- Base sites 101, 105, and 106 are coupled to a base station controller (BSC) 130, which includes, among other things, a processor 140 and a memory 150, and which is in turn coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC) 160, also including a processor 140 and a memory 150.
- BSC base station controller
- MSC 160 is coupled to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) 162 using known techniques.
- PSTN public switched telephone network
- Mobile communication signal 107 is conveyed between mobile station 103 and base site 101 through a radio frequency (RF) channel.
- the RF channel includes a reverse-link (mobile station 103 to base site 101) and a forward-link (base site 101 to mobile station 103).
- Mobile communication signal 107 includes an a pseudo-random short code (not shown) associated with and assigned by base site 101, and a mobile unique pseudo-random long code mask (not shown). The inclusion of the codes results in a mobile unique pseudo-random noise sequence (PN sequence) for mobile station 103, which is identifiable by the RAKE receiver at base site 101.
- PN sequence mobile unique pseudo-random noise sequence
- Signals 119 and 113 are multipath replicas of mobile transmitted signal 107, due, for example, to reflections of mobile communication signal 107 off of scatterers such as building 109.
- Multipath replica 119 of mobile communication signal 107, and mobile communication signal 107 arrive at base site 101 at different times, time offset from a reference time, commonly referred to as a pn-offsets.
- the different pn-offsets are the result of varying propagation distances.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a prior art multipath signal searcher 200 used to identify time offsets associated with mobile communication signals and their multipath replicas.
- a signal energy value associated with a particular time offset is used by multipath signal searcher 200 to select a pn-offset associated with an appropriate multipath signal for demodulation by a receiver.
- the base site receiver In order to demodulate the transmissions from a particular mobile station, the base site receiver must first differentiate the multipath signals associated with a particular mobile station from other multipath signals as well as simple noise associated with other nearby transmitters. This identification of a particular mobile station's multipath signals, including their locations with reference to a time offset or a pn-offset, begins as an antenna, or signal search.
- the pn-offset is measured in increments of time referred to as pseudorandom noise (PN) chips.
- PN pseudorandom noise
- Each PN chip is approximately equivalent to the inverse of the occupied bandwidth, e. g. 814 nanoseconds (ns) for a 1.2288 MHz system and 271 ns for a 3.866 MHz system.
- the searcher In a sectorized antenna system, there are generally two antennas for each of the sectors.
- the searcher For a typical time-diversity demodulation process the searcher identifies the strongest received multipath signals via correlating known PN sequences with the incoming multipath signal over a range of PN-offsets commonly referred to as a search window.
- Multipath signal searcher 200 then calculates the received multipath signal energies over the range of pn-offsets, incremented in 1/2 PN chip steps, for a set of antennas but does not demodulate or decode the information at these offsets.
- a received multipath signal energy, or energy metric, that exceeds a predetermined energy threshold may indicate that a valid mobile station transmission has been captured at that particular pn-offset.
- Multipath signal searcher 200 may be configured such that antennas within a sector are searched serially. After all the antennae have been searched, the searcher outputs the winning energy metrics at their associated pn-offsets. The resulting pn-offsets are then compared in a finger manager to the previously selected pn-offsets. The previously selected pn-offsets may or may not be replaced by one or more of the resulting pn-offsets, depending on the finger assignment algorithm. Accordingly, receiver finger demodulator paths are assigned to track and demodulate multipath signals at the selected pn-offsets.
- multipath signal searcher 200 despreads multipath signals received at an antenna 102 and assesses their energy levels at corresponding time offsets.
- Multipath signal searcher uses well known coherent demodulation techniques in order to determine whether or not the incoming signals at a particular time offset are representative of the desired mobile communication signal.
- Multipath signal searcher 200 includes a RF receiver front-end block 204 for front-end processing.
- Multipath signal searcher 200 further includes a PN depreader 220, a pilot signal Walsh code despreader 232, and an energy accumulator 230.
- a plurality of energy metrics output from the plurality of search paths searching at a corresponding plurality of time offsets provides an input to a sorter 250.
- Sorter 250 selects a best set of time offsets 243 based on the plurality of energy metrics and subsequently forwards best set of time offsets 243 to a finger manager 260 for directing receiver finger tracking and demodulation.
- Multipath signal searcher 200 receives a mobile communication signal 107 in the form of multipath replicas via antenna 102.
- Front-end processing such as intermediate frequency demodulation, analog automatic gain control (AGC), and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion of mobile communication signal 107 is performed by well known methods and circuits at RF receiver front-end block 204.
- the analog AGC is typically employed in front of the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter in order to reduce the dynamic operating range of the A/D converter.
- RF receiver front-end block 204 further converts the digital signal output from the A/D converter to a set of gain adjusted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 219.
- Set of gain adjusted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 219 is despread by a pseudo-random noise (PN) despreader 220 which removes a pseudo random code, added to the mobile communication signal prior to transmission by the mobile station.
- PN despreader 220 For each gain adjusted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component, PN despreader 220 yields a corresponding combined despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component 223 at a corresponding time offset.
- Combined despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 223 is further despread in pilot signal Walsh code despreader 232 via the removal of a series of Walsh Code zero's to produce a despread pilot signal portion 224.
- Despread pilot signal portion 224 is representative of the pilot in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component of pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 223.
- Despread pilot signal portion 224 is processed by energy accumulator 230 to yield an energy metric 241 for the mobile communication signal at the corresponding time offset.
- Energy accumulator 230 includes a cohererent (or complex) accumulator 234, a magnitude squarer 236, and a non-coherent (or real) accumulator 238.
- despread pilot signal portion 224 is forwarded to coherent accumulator 234.
- Coherent accumulator 234 then coherently accumulates despread pilot signal portion 224 at the corresponding time offset to produce a pilot signal in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component with an improved signal-to-noise ratio.
- the pilot signal in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component is input to magnitude squarer 236 which computes an energy of the pilot signal in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component to produce a magnitude representative of a pilot signal strength and consequently, has no imaginary component.
- Non-coherent accumulator 238 then operates to produce energy metric 241 at the corresponding time offset.
- Sorter 250 sorts and ranks energy metric 241 with a plurality of other energy metrics resulting from other time offset paths to produce best set of time offsets 243, substantially likely to correspond to a plurality time offsets of mobile communication signal 107.
- best set of time offsets 243 is based solely on energy metrics resulting from despread pilot signal portions at their corresponding plurality of time offsets. Best set of time offsets 243 is then utilized by a finger manager algorithm in finger manager 260 to direct a plurality of receiver finger demodulator paths (shown in connection with FIG. 3) to demodulate mobile communication signal 107 at selected time offsets.
- Multipath signal searcher 200 may be implemented using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or using other suitable means.
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- FIG. 3 is a partial block diagram of a prior art RAKE receiver 300 used for demodulating mobile communication signal 107 and it's multipath replicas at the time offsets selected by multipath signal searcher 200.
- RAKE receiver 300 despreads and demodulates received multipath signals at assigned time offsets resulting from mobile station 103.
- RAKE receiver 300 includes an antenna 102 for receiving incoming signals, and a RF receiver front-end block 204 for front-end processing.
- RAKE receiver 300 further includes a plurality of receiver finger demodulator paths although only one finger demodulator path 350 is shown in detail.
- RAKE receiver 300 also includes a combiner 342 for combining a plurality of receiver finger signal streams, for example receiver finger signal stream 356, resulting from the plurality of receiver finger demodulator paths.
- RAKE receiver 300 further includes a deinterleaver 358 and a decoder 359.
- RAKE receiver 300 receives mobile station signal 107 via antenna 102.
- Front-end processing such as intermediate frequency demodulation, analog automatic gain control (AGC), and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion of CDMA signal 107 is performed by well known methods and circuits at RF receiver front-end block 204.
- RF receiver front-end block 204 further converts the digital signal, output from the A/D converter, to a set of gain adjusted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 219.
- Receiver finger demodulator path 350 includes a finger PN despreader 351, a pilot signal Walsh code despreader 332, a data signal Walsh code despreader 360, and a finger data signal demodulator 354.
- Set of gain adjusted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 219 received by receiver finger demodulator path 350 is despread by finger PN despreader 351 which removes a pseudo random code added to mobile communication signal 107 prior to transmission by mobile station 103.
- finger PN despreader 351 For each gain adjusted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component, finger PN despreader 351 yields a corresponding combined finger despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 353 at the assigned time offset.
- the assignment of the assigned time offset is directed by finger manager 260 based on the best set of time offsets selected by sorter 250.
- Finger despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 353 are forwarded to pilot signal Walsh code despreader 332 for despreading to produce a finger despread pilot signal portion 324.
- finger despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 353 are forwarded to data signal Walsh code despreader 360 for despreading to produce a finger despread data signal portion 361.
- Finger despread pilot signal portion 324 and finger despread data signal portion 361 are then demodulated in finger data signal demodulator 354 to produce a receiver finger signal stream at the assigned time offset.
- Finger data signal demodulator 354 includes a channel estimator 362, and a complex multiplier 364.
- Finger despread pilot signal portion 324 received by channel estimator 362 is utilized to estimate a phase angle 363 associated with finger despread pilot signal portion 324.
- the phase angle results from a propagation delay associated with mobile communication signal 107.
- a conjugate of resulting phase angle 363 is multiplied with finger despread data signal portion 361 in complex multiplier 364 to yield receiver finger signal stream 356 at the assigned time offset.
- Combiner 342 then combines receiver finger signal stream 356 with other receiver finger signal streams resulting from additional receiver finger demodulator paths such as receiver finger demodulator path 370.
- Deinterleaver 358 restores an order to combined signal symbol stream 344 to yield a sequence of deinterleaved transmitted channel symbols representative of the mobile communication signal 107.
- the sequence of deinterleaved transmitted channel symbols are input to a decoder 359 which estimates a sequence of information bits from the sequence of deinterleaved transmitted channel symbols and outputs a decoded signal 380 representative of mobile communication signal 107.
- RAKE receiver 300 may be implemented using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or using other suitable means.
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a base station receiver assembly 400 which includes multipath signal searcher 200, RAKE receiver 300 and an energy adjustment generator 490, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- Energy adjustment generator 490 produces an energy correction to energy metric 241, forming a signal 448 forwarded to sorter 250.
- energy adjustment generator 490 provides an increased multipath detection probability over that which is achieved using only the energy metric alone.
- the energy correction is based on a symbol match count (SMC) resulting from a comparison of outputs from multipath signal searcher 200 with outputs from RAKE receiver 300.
- SMC symbol match count
- Energy adjustment generator 490 includes a data Walsh depreader 460, a data signal demodulator 470, a first binary clipper 471, a second binary clipper 472, a comparator 473, a counter 474, and a function block 480.
- Energy adjustment generator 490 which may be implemented in using any number of suitable methods, operates in concert with multipath signal searcher 200 and RAKE receiver 300 to generate the symbol match count as follows.
- a gain adjusted set of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 219 resulting from receiving and gain adjusting mobile communication signal 107 by receiver front end 204 is received by PN despreader 220.
- PN despreader 220 despreading at a specific PN offset, yields a combined despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 223 at a corresponding time offset.
- Combined despread pilot and data in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components 223 is input to data Walsh code despreader 460 which removes a Walsh code associated with spreading the data signal prior to transmission, thereby yielding a despread data signal portion 461.
- despread pilot signal portion 224 resulting from pilot Walsh depreader 232 is received by a data signal demodulator 470.
- Data signale demodulator 470 then demodulates despread pilot signal portion 224 to produce a signal stream 426.
- Data signal demodulator 470 includes a channel estimator 462 and a complex multiplier 464.
- Despread pilot signal portion 224 input to data signal demodulator 470 is received by channel estimator 462.
- Channel estimator 462 estimates a phase angle 463 associated with despread signal portion 224.
- Phase angle 463 of a multipath signal transmitted from mobile station 103 is indicative of a mobile communication signal delay.
- a de-rotation of the multipath ray equivalent to phase angle 463, results in an ability to compare transmitted channel symbols output from receiver fingers with transmitted channel symbols processed in multipath searcher 200.
- a conjugate of phase angle 463 is multiplied by despread signal portion 461 in complex multiplier 464, yielding a signal stream 426. Accordingly, signal stream 426 is representative of transmitted channel symbols, de-rotated such that a comparison of the transmitted channel symbols with a combined receiver finger signal stream is feasible over the predetermined time period.
- Signal stream 426 is converted in first binary clipper 471 to produce a first binary signal stream 445.
- combined signal symbol stream 344 output from a plurality of receiver finger demodulator paths is converted in second binary clipper 472 to produce a second binary signal stream 446.
- First binary signal stream 445 is comprised of symbols representative of an estimate of mobile communication signal 107 at the corresponding time offset.
- Second binary signal stream 446 is comprised of symbols representative of an estimate of mobile communication signal 107 at the time offsets assigned by finger manager 260.
- First binary signal stream 445 and second binary signal stream 446 are compared in comparator 473 which yields a value of one when two corresponding symbols from first and second binary streams are identical. Comparator 473 yields a value of zero when two corresponding symbols from the first and second binary streams are not identical. If an accurate selection of the time offset was previously made by multipath signal searcher 200, then first binary signal stream 445 will be substantially identical to second binary signal stream 446, for the time period.
- Counter 474 then receives an output 475 from comparator 473 and operates to count the number of times comparator 473 yielded the value of one in the time period.
- symbol match count 447 is generated.
- Symbol match count 447 is representative of a likelihood that the corresponding time offset for the time period contains mobile communication signal 107.
- Symbol match count 447 is added to energy metric 241 at function block 480 to yield, as output, signal 448 for use by sorter 250.
- Signal 448 is composed of an adjusted energy value.
- symbol match count 447 provides a weighting function to the inputs received by sorter 250, thereby resulting in a best set of time offsets 443. Accordingly, best set of time offsets 443 is substantially more accurate than best set of time offsets 243, generated as a result of only energy metric 241 provided in the prior art design.
- Function block 480 may be implemented using any suitable method such as a software algorithm or an application specific integrated circuit.
- function block 480 may generate signal 448 using an example algorithm as follows:
- f is a monotonically non-decreasing function and M is the total number of time offsets required to be searched.
- the total M offsets are sorted in descending order according to the adjusted energy values of signals input to sorter 250, such as signal 448. Therefore a signal received by multipath signal searcher 200 which has a low energy value 241 but is determined to have a high SMC 447 may be accepted as a candidate for receiver finger assignment by finger manager 260. As a result, weak mobile communication signals are more likely to be detected, and the capability of multipath signal searcher 200 to select corresponding time offsets at which successful receiver demodulation may occur, is enhanced.
- the cdma2000 system and its application in wideband CDMA systems has been specifically referred to herein, but the present invention is applicable to any coherent CDMA wireless communication system.
- the principles of the present invention which apply to a cellular-based digital communication system include but are not limited to personal communicating systems, trunked systems, satellite systems and data networks.
