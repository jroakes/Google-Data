Reference is crossed to be integrally incorporated herein.
Embodiment
The present disclosure describes the automation or semi-automation that one kind allows referred to herein as " robot program (bot) "
System is by the place calls during calling and is independently engaged in the dialogue with the mankind come the technology with human communication.Robot program
Receive and monitor that data should initiate the trigger event of calling to detect instruction.Robot program can pass through predefined work
The sequence of stream or repeatable operator scheme carrys out work, and each operation is carried out by the abstractdesription or intention of operation to be performed
Link.Substantially, robot program can be determined how reaction and what is said to the mankind using these workflows, to be use
Family performs useful task.
Various tasks of the system processing as inquire-receive, such as " book a table for two at Yves
Saint Thomas Restaurant for Thursday (subscribing two desks of Thursday in her husband's St. Thomas dining room) ",
“my sink is leaking and I need a plumber！It’s after 10p.m.！(my tank leak, I needs
Want a plumber！At night after 10 points！) " etc..
Wish that scheduling preengages, buys article, asks the user of service etc. that they in completion may be needed to want times reached
Performed before business and repeatedly search for and dial many callings.In first use-case, dining table is subscribed in dining room, user can search
Index holds up search dining room.In some instances, can be in website or application if dining room is just upper in website or application
(or by integrated with website or application) performs inquiry, if it is not, then user can call dining room and consult to preengage.
As an example, system can be used for for user's place calls.System is communicated with businessman and other services, with complete
Into the task of user's request.In some instances, robot program performs most of communication.In some instances, human manipulation
Member can examine and verify the success of the operation performed by robot program.In some instances, human operator who performs action,
And robot program is from the communication learning of human operator who, with their automated communication technical ability of raising.
In the second use-case, user wishes to find plumber outside normal business hours, and such inquiry may be more difficult to
Processing.For example, if user manually searches for plumber, he may search for plumber on a search engine and to several in them
Individual give calls.User may must explain time restriction to each plumber, and they are located at the property of where and problem, and
Obtain price evaluation.This may take very much.
Similarly, for the 3rd use-case, check whether local shop has product in stock, user may be required to scan for this
Ground shop and each local shop is called to determine particular commodity or product that whether shop there are them to be look for.
In addition to helping user to carry out particular task, system can be indexed with fresh information, such as business hours, offer
Service etc..In response to detecting loss, aging, inconsistent data etc., system can trigger to update the data automatically.It is logical
Often, in order to obtain such information, user may need each businessman of individual inspiration or data source.
The system provide many advantages, including reduce complete be related to initiate call some required by task the mankind it is defeated
The amount entered.For example, system can be based on determining to have met some trigger conditions automatically to initiate call, meet some
The inconsistency that the service and third party that trigger condition is such as provided by salon are preengage on website between the service listed.The system
The friction of Transaction Inquiries can be reduced, for example, the people of one end by detecting call dejected or not accommodating end call
Or change the mode to engage in the dialogue.The system can join the user of developing country and such as service of transport or education services
System gets up.The system can also connect the user to low technology industry existing for no website or numeral.In addition, even if with maximum
Polymerizer compare, the system is expansible for different applications.
Figure 1A shows the example block diagram of the system for calling system, the calling system place calls and

Trigger module 110, audio pack 112, conversation recording device 114, session storage 116, text to language module 118, the inspection of language end points
Survey device 120, the text that has stored to language result or recording 122, be intended to arrive text module 124, language to text module 126,
Language application programming interfaces (API) 128, text to intention module 130, flow manager 132, operator control unit 134 and Shi Yuan
(bailout) module 136.In some embodiments, system includes all modules.In some embodiments, system includes
The combination of these modules.For example, in one embodiment, text is unnecessary to module is intended to, and it is intended to directly
It is given to language synthesis module.
Figure 1B shows the alternative example block diagram of the system for calling system, and the calling system place calls are simultaneously
And engaged in the dialogue during calling between the robot program and the mankind of calling system.In this example, communications platform
102 are replaced by the phone for the guest portal point of user's request and for other requests (i.e. the inbound call from businessman)
Signal server.The system by it is two kinds of request be sent to telephony server (196), the telephony server (196) with from
The robot program that the other end is called services (195) and called.In some embodiments, robot program services
(195) dialog model (198) and language model (199) are included, make it that it is anthropoid that robot program's service can carry out class
Telephone conversation.Telephony server (196) can include TTS model (197).Language identifier (191) and/or audio synthesizer
(194) can be that telephony server (196) provides information, to understand and in response to people in the other end of call (190)
Class.Operator (134) monitors calling using task user interface (160) and integrated treatment user interface (170).Operator
(134) it can examine from recording operating room and assess TTS (114) institute's ticket call.Calling player (162) will be to behaviour
Work person (134) replays calling.Operator can carry out scheduling calling using local agent (175), to pass through telephony server (196)
Initiate call.
In Figure 1A embodiment, communications platform 102 allows robot program by performing such as place calls, receiving
The task of inbound call or contact target businessman from businessman or user (104,144) carrys out contact external role.Communications platform
102 also allow robot program to receive the request from user is called with representing user.
In some embodiments, user is by interacting or asked by language request to another with user interface
User or the calling of businessman.These users ask can be used for additional type of the task, such as：Reservation reservation, progress dining room are pre-
About, find dog walker or find out the article which shop has user to want purchase.
Fig. 1 C show that user can be by its in greater detail example user interface of the input on the request.User can
With by clicking on " book (reservation) " button or initiating to ask with user interface interaction in some other fashion.If for example,
User wants to carry out hair appointment, then the website that user can be associated with the salon that user wants haircut interacts.User
Can be as an alternative with being included in the search result list of the salon in search result as a result or with showing sand on map
The user interface of dragon interacts.Any one in these interfaces can allow user's request call.User can input use
The details of family request, such as：User wants species and the service for the desired service completed of professional image designer, user looked for
Date and time.As shown in Figure 1B, user can click on " continue with booking (continuing to subscribe) " button or adopt
Other actions are taken to indicate to carry out the request of hair appointment.
Fig. 1 D show the example that user speaks to make requests on to robot program.Said in user to robot program
Go out after request, robot program can be with the affirmative acknowledgement request.Robot program can also be asked on asking from user
The additional information asked.For example, if user says the request on being got a haircut to robot program, robot program can be with
Inquire the hair appointment wanted on user position, should scheduling hair appointment date and user scheduling which kind of class wanted
The information of the haircut service of type.
User can carry out task requests when task can not perform to system.For example, all closed in all Hair Dressing Salons
At 11 points in evening, user can be with request call with scheduling hair appointment.Therefore, request can be stored in mission bit stream and deposited by system
Chu Zhong, with date or time afterwards, such as business hours in the salon for otherwise being determined or being obtained by system 100
Period initiates and completed.
In some embodiments, system provides a user in the request is handled that there will be the initial feedback of delay.Example
Such as, when user is when the evening that salon closes, 11 request calls were with scheduling hair appointment, system provides a user vision, audio
Or other instructions, it is indicated because salon has been switched off, and completes task there will be delay, once until salon's business system
Untill can just salon being got in touch with.
In some embodiments, information of the storage of mission bit stream storage 150 on each task, such as：Ask this
The name of the user of business, one or more personnel to be called or place, being asked for task type, carry out task requests
Method, the details on the specific task of type, in order to complete the beginning for the movable details, task that task has been carried out
Date, task target date, updated for the final state of user made requests on time, the calling task is carried out again
The operator of secondary confirmation, user are for the Close Date of the task requests and the current state of the task.
In some embodiments, task manager module 140 is determined when to personnel or businessman's scheduling calling.Task
Manager module 140 monitors the task from mission bit stream storage 150, and determines to carry out scheduling to received task
Appropriate time.Some tasks are immediately by scheduling, and other tasks are then after certain trigger events occur by scheduling.
In some cases, in the other end by the call placed of system 100, there will be the mankind, such as mankind 104.The people
Class 104 can be the representative for the tissue that robot program attempts contact.In some instances, communication is used in order to call businessman
Platform.The system 100 can integrate with communications platform.For example, the system 100 can use the framework for being used for testing web applications
(framework) programmatically operate web browser, and use the conference call service based on web.System 100 can
To create and use multiple communications platform accounts.In some instances, system 100 can be automatically between communications platform account
Alternately throttled with avoiding calling speed.
Dialer 106 promotes to initiate or dial the calling of robot program's progress.Dialer 106 is communicatively connected to lead to
Believe platform 102.Dialer 106 provides instruction to be initiated to the specific callee selected by dialer 106 to communications platform 102
Call.Such as dialer 106 can play the audio sound corresponding with the numerical digit of telephone number.Once calling has been dialed,
Then system 100 can engage in the dialogue with the mankind callee of the circuit other end.
Dialer 106 can receive the instruction that calling is initiated to specific callee.Such as dialer 106 can be from system
Other modules in 100 receive the data for including instruction, all igniter modules in this way 110 of other modules or flow manager 132.
Igniter module 110 detects trigger event, or instruction system 100 should initiate the spy of calling to specific callee
Determine event.Trigger event can be the event of predefined type.Such as the user of system 100 can specify certain types of triggering thing
Part.Trigger event can include by system 100 user perform clear and definite action, be provided to igniter module 110
The pattern (pattern) that is detected in data, from occurring particular event by predetermined amount of time and various other types
Event.In response to detecting trigger event, igniter module 110 provides instruction with to specific callee to dialer 106
Calling is initiated, or instruction is provided to select the node of particular workflow or provide instruction to dialer to flow manager 132.
Audio system 108 is used to recording and playing audio.In some instances, three virtual streams are established and are used it for
The whole calling of record：(a) from phone or conference call service to the incoming audio of system 100；(b) communication is returned to from system 100
The outflow audio of platform；(c) a and b mixed flow is combined.Audio system 108 passes through communications platform using audio pack 112 to perform
102 communication.
Audio pack 112 be used to communicate with audio system 108.In some instances, the system 100 is included audio pack
The bags (wrap) of volume 112 and the audio-frequency module for disposing the continuous stream of incoming audio packet.Module also records each incoming packet, and
And allow to play back pre-recorded audio file.The system 100 uses various locating depths, sample frequency, packet size etc..
System 100 can record to be transferred into and out talking with by what robot program was carried out.Audio pack 112 can cause system
100 can use conversation recording device 114 to record special session or calling.In some instances, conversation recording device 114 can pass through
It is recorded in the language generation of robot program, to record a part for the dialogue carried out by robot program.Show at other
In example, conversation recording device 114 can be by outside when the language communication system 102 of robot program be output to the mankind 104
Ground records it, to record a part for the dialogue carried out by robot program.Conversation recording device 114 can also record the mankind 104
Response.
Conversation recording device 114 stores recorded session data in session storage 116.The session data recorded can be with
It is stored as voice data or is stored as representing the characteristic of voice data.For example, the session data recorded can be by
Vector is stored as, the value of the special characteristic of vector storage session voice data.Session storage 116 can be local data base,
The memory of remote server, the physical storage in system 100 or any various other types.
Language end point detector 120 simplifies the dialogue between robot program and the mankind of circuit opposite side.For simplification
Dialogue, the dialogue are segmented into single sentence, discretely switched between the mankind and robot program.Language end point detector
120 are responsible for receiving continuous input audio stream from audio pack 112 and are converted into discrete sentence.
Language end point detector 120 detects the end points of language.In one embodiment, language end point detector 120 with
Two states operate：Wait language；And wait silence (silence).Language end point detector 120 as follows these states it
Between alternately：By the way that the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of each audio packet and predefined threshold value relatively checked into the audio point
Group.If the RMSD of single audio packet is less than the threshold value, the audio packet is considered as " silence ".No matter when receive
The packet of non-silence, module will switch to " wait silence " state from " wait language " state.Module is only receiving persistently
After the period of the continuous silence packet of time predefined section, just changed to switchback, the time predefined section depends on whole system
State.
In some embodiments, at " wait sound " during the period, the pure silence packet of the construction of language end point detector 120
(bag of every ten true packet one construction of construction) and language is sent to text module 126.The packet of construction can
To avoid disconnecting from language API 128.In " wait silence " during the period, the transmission of language end point detector 120 is heavy come what is flow automatically
Silent packet reaches the predefined period (being estimated to be use for baseline noise), and is then transported on all audio packets.
In some embodiments, the use of language end point detector 120 is trained to observe intonation and linguistic context (language
Context machine learning, neutral net or some form of deep learning) finds end points.
In some instances, language end point detector 120 considers to say when determining how the specific stream of parsing audio input
What, the intonation of speaker etc..For example, language end point detector 120 can determine that specific mankind callee 104 tends to
Sentence is terminated by low pitch change, and language end point detector 120 can be predicted when detecting that tonal variations decline
The end for the sentence said by callee 104.Language end point detector 120 can based on the signal to noise ratio in time frame and
Threshold value is dynamically adjusted during calling.
The voice data parsed by language end point detector 120 is converted to text, Neng Gouzhen by language to text module 126
The intention of next response to be used to select robot program analyzes the text.Output of the language to text module 126
It is the ordered list of language option, and in some cases, there is provided the confidence level of best option.Language identification process includes
Two chief components：Acoustic module and language module.For acoustic module, system can use to be handed over from direct opposite phone
The model of the record training of the people of what is said or talked about.The model can use neutral net, and in some instances, the first of neutral net
Layer can take into account the vocoder present in call by retraining.Vocoder is to produce sound from the analysis of language input
Voice codec.Neutral net can also be taken into account between the calling to businessman and personal call calling not by retraining
Same ambient noise.System that language module can use the passing experience based on system and be put to language module biasing is built
It is vertical.In some instances, biasing can be automatically configured.In some instances, biasing can be configured manually.In some examples
In, language bias configuration changes between vertical first (vertical).
Language to text module 126 using the context (context) of calling so as to based on prediction from dialogue opposite side
People wants word to be put to language module biasing.For example, the robot program of system asks " Are you open on Tuesday
(you do business Tuesday) " be based on the problem, dialogue opposite side people will with such as " no, we are closed (and no, I
Do not do business) " or " yeah, sure (yes, certainly) " answer response possibility it is very high.Robot program is based on passing
Calling study is likely to be responded and understands incoming audio using prediction.Robot program can predict that complete words ring
Should, but robot program is it is also predicted that phrase.For example, say " we have seven people in robot program
After our party (our party has seven people) ", robot program is expected phrase " you said seven
people(you say seven people) " robot program is it is also contemplated that phrase " you said eleven(you say 11) ",
Because seven (seven) and eleven (11) sound similar.Robot program is it is also contemplated that the response of more low probability, such as
“you said two(you say two) " robot program can based on its prediction come for each phrase assign probability right.
In some embodiments, voice data is converted to text by language to text module 126 using language API 128
This.In some instances, voice data is converted to text by language API 128 using machine learning.For example, language API
128 can use the model for receiving voice data as input.Language API 128 can use any various models, such as determine
Plan tree, linear regression model (LRM), Logic Regression Models, neutral net, grader, SVMs, inductive logic programming, model group
Close (ensemble of models) (for example, using pack, propulsion, random forest etc.), genetic algorithm, Bayesian network
Deng, and can make in various manners to train, such as deep learning, perceptron, correlation rule, inductive logic, cluster, maximum
Entropy classification, learning classification etc..In some instances, language API 128 can use supervised learning.In some instances, talk about
Language API 128 uses unsupervised learning.In some instances, language API 128 can pass through net by language to text module 126
Network accesses.Such as language API 128 can be provided on Cloud Server by remote third party.
In order to solve the synchronization of talk, such as to determine that just in the context residing for talker, to determine by robot journey
The natural opportunity of sequence response, system 100 can identify intention (intent).It is intended that and is said by the mankind or by robot program
Sentence in single semantic meaning written language expression.In some embodiments, system 100 is ignored in the last of reception
It is intended to any intention received between the reply of robot program from the mankind, so that robot program produces and mankind's most recent
The related response of described sentence.However, system 100 can be intended to notify following response using previous.Such as system can incite somebody to action
The intention received before the most recent received is intended to is intended to and stored labeled as ANCIENT, parsing ANCIENT
For being assessed under line.In some instances, the disposal logic of various other forms can be used.
Although the major part of system 100 is unrelated with service condition, some parts of system 100 can be directed to specific
Service condition is manually configured on the internet browser or programmed completely, i.e. systematic vertical member.Vertical member is substantially by being intended to and businessman's logic generation
The normal form (schema) of code is formed.The single language being intended that in by the mankind or the sentence said by robot program in normal form
The inside written language expression of adopted implication.For example, being extracted in the business hours in vertical member, we have " AreYouOpen { date:
Tomorrow } " robot program is intended to, and corresponding " WeAreClosed { date_range:Sep } " mankind's intention.In the future
The process for being changed into intention from the incoming audio of the mankind is referred to herein as being intended to differentiate (Intent Resolution).Opposite mistake
Journey (being intended to robot program to be changed into language) is referred to as intention in utterance (Intent to Speech).Although per vertical first wife
Normal form is put, but the most of code for learning and classifying to be intended to is general and used across vertical member.In some instances, only
Being partially in intention resolution and intention in utterance configuration specific to language of system.
Logical code can be with per vertical metaprogramming (some shared common codes) and for context (the input ginseng by calling
Number and the thing that up to the present has occurred and that) each possible case for defining and the incoming mankind are intended to determine robot program
Behavior.In some embodiments, language is changed to text, and the text is then interpreted that the mankind are intended to.The mankind are intended to quilt
For determining that robot is intended to.In some vertical members, robot program, which guides, to talk with, and robot program in other cases
Mainly the mankind are reacted.Such as：In the vertical member of data acquisition type, robot program from businessman to extract some letters
Cease for target.Generally, it will seek to a series of problems until it obtains all desired information.For robot program with
Such as the problem of type of transaction of the pre- about target of progress is vertically first, and it will be mainly answered from the mankind (" what is your
name(what is your name)”……“and phone number(telephone number)”……).In this case,
System is only just taken leading when the mankind shrink into oneself etc. suddenly.Programmer can design to be intended to be intended to robot in the mankind
Between stream so that the conversion meets logic.In some embodiments, the agreement for stream be present so that non-engineer
It can be controlled to change or update the conversion being intended to from mankind's intention to robot.Machine learning can also be used automatic
Ground study stream.
In some embodiments, it can be hidden layer to input the mankind to be intended to resolution, and machine learning can be used for directly
Connect from input Textual study output device people and be intended to.The input of mankind's language can be changed to text, and then machine people's will
Figure can directly determine from the text.In further embodiment, system can directly export intention from mankind's language.It is all
These designs are learnt robot corresponding with scene and each input using machine learning and are intended to.
Text to be intended to normal form of the module 130 using possible incoming intention, each such example sentence being intended to
And language bias configuration is configured.Substantially, text is responsible for arriving incoming sentence " catching (snap) " to module 130 is intended to
Predefined (or " unknown ") is intended in list, while takes into account the mistake in unfamiliar sentence and language identification process.For example,
In some embodiments, text can identify sentence (as received from language identification module) " who be to module 130 is intended to
open eleven o'clock in the morning till nine o'clock tomorrow nine thirty I'm
Sorry (who will eleven, until tomorrow nine o'clock opens in the morning, sorry nine thirty) " is similar to known example " we
Open at+(TIME, from_time) and close at+ (TIME, to_time) i'm sorry ", this is an intention "
WeAreOpen { from_time=11am, to_time=9:30 } example ".As " from_time " and " to_time "
Field be intended to parameter.
Text can be made up of to module 130 is intended to two major parts：(1) interpreter and (2) annotation text to anticipate
Figure grader.In some embodiments, system has the rear sorting phase for carrying out parametric classification.For example, for phrase
" Monday to Tuesday, sorry Wednesday, we are closed, (Monday to Tuesday, we closed, sorry Monday
To Wednesday) ", comment section text can be rewritten as "<DATE:Monday>to<DATE:Tuesday>,sorry<DATE:
Wednesday>we are closed”.Rewritten this illustration show the interpreter using the annotation in specified response text short
Language.The text intent classifier of annotation can be converted to the phrase of annotation：WeAreClosed{day1:monday,day2:
tuesday,day3:wednesday}.Phrase is rewritten as by sorting phase afterwards：WeAreClosed{from_day:monday,
to_day:wednesday,wrong_to_day；tuesday}.
Once system 100 receives language option, it is just annotated using text to module 130 is intended to each
Date, time, shared name etc..This is for two purposes：(1) intent parameter (such as " time of extraction logic module:10am
(the time：10am)”)；(2) text is summarized to simplify the matching for the sentence for finding and running into before.Text connects to module 130 is intended to
Receive from language to the output of text module 126 and annotate language option list.Then text uses note to module 130 is intended to
Release the intention that most probable option is mapped to and is used for selecting next action in particular workflow by flow manager 132.
In order to reduce the calculating time during calling, system 100 can build the known text that should be annotated in advance
Storehouse (relative to current time and date).For example, in the Tuesday on the 1st of September in 2015, " tomorrow (tomorrow) ", " this
Wednesday (this Wednesday) ", " September 2nd (September 2 days) " etc. can be used as annotation " DATE:(2015,9,2) time "
Choosing.In real time, system 100 (passes through after some regularizations) sequentially iteration, and search for annotation to the word in input sentence
The most long matching of candidate.Then system 100 replaces text with annotation, and return to a character string edited, wherein all candidates
From left to right all it is annotated replacement.For example, " we open at 7in the morning (we in the morning 7 points opening) " will be by
Replace with " we open at@(TIME, 7am) ".
Interpreter or text can also be responsible for contraction to module 130 is intended to.For example, system 100 can be run into as " let me
Sentence as see...yes, 4,4pm (let me see ... yes, 4 points, at 4 points in afternoon) ".Text can to intention module 130
"@(TIME, 4pm) " annotation is replaced " 4,4pm " with single.In addition, text may shrink the small time to module 130 is intended to
Correction, such as " we close at 10, ah, 10:30pm (we at 10 points, closed in the afternoon 10 point 30 minutes) " arrives " we close
at@(TIME,10:30pm)"。
In other embodiments, system can use the other method for being used for annotating text, such as：Machine learning is calculated
How method, the data study that it can be based on integrated treatment annotate text；Prefix trees available for annotation text；Or can be special
Door derived rule-based pattern for annotation.
Text parses and annotated new sentence in most of callings to module 130 is intended to, and language identification is often turned round
Bent many spoken words.System 100 has the thousands of intentions per use case storage, and is divided each sentence based on the parameter of sentence
Class is with from the intention being confirmed as with the intention of the maximally related storage of sentence.For example, it is based on detecting that enlightenment inquiry is exhaled
Specific sentence can be categorized as the intention with inquiry name by the word in the specific sentence of the problem of person's of crying name, system 100.
In some embodiments, the intention of the nonrecognition sentence of system 100, and sentence can be categorized as to have unknown intention.
Text carrys out treatment classification to module 130 is intended to using machine learning algorithm.For example, system can be random with use condition
The combination of field module and Logistic Regression module.In one embodiment, classification is completed in sentence level, i.e. text
Character string be converted into intention set or list.In another embodiment, each token in original character string by
It is categorized as being intended to, and is intended to border and is also classified.For example, in first embodiment, sentence " On Monday, we
Open at seven, let me thing ... on Tuesday, we open at eight, (Monday, we open at 7 points,
Me is allowed to think ... Tuesday, we open at eight) " it will be classified as comprising intention：GiveDailyHours is (when providing daily
Between)+AskToWait (it is required that wait).In second embodiment, substring " on Monday we open at
Seven, (Monday, we were in 7 points of openings) " will be classified as the border of GiveDailyHours intentions, substring " let me
Think ... (allowing me to think ...) " will be classified as type AskToWait another intention, and substring " on
Tuesday, we open at eight, (Tuesday we open at eight) " will be classified as type GiveDailyHours's
Another is intended to.
In some embodiments, text can be without using machine learning algorithm to intention module 130, but is directed to each
Intention uses example collection, and 1- arest neighbors (pattern-recognitions are then used between each language option and all examples
Algorithm), the distance metric of wherein algorithm is a kind of normalized edit distance (character string for quantifying two such as words of the word of sentence
The method how differed each other) variant.The distance between two words are increasingly complex, and purpose is voice distance
It is approximate.In some instances, semantic distance can be determined by the text annotated to module 130 is intended to.
In practice, text can also use intersection language OPTION signal (for example, only being selected in language to module 130 is intended to
Numeral present in one of item is probably bad explanation).In some instances, text is based on system context to module 130 is intended to
The result deviation for annotating text is intended to module as priori.Finally, text to be intended to module 130 for such as
Extraction of the intention with some customizations virtually defined as " ComplexOpeningHours (complicated open hour) ", its
Middle system can identify the complicated wording for having been presented for the open hour, but system can not correctly extracting parameter (such as
“...dinner is served until 9,you can order desserts for one more hour,and the
Bar is opened until 2, but we don't accept customers after 1 ... (... dinner is supplied to 9
Point, have in addition one hour you can order sweets, bar is open at 2 points, but we do not receive customer after 1 point ...) " etc.).
In some instances, past calling of the example based on integrated treatment for classification is inferred automatically, and may be used also
With by manual editing.Vague generalization process can use annotation to substitute text, and omit suspicious integrated treatment.
In some instances, people will not say single intention, but a series of intentions.Such as：“you want a
haircutwhat time(you want haircutWhen)”.Example system is supported any amount of in given sentence
It is intended to.In some instances, specific intention certainly and negative intention are defined as other meanings by the text of annotation to module is intended to
(such as " (no, sir, we will close no sir, we will be closed at this date the prefix of figure on this date
Close) "=>Negative+WeAreClosed).In some instances, any link that the text of annotation is supported to be intended to intention module.
System includes the multiple modules for performing the difference in functionality of organizational logical, including flow manager 132, and it includes general knowledge mould
Block 133；Module 136 is helped with applying.
Flow manager 132 can include the custom code for each vertical member that tracking each calls, and determine how sound
The each intention (or prolonged silence) that should be received from people.However, in other embodiments, flow manager is across vertical member
General.Response is to tell the list (robot program can also select to keep silent) that 104 synthesis is intended to, and sometimes
Terminate the order of calling.Flow manager 132 is also responsible for the result of generation calling, including any information collected during it.
In some examples, system 100 learn how to it is each input carry out reaction be based on initially carried out by the mankind and later by
The reality calling that " children " robot program is carried out.System 100 makes logic as flexible as possible, to solve to occur in calling procedure
Any misunderstanding.
System 100 has multiple streams, and each stream is customized for certain types of task, such as determines the opening of businessman
Time is preengage for salon.System 100 can be maintained in the public library shared between not cocurrent flow, and from dialing
Subflow is extracted in the history of calling, it is allowed to which system is that each task redirects a new vertical member.In some instances, system
100 can be based on manual call placed come the automatic stream learnt for different task.
People can skip some material particulars when speaking, without making their dialogue partner puzzle.A for example, people
It may say " we open 10to 4 (we open from 10 points to 4 points) ".Robot program it should be understood that the businessman whether
The 10 points of openings of at 10 points in the morning or afternoon, similarly, if 4 points or 4:00 AM closing in the afternoon.For example, if this family shop is
Nightclub, then robot program may be contemplated to assume 10 points -4:00 AM in afternoon；If businessman is dining room, then machine
People's program may be contemplated to assume at 4 points in 10 points-afternoon of the morning, etc..
Flow manager 132 includes general knowledge module 133, and it eliminates the blurring of the intention in received language input.
In some examples, flow manager 132 includes polytype general knowledge module, for example, from some data sets (for example, baseline is local
Database) study statistical information module, and the module of manual programming.The module of first type (such as is opened using option
Put the time) set, and calculate each option and sub- option (such as " 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM " or " only 2:00 AM ") p
Value.The module of second of type uses predefined regular set, and its anti-locking system is made and may resided in data set
" general knowledge " mistake.Whenever it there are ways to explain some variables, flow manager 132 can combine two score values to determine most
Possible option.In some instances, flow manager 132 show that no option is conclusion possible enough, and system 100 is returned
Return to attempt to clearly require the meaning that people illustrate them.
General knowledge module 133 can use the data of the callee for carrying out self similarity to select most probable option.For example, such as
Most of bar in fruit Philadelphia is from 8 points at night to 2:00 AM business, then general knowledge module 133 can determine fuzzy phrase " we ' re
Open from 10to 2 (we open at 2 points from 10 points) " most probable option is that speaker means at 10 points at night
To 2:00 AM.In some instances, general knowledge module 133 can indicate to need further to illustrate to flow manager 132.For example,
If the working time of most of post offices in state of Michigan Jackson city be at 10 points in the morning at 5 points in afternoon, if system 100 thinks
Callee replies that their time is " 2 pm to 6 pm ", and this is the threshold quantities different from typical post office, general knowledge
Module 133 can indicate that the requirement of flow manager 132 illustrates.
Sometimes, there is the pressure of accumulation during calling, be often as high ambient noise, again abnormal scene, accent or only
It is the mistake in code.Pressure is also likely to be caused by unexpected be intended to.For example, when phoning dining room, system may
Run into unexpected sentence：“so,do you want to make a presentation(so you want to demonstrate
) " or " (we do not have we don ' t have a TV to show the Super Bowl, just so you know.
TV shows Super Bowl, what you knew) ".System should handle the intention not run into before it.In order to identify either one
Problematic situation, robot program attempt the amount of the pressure shown during quantization calling.Apply help module 136 can be with simulation monitoring
The operator of calling, and choose when to implement to intervene manually.
Operator control unit 134 is communicatively connected to flow manager 132, and operator control unit 134 allows the mankind
Operator directly provides instruction to flow manager 132.In some instances, once calling is sent to human operator who to locate
Flow manager 132 is placed in holding pattern or pause or closes flow manager 132 by reason, operator control unit 134.
Once flow manager 132 is selected in particular workflow based on the intention determined from text to intention module 130
Next node, then flow manager 132 to be intended to text module 124 provide instruction.The instruction flow manager 132 provided wraps
Include next intention that callee is sent to by communications platform 102.It is intended to text module 124 also produce reservation language synthesis
Mark prompting, such as different stress or the rhythm are defined on some words.It is intended to text module 124 to use manually
The rule or intensified learning of definition to produce new text from intention.
The output being intended to text module 124 is voice data to be converted to so as to the text exported in communications platform 102.
Text is converted into audio by text to language module 118, and text to language module 118 is defeated to language using previously stored text
Go out and read 122.Text can select previously stored output to language module 118 from output/reading 122 of storage.
In some embodiments, system will use text to language synthesizer during calling.If for example, used by flow manager 132
In the common response to be supplied selected for robot program be " Great, thank you for your help！(it is very good,
Thank to your help！) ", text to the text that language module 118 can select to be previously generated to language is exported without transporting
The output is generated during row.In some instances, text passes through network to language module 118 using similar to language API 128
The third party API of connected reference.
As described above, in some examples, user can be tied by the search (for example, Web search) with being supplied to user
Fruit interaction carrys out the task of activation system 100.For example, user can search " book a table for two tonight at a
Michelin starred restaurant (tonight is that two people subscribe desk in Michelin's star dining room) ".Task manager mould
Block 140 can receive task and mission bit stream is stored in mission bit stream storage 150.Then, task manager module 140 can
To determine when arranged task and set trigger event.For example, if user asks in advance before Michelin's asterisk dining room opens
Desk is ordered, then task manager module 140 can determine when dining room opens and set the trigger event of the time.If task
Manager module 140 is known due to trigger event and has delay in processes, then task manager module 140 can pass through offer
Vision, audio or other instructions postpone to alert user.In some embodiments, task manager module 140 can provide
On completing the time of required by task, when scheduling being started to the information of the task, or provide on why task is delayed by
More information.
Trigger module 110 can detect that specific trigger event (in this example, the open hour in dining room) has been sent out
It is raw, and indicate the place calls of dialer 106.In some instances, the selection meal to be called can be presented in system 100 to user
The option in the Room.In other examples, system 100 can automatically be dialed to the particular restaurant selected by feature based set and exhaled
Cry.User can be defined for the default preferences for particular task place calls.For example, user can be answered with appointing system 100
The selection calls with the immediate dining room of user's present position, or system 100 should select the dining room that highest is evaluated
To call.
In some examples, system 100 includes or forms a part for communications applications or is configured to communicate with communications applications,
Communications applications such as message transmission or chat app, including user interface, user are provided to assisting task by boundary's system-oriented

System 100 can be based on the dialogue just carried out context or on the specific called in knowledge data base memory storage
The data of person select some parameters of robot program.For example, system 100 can the accent based on callee, position and
Other context datas are more comfortable to determine the callee language different to the language using the calling from currently carrying out.System
Then the robot program can be switched to thinks the more comfortable language of the callee to system 100, and inquires the called
Person he or she whether prefer to be called with new language.By reflecting some language characteristics of the mankind callee, it is
System 100 adds the probability of successful call.System 100 reduces due to potential sources of friction of the language characteristic in dialogue to reduce
The pressure accumulated during calling.These characteristics can include the average length, the complexity of sentence structure, phrase for using word
Between pause length, the language said of callee's the most comfortable and various other language characteristics.
Fig. 4 is the block diagram 400 of the calling trigger module of system 100.Trigger module 110 is communicatively connected to dialer
106, and dialer 106 is provided instructions to gather hair to specific callee or callee based on detection trigger event
Play calling.In some instances, trigger module 110 can communicate with flow manager 132 is used for selecting to provide flow manager 132
The trigger event data of the node of particular workflow provides instructions to dialer 106.
Trigger module 110 is received from modules and inputted, and the module includes inconsistency detector 402, third party API
404th, trend-monitoring device 406 and event recognizer 408.Trigger module 110 can also be received from flow manager 132 and inputted.One
In a little examples, each in module 402-408 is integrated with system 100.In other examples, one in module 402-408
Or multiple remote systems 100, and pass through network connection to trigger module 110, the network such as LAN (LAN), wide area
Net (WAN), internet or its combination.One or more of module 402-408 can be connected to trigger module by network, and
Can between the component of promotion system 100 (for example, in language API 128 and language between text module 126) communication.
Inconsistency detector 402 is from multiple not homologous reception data and detects in the data value from the first data source
Inconsistency between the corresponding data value from the second source.For example, inconsistency detector 402 can receive instruction clinic
Business hours data and detect the clinic listed on the website of the clinic business hours be different from the clinic
Business hours for putting up of outside.Inconsistency detector 402 can will indicate the source of arguement, detect the data of inconsistency
Type, the data value of conflict and the data of various other characteristics of value are supplied to trigger module 110.In some instances, differ
Cause property detector 402 is provided to trigger module 110 to initiate the instruction of calling to specific callee.In other examples,
The specific callee and treat that igniter module 110 to be contacted based on the data determination that never consistency detector 402 receives
The field for the data collected from the specific callee.
Trigger module 110 can be based on the Data Detection trigger event provided by inconsistency detector 402.Trigger event
The user's input for receiving instruction contradiction can be included.For example, trigger module 110 can be defeated by the reception user of user interface 410
Enter.User interface 410 can be used alone or the interface of program.For example, user interface 410 can be search engine application or
The graphic user interface of navigation application.
In some embodiments, user interface 410 can prompt user to provide information.For example, user is detected
In the shop after the closing time of store advert, the system can ask whether the user shop also opens or allow the user
Input the business hours.The user can input asked data, and inconsistency detector 402 by user interface 410
Can determine in the data inputted by user interface 410 and between the second source such as corresponding data of knowledge base 412 be
It is no contradiction to be present.Knowledge base 412 can be storage medium, such as remote storage device, home server or any various other
The storage medium of type.Inconsistency detector 402 can determine whether the user is advance true beyond normal business hours
In the shop (for example, more than 20 minutes, because shop, which may be slow customer, keeps some volumes of opening for business in fixed time quantum
Outer minute).
Under another example scenario, inconsistency detector 402 can determine that the information of the website on tissue is
It is no out-of-date.For example, inconsistency detector 402 can be based on the Data Detection from knowledge data base 412 to Bass
The website of club shows there is monthly meeting on first Wednesday monthly, but the more active social media of the club
Profile all indicates that monthly meeting occurred on second Tuesday monthly.Inconsistency detector 402 then can be to trigger mode
The data of the output indication of block 110 inconsistency detected.
Trigger event can include determining that the specific collection of data is not yet updated in predetermined time amount.For example, system
100 user can be measured with specified time, no matter any other trigger event occurs after the time quantum, data should all be brushed
Newly.Inconsistency detector can compare the timestamp of the final updating of particular data value, and be determined in advance based on the timestamp
Whether fixed time quantum passes by.The feature of particular data word section including timestamp and data value in itself, which can be stored in, to be known
Know in database 412.Timer 414 can provide the time quantum that data have passed to update to knowledge data base 412.Differ
Cause property detector 402 can determine predetermined amount of time of having passed based on the timing data provided by timer 414.
For example, inconsistency detector 402 can determine New York Ithaca based on the data from knowledge data base 412
Business hours of bistro do not updated also in three months.Then, inconsistency detector 402 can be to trigger module
110 provide the output data of the detected event of instruction.
Trigger event can include receiving the request to initiating calling from one or more users.For example, trigger module 110
Request from user can be detected by third party API 404.Third party API 404 is communicatively connected to such as user circle
The user interface in face 416, user can provide request of the instruction to initiating to call by the user interface.For example, user interface
416 can be the graphic user interface of application, and user can ask to be exhaled with what is performed by scheduling by the graphic user interface
Cry activity.User can provide the data for indicating the set of specific callee or callee, and be requested for carrying
The specific data taken.For example, user can ask to call the hardware store of the every sale livestock goods and materials in Virginia
Activity, and inquire the hardware store whether provide chicken feeder (chick starter feed) (such as so that belongings provide
Position index it is available to search later).
During calling, callee can be the scheduling of the system 100 different time to carry out callback to callee.Example
Such as, if whether the menu for being asked dining room has any change, mankind callee can require that system 100 is organic at them
It can watch after new menu, within a hour or next day carries out callback to them, for further operation.Then, it is
100 callings that can be to the time asked of uniting carry out scheduling.In some instances, trigger module 110 can touch to future
Hair event carries out scheduling.In other examples, flow manager 132 will can be performed with scheduling by dialer 106 to initiate calling
Intention or call event.
Trigger event, which can be included in the data stored in knowledge data base or the data provided in real time, to be detected
Trend or pattern.For example, the trend detected in the search data received from search engine 418 can be trigger event.Search
Index holds up 418 and receives searching request from user, and the data of instruction searching request can be provided to trend-monitoring device 406.Become
Gesture detector 406 analyzes received data and detects trend in received data.If for example, to North Carolina
The search in Cuba restaurant of state Asheville received added 500% in one middle of the month of past, then trend-monitoring device 406 can detect
To the increase of search, and to trigger module 110 provide instruction trend data.
Trend-monitoring device 406 can will indicate the collection of specific callee or callee based on the trend recognized
The data output of conjunction is to trigger module 110.In some embodiments, trend-monitoring device 406 provides becoming detected by instruction
The data of gesture, and trigger module 110 determines the set of specific callee or callee based on the trend recognized.
For example, trend-monitoring device 406 can determine to have added 40% for the search of " cyclone of Nebraska State Lincoln ",
And the keyword of search is supplied to trigger module 110.Then, trigger module 110 can be with it is determined that to providing emergent thing
All shop place calls of money, to find out how many stock's necessity of each shop, and its business hours (for example, being used for rope
Draw the search later with the user of search engine).
Trigger event can include being identified as on the influential specific sense of the normal operation tool of businessman, tissue, individual etc.
Interesting event.Event recognizer 408 receives from the various third party sources including third party database 420 and event database 422
Data.Event recognizer 408 can receive data from such as other of local memory device or real-time stream source.Event is known
Other device 408 identifies the particular event from database 420 and 422, and by the data output for indicating identified event to triggering
Module 110.In some instances, trigger module 110 selects specific callee based on the data provided by event recognizer 408
Or set and the data that will be asked during calling of callee.
Can influence businessman, organizations and individuals operation particular event include extreme weather conditions, federal vacation, religion
Vacation, competitive sports and various other events.
Third party database 420 provides the data from various third party's data sources, including meteorology to event recognizer 408
Service, government's alarm etc..For example, third party database 420 can provide storm warning to trend identifier 408.Event recognition
Then device 408 can determine winter storm close to the northeast corner of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and can determine
Hardware store's place calls of Minneapolis northeast corner should be determined with the on-hand inventory of available generator.
Event database 422 provides the data from various data sources to event recognizer 408, and specifically includes instruction
The data of known event.For example, event database 422 can provide instruction federal and state vacation, church festival, parade, physical culture
Race, exhibition is open, accesses the data of political VIP and various other events.
For example, if Super Bowl is sponsored in town, event database 422 can carry to event recognizer 408
For data, the data for indicating the event are supplied to trigger module 110 by event recognizer 408.Trigger module 110 can be based on closing
In the Given information of current super bowl and storage information on past Super Bowl, it is determined that being dialled to all hotels of this area
Snore and cry to confirm availability and price.Trigger module 110 can be with it is determined that to sporting goods shop's place calls with true
Surely the availability of the football shirt of each team of Super Bowl is participated in.In this case, the shadow that igniter module 110 can ask
Ringing the other information of the operation of businessman, tissue or individual includes：The closing of office building and school, public transport scheduling change,
Special dining room supply or various other information.
One or more of modules of system 100 can be based on the event letter received from event recognizer 408
The information for ceasing to determine inferred trigger event or to be asked.If for example, when meet the Festival for the Dead (D í a de Muertos),
South America dining room particularly Mexico dining room may have special menu or business hours because of celebration.Show such
In example, when trigger module 110 can provide instruction to be called South America restaurant the business to update the same day to dialer 106
Between and menu.
In some embodiments, trigger event can be detected from system 100 call placed itself.Workflow manager
The part of 132 sessions that can be carried out based on system 100 should place calls to determine to have expressed suggestion in ession for telecommunication

Thursday,but next week we will be switching over to our summer schedule,and
we will be open until 9:30p.m. (yes, we or business of each Thursday to 8 points of evening, but next week we
Our day-light saving time table will be switched to, business is arrived evening 9 by us:30) " and then traffic manager 132 can be identified and is provided with
Close the intention of the further information of data field.
In some embodiments, trigger event can include receiving unsatisfactory knot from previous call placed
Fruit.If for example, robot program to businessman's place calls to determine whether the businessman has special holiday in vacation Independence Day
Business hours, and the confidence level of the accuracy to representing the answer provided by the mankind of the businessman is not reaching at least threshold value
Amount, then system 100 can be called with another specific date of scheduling or time, such as July 1, to determine whether to have spy
Different business hours holiday.In such an example, trigger module 110 can be with scheduling trigger event or to workflow manager 132
Information is provided to act with scheduling.In some instances, flow manager 132 is transmitted to arrange by instruction of the scheduling to dialer 106
Cheng Faqi callbacks.
System 100 has general knowledge module 133, and it allows flow manager 132 intelligently scheduling and selection particular workflow
Node.For example, in these cases, when existing during calling just in the deadline date of the serviceability of requested information,
General knowledge module 133 can further determine when scheduling calling and ask which information.In some instances, general knowledge module 133 is
The component of flow manager 132, as shown in Figure 1.In other examples, general knowledge module 133 is the component of trigger module 110, and
It is easy to trigger module 110 to be made regarding whether initiate the intelligence determination of calling.
Fig. 5 shows the instantiation procedure 500 for initiating call.In brief, process 500 can include：By with
Engaged in the dialogue in place calls and during calling between the robot program and mankind callee of calling system
Calling system calling trigger module come receive instruction the first event data (502), pass through the calling trigger mode
Block simultaneously determines that first event is the institute that triggering starts from initiating call using the data for indicating first event
The trigger event (504) of the workflow of calling system is stated, particular workflow is selected based on identified trigger event
(506), and in response to the selection initiate to the call of the callee specified by the particular workflow
(508)。
Process 500 can include by for place calls and during calling in the robot program of calling system
The calling trigger module of the calling system to be engaged in the dialogue between mankind callee come receive instruction the first event number
According to (502).For example, trigger module 110 never can receive data by consistency detector 402, the data are indicated in shop website
The business hours of the Sa Li candies car (Sally ' s Saloon of Sweets) of upper issue are related with the businessman to being stored in
The difference between business hours in search index.
Process 500 can include determining first event using the data of the first event of instruction by calling trigger module
It is trigger event, the trigger event triggers the workflow (504) for the calling system for starting from call.Show at some
Example in, identified trigger event be the value associated with the first data source and the respective value associated with the second data source not
Uniformity.For example, trigger module 110 can use the inconsistency detected from inconsistency detector 402 to determine
The inconsistency is trigger event, and it is by triggering workflow to determine the actual business hours of Sa Li candy cars.
In some instances, indicate that the data of the first event are provided by user.For example, user can report Sa Li candy cars
Had differences between the time issued on website and the time of Sa Li candy cars StoreFront issue.
In some instances, identified trigger event is user's request.For example, user can be (all by user interface
Such as user interface 416) to such as third party API 404 third party API provide input, with ask scheduling and perform to specific quilt
The calling of the set of caller or specific callee.
In some instances, identified trigger event is the certain types of event of one below：Weather events, physical culture
Race, entertainment event or seasonal event.For example, event recognizer 408 can determine Charles River's yachting Zheng Ma Sazhu
Fill in state Boston to occur, and event data can be provided to trigger module 110.Then, igniter module 110 can determine this
Yachting is trigger event.
In some instances, identified trigger event is becoming of being detected in the searching request for submit to search engine
Gesture.For example, trend-monitoring device 406 can receive search engine data from search engine 418 and determine Spain's snack dining room just
In trending.Trend-monitoring device 406 can provide the data for indicating the trend to trigger module 110, and trigger module 110 can
To determine that the trend is trigger event.
In some instances, identified trigger event is passage predetermined amount of time.For example, inconsistency detector 402
It can determine that the menu in the Cuba restaurant of New York Manhattan exists based on the data come in the knowledge data base 412 of self-timer 414
It is not updated also in four months.Timing data can be supplied to igniter module 110 by inconsistency detector 402, and
Can determine the to have passed menu data in four months Cuba restaurants without updating Manhattan of igniter module 110 is triggering thing
Part.Then, igniter module 110 can be updated to the Cuba restaurant of the offer suggestion calling of flow manager 132 Manhattan
Menu information data.
Process 500 can include selecting particular workflow (506) based on identified trigger event.Trigger module 110
Trigger event data can be provided to dialer 106 or flow manager 132, for the section of selection particular workflow or workflow
Point.For example, trigger module 110 can provide the business hours issued of instruction Sa Li candy cars to flow manager 132 not
The trigger event data of uniformity, flow manager 132 select particular workflow to call Sa Li candies car to solve using the data
The certainly difference.
Process 500 can include the call initiated in response to selection to the callee specified by particular workflow
(508).The instruction of the specific callee contacted can be supplied to dialer 106 by instruction by flow manager 132.For example,
Flow manager 132 can provide instructions to dialer 106 to call Sally hairdressing place (Saloon).
In initiation of the system and method as described herein to workflow --- in particular to the distribution of calling --- can be with
During by trigger event and relative automate, safeguard measure can be included within system 100 to prevent from violating local rule not
Desired calling.For example, if callee indicates that they are no longer desire to receive the calling from system, system can be to this
Recorded and prevent from further calling for the call setup inspection of the number to callee.
In addition, in the case where system and method as described herein collect data, storing or using can be with before data
The data are handled in one or more ways so that the recognizable information of individual is removed or is permanently blurred.Example
Such as, the identity of callee can forever be removed or it is processed not can determine that it is personal can recognize that information, or can be from
It obtains the geographical position of the callee of positional information can be extensive so that not can determine that user's in appropriate circumstances
Ad-hoc location.Wherein, received during calling individual, privacy or in the case of sensitive information, no matter the information make
For workflow part it is requested, callee voluntarily provides, is still not inadvertently received, workflow can include being used for pair
The information from system permanently remove or fuzzy step.
In some examples, system 100 can provide the user current effort shape automatically or after user's request
State is to perform the request to nonproductive task.For example, system 100 (such as computer, can be moved by the equipment that user is used
Dynamic equipment etc.) on notice provide the user the state that task is carried out.In some instances, system 100 can pass through other
Device (message transmission is applied, by telephone communication etc.) notifies the state of the ongoing task of user.
Fig. 6 is the block diagram 600 of the task manager module of system 100.It is flat that task manager module 140 is connected to communication
Platform 102, trigger module 110, mission bit stream storage 150 and session storage 116.When user transmits task by communications platform
When, mission bit stream is stored in mission bit stream storage 150 and task manager module 140 determines when the task should be by
Scheduling.Task manager can be associated with trigger event by task.Task can have be initially set to " new " state or
In the absence of some other designators of the processing to request.Once trigger event occurs, trigger module 110 will start to dial
Journey.In some embodiments, the monitored session of task manager module 140 storage is changed into the state in task from initialization
In progress, when changing into completion, the state of each task is updated.
By session information, task manager module can determine the state and result each called.For example, robot journey
Sequence can attempt repeatedly calling dining room in closing of the circuit to someone before making reservation.Session storage is kept and robot journey
The relevant information of each calling that sequence is made.In some embodiments, meeting can be periodically polled in task manager module
Words storage is to determine the state of calling task, i.e. whether calling be initialised, underway has still completed.In other realities
Apply in mode, the result of calling can be sent to task manager module so as in the storage of more new task information by session storage
The state of task.
In some embodiments, operator is by showing the operation of calling task and the information relevant with the carry out of task
Person's control panel checks calling.
Fig. 7 A show operator's control panel of the information relevant with the carry out of existing call task.For example, Fig. 7 is shown
The task of hair appointment.Operator's control panel can be provided with the reservation including the following for information about：Ticket reserving time, ask
The name for the person of asking, the service asked, Business Name, date and subscription time.Operator can by with ask phase
Whether request and associated session information are checked in the calling of association, to determine asked reservation by correctly pre-
Order.
The operator of one that Fig. 7 B are illustrated in being asked for checking user for task checks screen.Screen can be
Operator shows the current state of task.As illustrated in Fig. 7 B, due to having made reservation, task is completed.However, one
In the case of a little, task may not be completed and preengage not make also.Operator can have following option：Play with
The associated record of task or apparently from other information stored of calling (for example, transcription, intention for being extracted etc.), calling
The businessman associated with task or the automatic calling to future carry out scheduling.Additionally, operator can have working as task
Preceding state is supplied to the option of the user made requests on.
User can also pass through the state of the request task of communications platform 102.Additionally or alternatively, task manager module
140, which can be based on other trigger events (such as task status changes or time), determines when to send state renewal to user.
Fig. 8 is the flow chart of the example for the process 800 for showing the state for providing task.Process 800 can include by
Task manager module determines that trigger event is had occurred and that to provide the current state of user's call request (802).As described above,
Trigger event can include：User's request, the passage of some time quantum or the change of particular task state to state.Connect
, process 800 includes the current state (804) that user's call request is determined by task manager module.Task manager module
Current state can be determined by checking the state in mission bit stream storage.When task is added to mission bit stream storage 150
When, the state of task is initialised.When the calling associated with task is made and is completed, the state of task is updated.Connect
, the expression (806) of the current state of task manager generation user's call request.Expression can be the current shape of reception and registration task
State vision or audio representation.Process 800 provides the user the expression of the current state of generated user's call request
(808)。
Fig. 9 A show the visual state of Figure 1B hair appointment request when preengaging scheduling and carrying out.User can energy
User interface is enough accessed to check the state of task requests or user equipment (such as smart phone, intelligent hand can be sent to
Table, laptop computer, personal family assistant devices or other electronic equipments) state.State can by Email,
SMS or other mechanism are sent.
Fig. 9 B show the visual state that the hair appointment of Figure 1B when preengaging by success scheduling is asked.The state
It can be requested by a user, or once preengage and use is sent in the case where no user prompts by successful reservation can
Family.
Figure 10 A illustrate the renewal of oral status request and Fig. 1 C dining room reserve requests.As shown in FIG. 10A, respond
In user's query dining room, whether reservation has been made, and system can explain the step of it is had taken up to complete task, such as exhale
Cry dining room twice.System can also tell the next subsystem of user by scheduling with the time of call try, and can lead to user
Know the state after call attempt.
Figure 10 B illustrate the mouth that system is provided for Fig. 1 C dining room reserve requests in the case where no user prompts
Head status updates.Once system knows that the task of user has been completed, system can provide the user state renewal.In some realities
Apply in mode, system provides the user state renewal at once.In other embodiments, system determines convenient time and method
To notify user.For example, user can ask the dinner of London to be preengage.However, user can currently be positioned in the U.S.
In the mountain scene city in California.System can when user sleeps call try dining room.If system confirms
The reservation of London 12 noon, system can determine that 4 points of transmission state renewal text messages may make user wake up in the PDT mornings
Come.Then, system can select alternative state updating method, i.e. Email, or be maintained at the more easily time and user is entered
Row state updates.System can use the schedule from user, time zone, the information of custom or other personal information of user to determine
Appropriate convenient time and method, to provide a user state renewal.
In some embodiments, system can be determined the urgency of task or whether be repeated effort using user profile
To complete task.For example, the particular restaurant that system can be try to for user in the mountain scene city in California make it is pre-
About.User may be to end of day in May 15 to the journey in mountain scene city.If system does not still succeed on the 15th in may, that
It is exactly irrational that system, which is further continued for asking the reservation after May 16 or the End Of Tour of user,.However, in order to
Obtain dining room someone make reservation, then to call within 14th twice of number in may with several days earlier compared be reasonable
's.As the deadline close to task can become more urgent, and can become with the past task of deadline
It is less urgent or out-of-date.
In some embodiments, Figure 1B apply help module 136 determine when call it is in progress when should be directed to calling
The type of the intervention of introducing.Apply to help module 136 and can select in real time to talk with robot program and carry out artificial apply and help and explain it
Other people will take over calling.In other embodiments, the module can allow human operator to take over calling dumbly.It is additional
Ground or as an alternative, apply and help module 136 and can select politely to terminate robot program and people in the case of no manual intervention
Call between class.
Figure 11 is shown for the instantiation procedure 1100 by call from robot Program transformation to the mankind.Process 1100
It can be included between the robot program on the second end of first mankind in the first end of call and call
During call, the actual conversation (1102) between first mankind and robot program is analyzed by initial system.Then, call
Initial system can determine whether call should be switched to electricity from robot program based on the analysis to actual conversation
Talk about second mankind (1104) on the second end of calling.In response to determining that call should be switched to the second of call
Second mankind on end, by calling initial system by call from robot Program transformation to second mankind (1106).
In order to determine the type for the specific most suitable intervention of robot program's call, apply help module 136 can
Other instructions of human operator should be terminated or be switched to identify pressure events or find calling.
In some embodiments, apply and help pressure of the identification instruction of module 136 on the mankind or on robot program with suitable
The problem of locality is in response to the mankind.Apply every time and help the identification pressure events of module 136, it can all increase the local pressure of the calling of storage
The level of both power and global pressure.Whenever dialogue is as when returning track, applying and helping module 136 and reset local press water
It is flat.For example, thinking that reservation is made in the party of 6 people when robot program has called dining room, the mankind can ask robot program
“How many highchairs will your party need(your party needs how many high chair)”.Robot journey
Sequence can be responded with " we all need chairs. (we are required for chair) ".Sound of the mankind based on robot program
A little angry tone and reply " Yes, I know you all need chairs, but how many high should be carried
chairs for babies do you need(it is that I knows that you are required for chair, but you need how many to be used for baby
The high chair of youngster)”.System can detect intonation pattern, i.e. the mankind state beginning, statement end at or the height through statement
Sound.In some embodiments, intonation pattern in advance with pressure and angry associated.System can by the pattern associated in advance with
The pattern match detected in actual conversation.In some embodiments, intonation pattern can detect the word of repetition, speech has
Meaning slows down or keyword or phrase (" are you even listening to me(you are on earth either with or without listening me
Say)”“am I talking to a robot(I is spoken with robot)”).
When system detectio to the mankind is when having a little angry tone, it increases the local stress level of calling.Local pressure
Power is to reflect the operation score value of the possible amount of pressure associated with current state.If mankind's statement in actual conversation
Middle any pressure designator occur, then pressure score value is raised until the score value reaches intervention threshold.If there is not pressure
Designator, then system can according to workflow indicate calling continue, and this ground pressure score value reduce or keep it is low (or
Zero).If robot program suitably responds (such as, " We by providing the desired response of the mankind to problem
Not have no children in our party, (not having child in our party) "), then system can reduce local pressure
Power.If the system detects that without angry in his or her speech when the mankind respond, then apply and help module and can determine to exhale
Cry and return track and this ground pressure is reset to defaults or reset to zero.
The global pressure of call can only accumulate rise.This ground pressure attempts to assess the current contact with the mankind
(correspondence) whether pressure is carried, and global pressure attempts to evaluate the gross pressure entirely called.For example, can be by threshold
Value be arranged to robot program apply help go to human operator who before have and misread three times.If robot program does not have continuously three times
The Rational Solutions mankind, then this ground pressure will be high and can cause robot program is applied to help.In different callings, if machine
People's program does not understand other side twice in succession, but understanding of the 3rd really, then this ground pressure will be reset in the 3rd interaction, and
And it is likely to continue the dialogue.Global pressure will remain in that to exist between instruction robot program and the mankind to be misread twice
Information.It is if the time later during the call, robot program do not understand the mankind twice in succession again, then global to press
Power level is up to more than threshold value and robot program is likely to be applied and helped, although this ground pressure is still set three
Below the threshold value of secondary misunderstanding.
It is as discussed above, if any in local stress level or global stress level reach certain threshold value, apply and help module
136 will indicate manual intervention to system 100 or politely exit the calling.In some instances, whenever help when applying
Module 136 needs to repeat itself, apology, request illustrate etc. and when mankind's correcting system 100 or complain the calling (such as " I
can't hear you,can you hear me(I can't hear you, and can you hear me) ") when event can be considered as pressure
Event.
In some instances, if the mankind inquire whether robot program is robot, pokes fun at robot program etc. ---
I.e. by inquire the problem of absurd or with system it is not anticipated that some other modes action (such as system is attempting to make
Competitive sports are asked about when subscribing in dining room), then apply and help module 136 and event can be considered as pressure events.
In some embodiments, the regular collection for helping that module 136 is feature based is applied, when its determination system should be applied
Help and go to manual intervention.The rule of one feature based can be statement when two continuous Unknown worms are intended to current systems
The rule helped should be applied.One different rule can be stated when four Unknown worms intentions occurs in any place during call
System, which is applied to help, goes to human operator.System, which tracks the event occurred in dialogue and determines whether to have occurred and that, meets rule
The event of criterion.
In other embodiments, apply and help module 136 and go to the mankind using machine learning to predict when automatically to apply to help
Operator.Intention can be received from the dialogue with the mankind as to one or more machine learning moulds for example, applying and helping module 136
The input of type.Machine learning model can be intended to go to determine whether to apply to help with result based on the intention received and history
Human operator who.System can help the feature for annotating record that when should occur or occur without to train on being applied from sign
Machine learning model.Then, machine learning model can predict to apply to help when very may be used in the case where providing input feature vector set
Should can occur.
Apply and help module 136 and helped using many factors to determine to apply, the factor includes：The manner of the mankind, the tone of the mankind,
The identified angry horizontal, language that the mankind use of the mankind or the word selection of the mankind.
System 100 can step up the dialogue just implemented by robot program to human operator who to handle.For example,
If the pressure of threshold quantity in certain dialog be present, apply help module 136 can to flow manager 132 provide feedback data.
Flow manager 132 can be with or without audibly warned to mankind callee in the case of instruct robot program will converse
It is forwarded to the human operator who that input is provided by operator control unit 134.For example, robot program can say " Sure,
Thank you for your time today.Here is my supervisor. (certainly, thank you to send a telegram here today, this is
My supervisor.)”.Then, human operator who can complete times that robot program attempts to perform by operator control unit 134
Business.
Apply and help module 136 and also can determine level of confidence, have which defines system in the current task being just done
Some execution degree.Subscribed for example, robot program may be connected to task to make dining for user.If robot program calls
Dining room and the mankind have inquired multiple problems that the robot program does not know the answer, then system is in the current task completed
In can have low confidence.Received in system after the system do not have the problem of answer, system is in the task is completed
Level of confidence may become lower.If system reset and system determine that dialogue is just advanced towards the task of completion, it is
System can raise level of confidence.
In some embodiments, system switches to telephone conversation the human operator who of monitoring calling.System can make
Forward call is needed to call to operator's warning with operator's user interface or some other informing mechanisms.It once is notified,
Operator can have the limited time come the call of transferring before system determines to terminate the calling.System can use
With operator's identical speech.In this case, the switching from robot program to operator can be for opposite side
Transparent, because speech keeps identical.
In another embodiment, system switches to telephone conversation the human user for asking the task.System can be to
The user is warned in progress to call.When completing the task and problem being present or when robot program is asked the robot
During the problem of program does not know the answer, system can know the user.Robot program can with text, Email or
Carry out the details for the dialogue that transfer robot program needs user to input in some other manner.In some embodiments, machine
People's program will wait threshold amount of time --- responded for user before the dialogue is continued without user's input within i.e. 5 seconds.
Occurring in real time due to the dialogue, thus robot program can not long period wait user response.In some implementations
In mode, when system has determined that call needs to walk from robot program switching, system can attempt to call
It is forwarded to the user for making request.As discussed above, system can wait threshold amount of time so that user is responded and is taken over
Call.In some embodiments, if user does not take over call in threshold amount of time, system will be to behaviour
Transferred the call as member.In other instances, system will terminate the telephone conversation.System can also use and human user
Identical speech so that switching of the opposite side from robot program to user for dialogue is seamless.
