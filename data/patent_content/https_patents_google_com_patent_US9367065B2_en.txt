Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself
- autonomous vehicles are equipped with various types of sensors in order to detect objects in the surroundings.

- sensors provide data that is processed by the computer in real-time, that is, the sensors may continuously update their output to reflect the environment being sensed at or over a range of time, and continuously or as-demanded provide that updated output to the computer so that the computer can determine whether the vehicle's then-current direction or speed should be modified in response to the sensed environment.
- data 134 may include detailed map information 136 , e.g., highly detailed maps identifying the shape and elevation of roadways, lane lines, intersections, crosswalks, speed limits, traffic signals, buildings, signs, real time traffic information, vegetation, or other such objects and information.
- map information may include explicit speed limit information associated with various roadway segments.
- the speed limit data may be entered manually or scanned from previously taken images of a speed limit sign using, for example, optical-character recognition.
- the map information may include three-dimensional terrain maps incorporating one or more of objects listed above.
- the vehicle may determine that another car is expected to turn based on real-time data (e.g., using its sensors to determine the current GPS position of another car) and other data (e.g., comparing the GPS position with previously-stored lane-specific map data to determine whether the other car is within a turn lane).
- FIG. 5 is an example of map information 500 for a portion of a roadway including an intersection 510 .
- intersection 510 is a four-way stop, though map information 136 may include any number of different roadway arrangements, combinations, and/or features as noted above.
- the map information includes lanes 520 - 527 defined by lane lines 530 - 533 and 540 - 547 .
- the map information may also include details regarding the shape and location of cross walks 550 - 553 .
- the map information 500 may also include features such as sidewalks 560 - 563 , structures 570 - 573 , and vegetation (such as trees) 580 - 582 .
- Structures 570 - 573 may include various types of structures.
- structures 570 and 571 may include buildings such as a garage, shop, home, office, etc.
- structure 572 may include a wall feature.
- the map information 136 need not be entirely image based (for example, raster).
- the map information may include one or more roadgraphs or graph networks of information such as roads, lanes, intersections, and the connections between these features.
- Each feature may be stored as graph data and may be associated with information such as a geographic location and whether or not it is linked to other related features.
- a stop sign may be linked to a road and an intersection.
- the associated data may include grid-based indices of a roadgraph to allow for efficient lookup of certain roadgraph features.
- the detailed map information may also be encoded with information regarding the probability of detecting objects in various areas.
- Map information 600 of FIG. 600 is an example of such map information.
- the map may note that wall 572 is opaque to the laser or radar, and thus, the map information 600 may include an area 610 associated with an annotation indicating that the probability of detecting something behind the wall 572 (or on the opposite side of the wall as the vehicle's sensors) is zero.
- the map information 600 may indicate that wall 572 is 3 feet high.
- the annotation for area 610 may note that for that area, there is a higher confidence of seeing an object taller than three feet and a lower confidence of seeing an object which is shorter than three feet.
- objects defined in the detailed map information such as vegetation, buildings, walls, monuments, signs, towers, and other structures or objects may each be associated with a probability of the vehicle being able to detect another object of a particular size or shape on the opposite side of that structure as the vehicle's sensors.
- Computer 110 may also receive or transfer information to and from other computers.
- the map information stored by computer 110 (such as the examples shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 ) may be received or transferred from other computers and/or the sensor data collected from the sensors of vehicle 101 may be transferred to another computer for processing as described herein.
- data from computer 110 may be transmitted via a network to computer 720 for further processing.
- the network, and intervening nodes may comprise various configurations and protocols including the Internet, World Wide Web, intranets, virtual private networks, wide area networks, local networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, Ethernet, WiFi and HTTP, and various combinations of the foregoing.
- Such communication may be facilitated by any device capable of transmitting data to and from other computers, such as modems and wireless interfaces.
- data may be transferred by storing it on memory which may be accessed by or connected to computers 110 and 720 .
- computer 720 may comprise a server having a plurality of computers, e.g., a load balanced server farm, that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting the data from computer 110 .
- the server may be configured similarly to the computer 110 , with a processor 730 , memory 740 , instructions 750 , and data 760 .
- data 760 of server 720 may include provide weather related information.
- server 720 may receive, monitor, store, update, and transmit various information related to weather.
- This information may include, for example, precipitation, cloud, and/or temperature information in the form of reports, radar information, forecasts, etc.
- the computer 110 may generate a 3D model how each of the vehicle's different sensors are currently able to see observing the vehicle's environment. This may include, for example, what areas the sensors are able to see if the sensor's field of view were completely unobstructed by objects, rather than what objects and features the sensors are currently seeing. These models may be based on each individual sensor's field of view given that sensor's location and orientation relative the vehicle. This information may be pre-determined, for example using a general calibration step, before determining each of the individual sensor models.
- FIGS. 8A and 8B include the components of an individual 3D model 800 for sensor 311 .
- the model 800 for laser 311 may include the dimensions of 2D sensor field 411 shown in FIG. 8A (same as FIG. 4B ) as well as a third, vertical dimension 811 shown in FIG. 8B .
- a combination of these components 411 and 811 ) may be used to generate a 3D model 800 for laser 311 .
- Similar models may therefore also be generated for each of the sensors of the object detection component 148 .
- the individual sensor models may include probabilistic data which describes the confidence of detecting objects at various points or areas within a given sensor field.
- a particular model may include information indicating the confidence of detecting objects within a given sensor field.
- one model may have a higher confidence of detecting objects in the middle of a sensor field or within some distance of the sensor and a lower confidence at the outer edges of that sensor field.
- FIGS. 9A and 9B are examples of the components of a 3D model 900 for laser 311 having probabilistic data.
- the shading of the components of the 3D model 900 is shown as darker at areas closer to laser 311 where the confidence of detecting an object is likely to be higher and lighter at areas further from laser 311 where the confidence of detecting an object is likely to be lower.
- the models with probabilistic data may include very detailed information about the size and shape of objects that are likely to be detected at particular locations within the models.
- the probabilistic data may describe an area where the sensor is 60% likely to see another vehicle, 20% to see a small non-metallic object, etc.
- This initial modeling of individual sensors may also include leveraging information about the current state of the weather and adjusting the shape and or probability information for each individual sensor model in real time.
- weather may be detected automatically, based on data received from the sensors for that particular model or a different sensor, and/or from real time information received from a central location such as server 520 .
- computer 110 may receive weather information, either from the sensors or a central location, and use this information to adjust the shape or other characteristics of the 3D models for each of the sensors.
- a laser may be less reliable as a sensor if there is a significant amount of sun glare or precipitation.
- radar units may be less reliable when used in foggy conditions, etc.
- an example approach would be to build parameterized models of the relevant weather conditions (e.g., fog density, rain intensity, ground wetness & reflectivity, sun intensity and direction, etc). Additionally, one may, a priori, construct a model of how such weather conditions affect the different sensors (e.g., reduction in effective laser range as a function of fog density, blind spots in the laser as a function of Sun intensity and direction, etc), and apply these adapted models for computing the online field of view of the sensors.
- a model of how such weather conditions affect the different sensors e.g., reduction in effective laser range as a function of fog density, blind spots in the laser as a function of Sun intensity and direction, etc
- the individual models of all the sensors may be aggregated to compute a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) model of what areas the sensors are currently able to observe.
- This comprehensive model may be a binary map simply indicating areas where the vehicle can detect objects versus areas where the vehicle's sensors cannot detect objects. This information may already include the weather information incorporated into the individual models.
- FIG. 10 is an example of an aggregation of 2D sensor fields of the various sensors of object detection component 148 .
- FIG. 10 is shown in 2D, the actual combined model may be in 3D.
- objects located within area 1010 may be detected by the vehicle's sensors while objects located outside of area 1010 cannot be detected.
- the comprehensive 3D model may also include probability data.
- the combined model can combine the probability of detection from the individual sensor models in various ways.
- the probability for each area of the 3D model may be the greatest probability of detection as determined by processing each probabilities of each of the individual sensor models.
- the probability of detection of an object the size of a small passenger car for location 1 may be 20%.
- FIG. 11 is another example of a comprehensive 3D model 1100 based on a plurality of models for individuals sensors.
- each of the individual models may already include weather information.
- Comprehensive 3D model 1100 also includes 3 confidence regions, 1110 , 1120 , and 1130 .
- region 1110 may have a higher confidence of detecting objects (for example greater than 70%) and features in the vehicle's environment than region 1120 (between 40 and 69%).
- region 1120 may have a confidence of detecting objects and features than region 1130 (between 0 and 39%).
- Other comprehensive 3D models may include significantly more or less confidence regions, different types of confidence values, etc.
- This combined model for a plurality of sensors may also be combined with the detailed map information 136 to compute sensor occlusions and blind spots.
- the detailed map information 136 may be encoded with the probability of detecting objects. For example, using the current location of the vehicle, as determined from the vehicle's geographic position component, the computer 110 may identify a relevant portion of the detailed map information 136 and combine this information with the combined model.
- the feature of the detailed map information 136 including the probability of detecting objects, may be used to adjust the combined model.
- the result of this combination or adjustment may be a model of the vehicle's environment annotated with information describing whether various portions of the environment are occupied, unoccupied, or unobserved (cannot be detected by the sensors).
- the occupied/free data might come from a combination of real-time sensor data (e.g., model the sensor occlusions from a truck) as well as prior data (e.g., a building near an intersection would block all sensors; tall grass & trees might interfere with lasers & cameras and perhaps partially block radar; a bridge or tunnel with metallic beams might interfere with radar, leading to areas with high noise levels, which would be equivalent to blind spots).
- real-time sensor data e.g., model the sensor occlusions from a truck
- prior data e.g., a building near an intersection would block all sensors; tall grass & trees might interfere with lasers & cameras and perhaps partially block radar; a bridge or tunnel with metallic beams might interfere with radar, leading to areas with high noise levels, which would be equivalent to blind spots.
- These annotations may also include probability data as described above.
- FIG. 12 is an example of a combination of map information 600 and comprehensive 3D model 1100 .
- wall 572 occludes a portion of the 3D model 1100 as indicated by area 610 .
- comprehensive 3D model is reconfigured with new confidence regions 1210 , 1220 , and 1230 corresponding to the confidence values of confidence regions 1100 , 1120 , and 1130 , respectively.
- the computer 110 does not have to reconstruct the geometry of the environment based on sensor data, as the vehicle's computer already has an expectation of what should and shouldn't be seen in the environment.
- Another advantage of using a prior map is that the system can reason about blind spots and occlusions at longer range (before the relevant objects come into sensing range), e.g., the system might know it is approaching a blind intersection significantly earlier than the onboard sensors are able to see the objects responsible for the occlusions, which means the vehicle can modify its behavior (e.g., start to slow down) earlier and drive smoother and safer.
- the combined model and map may be used by the computer 110 to make driving decisions thereby improving safety.
- the computer may cause the vehicle to slow down if its sensing range is diminished (e.g., driving in fog), reposition the vehicle to get a better view of the world, avoid certain types of risky maneuvers (e.g., passing using the oncoming-traffic lanes) if the computer not confident enough that the sensors are detecting enough of the environment.
- Flow diagram 1300 of FIG. 13 is an example of some of the aspects described above which may be performed by computer 110 .
- computer 110 for each of a plurality of sensors of the object detection component, computer 110 generates an individual 3D model of that sensor's field of view at block 1302 .
- Weather information is received at block 1304 , for example from the sensors or from an external source, such as computer 520 .
- the weather information may include, for example, precipitation, cloud, fog density, rain intensity, ground wetness and reflectivity, sun intensity and direction and/or temperature information.
- Such weather information may be the form of reports, radar information, forecasts, real-time measurements, etc.
- the computer then adjusts one or more characteristics of the 3D models based on the received weather information at block 1306 .
- the computer aggregates the 3D models into a comprehensive 3D model at block 1308 .
- the comprehensive 3D model is then combined with detailed map information at block 1310 . As noted above, this may include determining a current location of the vehicle and using this information to select a relevant portion of the detailed map information to be combined with the comprehensive 3D model.
- the computer then computes a model of the vehicle's environment based on the combined comprehensive 3D model and detailed map information at block 1312 . This model of the vehicle's environment is then used to maneuver the vehicle at block 1314 .
