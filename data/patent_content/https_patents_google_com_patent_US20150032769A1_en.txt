FIG. 8 is a simplified schematic diagram of a computer system for implementing embodiments of the present disclosure. - Several example embodiments for systems and methods for automatically generating playlists reflecting a user's proximity in location and time and event interests will now be described. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of the specific details set forth herein.
- Users are always seeking new music, video or other media content to listen to/view or “old” or previously known music, video or other media content to enjoy to in a new way. By way of example, when a concert or other event is in town or when a user is planning to attend an event, the user will often want to hear the music, e.g., songs, authors, performers, bands, etc. scheduled to be played at the event before and after the event.
- While the following embodiments are described in terms of music and songs, it should be noted that the video and other digital media content can be the subject of the playlist as well as music and audio files.
- Identifying the songs to be played at a single-act event is a relatively simple task. However, the process of selecting relevant music becomes very complex with multi-act event or a multi day event with many acts each day or a single-act event that includes an unknown opening band. Manually finding and the songs to add to a corresponding playlist can be time consuming, tedious and even difficult at times. As a result, many users will not even try to customize a playlist or even attempt to find the songs of acts they have never heard of that are included as part of a event.
- A music vendor constantly strives to introduce users to new music so as to entice the user to purchase more music content. Once the music vendor has a user listening to music, it is much easier to get the user to purchase additional music and try new music that might be interesting to the user. One aspect that may pique a user's interest is to arrange the user's playlist to correspond to an upcoming event. Such as playlist can be even more enticing if the user has indicated an interest in the upcoming event such as web searches about the event, ticket purchases for the event, participation in social networking related to the event, on-line discussions relating to the event such as in email, blogging or social networking or similar online content
- The disclosed system, method and apparatus can automatically generate recommendations and playlists from upcoming events that are customized for the user. Automatically creating recommendations and playlists corresponding to events can solve many problems for the user as well as provide additional sales opportunities for the music vendor.

FIGS. 1A-D illustrate aplaylist system 100, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Theplaylist system 100 allows a user to manually indicate and/or access interest in and information about particular events and/or song. Theplaylist system 100 can be presented on any type ofuser device 101. Auser device 101, such as a smartphone or tablet computer, is shown as an example embodiment, however, it should be understood that any suitable device could be used, such as a computer. As shown inFIG. 1A , theplaylist system 100 can include aplaylist locale 103 and a list ofevents 105A-105 n. Scrollarrows 106A-B can be used to scroll through the list ofevents 105A-105 n. - By way of example, in large metro-areas such as San Francisco, Calif. or Chicago, Ill. or New York, N.Y. might have hundreds of events occurring within a selected time period, e.g., a 30 day time period. Upcoming events geographically near the user can be compiled using a combination of manual entry, web-search history by the user, user's calendar entries, user's email, blogging or other electronic communications, user's interests and discussions content on social media, and even sponsored or placed events collected from one or more of the vendor's partners.
- Once a playlist of songs is identified, the playlist can be presented to the user as potential interest points. The user can select performers of interest or not of interest or select an entire event, or other subset of selections related to the event. A user might be very interested in a larger event, even if the event is not local and there is no data indicating the user's planning to attend the event. By way of example, for a larger or well known event like Bonnaroo or Telluride Bluegrass Festival, the choices could be presented to a user in a separate list, regardless of the user's location. Once the interest has been identified, the system and method can then present suggested songs that are part of those events or related to those events, to the user.
- Selecting an event, e.g.,
Event A 105A, causes anevents page 110 to be displayed as shown inFIG. 1B . Theevents page 110 includes the event and a list ofperformers 108A-C for the selected event, e.g.,Event A 105A. - Selecting one of the
performers 108A-C can cause adetail page 120 to be displayed, as shown inFIG. 1C . Thedetail page 120 can include lists of the performers'songs 122A-C. Each of the songs can include the respective metadata for the song as shown inFIG. 1D . -
FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram of aplaylist generation system 150, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Theuser device 101 is linked by adata network 151 to theInternet 152, and/or a server such as included in aserver cloud 154. Thedata network 151 can be any type of data network such as wired or wireless network systems and protocols. - All or portions of a user's
interest data 156 can be stored in one or more locations such as on theuser device 101 and/or on one or more servers in theserver cloud 154. Theserver cloud 154 also includes aplaylist logic 164 for automatically generating playlists for the user. - The
server cloud 154 can also include thecontent 160, e.g., music, video or other content media, controlled by the vendor. Theserver cloud 154 can also includecontent 160A owned by the user such as content the user has purchased and stored in an online content locker to provide access to the user's content, independent of theuser device 101. Theserver cloud 154 can also include adatabase 162 related to the media content. Thedatabase 162 can include data related to the content such as events, artists, performers, musicians and many more data fields for each data base entry. -
FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram of types of a user'sinterest data 156, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The user'sevents page 110 anddetail page 120 can be customized for the user. The customization can include a ranking process base on the user'sinterest data 156. The user'sinterest data 156 can include the user'slocation 170,calendar data 172, expressedinterests 174 including internet search and browsing history,social media posts 176,past purchases 178 andother user data 180. - User's expressed
interests 174 can also include media “likes” and media “dislikes.” By way of example, if a user indicates he likes, promotes or shares a particular song in a playback client application or in a social networking discussion or otherwise, then that song may be given an elevated interest rating for that user. Similarly, if a user indicates he dislikes or disapproves a particular song in a playback client application or in a social networking discussion or otherwise, then that song may be given a reduced interest rating for that user. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of the logic processes within theplaylist logic 164, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Theplaylist logic 164 culls data from one or more sources to identify events of the user's interest. As an example, the user'scalendar data 172 can be one source. Searching the Internet for events can be another source. Each of theevent data 105A-C entries can include date, title, location and additional related data. - Another source of events of the user's interest could include events promoted by the music vendor. By way of example, the music vendor may want to promote an upcoming event to their users to spur sales of related media content to their users. The media vendor may focus the promotion of the event on selected users or broadly on all or a wide variety of users and even beyond their user base so as to attract new users. By way of example, the vendor may use an event having a broad audience following among their users and many potential users such as the National Football League Superbowl. The Superbowl half-time show attracts attention from a very large audience. The vendor may produce a playlist to increase the interest level of songs and video of the half-time show.
- When an event of interest is identified, such as manually identified by a user or automatically identified based on the user interest data as described above, the
playlist logic 164 can use thedata base 162 to identify the songs, performers, etc., scheduled to play in the identified event. As an example, an internet site for the identified event can be queried and matching band names can be compared to a database of known bands and performers so as to include all bands and performers associated with the identified event of interest. - The event
playlist generator logic 404 can use the identifiedevents 105A-C as a starting point to lead to related data in one ormore data bases 162. Themetadata identification logic 408 can use themetadata 130 of each content entry to identify particular content. By way of example, thedata base 162 may identify a song, however, multiple different recordings of the same the song may stored in thecontent 160. The different recordings may include several different performers performing the same song or alternatively or additionally, thecontent 160 may include one or more performers performing the same song in different formats, e.g., live, studio master, acoustic, etc. The metadata identification logic 408 can use themeta data 130 to identify the best match for the particular recording of the song for the user's playlist. The eventplaylist generator logic 404 can then generate aplaylist 410. The generated playlist is available to be forwarded to or accessed by theuser device 101. - The playlist could present the music organized by the event, so it would play like a possible setlist or “best of”. Songs could be organized within the playlist according to the user's interest data, a popularity ranking or most listened to ranking from the user's playlist history e.g., in a corresponding music vendor's knowledge base, and combinations thereof.
- For multi-act events, song lists could be organized by performer so a user could get the feel of what the concert might be like. Using the annual Coachella Valley Music Festival event as an example, the user can listen to a Coachella playlist for the event, whether a future event or past event. The song selections in the playlist can be suggested to the user to purchase music that they might be seeing at the event.
- The system can similarly examine past events, thus allowing a user returning from an event and perform the same functionality. By way of example, a user could query events from August 1969 and be presented with selections or setlists of music performed at the famed Woodstock Music Festival in Bethel, N.Y. The individual performers and their respective setlists of songs can be correlated.
-
FIG. 5 is a flowchart diagram that illustrates themethod operations 500 performed in automatically generating a playlist from an event, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. In anoperation 505, theplaylist logic 164 searches data from many sources, e.g., databases such asdatabase 162, to identify events of the user's interest. The user'scalendar data 172 can be one source. Searching the internet for events can be another source. Each of theevent data 105A-C entries can include date, title, location and additional related data. In anoperation 510, theplaylist logic 164 identifies an event of the user's interest. - In an
operation 515, theplaylist logic 164 uses thedata base 162 to identify the songs, performers, etc., scheduled to play in the identified event to produce a list of potential songs to be performed at the identified event. The list of potential songs to be performed at the identified event can also include related songs that may be of interest to the user. The related songs can include different versions of songs performed by the identified performers already included in the list of potential songs. The related songs can also include different versions of songs already included in the list of potential songs that are performed by performers other than the identified performers. The related songs can also include other songs performed by the identified performers but not previously included in the list of potential songs to be performed at the identified event. - In an
operation 520, themetadata identification logic 408 selects one of the songs from the list of potential songs. In anoperation 525, themetadata identification logic 408 uses themetadata 130 corresponding to the selected song to identify a best match for the particular recording of the song for the user's playlist. The best matching song correlates to the user's interest. - In an
operation 530, the eventplaylist generator logic 404 adds the selected best matching song to aplaylist 410. In anoperation 535, theplaylist 410 is reviewed to determine if the playlist is complete. If theplaylist 410 is not complete, the method operations continue in anoperation 540. Inoperation 540, theplaylist logic 164 selects another song from the songs from the list of potential songs and the method operations continue inoperation 525 above. - If the
playlist 410 is complete, then the method operations continue in anoperation 545. Inoperation 545, the generated playlist is output such as forwarded to or otherwise made accessible by theuser device 101 and the method operations can end. - By way of example, the
playlist 410 can be presented as a graphical user interface display data, e.g., a webpage or similar GUI display, to the user'sdevice 101. The playlist webpage display on the user'sdevice 101 includes logical links such as hyperlinks, to the functional code and data stored on and managed by the music vendor'sserver 154. - Each song listed on the
playlist 410 can be a logical link to access an audio clip of the corresponding song. The audio clip can be stored in thecontent 160 on theserver 154. Alternatively, or additionally, each song listed on theplaylist 410 can be a logical link to access a complete audio file of the corresponding song. The audio file can be stored in thecontent 160 on theserver 154. -
FIG. 6A is a playback client application user interface 600, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The playback client application user interface 600 is displayed on theuser device 101 and includes a display of theplaylist 410. Theplaylist 410 includessongs 1A-nn 602-612. - The playback client application user interface 600 can also include a
share button 620. Theshare button 620 allows the user to share theplaylist 410 via social networking or other sharing system. Selecting theshare button 620 causes theplaylist 410 to be submitted to the user's social network provider. The user's social network provider can share theplaylist 410 according to the user's social networking preferences. -
FIG. 6B is an options screen display in the playback client application user interface 600, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Selecting a song such asSong 3Aoptions screen 142 listing the access options available for the selected song. The options screen 142 can include aplay button 640 that may be selected to play the selected song. When theplay button 640 is selected, the playlist logic interrogates auser rights database 158 to determine if the user has previously purchased the rights to use the selected recording of the selected song. - By way of example the user may have previously purchased the rights to play the selected recording of the selected song and have the selected recording of the selected song stored in the user's content locker or on his user device. Alternatively, the user may have purchased rights to access the selected recording of the selected song from the
content database 160 provided by the music vendor. If the user has rights to play the selected recording of the selected song, the selectedsong 3Auser device 101. - If the user does not have rights to play the selected recording of the selected
song 3Aplay button 640 may not be displayed or may be disabled and apurchase button 642 can be enabled or displayed. Thepurchase button 642 activates acontent purchase logic 159 to allow the user to purchase rights to the selected recording of the selectedsong 3Acontent purchase logic 159 can also include a sampling option to allow a user to access a sample portion of the selected recording of the selectedsong 3A - The options screen 142 can also include a
meta data button 644 to allow the user to access at least a portion of the meta data corresponding to the selected recording of the selectedsong 3Asong 3A to the user. -
FIG. 7A is a flowchart diagram that illustrates themethod operations 700 performed in sharing a playlist from an event, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. In anoperation 705, the user can select theshare button 620 to share the playlist or a selected song and the selection of the share button is received in theplaylist logic 164. Theplaylist logic 164 downloads or otherwise provides access to the playlist to the user's social media provider in anoperation 715 and the method operations can end. -
FIG. 7B is a flowchart diagram that illustrates themethod operations 750 performed in purchasing content from an event, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. In anoperation 755, the user can select thepurchase button 642 to purchase the selected song and the selection of thepurchase button 642 is received in thepurchase logic 159. Thepurchase logic 159 initiates a purchase transaction with the user according to the user's account preferences in the music vendor's service, in anoperation 760. Initiating the purchase transaction can also, optionally, include providing an option for the user to access a sample of the selected song. Providing access to the sample of the selected song allows the user to preview the song before purchase to make sure the selected song is the correct song the user wishes to purchase. The user can also access the selected song's metadata by selecting themetadata button 644 to make sure the selected song is the correct song the user wishes to purchase. - When the purchase is completed, the user's
rights data 158 are updated to reflect the purchase, in anoperation 765. Completing the purchase also updates the user's playlist so that theplay button 640 can be enabled in anoperation 770 and the method operations can end. -
