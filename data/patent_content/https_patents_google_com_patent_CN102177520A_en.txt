Foreground detection
Fig. 2 illustrates the more detailed view of according to an embodiment of the invention dispenser 130.Piece dispenser 130 is configured to receive print media image 120.Print media image 120 is at first analyzed by foreground detection device 210.Because the print media image is retrieved sometimes from the source such as microfilm, so the background of image may be very noisy.In addition, background and prospect gray level are according to the page, may alter a great deal in the page and between a plurality of roll microfilms.Because such variation, not suitable based on the binaryzation of global threshold.Therefore, reconstruct utilizes analysis to foreground detection device 210 based on the morphological image gray scale.
Fig. 3 illustrates the more detailed view of foreground detection device 210 according to an embodiment of the invention.In this embodiment, suppose that print media image 120 is prospect images whiter than background.In another embodiment, if necessary, original image can be by inversion device 310 (inverter) counter-rotating to obtain the prospect whiter than background.Though background or prospect do not occur with the constant greyscale level, think to have minimum contrast level 313 between prospect and background.If prospect is white unlike background, then the print media image 120 from print media image or counter-rotating deducts minimum contrast level 313, and the mark/drawing of seeds picture that causes being directed to then morphology gray level image reconstructor 320.Mark/drawing of seeds picture and print media image 120 are imported into morphology gray level image reconstructor 320 as mask (mask).Deduct the output of morphology gray level image reconstructor 320 then from mask images, wherein residual image occurs as peak value on background or vault.By this way, foreground detection device 210 is used as peak detctor.The result of foreground detection device 210 is binary images of print media image 120.
Optical character identification (OCR)
In Fig. 2, in case foreground detection device 210 has been handled print media image 120, optical character identification (OCR) engine 220 and line and version ditch detecting device 230 are with regard to the analysis result image.OCR engine 220 is carried out first samsara to discern by the character in the print media image 120 of foreground detection device 210 processing.OCR engine 220 is handled all pieces that are identified as from the text of image.For attempt identification because size-for example very large title font-may be mistaken as the character that is not text, consequent image by proportional zoom device (rescaler) 222 scale down again and diminish for original half, attempt to discern additional text once more at this OCR engine 220.In this embodiment, this process is repeated to amount to iteration three times, to attempt to discern all big texts of OCR engine 220 initial not identifications.
In another embodiment, image is by proportional zoom device 222 magnification ratios again and become greatly original twice so that 220 identifications of OCR engine may not be identified in addition than small text.In this embodiment, this process is repeated to amount to iteration three times, to attempt discerning OCR engine 220 initial all that do not discern than small text.
The version ditch detects
Version ditch in the print media image is classified as vertical version ditch or level version ditch.Vertical version ditch is the high narrow white portion of text, title or image block in the typical separate print media image 120.Level version ditch is the wide white portion of weak point of text, title or image block in the typical separate print media image 120.In other words, the piece in the print media image 120 can and define by version ditch and/or line definition.
In one embodiment, the high narrow filtrator that utilizes the pixel to the zone that is positioned at high narrow and most of white to respond comes detection of vertical version ditch.In order to make the minimum in influence or deflection and the print media image 120, be that the high narrow rectangular window at center is analyzed the specific pixel in print media image 120 by putting with analyzed pixel.This deflection process is illustrated as deflection robust version ditch according to an embodiment of the invention and line detection system 400 in Fig. 4.Figure 4 illustrates in the center of the narrow rectangular window 410 of height by the checked pixel of "+" sign flag.High narrow rectangular window 410 detects corresponding to vertical version ditch, and with surround with dark space 420-L and 420-R around the dotted outline in main white space illustrate.
In order whether to determine checked specific pixel corresponding to the version ditch, be vertical version ditch in this example, after using rectangular window 410, a plurality of white pixel on each row in the rectangular window 410 are counted.If white surpasses the minimum percent threshold value with the ratio of black picture element, then row is considered to " white ".Repeat this process for each row.If the total number percent of the white row in rectangular window 410 surpasses for example 99% second threshold percentage, then analyzed center pixel is labeled as vertical version ditch pixel.
As seen in fig. 4, as by the center of the indicated analyzed pixel of "+" symbol at rectangular window 410.As an example, if be 66% for each row minimum percent threshold value, then in Fig. 4, because every row has three pixels, if two or three in the pixel in each row are white, then this is about to be considered to " white ".Therefore, in the example of Fig. 4, all in rectangular window 410 be about to " being thought " white.Next step in this analysis examples will be whether the total number percent of determining the white row surpasses as second threshold percentage of example 99%, determine that analyzed center pixel waits to be marked as vertical edition ditch pixel.In this example, because the total number percent of " thinking " white row is 100%, so this has surpassed threshold value example number percent 99%, the center pixel that therefore is marked with "+" symbol will be marked as vertical version ditch pixel.
It all is white that the method for demonstrating in Fig. 4 does not need each pixel in the rectangular window 410, to determine that analyzed pixel is marked as an edition ditch pixel, has therefore increased noise tolerance.In addition, illustrated in the rectangular window 410 as Fig. 4, this method does not need white pixel to have accurate vertical alignment, changes because can tolerate less storing.The width of rectangular window 410 and height are with the constant multiple Dynamic Selection of the mode height of the connected component on the print media image page 120.As an example, if print media image 120 is images of newspaper, then the mode height typical case of connected component is corresponding to the height of main text line.
In a similar fashion, substitute, can come pixel is analyzed to be marked as level version ditch pixel by using short wide rectangular window as the narrow rectangular window of illustrated height among Fig. 4.In case analyzed all applicable pixels, just made uniting of vertical and level version ditch pixel to obtain an edition ditch image.
Line detects
Line is also carried out line in the mode similar to the mode of version ditch detection with version ditch detecting device 230 and is detected.Yet,, not necessarily detect such line in the above so being used to of describing detected the method based on filtrator of edition ditch because line is made up of the narrow part of the weak point of foreground object usually.Therefore, in this embodiment, utilize following nine step method in the operation of online and version ditch detecting device 230:
L1. the line of carrying out based on filtrator detects with detection of vertical and horizontal line.Consequent line is called as striction line.
L2. delete all strict horizontal lines (step 1, detecting) from input picture.
L3. the consequent image that has the rectangular configuration element being carried out morphology opens.The width of rectangle is corresponding to the line width of greatest hope.This has eliminated all narrow parts of width of the ratio structuring element of image.
L4. the image above the figure image subtraction that step 2, is obtained.This image only has narrow part.
L5. the image in the step 4 being carried out morphology closes.This will be filled in the gap between the less narrow part.
L6. carry out connected component analysis to the image of closing.The component that deletion is shorter than predetermined threshold.The result is the narrow object of its height (closing the back) greater than threshold value.
L7. to carry out the reconstruct of morphology two-value as the bianry image of mask with from the image that serves as a mark of step 6.This generation has all connected components in the input picture of at least one narrow part of appropriateness high (closing the back).
L8. carry out connected component analysis to image.Keep it highly above being higher than second threshold value of the threshold value in the step 6 or having the component that intersects with strict perpendicular line essence.Therefore, they self essence component very high or the extension striction line is retained.
L9. eliminate the part of line, wherein it intersects with the OCR speech that is detected.This has removed the line simulator (being caused by scratch etc.) that runs through text.
The example of this rule L1-L9 is illustrative, and and is not intended to restriction the present invention.Can use the Else Rule that it will be apparent to those skilled in the art as providing this description to come detection line and Ban Gou.
The paragraph that segmentation OCR generates
When line has been discerned version ditch and line with a version ditch detecting device 230, the result is covered on the paragraph that is returned by OCR engine 220.Cutter 240 generates and the corresponding littler subgraph image set of square boundary frame from the OCR piece of print media image 120.In each subimage, be set to " white " with version ditch or corresponding all pixels of line, wherein consequent image is carried out the connected component analysis.Whenever version ditch and line encirclement text block, cutter 240 is cut apart the paragraph of OCR identification.By this way, cutter 240 generates new paragraph collection, does not wherein have text crossover track or version ditch.
Identification title and main text paragraph
The purpose of block type recognizer 250 is to distinguish the text be considered to title and be the text of the part of the main body of article.OCR engine 220 attempts to discern all text characters.Comprise character if OCR engine 220 can not be identified as piece, then OCR engine 220 is labeled as image with this piece.Yet owing to find the bigger variation of font size in print media image 120, OCR engine 220 may be thought the paragraph and the piece that comprise than big font by mistake image.In addition, if text is made up of relatively large font and/or most of capitalization, then block type recognizer 250 will be labeled as title by the piece that OCR engine 220 is denoted as text.Spread all over the histogram of the full page generation font size of print media image 120 determines by (cutoff) font size by block type recognizer 250.
In order to verify that the font size by the text of OCR engine 220 report is correct, block type recognizer 250 is with the size of the font size conclusive evidence character boundary frame of OCR engine 220 reports.If two font sizes do not have essentially equivalent, then relevant piece is not labeled as title.
Create piece via merging
The output of block type recognizer 250 is made up of the paragraph collection that is marked as title or main text.From this paragraph collection, combiner 260 is combined into the piece collection with paragraph, and each is made up of the paragraph set.In one example, combiner 260 uses following rule to finish this task:
M1. the title paragraph only can merge with other title paragraph.The main text paragraph only can merge with other main text paragraph.
If M2. the text in the title paragraph does not align, then nonjoinder title paragraph.Determine alignment by match by the least square line and the measurement error of fitting of the reference point of independent symbols.
If the equal substantial alignment of left side distance and rightmargin M3., then merge into vertical neighbors (that is, and one above another, other piece of not intervening wherein) the main text paragraph.
If M4. upper edge distance and bottom margin substantial alignment, the paragraph that then merging level is contiguous.
If M5. the main text paragraph separates then nonjoinder main text paragraph by line or version ditch.If the title paragraph is separated by perpendicular line, nonjoinder title paragraph then.Yet, can merge and stride edition ditch or horizontal title paragraph.
The example of this rule M1-M5 is illustrative, and and is not intended to restriction the present invention.Can use the Else Rule that it will be apparent to those skilled in the art as providing this description to discern the piece that is used to merge.
Title is distributed to the main text piece
Realization by rule above 260 pairs of the combiners causes generating title piece collection and main text piece collection.Yet typically, the main text piece is associated with the title piece.Therefore, combiner 260 is analyzed the main text piece for the existence of the title piece that is associated.Combiner 260 is realized the related of title piece and one or more main text pieces by the candidate who the main text piece is identified as the specific title piece, wherein the mid point of title piece be positioned on the mid point of main text piece and title piece and main text piece level overlapping.
Minimum candidate's title piece is regarded as the title of in question main text piece, is not right after the horizontal line that under title the title piece is separated with the main text piece unless exist, and puts because many print media publishers are right after line under many titles.Yet the line of other intervention will make piece and title break away from (delink), at this point, and the orphan of the title piece that the main text piece is considered to not be associated.
