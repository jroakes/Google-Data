- recommendation platform 102 can track manner and degree in which a user interacts with content.
- recommendation platform 102 can include crawling component 104 , identification component 106 , and recommendation component 108 .
- Crawling component 104 is configured to gather information regarding content offered by content provider 116 that individual users generally access (e.g., view, listen to, watch, read, etc.) more than once.
- the terms re-access, re-view, re-listen to, re-watch, and re-read respectively indicate that a single user has accessed, viewed, listen to, watched and read, respectively, certain content more than once.
- crawling component 104 is configured to crawl information logs relating to a set of users searching for information regarding content a subset of the users respectively interacted with and accessed (e.g., viewed, listened to, watched, read, etc.) and identify content individual users interacted with/accessed more than once.
- information logs having historical user information regarding content accessed/viewed by a user can be stored in memory 112 in historical user information 114 database.
- information logs for users can be stored in external memory (e.g., in memory of content provider 116 or another networked entity) that can be accessed by recommendation platform 102 .
- the crawling component 104 can crawl watch histories associated with the users that reflect videos respective watched by the users.
- a watch history for any given user can have information including but not limited to: videos watched by the user, number of times the respective videos were watched by the user, or times when the respective videos were watched by the user.
- the crawling component 104 can analyze the watch histories for each of the plurality of users to at least identify a set of videos that have been watched more than once by individual users. In other words, the crawling component 104 can identify videos offered by the content provider 116 to users that tend to be re-watched. As used herein, a video can be considered re-watched if the video is watched more than once by the same user.
- crawling component 104 can be configured to identify sets of re-watched videos that are restricted by additional criteria besides having been re-watched at least once (e.g., watched at least twice by a single user). According to this aspect, crawling component 104 can be configured to apply one or more filters that further restrict sets of re-watched videos based on various criteria.
- a filter employed by crawling component 104 can include but is not limited to: a filter that restricts a set of re-watched videos based on number of times the videos in the set have been re-watched; a filter that restricts a set of re-watched videos based on number of users who have re-watched the videos in the set, a filter that restricts a set of re-watched videos based on average frequency of re-watch in a predetermined time period, and/or type of users that re-watched the videos (e.g., where users can be clustered into types based on various factors including but not limited to: preferences, demographics, and social circles).
- crawling component 104 can be configured to dynamically generate sets of re-watched videos.
- crawling component 104 can identify a set of re-watched videos on scheduled basis. For example, crawling component 104 can be configured to identify a set of re-watched videos every hour, every day, every week, etc.
- crawling component 104 can identify a set of re-watched videos in response to a request.
- a request can be associated with initial access of content offered by content provider 116 by a user at a website through which the user interfaces with the content provider 116 .
- a request can be associated with a search query request initiated by a user.
- the identification component 106 is configured to examine an information log for a particular user having information regarding content the user has previously accessed/viewed, to identify content in the information log that overlaps with a set of content identified by the crawling component 104 that tends to be re-accessed/re-viewed by a group of users. Thus, for a particular user at a given point in time, the identification component 106 can generate a list of content that a user has accessed, viewed, watched, or otherwise expressed interest in that matches content included in a set of content identified by crawling component 104 as content that has been re-accessed/re-viewed/re-watched by other users. This list can then be used for various purposes. For example, the list can be used to recommend and/or push content to the user for re-watching, influence search results associated with searches conducted by the user, influence advertisement placement in and charging models associated with the content, or employed for market research.
- crawling component 104 can identify a set of videos from the plurality of videos that have been re-watched by a group of users.
- the identification component 106 can identify one or more videos included in a particular user's watch history that are included in the set of videos identified by the crawling component 104 .
- the identification component 106 can identify one or more videos included in the set of videos that a particular user expressed a liking for, shared with another user, commented on, and/or otherwise interacted with in a manner that indicates positive interest in the one or more videos.
- the recommendation component 108 can recommend the one or more videos included in the particular user's watch history and/or liked, shared, commented on, etc., that are included in the set of videos identified by the crawling component 104 to the particular user.
- the identification component 106 can also identify content that a user expressed a disliking for that is included in a set of content identified by the crawling component 104 that users tend to re-access/re-view. For example, the identification component 106 can identify one or more videos that a user marked as disliked, or videos which the user provided a poor rating or bad review for that are included in a set of commonly re-watched videos identified by crawling component 104 . The recommendation component 108 can further choose not to recommend those disliked videos for re-watching by the user.
- the recommendation component 108 is configured to recommend content to a user (for re-viewing, re-watching, etc.), that has been viewed, watched, liked, etc. by the user and that is included in a set of content identified by crawling component 104 as content that tends to be re-viewed, re-watched, etc.
- the recommendation component 108 employs a recommendation based in part on an observation that behavior of a group of users will likely predict behavior of an individual user related to the group. For example, where content includes videos, the recommendation component 108 at least infers that if a user watches or likes a video that tends to be re-watched by several other users, the user may have interest in re-watching the video as well.
- the recommendation component 108 can also apply various filters to streamline this approach to better identify videos (or other content where the content does not included videos) that a particular user may be interested in re-watching/re-viewing.
- recommendation systems disclosed herein can include a ranking component 402 that can apply various filters/algorithms to a list of content accessed, viewed, watched, etc. by a particular user that matches a set of content identified as content that is re-accessed, re-viewed, re-watched by a group of users.
- the filters or algorithms can apply various criteria that restrict and rank content included in the list based on factors in addition to inclusion as function of matching content viewed by the user included in a set of content that is re-viewed by a plurality of users.
- the recommendation component 108 can then recommend content based on a filtered list or ranking generated by the ranking component 402 .

- a second predetermined threshold e.g., a threshold higher than the first threshold
- the recommendation component 108 can recommend the video above other recommended videos (e.g., place the video at the top of a recommendation list generated by recommendation platform 102 or another recommendation system), or an auto-play component (discussed supra with respect to FIG.
- the ranking can also influence order in which the video appears in a search query result for a search based on one or more factors associated with the video. It should be appreciated that manner in which a ranking associated with a video, as assigned by the ranking component 402 affects recommendation of the video, presentation of the recommended video, ordering of the recommended video, search query inclusion of the video, auto-replay of the video, and/or advertising associated with the video, can vary and is not limited to the above examples.
- the ranking component 402 can employ various algorithms (stored in memory 112 or external memory accessible to ranking component 402 ) that apply one or more factors, discussed below, considered reflective of a user's interest in re-accessing (e.g., re-viewing, re-watching, re-listening, re-reading, etc.) content items previously accessed (or interacted with by a user in the manners discussed herein) by the user to rank the content items.
- These factors can include factors that restrict content items included in a set content items identified by crawling component 104 as content items accessed (e.g., viewed, watched, etc) by at least one other user more than once.
- These factors can also include factors that restrict content items included in a user's history that can be considered candidates, as determined by identification component 106 , for matching with content items included in the set of content items identified by crawling component 104 .
- the ranking component 402 can apply these one or more factors (e.g., via an algorithm or algorithms) to a broad subset of content items identified by identification component 106 to rank content items included in the broad subset.
- this broad subset can include one or more content items included in a first user's history as content items interacted with by the user in a manner that indicates an affinity for the items, that match content items included in a set of content items identified by crawling component 104 as content items re-accessed (e.g., re-viewed, re-watched, etc.) by one or more other users of a plurality of users.
- interaction with a content item that can indicate an affinity for the content item can include but is not limited to: accessing the content item, viewing the content item, playing the content item, watching the content item, marking the content item as liked, commenting on the content item, sharing the content item with another user, placing the content item in saved folder/file (e.g., a favorites folder, a watch later folder, etc.), copying the content item, or downloading the content item.
- saved folder/file e.g., a favorites folder, a watch later folder, etc.
- crawling component 104 can be configured to apply one or more filters (e.g., algorithms that filter based on factors described below reflective of a user's interest in re-accessing content items) to restrict the list of content items included in a set of content items that tend to be re-accessed by user in general.
- crawling component 104 can identify a set of content items that are re-accessed by at least 30% of other users.
- the identification component 106 can also apply one or more algorithms to restrict the list of videos in a user's history that can be candidates for matching with the content items included in a set identified by crawling component 104 .
- the identification component 106 can identify content items included in a user's history that have been accessed by the user over the last week that match content items included in the set identified by crawling component 104 .
- the ranking component 402 can be provided with a streamlined list/set (as opposed to a broad list/set) of content items identified by identification component 106 for which to apply any additional filters/factors to rank the content items.
- Examples of various factors or filters that the crawling component 104 and/or identification component 106 can employ to filter sets/subsets of identified content items, and/or the ranking component 402 can employ to rank content items identified by identification component 106 are listed below as items 1-8.
- the ranking applied to a content item by the ranking component 402 as a function of one or more of these factors/filters reflects probability that the user has interest in re-accessing the content item again.
- ranking component 402 can select an algorithm to apply for ranking content items based on the type of content.
- different algorithms can be employed by ranking component 402 depending on the type of content.
- the different algorithms can include factors and weights to apply to those factors based on the type of content.
- the algorithm for ranking a video to reflect a user's interest in re-watching the video can weigh a user's history of watching a video higher than the user's history for liking a video.
- the content is text articles
- historical user actions related to the user extracting and posting quotes from the article can be included as a factor in a algorithm employed by ranking component 402 , whereas if the content is pictures, such a factor would not apply.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on the number of other users who re-accessed (e.g., re-viewed, re-watched, re-listened, etc.) the respective content items. For example, a user's history can indicate that the user has watched or liked video ABC. Video ABC can also be included in a set of videos identified by the crawling component 104 as videos re-watched by at least one other user. The ranking component 402 can determine the number of user's who re-watched the ABC video and rank the ABC video to reflect a probability that the user has an interest in re-watching the ABC video as a function of the number of other user's who re-watched the ABC video.
- a user's history can indicate that the user has watched or liked video ABC.
- Video ABC can also be included in a set of videos identified by the crawling component 104 as videos re-watched by at least one other user.
- the ranking component 402 can determine
- the ranking component 402 can associate a higher ranking with the ABC video if 10,000 other user's re-watched it as opposed to 10.
- the ranking component 402 can apply a threshold whereby at least X number of other users have re-watched video ABC before video ABC can be considered (as a function of the ranking assigned thereto) a candidate video the user would have interest in re-watching.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on an average number of times other users re-accessed (e.g., re-viewed, re-watched, re-listened, etc.) the respective content items. For example, a user's history can indicate that the user has watched or liked video ABC. Video ABC can also be included in a set of video identified by the crawling component 104 as videos re-watched by at least one other user. The ranking component 402 can determine average number of times other users re-watched the ABC video and rank the ABC video to reflect probability that the user has interest in re-watching the ABC video as a function of average number of times the other user's re-watched the ABC video. For example, the ranking component 402 can associate a higher ranking with the ABC video if the average number of times other users re-watched the ABC video is two times as opposed to a single time.
- a user's history can indicate that the user has watched or liked video ABC.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on time and frequency associated with re-access (e.g., re-view, re-watch, re-listen, etc.) of the respective content items by others.
- time or time period of re-access of content by others can be considered relevant to a user's interest in re-access because it can be assumed that a user would be more interested in content items that have been re-accessed by other users within a recent time frame as opposed to a less recent time frame.
- a user's history can indicate that the user has watched or liked video ABC and video XYZ.
- Videos ABC and XYZ can also be included in a set of videos identified by the crawling component 104 as videos re-watched by at least one other user.
- the ranking component 402 can determine however that video ABC was re-watched by at least one other user (e.g., re-watched by other users in general) over a year ago while video XYZ was re-watched by at least one other user within the past week.
- the ranking component 402 can then rank the ABC video and the XYZ video based on time frame associated with re-watch by other users to reflect probability that the user has an interest in re-watching the ABC video and the XYZ video. For example, the ranking component 402 can associate a higher ranking with the XYZ video as opposed to the ABC video.
- the ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on and frequency associated with re-access (e.g., re-view, re-watch, re-listen, etc.) of the respective content items by others within the respective time period.
- ranking component 402 can associate a ranking with content items identified by the identification component 106 that is influenced by current popularity of the respective content items. This factor is based on an assumption that a user would have more interest in re-accessing content that is frequently being re-accessed by a plurality of other users within a current or recent time frame. For example, ranking component 402 can rank content items higher that are being more frequently re-accessed as opposed to content items that are being less frequently re-accessed.
- the ranking component 402 can examine number of times a particular video was re-accessed in a predetermined time-frame (e.g., within the past hour, day or week as opposed to within the past year). The ranking component 402 can also compare frequency of re-access within a recent time-frame with frequency of re-access over past time frames to determine whether the frequency of re-access is increasing or decreasing. The ranking component 402 can associate a higher ranking with content items that are associated with an increasing frequency of re-access (e.g., content items increasing in popularity) as opposed to content items associated with decreasing frequency of re-access (e.g., content items decreasing in popularity).
- a predetermined time-frame e.g., within the past hour, day or week as opposed to within the past year.
- the ranking component 402 can also compare frequency of re-access within a recent time-frame with frequency of re-access over past time frames to determine whether the frequency of re-access is increasing or decreasing.
- the ranking component 402 can associate a higher ranking with
- a user's history can indicate that the user has watched or liked video ABC and video XYZ.
- Videos ABC and XYZ can also be included in a set of videos identified by the crawling component 104 as videos re-watched by at least one other user.
- the ranking component 402 can determine however that video ABC was re-watched at a frequency of about 50 times in the past year by at least one other user (e.g., re-watched by other users in general) while video XYZ was re-watched by at least one other at a frequency of about 50 times in the past week.
- the ranking component 402 can then rank the ABC video and the XYZ video based on the frequency of re-watch by other users, and the respective time periods or re-watch by other user's, to reflect a probability that the user has an interest in re-watching the ABC video and the XYZ video. For example, the ranking component 402 can associate a higher ranking with the XYZ video as opposed to the ABC video.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on relatedness of a first user, for which the content items are identified for recommendation for re-access, to other users that previously re-accessed the content items.
- ranking component 402 can analyze the various other users that previously re-accessed the content items to identify characteristics of those users. Such characteristics can relate to but are not limited to: user demographics, preferences of users, or social circles the users are associated with.
- the ranking component 402 can further determine or infer characteristics of the first user, including demographic information for the first user, preferences of the first user, and/or social circles of the first user.
- the ranking component 402 can then rank a content item included in the first user's history as a function of relatedness of the first user to the other users that previously re-accessed the content item.
- the ranking component 402 can infer that the first user would have a greater interest in re-accessing the content item as opposed to a scenario where the first user shares very few if any similarities with the other users that previously re-accessed the content item.
- the ranking component 402 can therefore associate higher ranking to a content item when the first user shares similarities with other users that previously re-accessed the content item and a lower ranking to a content item when the first user share' very few if any similarities with the other users that previously re-accessed the content item.
- degree of similarities between the first user and the other users can further influence ranking.
- the crawling component 104 can identify a set of videos that have been re-watched by a plurality of users.
- the identification component 106 can identify a video, video ABC included in a first user's watch history that is also included in the set of videos.
- the recommendation component 108 can then recommend video ABC to the first user for re-watch.
- the ranking component 402 can examine those users of the plurality of users that re-watched video ABC and determine that 75% of them are female, 90% of them are below the age of 18, and 30% of them enjoy sport fishing.
- the recommendation component 108 can then examine characteristics of the first user to determine that the first user is a 16 year old female who hates fish and anything to do with fishing.
- the ranking component 402 can associate a relatively high ranking with ABC which reflects a strong inclination that the first user would be interested in re-watching video ABC. According to this aspect, the ranking component 402 can adjust ranking of a video based on degree of similarity between a user who watched a video and other users that re-watched the video.
- crawling component 104 can be configured to generate sets of videos respectively re-accessed by clusters of users associated with particular characteristics.
- the identification component 106 can then examine a set of the sets of videos that is associated with users exhibiting similar characteristics to a first user when identifying matches between videos included in the first user's watch/like history that have been previously re-watched by other users. For example, rather than generating a set of videos that have be re-watched by a plurality of users, the crawling component 104 can generate sets of videos that have be respectively re-watched by specific clusters of users associated with particular characteristics related to a first user.
- the crawling component 104 can identify a set of videos that have been re-watched by a plurality of females under the age of 18. Where a first user is a 16 year old female, the identification component 106 can examine the set of videos to identify a video included in the set of videos that is also included in the first user's watch history.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on manner and degree of interaction with the content items by the first user for which the content items are identified for recommendation for re-access.
- a user's historical information 114 can include various indicators of a user's affinity for a particular content item in addition to accessing or viewing the item.
- a user may be able to view a link to content, view a summary of content, access content and view the content, access content and play the content (e.g., where the content includes video or audio), view content and provide comments on the content, view content and mark the content with an indication that the user likes or dislikes the content, view the content and share the content with another user (e.g., via posting a link to the content, emailing a link to the content, etc.), view the content and download or store the content, save or generate a reference locator for the content, etc.
- manner and degree of interaction with content can influence probability the user would have interest in accessing/viewing the content again.
- identification component 106 can identify content items included in a user's history that the user has interacted with in any of the manners described above and which are also included in a set of content items identified by crawling component 104 as content items that have be re-accessed by a plurality of users.
- the ranking component 402 can then apply a ranking to the respective content items as a function of the user's manner and degree of interaction with the respective content items. For example, a first video that a user views, shares a link to, and provides commentary on can be considered more interesting to the user as compared to a second video a user views a summary of and merely saves for viewing later.
- the ranking component 402 can be configured to apply a higher ranking to the first video compared to the second video.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on number of times of re-access of the content items by the user for whom the content items are being identified for recommendation for re-access.
- the crawling component 104 can identify a set of content items that tend to be re-accessed by a plurality of users.
- the identification component 106 can then identify a content item included in a first user's history that was accessed at least once by the first user that is also included in the set.
- the recommendation component 108 can then recommend the matching content item to the first user for re-access.
- a user's history will indicate that the user has already re-accessed the content item. For example, rather than accessing the content item once before, the first user may have accessed the content item twice before, three times before, four times before, etc.
- the ranking component 402 can infer that the greater amount of re-access of the content item by the user in the past, the more likely the user would be interested in re-accessing the content item in the future.
- the ranking component 402 can apply a higher ranking to content items included in the first user's history as a function of the number of times the first user has accessed the content item.
- ranking component 402 can rank content items identified by the identification component 106 based in part on a time of access the content items by the user for whom the content items are being identified for recommendation for re-access.
- the crawling component 104 can identify a set of content items that tend to be re-accessed by a plurality of users.
- the identification component 106 can then identify a content item included in a first user's history that was accessed at least once by the first user that is also included in the set.
- the ranking component 402 can further rank the content item to reflect a degree of likelihood that the first user would be interested in re-accessing the content item again as a function of time the first user accessed the content item.
- the ranking component 402 can consider a content item that was accessed by the first user within the past week as a better candidate for recommendation of re-access compared to a content item that was accessed by the first user a year ago.
- the ranking component 402 can associate higher rankings with content items that have been accessed (or interacted with in a manner discussed above that indicates an affinity for the item) more recently than others.
- the recommendation platform 102 can further include inference component 404 to provide for or aid in various inferences or determinations associated with aspects of crawling component 104 , identification component 106 , recommendation component 108 and ranking component 402 .
- inference component 404 may be granted access to all or portions of recommendation platform 102 , service provider(s) 116 external information sources/systems (not shown), and client devices 120 .
- inference component 404 can facilitate inferring a ranking for a video by ranking component 402 (e.g., inferring a probability that the user has an interest in re-watching the video). For example, inference component 404 can apply one or more of the above factors to content items, such as videos, identified by identification component 106 , to infer a degree/probability of likelihood of re-access or re-watch by a user. The inference component 404 can further infer whether and how to recommend and present content items to a user for re-watch based on ranking information associated therewith. For example, the inference component 404 can infer whether to recommend a video to a user for re-watch based on the ranking associated therewith. In another example, inference component 404 can infer how to order a video recommended for re-watch amongst other videos recommended to the user in a recommendation section of a user interface based in part on a ranking associated therewith.
- inference component 404 can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data.
- An inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example.
- the inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events.
- An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data.
- Such an inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.
- Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.
- support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc. can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
- Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.
- a support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data.
- directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., na ⁇ ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.
- FIG. 5 presents a diagram of another example system 500 for recommending content to a user that the user previously viewed for viewing again, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.
- System 500 includes same features and functionalities of system 400 with the addition of auto-play component 502 . Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity.
- Auto-play component 502 is configured to automatically replay a media item, such as a video or audio track, in response to a determination by recommendation component 108 for recommendation of re-access (e.g., re-watch or re-listen to) of the media item. For example, in response to identification by the identification component 106 and/or recommendation component 108 of a video that a user may have an interest re-watching, the auto-play component 502 can automatically play the video in a media player of a user interface at a client device 120 employed by the user.
- a media item such as a video or audio track
- the auto-play component 502 can be configured to automatically re-play a media item in response to a determination/inference by ranking component 402 and/or inference component 404 that the media item has a high probability of re-watch/re-listen by the user.
- the auto-play component 502 can be configured to automatically reply a video or audio track in response to association of a ranking with the video or audio track that is above a predetermined threshold.
- the auto-play component 502 can be configured to automatically replay videos that have a 90% probability of re-watch by a user (e.g., based on the various factors discussed herein).
- the auto-play component 502 is configured to initiate the automatic replay of a video or audio track as a function of user context or user preferences.
- the inference component 404 can infer user context and/or user preferences.
- user preferences can be provided to recommendation platform 102 by user.
- User context can relate information including but not limited to, a user's physical location, a user's physical surroundings, a user's current activities, and time of day. For example, where the recommendation component 108 identifies a sports match video as having a high probability of re-watch for a particular user, the auto-play component 502 can choose to automatically replay the video when the user is travelling to attend a similar sports match as opposed to a time when the user is attending church.
- FIG. 6 presents another diagram of another example system 600 for recommending content to a user that the user previously viewed for viewing again, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.
- System 600 includes same features and functionalities of system 500 with the addition of advertising component 602 . Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity.
- Advertising component 602 is configured to provide advertisements (ads) to users. These advertisements can include video ads, text ads, picture ads, audio ads, etc. In some aspects, the advertisements are associated with content re-accessed by users. In other aspects, the content re-accessed by a user is an advertisement.
- the advertising component 602 can identify ads best suited for association with content recommended for re-viewing based on learned factors regarding user interest in ads associated with the content at a prior viewing. For example, the advertising component 602 can select a new ad to associate with content recommend for re-viewing where the user did not show interest (e.g., click on, watch for a predetermined period of time, take action regarding the purpose of the add such as purchase the product advertised in the ad, etc.). In another example, where a user showed interest in a particular advertisement in the past, the advertising component can chose to show similar ads with the content when recommended for re-viewing by the user. According to this aspect, the advertising component 602 can select ads to associate with content recommended for reviewing based in part on probability of advertisement conversion during user re-watch.
- the advertising component 602 can prioritize ad placement with content recommended for re-viewing based in part on an inferred/determined user interest level in the content, where the user interest level is based in part on degree of likelihood a user will re-view the content. For example, when ranking component 402 associates a ranking with content that reflects a high probability the user with re-view the content, the advertising component 602 can choose to place high quality ads with the content recommended for re-access. Similarly, advertising component 602 can choose to associate ads that have been purchased at a higher premium in exchange for premium placement with content that tends to be re-accessed by users and has been recommended to a particular user for re-access.
- advertising component 602 can associate ads with content recommended for re-view by a user as a function of user preferences.
