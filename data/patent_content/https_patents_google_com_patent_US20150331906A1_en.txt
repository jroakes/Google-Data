Modified re-issued query(ies) 282 may be generated based on modifications of an initial query to tune search results by modifying search terms (add or remove keywords), and/or modifying sites (add or remove labels).
Abstract
A system embodiment receives a query from the user. The query is processed by a search infrastructure which may return a set of results. Results may then be estimated for quality by a quality estimator. The quality estimator may determine an initial quality estimation of the search result(s). A query re-issuer generates re-issued query information based on the initial quality estimation of the search result(s) for the initial query. A query modifier then receives the re-issued query information and generates a modified re-issued query in accordance with the query re-issue information. A method embodiment modifies and re-issues a query to the search infrastructure. The method includes determining an initial quality estimation of the search result, generating re-issued query information based on at least an initial quality estimation of the search result for the initial query, receiving the re-issued query information and generating a modified re-issued query.

- This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/142,254, filed Dec. 27, 2013, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/874,124, filed Oct. 17, 2007, the contents of each of which are incorporated by reference.
- 1. Field of the Invention
- The present invention relates in general to search engines.
- 2. Related Art
- The development of information retrieval systems has predominantly focused on improving the overall quality of the search results presented to the user. The quality of the results has typically been measured in terms of accuracy, recall, or other quantifiable measures of performance. Information retrieval systems, or ‘search engines’ in the context of the Internet and World Wide Web, use different techniques to improve the quality and usefulness of the search results. These techniques may address certain aspects of search engine design, such as basic indexing algorithms and document representation.
- An inherent problem in the design of search engines is that the relevance of search results to a particular user depends on factors that are highly dependent on the user's intent in conducting the search, that is, why they are conducting the search, as well as the user's circumstances and facts pertaining to the user's information need. Thus, given the same query by two different users, a given set of search results can be relevant to one user and irrelevant to another, entirely because of the different intent and information needs.
- Most attempts at solving the problem of inferring a user's intent typically depend on relatively weak indicators, such as static user preferences, or predefined methods of query reformulation that are nothing more than educated guesses about what the user is interested in based on the query terms. Approaches such as these cannot fully capture user intent because such intent is itself highly variable and dependent on numerous situational facts that cannot be extrapolated from typical query terms.
- In some cases, browsers may allow filtering of returned results to block undesired content (such as, parental web site blocking tools). Different browser tools have also been used to remove undesirable search terms in search queries prior to sending these terms to search engines. However these attempts have been designed to block content and may not evaluate or improve quality of search results.
- Systems and methods are needed that improve the quality of results for users.
- The present invention relates to systems and methods for modifying and re-issuing a user's query. A system embodiment receives a query from the user. The query is processed by a search infrastructure which may return a set of results. A quality estimator may determine an initial quality estimation of the search result(s). A query re-issuer generates re-issued query information based on the initial quality estimation of the search result(s) for the initial query. A query modifier then receives the re-issued query information and generates modified re-issued query(ies) in accordance with the re-issued query information.
- A method embodiment modifies and re-issues a query to the search infrastructure. The method includes the steps of: (a) determining an initial quality estimation of the search result(s) (b) generating re-issued query information based on at least an initial quality estimation of the search result(s) for the initial query; and (c) receiving the re-issued query information and generating a modified re-issued query in accordance with the re-issued query information.
- In another embodiment, the quality estimator may provide an indication to the query re-issuer that may be based on the number of search results retrieved from the search infrastructure. This indication may be used by the query re-issuer to generate re-issued query information. Re-issued query information may be used by the query modifier to generate modified re-issued query(ies).
- In this way, the quality of search results in response to a user's query may be improved by estimating the quality of the search results.

The operation ofsearch engine system 108, according to embodiments, is described further with respect toFIG. 2A andFIG. 2B . - In one example,
search engine system 108 andunderlying search infrastructure 130 operate on different remote computing devices and communicate with one another overnetwork 106. Alternatively,search engine system 108 andunderlying search infrastructure 130 can be combined on one device or coupled locally to one another. -
Search engine system 108 andsearch infrastructure 130 can each be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. In one example, not intended to limit the present invention,search engine system 108 can be implemented as a server that can communicate with or is part of a web server (not shown). Similarly,search infrastructure 130 can be implemented as a server that can communicate with or is part of a web server (not shown). In this way,developer 104 oruser 102 can communicate withsearch engine system 108 remotely over the Web through respective browsers running on remote client devices such asclient device 103, anddeveloper client 140. - Referring to
FIG. 1 , query modification may include receiving asearch specification 170 fromdeveloper 104.Developer 104 has access to adeveloper client 140.Developer 104 may broadly refer to any user that desires to customize search engine system behavior.Developer client 140 may receive asearch specification 170 fromdeveloper 104.Developer client 140 may be coupled tosearch engine system 108 throughnetwork 106.Network 106 may transfersearch specification 170 fromdeveloper client 140 tosearch engine system 108.Search specification 170 may have a query modification description and a results modification description. - Query modification description may include information on query modification. For instance, this can include query modification parameters. In one embodiment, query modification (QM) parameters can include one or more parameters to add, to restrict, promote, to demote, or to remove search terms.
- In another example, query modification description can include information on query modification that is at an even higher-level (such as, an indication of how certain terms or keywords are to be included, excluded, favored, or disfavored to tune search results) which may more easily specified by
developer 104. This information may be later analyzed and automatically converted to QM parameters. - Results modification description may include information on results modification of results returned from
search infrastructure 130. In particular, this can include result modification parameters. In one embodiment, results modification (RM) parameters can include one or more parameters to restrict, to promote, to demote or to remove results. In another example, results modification description can include information on results modification that is at an even higher-level (such as, an indication of what websites (e.g. URLs) are to be included, excluded, favored, or disfavored in a search to tune search results) which may more easily specified bydeveloper 104. This information can then be later analyzed and automatically converted to RM parameters. - According to one feature, not intended to limit the invention,
search specification 170 can be provided in a language that is hierarchical, human readable/editable and machine-readable/editable for direct execution by a machine. Such a language can include, but is not limited to, XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language). -
User 102 has may accessclient device 103 to providequery 160 and receiveresults 190 fromsearch engine system 108. Query 160 can be any type of search query including, but not limited to, a query having one or more terms specified by the user for the search. - In one embodiment,
search engine system 108 is adapted to receive a search query that includes one or more terms and may also include one or more labels. The query terms are keywords of interest to the user; the labels are words that the user desires to be found in comments or tags associated with documents matching the query terms. For example, a search query may include a term “camera” and a label “professional review”. Search results in a response to a search query are automatically selected to include both the most relevant documents to the query terms and relevant documents that have labels that match the query labels. This is an example and not intended to limit the invention as a search query need not have labels. -
FIG. 2A illustratessystem 200.System 200 is an embodiment of a system for re-issuing a user query based on estimated quality of search results. -
System 200 containssearch engine system 108.Search engine system 108 may includequery modifier 210,query re-issuer 220 andresult processor 240. -
Query modifier 210 receivesquery 160 as an input and initially generates a modifiedquery 280 which is provided to searchinfrastructure 130.Search infrastructure 130 may return no result, a result or a plurality of orderedresults 290. Orderedresults 290 may be provided to resultprocessor 240.Result processor 240 may process orderedresults 290 to generate processedresults 292.Processed results 292 may be provided to query re-issuer 220. -
Query re-issuer 220 may generatere-issued query information 294.Re-issued query information 294 may contain an estimate of quality of orderedresults 290 and/or an estimate of the number of orderedresults 290. In an embodiment,re-issued query information 294 may contain information on the number of times a query has been re-issued and/or any query that may be stored byquery re-issuer 220.Re-issued query information 294 is explained further in the application with respect toFIG. 2B . -
Query re-issuer 220 may sendre-issued query information 294 to querymodifier 210.Query modifier 210 may then generate modified re-issued query(ies) 282 and send modified re-issued query(ies) 282 back tosearch infrastructure 130. In exemplary cases wheresearch infrastructure 130 may not provide any orderedresults 290, modifiedre-issued query 282 may be query 160 or modifiedquery 280. In this way, quality of search results may be improved through query modification and query re-issue. -
FIG. 2B illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a system for re-issuing a user query based on, but not limited to, the estimated quality of search results. -
Search engine system 108 may includequery modifier 210 that receives aquery 160 fromuser 102 throughclient device 103.Query modifier 210 may modify query 160 based onsearch specification 170.Search specification 170 may be provided bydeveloper 104.Search specification 170 may include a query modification description and a results modification description. The query modification description includes information on query modification. The results modification description includes information on results modification. In an embodiment, an approximation ofsearch specification 170 may be used to modify a query. An approximation ofsearch specification 170 may be needed, for example, if thesearch specification 170 has a large query modification description. Query 160 may be modified byquery modifier 210 based onsearch specification 170 to generate modifiedquery 280.Modified query 280 is provided as an input to thesearch infrastructure 130. -
Filter 244 inquery modifier 210 may be used bysearch infrastructure 130 to test whether the domain of a particular search result is included in the URL patterns for labels that match the query labels. Domain of a search result, for example, may refer to the domain name of a server from which search results are derived. These URL patterns may be provided bysearch specification 170.Search infrastructure 130 may process query 160, modifiedquery 280 or modified re-issued query(ies) 282 withfilter 244. - In one embodiment,
filter 244 may be an adaptable and/or a reconfigurable filter.Filter 244 may change (adapt and/or re-configure) depending on the estimated quality of search results. As an example, the size offilter 244 may be increased if the quality of the search results is not good. Furthermore, filter 244 may include one or more filters that affect the retrieval of search results. In one embodiment,filter 244 may be implemented as a Bloom filter. As known to those of skill in the art, a Bloom filter is a space-efficient data structure that is used to probabilistically test whether an element is a member of a set. Bloom filters may be characterized by their error rates. Size of a Bloom filter may depend on these error rates. These examples are illustrative and not intended to limit the invention. -
Search infrastructure 130 may return no result, a result or an initial set of orderedresults 290. In exemplary cases wheresearch infrastructure 130 may not provide any search results, modified re-issued query(ies) 282 may be query 160 or modifiedquery 280. Orderedresults 290 are provided as an input to resultprocessor 240 insearch engine system 108.Result processor 240 may include aURL matcher 242 and aresult ranker 246.Result processor 240 may further process orderedresults 290 to produce a result set in which a selected portion of the documents have labels that match the query labels. -
Result ranker 246 may receive orderedresults 290 fromsearch infrastructure 130 and ranks them using label matches as weighting factors. Label matches may occur when labels provided with a query by a user match labels that may be included in search results. The ranked results may then be provided to theURL matcher 242. -
URL matcher 242 tests whether the domain of a particular search result is included in a set of URL patterns. Domain of a search result, for example, may refer to the domain name of a server from which search results are derived. This set of URL patterns may be provided bysearch specification 170. -
Processed results 292 may be provided to query re-issuer 220. In an embodiment, query re-issuer 220 may store any result fromsearch infrastructure 130 or a plurality of processedresults 292.Query re-issuer 220 may comprise ofquality estimator 222 andre-issue information 224. -
Re-issue information 224 may include information related to the query such as the number of times a query has been re-issued. In another embodiment,re-issue information 224 may include information related to the current state ofquery re-issuer 220. Current state ofquery re-issuer 220 may depend on if a query or a plurality of queries have been re-issued or if a query or a plurality of queries are waiting to be re-issued. -
Quality estimator 222 may estimate a quality of a search result, a plurality of search results or provide an indication that no results have been retrieved fromsearch infrastructure 130. An estimate of quality may also depend on the number of orderedresults 290 that have been retrieved fromsearch infrastructure 130. In cases where search results are retrieved fromsearch infrastructure 130,quality estimator 222 evaluates the quality of the search result based on a comparison of one or a plurality of results retrieved fromsearch infrastructure 130 andsearch specification 170.Quality estimator 222 may providequery re-issuer 220 with an evaluation or an indication. In an embodiment of the invention,quality estimator 222 may provide an evaluation of quality of processedresults 292. This evaluation may include an estimate of the value of re-issuing a query one or more times. The value of re-issuing a query may be based on, but is not limited to, computational cost, network cost and latency. An evaluation of quality may depend on a number or percentage of results that match query terms or labels. Furthermore an evaluation of quality may depend on error rates offilter 244. This value is then used by thequery re-issuer 220 to generatere-issued query information 294 and send there-issued query information 294 to querymodifier 210. -
Re-issued query information 294 may contain an estimate of quality fromquality estimator 222. In an embodiment,re-issued query information 294 may additionally containre-issue information 224 and/or any query that may be stored byquery re-issuer 220. - An estimate of quality contained in
re-issued query information 294 may be based on, but is not limited to, computational cost, network cost and latency. An evaluation of quality may also depend on a number or percentage of results that match query terms or labels. In an embodiment, an evaluation of quality may be based on the number of orderedresults 290 provided by search infrastructure in response. In one case,search infrastructure 130 may provide no result in response to a query. In another case,search infrastructure 130 may provide a large a plurality of results in response to a user query. In either case, an estimate of quality contained inre-issued query information 294 may indicate the number of search results retrieved fromsearch infrastructure 130 in response to a query. -
Query re-issuer 220 may sendre-issued query information 294 to querymodifier 210.Query modifier 210 may then generate modified re-issued query(ies) 282 and send modified re-issued query(ies) 282 back tosearch infrastructure 130. - In an embodiment, if the estimated quality of processed
results 292 is acceptable, query re-issuer 220 may provideresults 190 touser 102. In this way, quality of search results may be improved through query modification and query re-issue. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating various stages that may be involved in query modification and re-issue in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In what may be called mode ‘First Pass’,user 102 sends out a query q tosearch engine system 108. In an embodiment query q may be query 160 as illustrated inFIG. 2B . At 302,search engine system 108 may modify the query based on thesearch specification 170, shown inFIG. 2B .Search engine system 108 thus generates a modified query q′, which is sent to searchinfrastructure 130. -
Search infrastructure 130 receives the query and generates search results r′ at 320. Search results r′ are then sent tosearch engine system 108. In an embodiment of the present inventionsearch engine system 108 may filter, rank and estimate the quality of the results at 308. If the estimated quality of results r′ is acceptable, results r′ are presented to theuser 102. - If the estimated quality of the results r′ is unacceptable, then query q′ may be modified beginning what may be called as mode ‘Add Keywords’. Query q′ may be modified by adding terms to query q′. The terms are keywords of interest to the user. In an embodiment, these keywords may be obtained from
search specification 170 provided bydeveloper 104. Query modification of query q′ may be based onsearch specification 170, as shown inFIG. 2B . - Query modification of query q′ results in query q″ being generated by
search engine system 108. Query q″ is sent to searchinfrastructure 130. At 330, search infrastructure 330 generates search results r″. Search results r″ are received bysearch engine system 108. In an embodiment of the present inventionsearch engine system 108 may filter, rank and estimate the quality of the results at 310. If the estimated quality of results r″ is acceptable, results r″ are presented to theuser 102. - If the estimated quality of the results r″ is unacceptable, then query q may be modified beginning what may be called as mode ‘Trim Sites’. Query q may be modified by adding ‘site:’ modifiers to it. ‘Site:’ modifiers may be terms that are added to query q created by the user. In an embodiment of the invention, ‘site:’ modifiers may be obtained as fixed size subset of URL patterns that may be included in
search specification 170. This results in query q′ being generated at 310. - Query q″ is sent to search
infrastructure 130. At 340, search infrastructure 330 generates search results r′. In an embodiment, not intended to limit the invention, referring toFIG. 2A andFIG. 2B , results r′ may be provided asresults 190 touser 102. In another embodiment, referring toFIG. 2B , query re-issuer 220 may store results r′, r″ and r″.Quality estimator 222 may provide an evaluation of quality of stored results r′, r″ and r″.Query re-issuer 220, may use the evaluation to provide either r′, r″ or r′″ in isolation or in any combination asresults 190 touser 102. - In one example, a re-issued query includes an initial query further modified to add terms or labels to reduce the number of results. In another example, a re-issued query is based on an initial query that has labels modified to trim sites included in returned search results. In still another example, a re-issued query is based on an initial query.
- In this way quality of a search result or a plurality of search results may be improved through query modification and query re-issue.

FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method in an embodiment of the present invention.Method 400 begins with receiving a search query from a user at 402. As an example, query 160 may be received bysearch engine system 108. - At 404, the search specification is used to generate a modified query. A modified
query 280, for example, may be generated byquery modifier 210. - At 406, a query is sent to a search infrastructure. As an example, modified
query 280 may be sent to searchinfrastructure 130. - At 408, ordered results are received from the search infrastructure. Ordered
results 290 may be received, for example, bysearch infrastructure 130. - At 410, results received by the search infrastructure are filtered. Filtering of results, for example, may be carried out by
filter 244. - At 412, filtered results generated in
step 410 are ranked. Ranking of filtered results may be carried out byresult ranker 246 included inresult processor 240. - At 414, the search results are estimated for quality. As an example, processed
results 292 may be estimated for quality byquality estimator 222. - At 416,
method 400 changes control depending on whether query modification is needed. If query modification is not needed, the results are rendered to the user at 426.Results 190, for example, may be rendered touser 102. If query modification is needed,method 400 determines the type of query modification needed atstep 418. As an example,quality estimator 222 may check if query modification is needed and determine the type of query modification. - At 420,
method 400 changes control depending on if keywords need to be added to modify the query. If the keywords are to be added to modify the query, key words are added to the query and the modified query is sent back to the search infrastructure at 422. If keywords are not to be added to the query, “site:” modifiers are added to the query and the modified query is sent back to the search infrastructure at 424. As an example, modified re-issued query(ies) 282 may be sent back tosearch infrastructure 130. Modified re-issued query(ies) 282 may be generated based on modifications of an initial query to tune search results by modifying search terms (add or remove keywords), and/or modifying sites (add or remove labels). - In this way, quality of search results may be improved through query modification and query re-issue.
