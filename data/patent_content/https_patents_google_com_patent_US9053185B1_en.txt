Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to determining similar user identifiers.
- Information about online users is often unavailable to interested parties, such as website owners and online advertisers. From an advertiser's perspective, placing an advertisement on a web page may or may not be of interest or useful for the end users viewing the web page.
- the content of a web page may be used to help advertisers select advertisements to be provided with the web page. For example, an advertiser selling golf clubs may advertise on a website devoted to golf, since visitors to the website may share a common interest in golf.
- Such systems may use keywords located in the text of the website to identify topics discussed on the website.
- a processing circuit receives a plurality of different models, each model configured for use in generating a second set of network user identifiers based on a first set of network user identifiers.
- the processing circuit receives feature data for each of the plurality of different models, each feature data having a corresponding feature weight data.
- the processing circuit identifies similar models within the plurality of different models based on a similarity of the feature data between models within the plurality of different models.
- the processing circuit generates the representative model to represent the similar models.
- the representative model may be used to generate the second set of network user identifiers based on the feature data and corresponding weight data of the representative model.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with an illustrative implementation.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example web page having an advertisement.
- FIG. 3 is an example process for identifying similar online users.
- FIG. 4 is an example process for creating a representative model for a plurality of different models identified by similar feature data.
- the online behaviors of user identifiers may be used to provide audience-based advertising.
- online behavior refers to how a user identifier interacts with web pages on the Internet (e.g., which web pages are visited, the order in which the web pages are visited, how long a particular web page is viewed, and similar information).
- a set of user identifiers associated with an online event e.g., making an online purchase, being added to an advertiser's list of user identifiers, etc.
- a user may opt in or out of allowing an advertisement server to identify and store information about the user and/or about devices operated by the user. For example, the user may opt in to receiving advertisements from the advertisement server that may be more relevant to the user.
- the user may be represented as a randomized user identifier (e.g., a cookie, a device serial number, etc.) that contains no personally-identifiable information about the user. For example, information relating to the user's name, demographics, etc., may not be used by the advertisement server unless the user opts in to providing such information. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by an advertisement server.
- advertisements are provided based on the content of a web page.
- a web page devoted to golf may mention the terms “golf” and other golf-related terms.
- An advertising system that places advertisements on the web page may use the content of the web page itself and/or terms provided as part of a request for an advertisement (e.g., via an advertisement tag embedded into the code of the web page), to determine a theme for the web page. Based on the determined theme, a manufacturer of golf clubs may opt to place an advertisement on the web page.
- Audience-based advertising in contrast to content-based advertising, involves selecting advertisements based on the user identifier visiting a web page, instead of the content of the web page itself.
- a user identifier may be associated with making an online reservation at a golf resort and navigating to a financial web page to check the stock market.
- an advertisement from a manufacturer of golf clubs may be provided with the financial web page, even though the financial web page is unrelated to golf.
- One or more implementations described herein may provide a method for identifying multiple models targeting nearly the same set of network user identifiers. After the multiple models are identified, the processing circuit may generate a representative model. This may result in moderate to significant memory space savings, depending on the diversity of the advertisers. Specifically, instead of saving a plurality of nearly identical, similar models, a serving system may only have to store the representative model. While it is possible to compress the size of the models or only load one model at a time, the implementations disclosed above may render these alternatives unnecessary.

- advertisement server 104 may be configured to determine whether the online behavior of a user identifier from client 102 is similar to that of other user identifiers. In some cases, advertisement server 104 may determine the similarity between the online behavior associated with a user identifier and that of other user identifiers associated with a desired action, such as purchasing a certain good or navigating to a certain web page. For example, a number of user identifiers may be associated with visiting web pages from content sources 108 , 110 devoted to tourist attractions in Seattle and going on to purchase airline tickets to Seattle.
- advertisement server 104 may determine that a user identifier associated with client 102 is similar to those user identifiers associated with a purchase of airline tickets to Seattle based on client 102 navigating to web pages provided by content sources 108 , 110 .
- advertisement server 104 may receive browsing history data to determine the online behaviors of user identifiers around a certain event.
- advertisement server 104 may use cookies and/or pixel tags to determine an online behavior of a user identifier. For example, a cookie associated with advertisement server 104 may be placed on client 102 and used as a user identifier. Whenever client 102 navigates to a web page that includes an advertisement from advertisement server 104 , the cookie may be used to identify client 102 as having visited the web page.

- Another advertisement tag may request an advertisement from a remote location, for example, from an advertisement server, as web page 206 is loaded.
- client identification data e.g., a cookie, device ID, etc.
- the advertisement server is able to determine browsing history associated with a user identifier as it is used to navigate between various web pages that participate in the advertising network (e.g., web pages that include advertisements from the advertisement server).
- an example process 300 for determining similar online user identifiers may compete in an advertising auction for the ability to place an advertisement on a given web page.
- An advertiser having access to a set of user identifiers that are similar to other user identifiers associated with making a purchase may adjust their bid accordingly if one of the similar user identifiers requests a web page having an embedded advertisement.
- Process 300 includes receiving data indicative of a set of user identifiers associated with an online event (block 302 ).
- an online event may correspond to any action performed by an online user.
- an online event may correspond to visiting a web page, clicking on a particular link (e.g., a hyperlink, an advertisement link, etc.), navigating between a set of web pages, ending their browsing session, spending a certain amount of time on a given web page, purchasing a good or service, or any other action that may be performed by an online user.
- the set of users may be represented using device identifiers (e.g., cookies, device IDs, etc.) for the electronic devices operated by the users.
- the set of user identifiers may also include information about when the event occurred with respect to a user in the set.
- the received set may include information about when a particular user visited a web page, made a purchase, or performed any other online action.
- an online retailer may wish to place advertisements via an advertising network.
- the retailer may generate a list of user identifiers associated with visits to the retailer's website and/or purchases made via the website.
- the list of user identifiers may be a list of cookies, device IDs, or other information that can be used by the advertising network to determine online behaviors associated with the user identifiers on the list. For example, a mobile telephone having a unique device ID may be used to access the retailer's website. If the user has opted in to allowing information about the user to be collected, the retailer may record the device ID as a user identifier and provide it to the advertising network. The advertising network may then use the user identifier to identify similar user identifiers.
- Process 300 includes determining short-term browsing histories surrounding the event (block 304 ).
- the system that receives the set of user identifiers may retrieve information regarding the browsing histories associated with the user identifiers in the set.
- a server of an advertising network may store browsing history information for user identifiers that visited websites participating in the advertising network (e.g., websites that display advertisements provided by the advertising network). Such information may be collected, for example, by receiving identification information (e.g., a cookie, device ID, etc.) each time a user identifier is used to access a web page displaying an advertisement from the advertising network. Such information may be used to reconstruct, or partially reconstruct, a user's browsing history, provided that the user has opted in to allowing such information to be used.
- the browsing history may be predetermined by another device outside of the advertising network (e.g., the browsing history data may be publisher-provided).
- the short-term browsing history for a user identifier refers to data about which web pages were visited within a particular period of the online event.
- the short-term browsing history for a user identifier surrounding an event may include data about the web pages visited by the user identifier less than one, two, five, twelve, or twenty four hours prior to the event.
- the short-term browsing history for a user identifier may include data about the web pages visited by the user identifier less than one, two, five, twelve, or twenty four hours after the occurrence of the event.
- long-term browsing histories may be used (e.g., browsing history data from a period longer than the particular period associated with the short-term browsing history).
- short-term browsing history may provide more insight into a user identifier's interests surrounding the event. For example, a user may have a long-term interest in professional football. However, the user may have a short-term interest in purchasing flowers for his wife's birthday. Analyzing the user's short-term browsing history surrounding his online purchase of flowers may exclude the topic of football from being associated with the purchase of flowers. According to various implementations, the short-term browsing histories may be determined for the entire set of user identifiers or for a subset of the user identifiers (e.g., a random sampling of the user identifiers, a subset selected up to a predetermined amount of user identifiers, etc.).
- Process 300 includes training a behavioral model (block 306 ).
- the browsing history data associated with the user identifiers in the received set may be used to train a behavioral model.
- the behavioral model may determine commonalities among the online behaviors associated with the user identifiers. For example, a large number of user identifiers that purchase organic peanut butter from a retailer may have recently visited a web page devoted to a recipe for an all-organic peanut butter and banana sandwich. Such a characteristic may be used to identify other user identifiers that are also likely to become associated with purchasing organic peanut butter from the retailer.
- Process 300 includes using the model to identify similar user identifiers to those in the received set (block 308 ).
- the set of similar user identifiers may include device identifiers (e.g., cookies, unique device IDs, etc.) or other information that may be used to determine that a user identifier in the set of similar user identifiers is being used to request a web page.
- the set of similar user identifiers may be provided to an advertiser and used by the advertiser to select relevant advertisements.
- the set of similar user identifiers may be provided to an advertising server that conducts an advertising auction (block 310 ).
- An advertiser may utilize the set of similar user identifiers to adjust auction bids to provide an advertisement to those user identifiers.
- a user identifier that visits a web page devoted to plumbing repairs may have a browsing history similar to that of user identifiers associated with purchasing copper tubing.
- advertisers may participate in an auction to place an advertisement on the web page. In such a case, an advertiser may place a higher bid in the auction to provide an advertisement for copper tubing to the user identifier.
- Process 400 includes receiving (for example for storage in a memory) a plurality of different models (e.g., M 1 , M 2 , . . . M n ) (step 402 ).
- the plurality of different models can comprise any number or type of models.
- a model is a description of observed or predicted behavior of some system, simplified by ignoring certain details. Models allow complex systems, both existent and merely specified, to be understood and their behavior predicted. A model may be used as the basis for simulation.
- Each model is individually configured to receive a first set of network user identifiers, feature data associated with each network user identifier in the first set of network user identifiers, and a set of potential similar user identifiers that do not appear in the first set of network user identifiers (e.g., a pool of potential similar user identifiers, in the advertising network, who may or may not be similar user identifiers), and to generate a second set of network user identifiers (e.g., a set of similar user identifiers) based on the features of the first set of network user identifiers.
- Information contained in the models can be manually compiled and loaded into the system memory or automatically obtained from a program that tracks internet browsing activity for user identifiers that allow such tracking.
- Each of the plurality of different models includes feature data and corresponding feature weight data.
- the corresponding feature weight data is fixed within each model and may relate to the weight each feature data of the model will be given when the representative model is generated.
- Feature data can comprise information that describes if a network user belongs on the first set of network user identifiers.
- feature data for each network user identifier in the first set of network user identifiers include, but are not limited to, web pages visited, topics in the web pages, salient keywords in the web pages, word clusters in the web pages, advertisements displayed on the web pages, advertisements clicked on, search terms entered for searches performed, products purchased, user identifiers' geography, user identifiers' demography, etc.
- information relating to the user identifier's name, geography, demographics, etc. may not be used by the advertisement server unless the user opts in to providing such information. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the advertisement server.
- the feature data associated with a model may include word clusters.
- the content of a web page may be determined using word clusters.
- a word cluster may be a set of words that convey the same or similar ideas.
- a word cluster may be a set of synonyms, according to some implementations.
- the text of a web page may include the word “hotel.”
- a word cluster that includes the word “hotel” may be as follows:
- cluster — 1 ⁇ inn, hotel, hostel, lodge, motel, public house, spa ⁇
- a cluster may be used to identify web pages devoted to the same topic, but use different terminology to do so.
- a word cluster may include words that have related, but different meanings.
- a characteristic of a web page may be a set of different word clusters. For example, the word “Seattle” may be part of a second word cluster that includes related terms:
- cluster n 2 ⁇ Seattle, Emerald City, Seatown, Rain City, Gateway to the Pacific ⁇
- a set of word clusters representing a web page may be as follows:
- Such a cluster may be used to classify the web page as being related to hotels in Seattle.
- a word cluster may be determined by a content analysis engine.
- the content analysis engine may be a clustering tool that gathers sets of words that relate to a common semantic concept. The engine may identify semantic similarity among documents, keywords, web pages, advertisements, etc.
- a content analysis engine may contain a training component that defines sets of words that are related to specific topics or semantic concepts, e.g., baseball, photography, camping, etc.
- a content analysis engine may also contain a component that evaluates a text fragment and returns word sets that are likely to match the text fragment.
- the text fragment may be words, phrases or numbers in a search query, web page, and/or advertisement. For example, a content analysis engine may automatically analyze the content of a web page to determine that the content of the web page is related to car insurance.
- Process 400 includes identifying similar models within the plurality of different models (step 404 ).
- a computer examines the feature data and corresponding weight data of each model of the plurality of different models and measures a similarity between the plurality of different models.
- the similarity between the plurality of different models can be measured in different ways (e.g., alternative methods 404 A, 404 B and 404 C), as will be described. Since models can have tens, hundreds, or thousands of different features and weights, using a computer to do the calculations needed to determine similarity can make the process feasible.
- a computer executes a cosine similarity algorithm to determine the similarity between the plurality of different models (step 404 A).
- Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors by measuring the cosine of the angle between them.
- each model represents the network user identifiers as a set of feature vectors.
- a feature vector refers to an nth dimensional vector of feature data of a network user.
- Cosine similarity is calculated according to the Equation 1 below:
- M 1 and M 2 are two different models.
- the resulting similarity ranges from ⁇ 1, meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating independence.
- the values in between ⁇ 1 and 1 indicate intermediate similarity.
- the advertising system may set a predetermined similarity threshold value. If the cosine similarity exceeds the predetermined similarity threshold value, the models are considered similar.
- Model 1 has features golf, wine tasting, and bicycling with corresponding weights 0.2, 0.9, and 0.5, respectively.
- Model 2 has features golf, wine tasting, and cooking with corresponding weights 0.3, 0.4, 0.9.
- Model 1 can be represented by the vector [0.2, 0.9, 0.5, 0] where the zero is the weight for the cooking feature, which is absent in Model 1.
- Model 2 can be represented by the vector [0.3, 0.4, 0, 0.9] where the zero is the weight for the bicycling feature, which is absent in Model 2.
- Equation 1 the cosine similarity between Model 1 and Model 2 is 0.39, indicating that the models are similar.
- Model 1 has Model 1 has features golf, wine tasting, and bicycling with corresponding weights 0.2, 0.9, and 0.5, respectively.
- Model 2 has features golf, mystery books, and cooking with corresponding weights 0.3, 0.4, 0.9.
- Model 1 can be represented by the vector [0.2, 0.9, 0.5, 0, 0] where the zeroes are the weights for the mystery books and cooking features, which are absent in Model 1.
- Model 2 can be represented by the vector [0.3, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.9] where the zeroes are the weights for the wine tasting and bicycling features, which are absent in Model 2.
- Equation 1 the cosine similarity between Model 1 and Model 2 is 0.06, indicating that the models are less similar than in the previous example. In fact, since the cosine similarity is close to 0, the models are nearly independent of each other.
- the similarity between the plurality of different models is measured by comparing advertiser based features of each model (step 504 B). For example, if a model is associated with an advertiser that sells a category of goods or services, the model may be determined to be similar to models associated with advertisers who also sell within that category of goods or services. The premise of this assumption is that two similar advertisers would prefer to target a nearly identical audience. Therefore, the models should be similar. In some implementations, models are determined to be similar if the advertisers are classified in the same advertising category. In other implementations, based on the features present in the model, particularly, the word clusters, the processing circuit may calculate a similarity value for the models.
- Both word clusters share the words “drink”, “soda” and “pop” indicating that both models are targeting soft drink consumers, but cluster — 1 includes the word “cola” and cluster — 2 includes the words “lime” and “lemon.”
- the inclusion of these words may result in a lower correlation, although it indicates that the models may simply be associated with network user identifiers associated with drinking different soda flavors.
- Beverage Company 3 has a set of network user identifiers associated with drinking juice, the set associated with a model, the corresponding feature data and weight data should have some similarities and differences from Beverage Company 1 and Beverage Company 2 because of the different audiences.
- cluster — 3 includes the words “juice” and “smoothie”, which indicates that Beverage Company 3 may be focused on providing relevant content to a different audience, for example, an audience that drinks healthy smoothies instead of soda.
- Cluster — 3 includes the word “fruit” which is similar to the words “lemon” or “lime” in cluster — 2, indicating that Beverage Company 3 may be more similar to Beverage Company 2 than Beverage Company 1, which was focused on the cola flavor. This approach may result in a lower correlation if the advertisers have multiple sets of network user identifiers with different characteristics (e.g., sets associated with different flavors of soda, coupons for different products, etc.).
- the processing circuit may calculate a similarity value based on the feature data and weight data of the models. If the similarity value exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the processing circuit identifies the advertisers to be similar.
- the similarity between the plurality of different models is measured by scoring a sample set of network user identifiers by each of the models, measuring the overlap between positive predictions and negative predictions for each model, and measuring the degree of overlap (step 404 C).
- the processing circuit compiles a set of randomly selected user identifiers.
- the network user identifiers in the set of randomly selected user identifiers are randomly selected from two sets: 1) a set of network user identifiers that appear in a set of network user identifiers associated with any of the plurality of different models, and 2) a set of network user identifiers that do not appear in the set of network user identifiers associated with any of the plurality of different models.
- the set of network user identifiers that do not appear in the set of network user identifiers associated with any of the plurality of different models may be comprised, for example, of network user identifiers appearing in a set of network user identifiers associated with any model that is not the focus of the comparison, subject to the user opting out.
- step 404 C will be described with two models, Model 1 and Model 2, but this does not limit the number of models that can be compared. For example, consider three network user identifiers, user1, user2, and user3. User1 is in a set associated with Model 1, User2 is in a set associated with Model2, and User3 has not been in the set associated with either Model 1 or Model2.
- User3 exists in an advertisement display network, for example, in a set associated with Model3.
- the first set from which network user identifiers can be randomly selected consists of ⁇ user1 user2 ⁇ , while the second set from which network user identifiers can be randomly selected consists of ⁇ user 3 ⁇ .
- each model within the plurality of different models is used to identify similar user identifiers from the pool of potential similar user identifiers appearing in the set of randomly selected user identifiers.
- a positive prediction occurs when a model identifies a network user identifier from a set of network user identifiers that appear in a set of network user identifiers associated with any of the plurality of different models.
- a negative prediction occurs when a model identifies a network user identifier that does not appear in a set of network user identifiers associated with any of the plurality of different models.
- a positive prediction may be the identification of user1 or user2 as a similar user identifier.
- a negative prediction may be the identification of user3 as a similar user identifier.
- the processing circuit identifies user3 as a negative prediction if user3's user identifier does not appear in the set of network user identifiers associated with Model 1 or Model 2.
- the similarity between each model is calculated based on the degree of overlap between positive predictions and negative predictions. For example, consider a set of randomly selected user identifiers that is comprised of five user identifiers from the set associated with Model 1 (M1 — 1, M1 — 2, M1 — 3, M1 — 4, M1 — 5), five user identifiers from the set associated with Model 2 (M2 — 1, M2 — 2, M2 — 3, M2 — 4, M2 — 5), and five user identifiers that do not appear in the set associated with either Model 1 or Model 2 (MX — 1, MX — 2, MX — 3, MX — 4, MX — 5). If Model 1 identifies 8 positive predictions (e.g.
- Model 2 identifies 7 positive predictions (e.g. M1 — 2, M1 — 3, M1 — 4, M2 — 2, M2 — 3, M2 — 4, M2 — 5) and 1 negative prediction (e.g. MX — 2) of similar user identifiers from set of randomly selected user identifiers, the models are considered similar because of the high degree of overlap between the positive predictions.
- Model 1 identifies 5 positive predictions (e.g.
- the advertising system may set a predetermined degree of overlap required for the models to be considered similar. In other words, if the degree of overlap between the models exceeds the predetermined value, the models may be considered similar, but if the degree of overlap between the models is less than the predetermined value, the models may be considered not similar.
- Process 400 includes generating a representative model to represent the similar models (step 406 ).
- the representative model is compiled and loaded into the system memory.
- the representative model may be generated in various ways (e.g., alternative methods 406 A, 406 B and 406 C).
- the representative model is generated by selecting any of the identified similar models to be the representative model (step 406 A). This approach assumes that since the models are similar, any model can be used to provide relevant content to a nearly identical audience.
- the representative model is generated from the pool of feature data and weight data from each of the similar models (step 406 B). In other words, the representative model will include every feature data present in each of the similar models with the weight data being determined by arithmetic average, weighted average, harmonic mean, or any other statistical measurement of the average.
- the representative model is generated by ranking the feature data represented by the similar models in order of importance and selectively picking the strongest feature data from each of the similar models according to the weight data associated with each feature data (step 406 C).
- feature strength may be measured by the magnitude of the weight data, the number of times a model has been trained on a feature data, revenue obtained by the model, the size of the set associated with a feature data, the quality of the set associated with a feature data, age of the feature data, etc.
- the magnitude of the weight data is proportional with the strength of the feature data. For example, the higher the magnitude, the stronger the feature.
- the number of times a model has been trained on a feature data may indicate the strength of a feature in that a feature that is present in the model for a longer, consistent period of time may be stronger than a feature that is present in the model once or twice.
- a feature that is present in the model once or twice may indicate network activity that occurs for only a short period of time.
- the revenue obtained by the model may indicate the strength of the feature data in that the model has led to more conversions.
- a conversion refers to a user, corresponding to a network user identifier, performing a certain action, typically, the purchase of a good or service. The higher the revenue obtained, the stronger the model, and thus, the feature data.
- the size of the set associated with a feature data may correlate to the strength of the feature data in that the larger the set, the less strong a feature data may be because of the increased number of feature data in the pool of feature data.
- a feature data that is consistently present in a large set may indicate that the feature data is strong.
- the quality of the set associated with the feature data may indicate the strength of the feature data in that the model has led to more conversions. This is different from measuring the revenue obtained by the model because conversions do not necessarily have to be the purchase of a good or service.
- Other examples of conversions include a user, corresponding to a network user identifier, creating a user profile on a web page, subscribing to receive marketing offers (e.g., by providing a postal or email address, by providing a telephone number, etc.), or downloading software from a web page.
- a high quality set leads to a high number of conversions, indicating that the feature data is strong.
- the age of the feature data also indicate the strength of the feature data.
- Newer models are considered fresher than older models (e.g. models that represent network behavior associated with a period before the period associated with the newer models).
- Feature data that is present in newer models may be stronger than the feature data present in older models because the newer models are better indicators of current trends in network behavior.
- the representative model may be optimized by continuing to select different numbers of feature data from the similar models. For example, if the similar models include 10 feature data with corresponding weight data, the representative model may be comprised of the 5 features with the highest weight data. To optimize the representative model, feature data can be added or deleted. For example, the representative model may be changed to include the 6 features with the highest weight data or the 4 features with the highest weight data, instead of the 5 features with the highest weight data.
- the representative model can be used to generate a second set of similar network user identifiers (step 408 ) in a way similar to step 308 described in process 300 ( FIG. 3 ).
- Using the representative model to generate the second set of similar network user identifiers for each set associated with the plurality of similar models used to generate the representative model results in moderate to significant memory space savings, depending on the diversity of the advertisers. Specifically, instead of saving a plurality of nearly identical, similar models, a serving system will only have to store the representative model. While it is possible to compress the size of the models or only load one model at a time, the implementations disclosed above render these alternatives unnecessary.
- the processing circuit may generate display data configured to display the second set of similar network user identifiers.
