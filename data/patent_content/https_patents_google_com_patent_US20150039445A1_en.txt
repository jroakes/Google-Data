FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing an example of a system 100 for auctioning in-stream ad space. In-stream ad space may include one or more ad spaces in a video stream, audio stream, and/or audio and video stream. In general, advertisement (“ad”) space may be associated with different types of media such as print media (e.g., newspaper, magazine), a website, a video stream, an audio stream, an audio/video stream, and/or any other location in presented content. Accordingly,ad spaces 120 may include different types of ad space such as in-stream ad space, Web-page ad space, print-media ad space, and/or anyother ad spaces 120. In some implementations, a plurality ofad spaces 120 of different types may be associated as a unit, which then can be (e.g., auctioned) to advertisers 102. A publisher may have a rate for an advertisement based, at least in part, on attributes of an associated ad space. Such attributes may include one or more of the following: size, amount of text, publication date, publication, section in publication (e.g., News, Sports, Home & Garden), location, type of advertisement (e.g., For-Profit, Non-Profit, Government), time, date, Nielson Rating, and/or other aspects associated with an advertisement and/or publication. A publisher may be willing to sell ad space at a price less than the specified rate. In some implementations, to facilitate the offer and acceptance process in this case, thead server 106 may provide an auction (e.g., on-line auction) of thead spaces 120 to theadvertisers 102 a-c of thepublishers 104 a-c. - At a high level, the system 100, in some implementations, may include the
advertisers 102, thepublishers 104, and thead server 106 coupled through anetwork 108. Theadvertisers 102 a-c are any devices (e.g., computing devices) operable to connect or communicate with thepublishers 104, thead server 106 or thenetwork 108 using any communication link. Eachadvertiser 102 includes, executes, or otherwise presents a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and comprises an electronic device operable to receive, transmit, process and store any appropriate data associated with system 100. While the illustrated implementation includesadvertisers 102 a-c, system 100 may include any number ofadvertisers 102 communicably coupled toad server 106. Further, “advertiser 102” and “user” may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, for ease of illustration, eachadvertiser 102 is described in terms of being used by one user. But this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one device or that one user may use multiple devices. - As used in this disclosure, a user of
advertiser 102 is any person, department, organization, small business, enterprise, or any other entity that may use or request others to use system 100.Advertiser 102 is intended to encompass a personal computer, touch screen terminal, workstation, network computer, kiosk, wireless data port, smart phone, personal data assistant (PDA), one or more processors within these or other devices, or any other suitable processing or electronic device used by a user, for example, for viewing content frompublisher 104. For example,advertiser 102 may be a PDA operable to wirelessly connect with an external or unsecured network. In another example,advertiser 102 may comprise a laptop that includes an input device, such as a keypad, touch screen, mouse, or other device that can accept information, and an output device that conveys information associated with an advertisement ofad server 106, including digital data, visual information, or GUI. Both the input device and output device may include fixed or removable storage media such as a magnetic computer disk, CD-ROM, or other suitable media to both receive input from and provide output to users ofadvertisers 102 through the display, namely the client portion of GUI. - GUI comprises a graphical user interface operable to allow the user of
advertiser 102 to interface with at least a portion of system 100 for any suitable purpose, such as bidding in an on-line auction for thead spaces 120. Generally, GUI provides the particular user with an efficient and user-friendly presentation of data provided by or communicated within system 100. GUI may comprise a plurality of customizable frames or views having interactive fields, pull-down lists, and buttons operated by the user. For example, the GUI can be operable to display certain network ads in a user-friendly form based on the user context and the displayed data. GUI may also present a plurality of portals or dashboards. It should be understood that the term graphical user interface may be used in the singular or in the plural to describe one or more graphical user interfaces and each of the displays of a particular graphical user interface. Indeed, reference to GUI may indicate a reference to the front-end or a component of anauction engine 134, as well as the particular interface accessible viaadvertiser 102, as appropriate, without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Therefore, GUI contemplates any graphical user interface, such as a generic web browser or touch screen, that processes information in system 100 and presents the results to the user.Ad server 106 can accept data fromadvertiser 102 via a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) and return the appropriate HTML or XML responses to thebrowser using network 108. -
Publisher 104 comprises an electronic device (e.g., computing device) operable to receive, transmit, process and store data associated with system 100. In the illustrated implementation,publisher 104 provides information associated withad spaces 120 toad server 106. Ad-space information comprises or otherwise identifies attributes ofad spaces 120 that may be purchased frompublisher 104. For example, ad-space information may identify or include one or more of the following: a publisher, ad sizes, media types, bundled ad spaces, time, date, different sections included in the media, circulation numbers, viewer numbers, a rates quoted by thepublisher 104, and/or any other parameters associated with an advertisement and/or media. In some implementations, ad-space information may include information identifyingavailable ad space 120, packages ofdifferent ad space 120, reserves for the packages, as well as other information. In some examples, ad-space information may indicate that apublisher 104 never accepts a bid less than a certain percentage (e.g., 50%) of the specified rate. In some implementations, ad-space information may merely include a history of offers, acceptances, and/or rejections and associated parameters (e.g., offer price, ad-space attributes) for various ad space. -
Ad server 106 comprises an electronic device (e.g., computing device) operable to receive, transmit, process and store data associated with system 100.Ad server 106 can be implemented using computers other than servers, as well as a server pool. Indeed,ad server 106 may be any computer, electronic or processing device such as, for example, a blade server, general-purpose personal computer (PC), Macintosh, workstation, Unix-based computer, or any other suitable device. In other words,ad server 106 may include computers other than general purpose computers as well as computers without conventional operating systems.Ad server 106 may be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux, UNIX, Windows Server, or any other suitable operating system. In some implementations,ad server 106 may also include or be communicably coupled with a web server and/or a mail server. -
Ad server 106 includesmemory 116 and aprocessor 118.Memory 116 may be a local memory and include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non-volatile memory including, without limitation, magnetic media, optical media, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), removable media, or any other suitable local or remote memory component. In the illustrated implementation,memory 116 includesad spaces 120,ad packages 122,auction displays 124, and content (e.g., in-print ads 125 and in-stream ads 126), but may include other information without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Here,ad space 120 refers to ad space and associated parameters for ad space in content such as newspapers, magazines, websites, video, audio, and other media.Local memory 116 may also include any other appropriate data such as applications or services, firewall policies, a security or access log, print or other reporting files, HTML files or templates, data classes or object interfaces, child software applications or sub-systems, and others. -
Ad space 120 include any parameters, pointers, variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, files, links, or other data for identifying ad space that may be purchased frompublisher 104 for presenting secondary content. As discussed above,ad space 120 may include or otherwise identify one or more of the following attributes associated with ad space: size, amount of text, publication date, publication, section in publication (e.g., News, Sports, Home & Garden), location, type of advertisement (e.g., For-Profit, Non-Profit, Government), duration, television show, time, date, in-stream location, and/or other aspects associated with an advertisement and/or publication. For example,ad space 120 may identify a newspaper, sections, sizes, days, rate cards, and other parameters associated with advertising in the newspaper. In another example,ad space 120 may identify a video, an in-stream location, date, time, specified amount, and other parameters associated with a streaming video. In some implementations,ad space 120 may identify mathematical and/or logical expressions for determining a rate for a certain type of ad space. For instance,ad space 120 may identify a value associated with each of the various attributes and the expression may determine the rate using these values and an associated expression. Eachad space 120 may be associated with a specific publisher, a specific publication, a specific network, a specific video, and/or a plurality ofad space 120 may be associated with a single publisher, a single publication a specific network, or a specific video. In some implementations,ad space 120 may be formatted, stored, or defined as various data structures in text files, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) files, flat files, Btrieve files, comma-separated-value (CSV) files, internal variables, or one or more libraries. For example, aparticular ad space 120 may merely be a pointer to a third party ad space file stored remotely. In short,ad space 120 may comprise one table or file or a plurality of tables or files stored on one computer or across a plurality of computers in any appropriate format. Indeed, some or all ofad space 120 may be local or remote without departing from the scope of this disclosure and store any type of appropriate data. -
Processor 118 executes instructions and manipulates data to perform operations ofad server 106. AlthoughFIG. 1 illustrates asingle processor 118 inserver 106,multiple processors 118 may be used according to particular needs, and reference toprocessor 118 is meant to includemultiple processors 118 where applicable. In the illustrated implementation,processor 118 executes apackage engine 132 and anauction engine 134 at any appropriate time such as, for example, in response to a request or input from a user ofserver 106 or any appropriate computer system coupled withnetwork 108. - The
package engine 132 includes any software, hardware, and/or firmware, or combination thereof, operable to associated one ormore ad spaces 120 as anad package 122 or unit to be sold (e.g., auctioned) to theadvertisers 102. For example, thepackage engine 132 may associate, asad package 122, an in-print ad space 120 and an in-stream ad space 120 of apublisher 104 for auction toadvertisers 102. In general thepackage engine 132 may perform one or more of the following functions: automatically generates one ormore ad packages 122 in response to an event (e.g., request, period of time, receipt of ad space 120), identifies one ormore ad spaces 120 associated with apublisher 120, associates one ormore ad spaces 120 based on appropriate parameter(s) (e.g., date of display, proximity of media), and/or other functions usingad space 120. In some implementations, thepackage engine 132 associates thead spaces 120 in thead package 122 with a period of time for simultaneously displaying ads in thead spaces 120. For example, thepackage engine 132 may associate abanner ad space 120 and an in-stream ad space 120 for displaying a banner while presenting an in-stream ad. For example, the in-stream ad space 120 may be associated with a computer monitor, a display in a lobby, a television, or other suitable displays. In some implementations, thepackage engine 132 associates thead package 122 with a geographic location for proximately displaying thead spaces 120. For example, thepackage engine 132 may associate abanner ad space 120 and an in-stream ad space 120 such that a banner ad is displayed on a PDA and an in-stream ad is presented on a display in a lobby in response to the PDA and the display being within a specified proximity. In some implementations, thepackage engine 132 may predict or estimate the number of avails associated with the ad packages 122. In some implementations, thepackage engine 132 may associatead spaces 120 that are a surplus that thepublisher 104 was unable or did not directly sell toadvertisers 102. - The
auction engine 134 includes any software, hardware, and/or firmware, or combination thereof, operable to present ad packages 122 toadvertisers 102 for sale (e.g., auction). Though reference is made to an auction, other forms of transactions are contemplated including direct sales, reservations, and the like. Theauction engine 134 may populate anauction display 124 with information from one ormore ad packages 122 for presenting through and receiving bids through GUI 110. In general, theauction engine 134 may perform one or more of the following functions: receive a request for available packages fromadvertisers 102, identify one ormore ad packages 122 based, at least in part, on the request, identify at least oneauction display 124 for presenting information associated with identifiedad packages 122, populate anauction display 124 in accordance ad packages 122, and transmit theauction display 124 including information at least associated with the ad packages 122 toadvertisers 102. In some implementations, theauction engine 134 presents the ad packages 122 toadvertisers 102 in the auction displays 124. The auction displays 124 may allowadvertisers 102 to bid onad packages 122 provided by thepublishers 104. In some implementations, thepublishers 104 directly sell ad space to theadvertisers 102 and provide the remaining ad space to thead server 106 to auction ad packages 122 using theauction engine 134. Alternatively or in combination, thepublishers 104 may directly sell some of the ad spaces after or during the on-line ad auction, such as by directly selling the remaining ad spaces after theauction engine 134 processes bids from theadvertisers 102. - Regardless of the particular implementation, “software,” as used herein, may include software, firmware, wired or programmed hardware, or any combination thereof as appropriate. Indeed, the
package engine 132 and theauction engine 134 may be written or described in any appropriate computer language including C, C++, Java, J#, Visual Basic, assembler, Perl, any suitable version of 4GL, as well as others. It will be understood that while thepackage engine 132 and theauction engine 134 are illustrated inFIG. 1 as modules, each of thepackage engine 132 and theauction engine 134 may include numerous sub-modules or may instead be a single multi-tasked module that implements the various features and functionality through various objects, methods, or other processes. Further, while illustrated as internal toserver 106, one or more processes associated with thepackage engine 132 and/or theauction engine 134 may be stored, referenced, or executed remotely. Moreover, thepackage engine 132 and/or theauction engine 134 may be a child or sub-module of another software module or enterprise application (not illustrated) without departing from the scope of this disclosure. -
Ad server 106 may also include an interface for communicating with other devices, such asadvertisers 102, overnetwork 108 in a client-server or other distributed environment. In some implementations,ad server 106 receives data from internal or external senders through the interface for storage inlocal memory 116 and/or processing byprocessor 118. Generally, the interface comprises logic encoded in software and/or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate withnetwork 108. More specifically, the interface may comprise software supporting one or more communications protocols associated withcommunications network 108 or hardware operable to communicate physical signals. -
Network 108 facilitate wireless or wireline communication betweenserver 106 and any other local or remote device, such asadvertisers 102.Network 108 may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network. While illustrated as single network,network 108 may be a continuous network logically divided into various sub-nets or virtual networks without departing from the scope of this disclosure, so long as at least portion ofnetwork 108 may facilitate communications betweenserver 106 and at least oneadvertiser 102. In some implementations,network 108 encompasses any internal or external network, networks, sub-network, or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various devices in system 100.Network 108 may communicate, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets, Frame Relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells, voice, video, data, and other suitable information between network addresses.Network 108 may include one or more local area networks (LANs), radio access networks (RANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), all or a portion of the global computer network known as the Internet, and/or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations. - In one aspect of operation, one or
more publishers 104 transmit information identifying available ad space toad server 106. Thead server 106 generates and/or updates one ormore ad spaces 120 based, at least in part, on the received information. In response to an event (e.g., request, period of time, receiving ad space information), thepackage engine 132 identifiesad spaces 120 and generates one or more ad space packages 122 based on any appropriate criteria (e.g., date, time, location). In response to at least a request from anadvertiser 102, theauction engine 134 may identify one ormore ad packages 122 based, at least in part, on the request. For example, the request may identify a television show, a video, and/or other multimedia. Using the request, theauction engine 134 may identify one ormore ad packages 122 includingad space 120 in the identified media. Theauction engine 134 identifies at least oneauction display 124 for presentingad packages 122 and receiving bids for ad packages 122. Theauction engine 134 transmits theauction display 124 to the requestingadvertiser 102 to receive bids for ad packages 122. -
FIGS. 2 and 3 are flow charts showing examples ofmethods 200 and 300, respectively. Themethods 200 and 300 may be performed, for example, by a system such as the system 100 and, for clarity of presentation, the description that follows uses the system 100 as the basis of an example for describing themethods 200 and 300. However, another system, or combination of systems, may be used to perform themethods 200 and 300. -
FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 200 for auctioning in-stream ad spaces or ad spaces. The process 200 begins at step 202 where information identifying ad spaces associated with a publisher is received. For example, thead server 106 may receive information from thepublisher 104 a identifying ad spaces associated with thepublisher 104 a. Alternatively or in combination, a third party may send information regarding ad spaces that the third party provides and the third party ad spaces are associated with content provided by thepublisher 104 a. Thead server 106 stores the ad space information in one ormore ad spaces 120. One ormore ad spaces 120 may identify in-stream ad spaces, such as an ad space in a video presentation or an audio presentation. In some implementations, one ormore ad spaces 120 identify an in-page ad space, such as an ad space on a web page. - At step 204, one or more ad spaces are associated as a unit. For example, the
package engine 132 may associate one ormore ad spaces 120 as an ad unit such as ad packages 122. In some implementations, the association may include a period of time for simultaneously displaying ads in the associated ad spaces in two or more different media types, such as a web page and a video presentation. For example, an Internet café can present in-stream ad spaces using a video presentation device and in-print ad spaces in a Web page using a computer device. In some implementations, the two or more media types, such as the in-stream ad space and the in-page ad space, are associated with a geographic location for proximately displaying ads, such as the video presentation device and the computer device in the Internet café. The ad units are presented for sale (e.g., auction) to one or more advertisers atstep 206. For example, theauction engine 134 may identify anauction display 124 for presenting the ad packages 122 to theadvertisers 102. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing anexample method 300 for selling (e.g., auctioning) ad space, so as to, for example, dispose of a surplus of ad spaces.Method 300 begins at step 302 where information identifying a first subset of ad spaces associated with a publisher is identified. For example, thead server 106 may receive from thepublisher 104 a information regarding a first subset of ad spaces. At step 304, information identifying a second subset of ad spaces (e.g., those sold by the publisher) is received. For example, thead server 106 may receive, from thepublisher 104 a, information indicating a second subset of the ad spaces where sold directly toadvertisers 102. The first subset of ad spaces are offered for sale (e.g., through an online-auction) at step 306. For example, theauction engine 134 may present the first subset of thead spaces 120 through one or more auction displays 124. Theadvertisers 102 may provide the in-print ads and the in-stream ads for presentation in thead spaces 120. Alternatively or in combination, thepublishers 104 may compete for ad placements in thead spaces 120 and/orad packages 122 with thepublisher 104. - Although this disclosure has been described in terms of some implementations and generally associated methods, alterations and permutations of these implementations and methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the above description of example implementations does not define or constrain this disclosure. Other changes, substitutions, and alterations are also possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
