Abstract
A messaging campaign integration system for generating a composite campaign, including integrating user created content, is disclosed herein. The composite email includes content generated for distribution to a set of end users. A content creator can specify content to be integrated in composite emails being sent to desired end users. An integration component can integrate the specified created content based on a content creator's preference. A composite email, including the specified content, can be sent to the desired end users.
Description
- This disclosure generally relates to generating emails including integrating personalized content into digest emails based on user specific data.
- Electronic mail (hereinafter “email”) is one of the most widely used communication tools. Digest emails are often employed to summarize a corpus of communications activity (e.g., emails, notifications, alerts . . . ) association with numerous individual communications. Email digests facilitate keeping users updated on content being followed without being inundated with notifications. Digest emails can be sent to users that have affinity to a subject of the digest emails. Digest emails can be sent to a number of target users through an email campaign.
- An email campaign can target desired users through user subscriptions or user enrollment in the campaign. Email campaigns can generate generic digest emails to be sent to users.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate the scope of any particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented in this disclosure.
- Mail digests are periodically sent to users or subscribers of a particular service or website. In a social media context, email digests can be personalized with content based on a user's affinity to the content. For example, in a video sharing network, a user can subscribe to a channel; and an email can be generated to send to the user that features content of the subscribed to channel. A messaging campaign system can receive content, such as content exemplified above, from a plurality of content creators. The messaging campaign system can generate messages based on stored analytical information. For example, the messaging campaign system can create digest emails for users based on the respective users' affinities to certain content.
- The messaging campaign system can determine a user's affinity to content based on the analytical information. For example, a user can “like,” follow, or subscribe to a content channel and/or the messaging campaign system can store the user's access history. In another aspect, the messaging campaign system can receive content created for digest messages and settings for the digest messages. The messaging campaign system can generate personalized messages utilizing the content created for the digest messages and the settings. For example, a content creator may desire that a particular video is only delivered to users within a particular age range that also have affinity to the content creator. The messaging campaign system can generate digest emails and automatically integrate personalized messages into the digest emails for users meeting the above criteria.
- When a user has affinity to multiple content providers, the messaging campaign system can determine which content provider's message to integrate, where to integrate a content provider's messages, and the like. The messaging campaign system can further provide tools to assist content creators and improve quality and performance of messages. A ranking tool can employ a variety of signals to evaluate performance of text, performance of the creator's previous messaging campaigns, performance of the creator's proposed campaign in a random “canary” set of users to whom the campaign is sent first, the creator's overall brand-safety scores, and the like. An advice tool can provide content creators with determined settings and designs for messages. In an example, the determined settings and design can be predetermined (e.g., based on prior messages). A reporting tool can receive information regarding messaging statistics, such as number of messages sent, number of messages opened, number of messages clicked, and number of messages shared with others.
- In another aspect, the messaging campaign system can include a pay system. The pay system can allow for various payment options. As one option, content providers can pay for campaigns based on number of emails sent, opened, or clicked. In a postpaid option, a content provider can be pilled after messages are sent, opened, or clicked. In a prepaid model, a content provider prepays a desired amount; as emails are generated, the messaging campaign system can check the content provider's balance. If the content provider's balance reaches zero or becomes negative, the messaging campaign system can halt sending of messages or finish sending the current campaign and generate a bill.
- The following description and the drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

For example, a policy can be based on targeting signals (e.g., such as targeting signals input to console component 616) associated with a messaging campaign and/or promotional campaign. As another example, an approval criterion can indicate whether or not a word is a bad word based on a demographic of a target audience associated with a campaign.
- At 1008 the computing device (e.g., approval component 628) can determine whether or not content of the messaging campaign meets approval criterion. Determining whether or not content of the messaging campaign meets the approval criterion can be based on the analysis of the messaging campaign and the determined approval criterion. If it is determined that the content is approved,
method 1000 can continue to 1016. If it is determined that the content is not approved,method 1000 can continue to 1010. - At 1010, a messaging campaign, that is determined not to be approved, can be removed, by the computing device (e.g., approval component 628), from consideration for at least one of matching or integrating. For example, a rejected or not approved message can be determined to be a bad and/or inappropriate message. Therefore, the message should not be distributed and need not be considered for matching and/or integration.
- At 1012, a creator of the messaging campaign can be notified, by a computing device (e.g., approval component 628) through an interface (e.g., interface component 312), that the messaging campaign is not approved. Notifying can include generation and sending of an email, causing an interface to display a message, and the like. In an aspect, notifying can include notifying a reason for not approving the messaging campaign (e.g., inappropriate settings, bad words, bad formatting, etc.).
- At 1014, the computing device (e.g., approval component 628) can receive an appeal relating to the messaging campaign being not approved. 1014 can include receiving input from a content creator indicating the content creator desires to appeal the rejection of the messaging campaign. For example, a content creator can select an appeal option, e.g., in an interface, and can provide optional comments. In response to receiving input representing an appeal,
method 1000 can apply a policy to re-analyze the messaging campaign and/or elevate determining whether or not to approve a messaging campaign to another resource, such as a human interacting with a device. - At 1016, the messaging campaign can be matched and/or integrated by the computing device (e.g.,
