Fig. 8 illustrates that the typical case that intelligent controller operates controls environment wherein.As mentioned above, intelligent controller 802 receives control inputs from user or other entity 804, and using the Control and Schedule of these control inputs and storage and out of Memory to produce output control signal 805, this output control signal 805 controls the operation of one or more controlled entity 808.The operation of controlled entity can change the environment embedded by sensor 810-812.Sensor exports or feedback to intelligent controller 802 Returning sensor.Based on this feedback, intelligent controller amendment exports control signal to realize the one or more specific objectives for controlled system operation.In essence, intelligent controller exports control signal according to two different feedback loop amendments.First feedback loop the most direct comprises coming the output of sensor, and controller can use this output determine output control signal subsequently or control output modifications, to realize the re-set target for controlled system operation.In many cases, second feedback loop relates to the environment of user or other feedback 816, and this feedback 816 causes the user subsequently for intelligent controller 802 to control and scheduling input conversely.In other words, user can be regarded as exporting instant steering order and Control and Schedule change but not the sensor of other type that exports of raw sensor, maybe can be regarded as the parts of more senior feedback loop.
There is many dissimilar sensors and sensor output.Usually, sensor export to the parameter of some types, machine state, structural state, computing mode or physical environment parameter directly or indirectly relevant.Fig. 9 illustrates the general characteristic that sensor exports.As shown in Figure 90 of first in Fig. 92, sensor can export the signal (representing with curve 904) along with time variations, and this signal and the parameter P drawn about the longitudinal axis 906 are directly or indirectly relevant.Sensor can continuously or compartment of terrain output signal, the time of output draws about transverse axis 908.In some cases, sensor output can be relevant to two or more parameters.Such as, in Figure 91 0, the parameter P that sensor output value is different from two in time
1and P
2directly or be indirectly correlated with, parameter P
1with parameter P
2be draw about axle 912 and axle 914 respectively, the time draws about the longitudinal axis 916.In the following discussion, for the purpose of simplifying the description and discuss, suppose sensor generation and single parameter directly or indirectly relevant output, as in Figure 90 2 in fig .9.In the following discussion, suppose that sensor exports as one group of parameter value for parameter P.This parameter can be relevant to ambient conditions, and ambient conditions is such as temperature, ambient light levels, sound level and other this class feature.But this parameter also can be one or more positions of machine part, the pressure of memory storage address data mode in a data storage device, the flow rate of electric current, gas or fluid of drawing from power supply, gas or fluid and comprise the parameter of other types many of the useful information for controlling object.
Figure 10 A-Figure 10 D illustrates intelligent controller handled information with producing during control operation.All these illustrate the figure of the Figure 90 2 be similar in Fig. 9, wherein, about the value of longitudinal axis rendering parameter or the value of another group relevant controlling, draw the time about transverse axis.Figure 10 A illustrates the idealized specification of the result for controlled entity operation.The longitudinal axis 1002 in Figure 10 A represents the parameter value P specified
s.Such as, when intelligent thermostat, this parameter value of specifying can be temperature.By contrast, for irrigation system, this parameter value of specifying can be flow velocity.Figure 10 A is the figure of the parameter value continuous curve 1004 in time representing expectation, and the parameter value that intelligent controller tends to be expected by these realizes the control to one or more equipment, machine or system.This this parameter value of specification indicative of desired is initially low 1006, then rises to relatively high value 1008, then drops to intermediate value 1010, rise to high value 1012 more afterwards.Control specification and visually can be displayed to user, as an example, be shown as Control and Schedule.
Figure 10 B illustrates another view of the Control and Schedule corresponding to the control specification shown in Figure 10 A or the view of coded data.Control and Schedule comprises the parameter value increase 1016 corresponding to the edge 1018 in Figure 10 A, the parameter value reduction 1020 corresponding to the edge 1022 in Figure 10 A and increases the instruction of 1024 corresponding to the parameter value at the edge 1016 in Figure 10 A.The direction arrow drawn in Figure 10 B can be regarded as set point change, or the instruction of the expectation Parameters variation at particular point in time place within certain period.
Set point change can be stored as the record with multiple field, and whether multiple field comprises field that whether instruction set point change is the set point that the set point that produces of system or user produce, instruction set point change is the field of the set point change of instant control inputs or the set point change of scheduling, the field of time and date of the establishment of instruction set point change, the field of the time and date of the last editor of instruction set point change and other this kind of field.In addition, set point can be associated with two or more parameter values.As an example, range set point can the scope of indication parameter value, and within the scope of this, intelligent controller should keep controlled environment.Set point change is commonly called " set point ".
Figure 10 C illustrates the control that intelligent controller exports, and it can come from the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 10 B.In detail in this figure, the amplitude exporting control signal is drawn about the longitudinal axis 1026.Such as, controlling to export can be the voltage signal exported to heating unit by intelligent thermostat, and high voltage signal indicates that heating unit is current should operate, and low voltage signal indicates heating system should not operate.Edge 1028 in Figure 10 C corresponds to the set point 1016 in Figure 10 B.The width of positive control output 1030 can be relevant with the length of the parameter value variation expected or amplitude, indicated by the length of set point arrow 1016.When obtaining the parameter value expected, intelligent controller does not continue output HIGH voltage signal, as represented with edge 1032.Set point 1020 in Figure 10 B and set point 1024 cause similar positive output control signal 1034 and export control signal 1036.
Finally, Figure 10 D illustrate observe as come from intelligent controller the sensor of the control of one or more controlled entity exported indicated by Parameters variation.In figure 10d, draw directly or indirectly relevant to parameter P sensor about the longitudinal axis 1040 to export.The level and smooth continuous curve 1042 of the parameter value observed represents.Although this continuous curve can be regarded as relevant with the initial specifications curve drawn in Figure 10 A, the curve of observation inaccurately mates this specification curve.First, the controlled entity parameter value variation representated by set point 1016 that limited a period of time 1044 may be spent to realize in Control and Schedule drawn in fig. 1 ob.And once obtain parameter value and controlled entity tends to discontinuous operation, then parameter value can start to decline 1046, form the control starting feedback and export with the operation recovering controlled entity, to keep the parameter value of expectation.Therefore, the senior constant parameter value 1008 of the expectation in Figure 10 A in fact may terminate with time dependent curve 1048, and this time dependent curve 1048 inaccurately corresponds to and controls specification 1004.Intelligent controller uses the above first order feedback discussed with reference to Fig. 8 to control one or more controlled entity, makes the parameter value observed in time as shown in Figure 10 D mate the time behavior of specifying of the parameter in Figure 10 A as closely as possible.The second level feedback control loop discussed with reference to Fig. 8 above can relate to the change of the specification that user carries out in time, as shown in Figure 10 A, utilize the change to the Control and Schedule stored, the input of instant steering order is utilized, to generate the specification of amendment, the specification of this amendment produces the parameter value/time curve of the operating result that reflection user expects.
Figure 11 A-Figure 11 C illustrates three kinds of dissimilar Control and Schedules.In Figure 11 A, Control and Schedule is the continuous curve 1102 of representative as the parameter value of the function of time, draws this parameter value, draw the time about transverse axis 1106 about the longitudinal axis 1104.This continuous curve only comprises horizontal component and vertical portion.Horizontal component represents to be expected the time period of parameters constant, and vertical portion represents the expectancy changes of the parameter value at particular point in time place.This is the Control and Schedule of simple types, and is used in hereinafter in the various examples of automatic Control and Schedule study.But automatic Control and Schedule learning method also can learn the scheduling compared with complicated type.Such as, Figure 11 B illustrates the Control and Schedule not only comprising horizontal segment and vertical section, also comprise straight-line segment at any angle.Therefore, utilize such Control and Schedule, the change of parameter value can be designated as and occur with given speed, but not be designated as the moment in the simple Control and Schedule as shown in Figure 11 A occurs.Automatic Control and Schedule learning method also can hold the Control and Schedule based on level and smooth continuous curve, such as Control and Schedule as shown in Figure 11 C.Usually, compared to the better simply Control and Schedule shown in Figure 11 B and Figure 11 A, the characteristic based on the Control and Schedule (such as Control and Schedule) as shown in Figure 11 C of smooth continuous curve describes and data encoding is more complicated and comprises more substantial storage data.
Set point change (being often called for short " set point ") is encoded into the record in electronic memory and/or mass-memory unit usually.
In the following discussion, hypothesis parameter value is without trending towards towards lower value release during Dynamic System usually, such as, when parameter value is temperature and controlled system is heating unit.But, in other cases, parameter value without can trend towards during Dynamic System towards high value release, such as, when parameter value is temperature and controlled system is air-conditioning.The direction of release often uses the direction compared with low-resource or expense corresponding to system.In still other cases, environment or other external condition can be depended in the direction of release, such as when parameter value for temperature and controlled system for comprise heating and refrigerating function both HVAC system time.
Forward the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 11 A to, the Control and Schedule 1102 that continuous curve represents can be encoded into the discrete set point corresponding to vertical portion or edge in continuous curve alternatively.In the following discussion, the Control and Schedule of usual use continuous curve represents the Control and Schedule of storage, Control and Schedule or the schedule creating interface provided by intelligent controller by user or remote entity of this storage create, or are created based on the instant control inputs of already present Control and Schedule, record and/or the combination of the sensing data of record or the information of these types by intelligent controller.
Graphically instant control inputs in the figure of parameter value to the time.Figure 12 A-Figure 12 G illustrates the diagram of instant control inputs, this instant control inputs can be received by intelligent controller and perform, then record and cover on Control and Schedule (such as above with reference to the Control and Schedule that Figure 11 A-Figure 11 C discusses), as the part that automatic Control and Schedule learns.Utilize the vertical line segment ending at little filling or shade circle, graphically instant control inputs.Figure 12 A illustrates the diagram of two instant control inputs 1202 and 1204.Instant control inputs is equivalent to the edge of Control and Schedule (such as shown in Figure 11 A) substantially, this Control and Schedule is input to this intelligent controller by the user or remote entity that perform input control immediately by expection intelligent controller, thus covers any current Control and Schedule of the operation of specifying intelligent controller.Therefore, instant control inputs is the real-time set point being input to intelligent controller by control inputs interface.
Because instant control inputs changes current Control and Schedule, so instant control inputs is associated with interim Control and Schedule subsequently usually, in fig. 12, this interim Control and Schedule is shown level and vertical dotted line, these dotted lines form the curve of interim Control and Schedule parameters versus time, and this curve extends forward in time from instant control inputs.Interim Control and Schedule 1206 and interim Control and Schedule 1208 are associated with the instant control inputs 1202 in Figure 12 A and instant control inputs 1204 respectively.
The example of interim Control and Schedule that Figure 12 B illustrates instant control inputs and is associated.Instant control inputs 1210 is essentially input set point, this input set point covers current Control and Schedule and instructs intelligent controller to control one or more controlled entity, to reach the parameter value of the ordinate of the filling circle 1212 in the diagram of control inputs when equaling in sight.Time in sight after control inputs, interim thermostatic control scheduling interval 1214 extends a period of time after instant control inputs, then utilizes instant control inputs terminal subsequently or set point subsequently 1216 that instant control inputs is discharged.In interval 1214, keep the time span of instant control inputs to be the parameter that automatic Control and Schedule learns.The direction of instant control inputs terminal set point 1216 subsequently and amplitude represent the parameter of one or more additional automatic Control and Schedule study.Note that the parameter that automatic Control and Schedule learns is adjustable parameter, it controls the operation of automatic Control and Schedule study, and is different from the one or more parameter values about time drafting comprising Control and Schedule.The parameter value about longitudinal axis drafting in the example Control and Schedule referenced by current discussion is directly or indirectly relevant with observed quantity, and observed quantity comprises ambient conditions, machine state etc.
Figure 12 C illustrates existing Control and Schedule, and instant control inputs is added on this existing Control and Schedule.This existing Control and Schedule requires the increase of parameter value P in point in the morning 7 (in Figure 12 C 1222), and this increase edge 1220 represents.Instant control inputs 1224 specifies the parameter value variation comparatively early of smallish a little amplitude.Figure 12 D-Figure 12 G illustrates various interim Control and Schedule subsequently, and it can obtain according to the currency of the parameter value that various differences realize and/or automatic Control and Schedule learns of intelligent controller logic.In Figure 12 D-Figure 12 G, utilize phantom line segments that the interim Control and Schedule be associated with instant control inputs is shown, the part of the existing Control and Schedule that instant control inputs covers is shown with a line segment.In a method, as indicated in fig. 12d, expectation parameter value indicated by instant control inputs 1224 is kept to reach regular time section 1226, after that time, interim Control and Schedule release (representing with the edge 1228) parameter value of specifying at the time point place of the instant control inputs of execution to Control and Schedule.This parameter value is kept 1230, until the set point of next scheduling, the set point of this next one scheduling corresponds to the edge 1232 in Figure 12 C, and intelligent controller recovers the control according to Control and Schedule at this some place.
In other method in fig. 12e, the parameter value specified by instant control inputs 1224 is kept 1232, until reach the set point of next scheduling, in this case, this set point corresponds to the edge 1220 in the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 12 C.At this next set point place, intelligent controller recovers the control according to existing Control and Schedule.
In diverse ways, as shown in Figure 12 F, intelligent controller keeps the parameter value specified by instant control inputs 1224 to reach regular time section 1234, and after this time period 1234, the parameter value that existing Control and Schedule has been specified at this time point place is resumed 1236.
In the method shown in Figure 12 G, the parameter value specified by instant control inputs 1224 is kept 1238, until reach set point reciprocal with instant control inputs, at this set point place, existing Control and Schedule is resumed 1240.In other alternative method, instant control inputs can be discharged into minimum rational rank further, to attempt about resource and/or the operation of energy expenditure optimization system.Usually be used in these methods between the invasion learning period, user has to select energetically to be greater than or less than the parameter value of the parameter value be associated with minimum or low energy or resource utilization.
In the example implementation that automatic Control and Schedule learns, intelligent controller monitors instant control inputs and scheduling change in the process of monitoring period, this monitoring period is usually consistent with the time interval that Control and Schedule or son dispatchs, while according to existing Control and Schedule (except changed by instant control inputs and input scheduling the part that covers) control one or more entity.At the end of the monitoring period, the data of record are added on existing Control and Schedule, and generate new temporary scheduling by the feature combining existing Control and Schedule and scheduling change and instant control inputs.Follow various types of resolution, new temporary scheduling is promoted to the existing Control and Schedule for future time intervals, and in this future time intervals, existing Control and Schedule is used for control system operation.
Figure 13 A-Figure 13 D illustrates the general background that the intelligent controller that the application relates to operates wherein.As shown in figure Figure 13 A, this background comprises region or holds district 1302, one or more intelligent controller 1304 and 1306 and control by described one or more intelligent controller and one or more equipment of operation on region or appearance district 1302, system or other entity 1306-1308.In many cases, intelligent controller is described as control area or holds district 1302, although in fact they directly control one or more equipment, system or other entity 1306-1308.Region or appearance district 1302 can be the synthesis regions in the subregion Huo Zirong district comprising multiple connection or separation or hold district.By a region of intelligent controller control, multiple region, a Ge Rong district or multiple appearance district hereinafter referred to as " controlled environment ".Intelligent controller can be positioned at environment, as the intelligent controller 1304 shown in Figure 13 A, or can be positioned at outside, such as, as the intelligent controller 1306 in Figure 13 A.Similarly, can environment be positioned at the equipment environmentally operated, system or other entity 1306-1308, such as, as the system 1306 in Figure 13 A, or the outside of environment can be positioned at, such as, as the system 1307-1308 in Figure 13 A.In the concrete example discussed in following sub-chapter, system is HVAC system and/or additional air-conditioning and well heater, and intelligent controller is intelligent thermostat, environment is by the residence of the system heating controlled by intelligent thermostat, cooling and/or the house of ventilation, many families, commercial mansion or industrial mansion.
As shown in Figure 13 B, intelligent controller 1304 communicates usually each other with intelligent controller 1306, and can additionally communicate mutually with remote computing system 1310, some control task and the calculating relevant with Based Intelligent Control are distributed to this remote computing system 1310.In addition, intelligent controller exports control signal to the system 1306-1308 controlled by intelligent controller usually, and receives data-signal from system 1306-1308.As shown in fig. 13 c, system 1306-1308 controls by intelligent controller, to operate on environment 1302.This operation can comprise various types of material exchange, cause with the operation of the heat interchange of environment, with the exchange of electric current of environment and the operation of other types many.These operations affect one or more characteristic or the parameter of environment usually, and these characteristics or parameter are monitored by intelligent controller directly or indirectly.The intelligent controller that the application relates to controls environment based on Control and Schedule and instant control inputs usually, and above-mentioned instant control inputs can be regarded as covering on Control and Schedule or adding Control and Schedule to.In Figure 13 C, the background utilizing two Figure 131 2 and 1314 to show this large class intelligent controller to operate wherein.First Figure 131 2 is parts that with the addition of instant control inputs 1316 of Control and Schedule.Alternatively, this part of Control and Schedule can characterize the set point of scheduling and non-instant control inputs 1316.The longitudinal axis is denoted as " P " 1318 with the value of the special parameter or characteristic (being called " environmental parameter ") that represent environment, horizontal axis representing time 1320.The expectancy changes of instant control inputs 1316 or the set point ordinary representation parameter of dispatching alternatively or characteristic 1322, represents with △ P.Time in sight during control inputs or before the input of dispatching or the input of scheduling time, intelligent controller exports control signal parameter or characteristic P are changed △ P to system usually.Although it should be noted that △ P is positive in present exemplary, the parameter P namely expected is greater than the currency of parameter P, and △ P also can for what bear, and namely the expectation value of P is less than current P.Also can be the situation of intelligent controller relative to multiple parameter control system, in this case, independent Control and Schedule can be had for parameters, and multiple parameter can be grouped together to form the complex parameter for single Control and Schedule, alternatively, set point can be associated with the multiple P values for each environmental parameter in one or more environmental parameter.In the following discussion, for the purpose of simplifying the description and discuss, suppose that one or more intelligent controller monitors single parameter P, each set point specifies single parameter value, and intelligent controller exports control signal to control the value of the parameter P in controlled environment 1302 to one or more system.
As shown in Figure 131 4, once the operation of intelligent controller start up system is to change △ P by the value of parameter P, then parameter P changes to the P value 1326 of expectation in a continuous manner along with the time from initial P value 1324.In other words, P value can not be changed instantaneously on the time point of set point corresponding to instant control inputs or scheduling.Therefore, there is time interval △ t 1328, be called as " response time ", its by the time of the set point change of instant control inputs or scheduling with reach the parameter value of being specified by set point change or instant control inputs time spaced apart.The intelligent controller that the application relates to by the P in this response time △ t interval 1328 to the behavior modeling of t, thus on any time point during the response time, can show or be reported to the time point remaining time or in other words residual response time that obtain the t value expected.Such as, therefore, at time t
11330 places, intelligent controller interval computing time △ t
1the length of 1332 (residual response times), and by the length in this time interval with herein, figure or the display translation of numerical value report on the display device (display device 410 in such as Fig. 4) of intelligent controller, or export this information by long-range display interface, in order to be presented in remote display device (such as smart mobile phone).This information can comprise the instruction of residual response time, the instruction relative to the residual response time of whole response time, the information comprising the response time of having pass by present or other information relevant with the response time.It should be noted that from the display of residual response time, for the operation of various different intelligent controller, the calculating of the excess time before the P value reaching expectation can be used independently.Such as, intelligent controller can change control strategy according to the residual response time calculated for various different control strategy.
In first impression, the task of calculating the residual response time can be relatively simple expressively.But as illustrated in figure 13d, this task is often very remarkable.Figure 13 D illustrates that the P that can change controlled environment is to the various different condition of the behavior of t and effect.In many cases, the time in one day, weather and the time in 1 year 1340 can change the behavior of P to t of environment, hereinafter referred to as the P response of environment.This P response also can be changed by the internal state going to the dissimilar input 1342-1344 of system or system.Such as, need the system of the electric power for operating to be inactive during power failure, P consequently during power failure response can substantially be different from electric power available time P response.P response also can affect by the external entity except operating in system 1346 environmentally, or affects by the built-in system except operating in the system 1306-1308 on environment 1348 and equipment.In addition, the change (window 1350 such as opened) for building or structure can exchange 1352 and the P changed significantly for environment responds because of heat interchange or material.These are the sub-fractions in the many different possible factor of the P response that can change environment, therefore make the calculating of the residual response time performed by intelligent controller and show complicated and baffle.
In many realizations of the intelligent controller related in the application, due to many factors of the specific P response for controlled environment can be affected, therefore one or more intelligent controller uses at least two kinds of P response different models during the response time, to calculate and the display residual response time.Figure 14 A-Figure 14 E illustrates based on the one or more structure in the first the P response model of the P response data observed.Figure 14 A illustrates the structure of the Data Collection that intelligent controller carries out and the parameterized P response curve from data.In Figure 14 A, transverse axis 1402 is time shafts, about this time shaft, various data mode is shown.Period response time (the interval △ t 1328 in such as Figure 13 C) after the set point of control inputs or scheduling time in sight, intelligent controller monitoring P value also draws the point for representing the P response curve observed over time.In Figure 14 A, first such Figure 140 4 represents the point that first P response curve observed about intelligent controller is drawn.Usually these points are stored in file or database, often as the coordinate pair of coding, but not with the coordinate pair of graph making.But, for convenience of description and illustrate, in the following discussion the data of storage are called " figure ".The observation of first P response produces one group of point usually, such as, in Figure 140 4 draw the point illustrated, this Figure 140 4 describes the general trend of P to the behavior of t.Intelligent controller continues to observe P response in time, adds the point of the P observed to t to figure, as shown in Figure 140 6-1409 in Figure 14 A.After some time, if visually by the P of record to the point-rendering of t in the graph, then they will form hint P to the relatively intensive cloud of the point of the curve of t, and this P responds the P that the curve of t describes for controlled environment.When storing enough points, intelligent controller can generate parameterized model or function, and it is the point collected of matching best statistically, as represented with parameterized Figure 141 0 in Figure 14 A.Parameterized figure is and represents the figure that the model of P to the data of t that the process of the observation responded at many P observes is associated.In some cases, after graph parameter, or after the important time period, P response data can be abandoned.
Having may model for the many of P response curve.Figure 14 B illustrates the model of a P response curve.In Figure 14 B, expression formula 1416
Be plotted in curve map 1418, transverse axis 1420 represents the time, and the longitudinal axis 1422 represents the change △ P of the P value the initial time represented from initial point 1424.This model is nonlinear at zero-sum between about 15 minutes, is close to linear to reach 10 minutes, is nonlinear again until about 35 minutes, then becomes very flat after this.It should be noted that, this model can be suitable for the equipment of some type and system changes some the △ P in its some environment worked and the characteristic of some type and parameter, but it is certainly unsuitable in a large number or even most of possible controlled environment, △ P change and characteristic and parameter.This expression formula is by two constant a and b parametrization.Therefore, usually, △ P is calculated to be the function of time by this model, for given P and the constant parameter of the determined one or more value of given controlled environment by this function parameter.When the model shown in Figure 14 D, the slope of the straight line portion of the P response curve produced from this model can be changed by the value changing parameter b, the scope of △ P value can be changed simultaneously by the value changing parameter a.The model of other types many may be used for P response curve.
For the P response observed collection and the parameterized model that produces is generally only estimation, and owing to can affect all Different factor of P response, therefore this parameterized model is generally the estimation that the mean P for controlled environment responds.If be plotted in by model curve in the intensive cloud of the point representing observation data, then in fact only considerably less observation station will drop on the P response curve of this model generation usually.By assessment data to what extent model of fit select and assessment models.There is many statistical methods, these modes can be adopted to carry out the degree of fitting of computation model and experimental data.Figure 14 C-Figure 14 D illustrates a kind of such method.Figure 14 C illustrates model P response curve with chart 1430, and this chart is similar to the chart shown in Figure 14 B, except the P observed is to a point 1432 in the point of t.Through the P observed to the vertical line segment 1434 of the point 1432 of t also at point 1436 place through model curve and at point 1438 place through time shaft, the time coordinate of point 1438 is called as t
1.The △ P coordinate 1438 of the P observed to the point of t is denoted as △ P
o, and time t is corresponded on model curve
1the △ P coordinate 1440 of the point of 1410 is denoted as △ P
c.Difference △ between the data point i 1432 observed and corresponding model points 1436
olcican be calculated as:
Can to be sued for peace the match value calculated for the curve about observation data to all difference for all data points by following:
If all data points all fall along model curve, then match value will be 0.Along with observation data leaves model curve further, this match value increases.
As shown in fig. 14d, be often the situation that the match value calculated from various different data group drops on the probability distribution of particular type.A kind of such probability distribution is shown in Figure 14 D.The longitudinal axis 1460 represents the probability observing specific match value, and transverse axis 1462 represents different possible match value.For specific match value, such as match value 1464, is drawn as with oblique line the probability of match value that shown in shade, below the probability distribution curve on the right side of match value 1466 region representation observes match value 1464 or be greater than this match value in Figure 14 D.This probability also may be used for the rationality of assessment models about observation data.When the probability of match value of the match value being equal to or greater than observation drops on below threshold probability, this model can be abandoned.
Get back to Figure 14 A, after adding figure in each response of observation and by the data point that the P being used for observing responds, intelligent controller can calculate the match value of various different model relative to data, and when one or more model is associated with the match value being less than first threshold or is associated with the corresponding probable value being greater than Second Threshold, intelligent controller can select the model of most matching from one or more model, and generates parameterized figure by being associated with figure by selected model (comprising for the steady state value selected by model parameter).This formation is called as the situation of " by graph parameter " in the following discussion.Once by graph parameter, then attempt to change into world model, intelligent controller can use this world model to predict the residual response time or with the time, for show or for the value of other object.Along with the time goes over, after adding new P response data, can the parameterized figure of continuative improvement, comprise and change the world model that is associated with parameterized figure and change constant parameter value.This improvement can continue indefinitely, or can be terminated after the reliable model of structure height.Alternatively, parameterized figure can represent the data window of slip, only has recently for selecting the data of the current model and parameter value be associated.
Intelligent controller can generate various different parameterized model for various different situation, is also referred to as " world model ".Figure 14 E illustrates the generation of multiple world model, as the continuation of the timeline shown in Figure 14 A.Once generate first parameterized Figure 141 0, then intelligent controller can have been selected, and the data point of collection to be divided on multiple Figure 141 2-1415, each figure collects the P response observed in varied situations.Such as, when determining that weather and ambient temperature are the material impacts to P response, intelligent controller can collect the independent P response data for fine day, cloudy day, night, strong wind sky and other this kind of different weather condition.Figure 14 E illustrates four Figure 141 2-1415 initial graph 1410 being divided into and arranging along vertical parameter or condition dimension (dimension of such as weather and temperature).Then, as shown in fig. 14e, each figure that intelligent controller can continue as in these each figure collects data, until they can be parameterized, has the parameterized figure shown in row 1420.Now, so intelligent controller can generate new figure, it is collected along new dimension (row 1422 as the many picture groups as shown in Figure 14 E represent) growth data substantially.Except the world model for the follow-up generation of particular case, middle world model (such as world model 1410) can also be retained.Certainly, need the amount of the data of collecting exponentially to become large in order to the graph parameter by various dimensions, and this combined effect strictly retrain the quantity of the different dimensions that intelligent controller can be considered.But intelligent controller does not need to be constrained for and only generates single world model, but can generate multiple world model, each world model for different situations or different one group of situation so that better close to the P response curve obtained under those circumstances.In some cases, response model can depend on the amplitude of the △ P represented by the set point change of dispatching or instant input control.
Intelligent controller adoptable the second P response model is called as " partial model ".Usually, no matter have how many data to be collected and be used to generate one or more world model, intelligent controller is all difficult to generate the enough accurate world model of calculating for the high-precision residual response time.Although not always this situation, it is not beyond thought, and this is that all various dissimilar factors owing to can affect P response cause, as above with reference to Figure 13 D discuss.But, better simply partial model may be generated continually within the specific response time.Figure 15 A-Figure 15 B illustrates several locally fine point technology.
Figure 15 A illustrates a kind of partial model.In many cases, after control signal is outputted to one or more system by intelligent controller, have and be called △ t
unstablethe time period of 1502, within this time period, P value can fail to change or in fact change on the direction contrary with desired orientation.After the time interval 1502 of instability, △ P can be almost linear 1504 to the response of t.This partial model can be expressed as:
Δ P=mt-mt
unstable
Wherein, m is the slope of straight line portion and is single constant basis for this model.As shown in fig. 15b, though the response after the unstable period be not linear but curve time, a series of Local Linear Model also can be utilized close to this response.In Figure 15 B, P response is around having time coordinate t
1part in the dotted line circle 1502 of the point 1504 (being regarded as local initial point) of 1506 is almost linear, and linear model 1508 can be utilized to carry out approximate representation, and this linear model 1508 is expressed as:
ΔP＝mt
c
P response curve another part in dotted line circle 1510 can carry out approximate representation with the different linear models with Different Slope.Therefore, by the set point of control inputs time in sight or scheduling and obtain expect P value time between interval on select one group of continuous print linear model, intelligent controller can calculate the residual response time accurately step by step.
Therefore, world model and partial model provide the model of P response.Use world model during the initial part of the response time after the set point of control inputs or scheduling time usually in sight, this is because usually not there is enough observation datas calculate in this initial time section for partial model parameter and/or select specific portion model.But, situation is often such: after initial time section, when the data point of enough P to t can be used for current P respond time, can partial model be selected and by its parametrization to provide more accurately until obtains the prediction of the residual response time of the time of expectation P value.But not always this situation.Situation may be such: on the whole response time, and world model has more standby predictability, or after choice and operation partial model, after another a period of time, world model can predict the value of residual response time again better from partial model.In some cases, world model and partial model all can not provide enough predictive abilities.For this reason, many intelligent controllers in such intelligent controller that the application relates to reevaluate P response model continuously and attempt, for each time point on whole interval selects best model, to calculate and show the value of residual response time in this interval continuously, periodically or off and on.
Except for cause in the instant control of environment to one or more system or the response duration △ P of control that the set point change of scheduling causes with except the local of the change of t and the P response model of the overall situation, the responding relevant information with P and can be obtained by intelligent controller of many addition type, and in the storer of Electronic saving in intelligent controller and/or mass-memory unit or in the addressable remote computation facility of intelligent controller.Figure 16-Figure 17 uses the information that illustrates two kind addition type similar to the figure shown in Figure 14 B-Figure 14 C and Figure 15 A-Figure 15 B, and above-mentioned information obtains to the respondent behavior of t with about various types of additional informations of the system controlled by intelligent controller by monitoring P.Figure 16 illustrates that △ P/ △ t for the system of particular type is to the curve of P, this systematic influence controlled environment and directly controlling by intelligent controller.In the situation shown in figure 16, the part of △ P/ △ t to the curve of P is straight line 1602.This line is expressed as follows the fact: for the particular system that have collected data for it, and the speed that this system changes the value of the parameter P in controlled environment changes about the currency of P.The currency of P can be the currency of the currency of the P in controlled environment or the P of controlled environment outside.Such as, this curve is continually for describing the dependence of validity relative to ambient temperature of heat pump.As shown in figure 16, there is critical P value P
c1604, at this place △ P/ △ t from the occasion of changing negative value into.When intelligent controller is just being attempted to increase the P value in controlled environment, be less than critical P value P at current P value (such as ambient temperature)
ctime, obviously can not be chosen to the system that use has △ P/ △ t characteristic (the △ P/ △ t characteristic such as shown in Figure 16).Continually, intelligent controller is set up and is much higher than P
cp value critical value or lock value, because the validity of system or the rate of change of P are very low under this lock value, therefore under this lock value, intelligent controller not activation system to increase the value of the P in controlled environment.
Figure 17 illustrates dissimilar information, intelligent controller can obtain and this information of Electronic saving to characterize particular system.Figure 17 illustrates that △ E/ △ P for particular system is to the figure of P, and wherein, △ E is the amount value of the parameter P in controlled environment being changed the energy needed for △ P.In fact, this curve reflects the dependence of energy efficiency relative to the currency of P of system.The currency of P can be the currency of the currency of the P in controlled environment or the P of controlled environment outside.As an example, this curve can represent the energy efficiency of smelting furnace relative to ambient temperature.In curve 1702 drawn in fig. 17, close to P
1the P value place of 1704, when △ E/ △ P is minimum, energy efficiency is maximized, and when increasing from the P value of this maximal efficiency or reducing P, energy efficiency reduces.In the example of smelting furnace, the energy efficiency of smelting furnace can reduce along with the reduction of ambient temperature, this is because the heat interchange of controlled environment and external environment increases, reduce when also can work as the value that temperature reaches relatively high, this is that difference between the temperature of the air exported due to smelting furnace and environment temperature reduces.In other words, when temperature is both not too cold also not too hot, smelting furnace can not increase the temperature of controlled environment effectively.
The data (the P response model as described before) of drawing in Figure 16 and Figure 17 are stored as the set of data point usually in storer and/or mass-memory unit.As for P response model described before, intelligent controller can correspond to the data of the figure shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17 along with accumulated time.As for P response model described before, can along with accumulated time correspond in figure 16 shown in the data of figure, and can for counting yield by its parametrization.Also the data of the figure shown in corresponding in fig. 17 partly or intactly can be obtained from other source (comprising the characteristic from the system for particular type).
The application relates to intelligent controller, and this intelligent controller balance controls to realize multiple targets of potentially conflicting sometimes, and so that the one or more targets under realizing conflict constraint.Exemplarily, intelligent controller can be designed to utilize minimum energy expenditure to produce the appointment change of the value of environmental parameter P as far as possible rapidly, to meet the Control and Schedule characterizing controlled vertical set point change, as discussed above.Usually, due to for some particular system (such as presenting the system of the characteristic shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17) controlled by intelligent controller, in order to control the value of the P in controlled environment, along with △ P/ △ t increases, △ E/ △ P reduces, therefore these goal conflicts.
In some intelligent controller in such intelligent controller that the application relates to, intelligent controller provides the feature of user interface to select self-winding parts to activate rank with the operation permitting a user to intelligent controller, and this self-winding parts activates rank and specifies intelligent controller how to balance to carry out set point change fast but the target of the antagonism carried out in the mode of energy efficient.Intelligent controller to carry out about activation which or which system set point change really regularly between use this self-winding parts to activate rank.Figure 18 illustrates that one of the intelligent controller self-winding parts realizing providing to user activates the user interface of rank.The user interface that this self-winding parts activates rank comprises slider bar feature 1802, and slider bar feature allows user along slider bar 1802 moving cursor or cursor 1804, activates rank to select self-winding parts in scope [saving most, the most comfortable].Saving most in rank, intelligent controller finds and/or cost the most effective means the most effective with the energy of the expectancy changes using the value for realizing the environmental parameter P in the environment that controls by intelligent controller.By contrast, activate in rank at the self-winding parts of the most comfortable, intelligent controller attempts the expectancy changes of the value of carrying out P as quickly as possible.The value that middle self-winding parts activates rank represents in the balance of saving the various ranks between the most comfortable most.The user interface that self-winding parts activates rank also can be started by opening/closing feature 1806 and stop using.In some implementations, intelligent controller identification four self-winding parts activate rank: (1) is closed; (2) save most; (3) balance; (4) the most comfortable.In other realizes, more substantial self-winding parts can be had and activate rank.In some implementations, the self-winding parts can with successive range activates rank.
Figure 18 additionally illustrates the P response curve covered on Control and Schedule and the instruction that the self-winding parts saved most is activated to rank 1808 and uses for the energy that the self-winding parts of the most comfortable activates rank 1810.In figure 18, represent Control and Schedule with solid line (such as solid line 1812), with dotted line (such as empty curve 1814), P response curve is shown.Under the Control and Schedule covered, vertical line (such as vertical line 1816) represents the scope that the energy of the one or more systems controlled by intelligent controller uses, and fills circle (such as filling circle 1818) and represents specific energy use value.Visible in figure 18, under most save mode, use relatively few energy to realize the change of P value, as represented by the part of the filling circle 1818 in vertical line 1816, but P response curve 1814 has relatively slow gradient of inclining, and therefore the response time is relatively long.By contrast, under the most comfortable pattern, the response time is relatively short, but energy uses relatively high.
Figure 19 A to Figure 19 D illustrates the information of addition type about P response and response times, above-mentioned information can Electronic saving in intelligent controller.Figure 19 A illustrates the table 1902 with four row 1904-1907, and these four row comprise: (1) self-winding parts activates rank 1904; (2) P
low locking1905; (3) P
high locking1906; (4) system 1907.The often row of this table represents the scope [P of P value
low locking, P
high locking], within the scope of this, intelligent controller is activation system under various different self-winding parts activates often kind of rank in rank.As above with reference to Figure 16 discuss, lower than critical P value, some system can be inoperative.Also as with reference to this figure discuss, P
low lockingvalue can be set to the P indicated by figure (figure such as shown in Figure 16)
ccritical value, or be set to higher P value, lower than the P value that this is higher, system can be too invalid and cannot be used for the value of the environmental parameter P increased in controlled environment.Similarly, system can with the upper limit P of valid function
high lockingbe associated.P
low lockingand P
high lockinglock value limit the scope of P value, intelligent controller can carry out selecting to activate particular system within the scope of this, and this scope of P value can activate rank along with self-winding parts and change.Intelligent controller empirically can be derived in the past along with the time, determine the value that is stored in table 1902, or initially specified these values and adjust subsequently.They represent activates to realize the exploration of set point change under various P value about selective system.When having additional in check environmental variance, additional this kind of table can be used.
Figure 19 B illustrates the add list that can be stored in by intelligent controller in electronic memory and/or mass-memory unit.Intelligent controller can activate this kind of table separately shown in often kind of rank storage figure 19B in rank for various different self-winding parts.Each table (such as table 1910) comprises three row 1912-1914, and these three row comprise (1) system configuration 1912; Instant control inputs 1913; With the set point change 1914 of scheduling.For the set point change of certain system configurations and particular type, each table stores the maximum response time that intelligent controller should reach for set point change.System configuration can correspond to the system of the whole classifications controlled by intelligent controller.Such as, in climate controlling application, system configuration can refer to the whole class heating for heating dwellings, comprises radiation heating, heat pump, the stove of forced ventilation or the various combinations of heating unit.The user of various dissimilar heating unit configuration can expect different response time properties.Such as, radiation heating user can get used to the response time of slowing down, thus allows intelligent controller to realize Energy Efficient controlling party mask have larger scope of activities at control heating unit.In some implementations, similar table can comprise the pretreatment time various different self-winding parts being activated to often kind of rank in rank, and each table provides the pre-service interval of the set point change for certain system configurations and particular type.
Figure 19 C illustrates and can be stored in the electronic memory in intelligent controller and/or other add list in mass-memory unit.Figure 19 C illustrates a series of three compatibility table 1920-1922, and each indicator is to the P value of different range, and the instruction of these P values is by the four systems compatibility between any two of intelligent controller control.These are shown, and whether indicating intelligent controller is current can activate two systems.Exemplarily, heat pump is often with the auxiliary heating bar heated for family, and in some cases, the compressor of heat pump can not operate with auxiliary heating bar simultaneously.
Figure 19 D illustrates the information that intelligent controller stores, in one implementation, this information about the P response of four the different systems controlled by intelligent controller and other characteristic, for controlling the value of the environmental parameter P in controlled environment.In Figure 19 D, four systems represents with rectangle 1930-1933 respectively.Intelligent controller store △ P/ △ t for each system to the data of P, △ E/ △ P to the data of P and P to the data of t, the △ P/ △ t be such as associated with system 1930 to the data 1936 of P, △ E/ △ P to the data 1938 of P and P to the data 1940 of t.This category information is discussed above with reference to Figure 14 A-Figure 17.P response model can be additionally for the world model collected by dedicated system or dedicated system combination, thus the P response of their reflection dedicated system or dedicated system combination.In addition, intelligent controller stores the table for the system compatibility instruction 1942 of all systems and/or configuration, lock value 1944 and maximum response time 1946, as above with reference to Figure 19 A-Figure 19 C discuss.
Figure 20 illustrates the realization of intelligent controller to the technology of effective control of one or more system, to change the value of environmental variance P according to the set point change of dispatching or instant control inputs.Figure 20 illustrate Control and Schedule 2002 and when intelligent controller control one or more system will the value of environmental variance P increase specified amount △ P 2006 time obtain P response curve 2004.Usually, intelligent controller is constrained for the value increasing environmental variance P in maximum response time 2008.In order to realize the appointment change △ P of P value in maximum response time, intelligent controller carries out about the initial decision that will activate which system (representing with shade circle 2010), then continuously monitor P response curve (to represent with non-shadow circle, such as non-shadow circle 2012), to guarantee that the △ P realizing expecting in maximum response time changes.If the rate of change of P value starts to lag behind the intensity of variation needed for target P value 2014 realizing being associated with the set point change 2016 of instant control inputs or scheduling, then intelligent controller carries out about being activated with the one or more additional decision of the system of realize target P value, such as, determining 2018.Note, in fig. 20, initial decision is shown to occur on the time point more Zao than the time of set point change.Which reflects the following fact: initial decision is not bound to the time of set point change, and may occur more early, to start the value changing environmental variance P, thus can adopt Energy Efficient and/or the effective control strategy of cost, this control strategy can need the time period longer than maximum response time.Also following situation may be had: initial decision occurs on the time more late than the time of set point change or occurs on the time identical with the time of set point change.
Figure 21 illustrates the control flow chart of the operation of intelligent controller.Usually, high level intelligent controller continuously operates in the background of event handling or event polling.In step 2102, intelligent controller waits for next control event.Then when the next one control event occur with a series of conditional statement time, the type of intelligent controller determination event also calls corresponding control routine.In such as step 2104 when determined instant control event, in step 2106, intelligent controller calls instant control routine to carry out the part of the user interactions of intelligent controller, to receive one or more instant control inputs, other behavior that above-mentioned instant control inputs instructs intelligent controller initiation control signal, adjustment Control and Schedule and/or execution user to be formulated by instant control inerface.When control event is the control event of scheduling, such as when current time corresponds to the time of the execution control activity that Control and Schedule is specified, as determined in step 2108, in step 2110, call scheduling controlling routine with the control event of operation dispatching.When control event is scheduling interface event, as determined in step 2112, in step 2114, intelligent controller calls the mutual routine of scheduling to perform being inputted session by the scheduling of scheduling interface and user or dispatched the part changing session of intelligent controller.When control event is Sensor Events, as determined in step 2116, in step 2118, intelligent controller calls sensor routine and carrys out processes sensor event.Sensor Events can comprise interruption that sensor produces because of change that sensor exports, the cut-off of timer of sensing data at interval being arranged to the sensing data process waking intelligent controller up to process next scheduling and other this kind of event.When response time monitor event occurs, as determined in step 2120, in step 2122, call the routine of response time monitoring to process this event.Discuss this kind of event hereinafter in detail.
Figure 22 A-Figure 22 E uses control flow to illustrate the logic of the P respondent behavior of the expectation after intelligent controller adopts with the set point change realizing instant control inputs and scheduling.Figure 22 A illustrates a part for the instant control routine called in the step 2106 of Figure 21.This is the event handler for instant control event.In step 2202, routine adds Control and Schedule to by immediately controlling set point.Then, in step 2204, routine calls routine " starter system activation " to select a starter system or a group system to activate to perform instant control inputs.Above with reference to determining in Figure 20 that 2010 discuss this starter system activation routine.In step 2206, instant control routine exports suitable control signal to selected one or more systems, and indicated by oval 2208, can perform various other steps relevant with processing instant control event.What the routine " control of scheduling " called in the step 2210 of Figure 21 carried out being similar to routine " starter system activation " calls the set point change processing scheduling.
Figure 22 B provides the control flow chart of the routine " starter system activation " called in the step 2204 for Figure 22 A.In step 2210, routine " starter system activation " determines the △ P corresponding to set point change and the current P value (P of instant control inputs or scheduling
initially), target P value (P
target) and current time or initial time.Then, in step 2212, starter system activates the current self-winding parts set by user interface that routine determines to activate rank by self-winding parts in some embodiments and activates rank, as above with reference to Figure 18 discuss.In step 2214, intelligent controller use determined self-winding parts to activate maximum response time that the value of rank and system configuration information determine the set point change performing instant control inputs or scheduling, the set point change of this instant control inputs or scheduling causes the event handler of the set point change from the event handler of instant control inputs or scheduling to call routine " starter system activation ".In step 2216, call one or more systems that routine " selective system combination " is selected for initial activation, to carry out the set point change of instant control inputs or scheduling.In step 2218, by the instruction of selected one or more systems be used for realizing P
targetthe object time of value stores in memory.In step 2220, the next response time monitor event of routine " starter system activation " scheduling is continuously, off and on or periodically to monitor P response curve, to guarantee to reach target P value P in maximum response time
target.
Figure 22 C provides the control flow chart of the routine " selective system combination " called in the step 2216 for Figure 22 B.In step 2224, routine " selective system combination " arranges multiple local variable, comprises and local variable energy 1, time 1, energy 2 and time 2 is set to large value and local variable combination 1 and combination 2 are set to sky.Then, in for circulation of step 2225-2233, routine " selective system combination " considers may combining of one or more system to select the best combination activated by intelligent controller, thus realizes the change △ P of the P value of specifying caused because of the set point change of instant control inputs or scheduling.It should be noted that, although the steering logic illustrated supposes that complete information (such as shown in Figure 19 D) can be used for all systems, but may not be often this situation, in this case, in the calculating of the information based on these types, carry out suitable adjustment, comprise the omission of the use of default value or the application of certain rule.In step 2226, routine " selective system combination " uses and is appropriate to the compatibility table of current P value scope, as above with reference to Figure 19 C discuss, to guarantee that the system in combination of current consideration does not comprise incompatible system.And in step 2226, routine " selective system combination " uses discussed in fig. 19 a table to guarantee that all systems in the system in combination of current consideration are not outside its front P value scope above.The system in combination of current consideration comprise incompatible system or should stop using in the current situation system time, refuse this combination, and control flow go to step 2225-2233 for circulation the next one repeatedly.In step 2227, routine " selective system combination " uses the system specific information of each system in the combination being used for current consideration, such as, for the data 1936 of the system 1930 in Figure 19 D, data 1938 and data 1940, realizes P to calculate
targetrequired time and the amount of carrying out this operation energy used.P
targetestimation additionally can use the information of other type, other this category information comprising weather forecast, system operating state and obtain from remote information source.Various diverse ways can be used to obtain this time and energy value.The method of oversimplification can utilize each system to utilize weighting or equalization subsequently to realize P
targetrequired energy and the additive combination of time, to calculate total time and energy value.Alternatively, the calculating of more complicated type can be used accurately to estimate that the system in combination of current consideration realizes P
targetrequired response time and energy use.When in the step 2214 that the time calculated is less than or equal in Figure 22 B during determined maximum response time (as determined in step 2228), and when the energy calculated is less than the value stored in energy 1 (it represents the minimum observation energy being used for the system in combination considered before) (as determined in step 2229), then in step 2230, local variable combination 1 is arranged to the system in combination of current consideration, energy 1 is arranged to calculated energy, and the time 1 is arranged to the calculated time.When the calculated time be not less than or be not equal to maximum response time but the time calculated is less than value current stored in the local variable time 2 time (as determined in step 2231), then in step 2232, local variable combination 2 is arranged to the system in combination of current consideration, energy 2 is arranged to calculated energy, and the time 2 is arranged to the calculated time.In other words, in for circulation of step 2225-2233, consider that the various of one or more system may combine, to find that (if possible) is for the system configuration having minimum possible energy and use, and can realize P being less than or equal in maximum response time
targetcombination.It should be noted that, such as in the table discussed above with reference to Figure 19 B, the value that can store from storer, dynamically change maximum response time according to various ancillary rules, exploration and consideration (character of the set point change such as performed).In fact, ancillary rules and characteristic can be used dynamically to change monitoring and the various threshold values that adopt of adjustment control strategy.All P can not be realized when one or more system all are combined in be less than or equal in maximum response time
targettime, determine the combination of one or more systems with the least estimated response time.When at least one system in combination can realize P being less than or equal in maximum response time
targettime, as determined in step 2234, then routine " selective system combination " returns the most efficient system of energy in these systems.Otherwise, return and realize P the soonest
targetcombination.In alternative realizes, do not consider system in combination possible in a large number, in for circulation of step 2225-2233, starter system can be selected and add spare system to be as required enough to carry out the system in combination of set point change to obtain.
Figure 22 D provides the control flow chart of the routine " response time monitoring " called in the step 2122 of Figure 21.This is the event handler for response time monitor event, and perform for as above with reference to 2012 in Figure 20 discuss P response monitoring.In step 2240, routine " response time monitoring " determines the currency of environmental variance P.When this value is less than P
initiallytime (as determined in step 2242), and when the initial time that this current time is greater than P response curve adds a certain steady state value (as determined in step 2244), then in step 2246, call routine " gravity treatment " to attempt to select the better combination of one or more system to activate to realize P as quickly as possible
target.Routine " gravity treatment " corresponds to the follow-up decision discussed above with reference to 2018 in Figure 20.In this case, the change of P value is contrary with expectancy changes on direction.The steady state value adding current time to does not carry out the gravity treatment of activity system during guaranteeing the initial unstable period after starter system activates.Similarly, when the projection value that the currency of environmental variance P is less than P deducts constant, as determined in step 2248, its instruction is not carried out towards P
targetenough advances, then in step 2246, call routine " gravity treatment ".When the currency of environmental variance P is at P
targetthreshold distance in time, as determined in step 2250, routine " response time monitoring " returns and does not dispatch next response time monitor event, this is because no longer need P
targetresponse time monitoring.Otherwise, the next response time monitor event of scheduling in step 2252.
Figure 22 E provides the control flow chart of the routine " gravity treatment " called in the step 2246 of Figure 22 D.This routine is similar to the routine " selective system combination " shown in Figure 22 C.But, when routine " reschedule ", determine to provide P in for circulation of step 2259-2264
targetthe combination of the one or more systems realized the soonest, and in step 2266, suitable control signal is outputted to selected one or more systems.The finally next response time monitor event of scheduling in step 2268.
Therefore, return Figure 20, after the set point change 2016 of control inputs or scheduling time in sight, the routine " starter system activation " shown in calling graph 22B in case determine activate one or more system which combination come realize target P value, with in fig. 20 determine that 2010 represent step.Then, by the next response time monitor event of reschedule continuously, routine " response time monitoring " is repeatedly called to monitor the progress of head for target P, as represented with unfilled circle (the unfilled circle 2012 in such as Figure 20) during the response time.When the progress of head for target P is undesirable, as in routine " response time monitoring " detect, be invoked at the routine " reschedule " shown in Figure 22 E so as the one or more system of gravity treatment to activate to attempt in maximum response time (if still may) or as quickly as possible (if no longer may in maximum response time) reach target P value.Illustrate that reschedule operates with filling circle 2018 in fig. 20.In one implementation, low-power processor in intelligent controller can use simple exploration to monitor, the processor of higher-wattage can carry out system activation decision simultaneously, and when determining to need activity system gravity treatment, low-power processor wakes the processor of higher-wattage up.
After the set point change of control inputs or scheduling when intelligent controller is in sight to the continuous print of the progress of head for target P value, interval or periodically monitoring allow intelligent controller to realize the balance of the expectation between energy efficiency and response time.In additional realization, other consideration can as the factor selecting one or more subsystem to activate the designated value realizing environmental parameter.In some cases, intelligent controller can carry out more complicated consideration to realize the designated value of multiple parameter under various difference constraint.
The value of the residual response time of calculating is also stored at least one storer by the value of calculated response time that it should be noted that intelligent controller during response monitoring.The selection of the one or more systems being used for activating also stores in memory so that follow-up generation control signal by intelligent controller.
comprise and utilize intelligent controller monitor progress and dynamically change the method for control and the intelligent thermostat of realization
With reference to the application-specific in the response monitoring scientific discovery intelligent thermostat (a class intelligent controller) that Figure 20-Figure 22 E discusses.Many houses adopt heat pump to carry out heating and cooling with the controlled environment of business.Heat pump is effective at relatively high temperatures, but loses its validity when ambient temperature declines.For this reason, except heat pump, many houses also comprise certain auxiliary heating system with the controlled environment of business, to allow the reasonable response time in the temperature lower than the temperature of heat pump effective heating controlled environment.But usually, auxiliary heating system tends to that energy efficiency is lower than heat pump, running cost is higher or not only energy efficiency was low but also cost is high usually than heat pump, frequent energy efficiency is between its 1/5 and 1/3, and cost is between its 3 times and 5 times.Therefore, use response type monitoring technique discussed above, intelligent thermostat can be attempted only activating heat pump to preserve energy and replace heat pump or activate auxiliary heating system to realize dynamically producing acceptable balance between the acceptable response time with heat pump simultaneously.
Important problem appears at following interface place therebetween: (i) uses known sensing and the attainable power-saving technology of disposal route, and the user that popularizes of (ii) reality of realizing the equipment of this kind of power-saving technology adopts and integrated in its daily routine and environment of those equipment.The user interface of energy-efficient equipment needs to provide easy to user usually, that enjoy with pleasant experience, or user can ignore the power conservation feature of equipment, such as by avoid with the power conservation feature of advanced person alternately, such as by thermostat being arranged to emergency hand operator scheme on permanent basis and making advanced stop using or even for the devices exchange equipment of older technology with not too complicated user interface.The interface of some above-mentioned intelligent controller, comprise the interface that the self-winding parts shown in Figure 18 activates rank selection, contribute to providing intelligence, many sensings, interconnection network, energy-conservation equipment, for easy, pleasant, seamless and be applied in family the mode of User-friendly.The realization of the intelligent thermostat hereafter discussed comprises many features, these features contribute to providing intelligence, many sensings, interconnection network, energy-conservation equipment, for easy, pleasant, seamless and be applied in family the mode of User-friendly.
Figure 23 A-Figure 31 illustrates the realization of intelligent thermostat.After the discussion of these figure provided below, monitoring and the application of adjustment technology in the realization of intelligent thermostat of intelligent controller discussed above is discussed with reference to Figure 32-Figure 39.
Figure 23 A illustrates the skeleton view of intelligent thermostat.Intelligent thermostat 2300 has the succinct appearance of fashion.Intelligent thermostat 2300 comprises the circular body 2308 that diameter is about 8cm, and this main body 2308 has visually pleasant serving, such as, plate pearl nickel or chromium plating.The cap-like structure comprising the display monitor 2302 of rotatable outer shroud 2306, sensor ring 2304 and circle is separated with main body 2308 by little peripheral clearance 2310.Outer shroud 2306 can have the serving identical with main body 2308, and sensor ring 2304 and circular display monitor 2302 can have the outer covering of usually circular glass (or plastics), this outer covering gradually forms arcuation in outward direction and provides fashion but look solid and durable overall appearance.Sensor ring 2304 comprises any one in various sensor, comprises infrared sensor, visible light sensor and sonic transducer.The glass of covering sensor ring 2304 or plastics can be with cigarette process or mirror-polishing, thus sensor itself is sightless to user.Can provide ventilation function by peripheral clearance 2310, this allows internal sensor sensing surrounding air, and does not need gill-like air vent or grid-like air vent.
Figure 23 B-Figure 23 C illustrates just by the intelligent thermostat that user controls.Intelligent thermostat 2300 is by two kinds of user's input controls: the rotation (Figure 23 B) of (1) outer shroud 2306; (2) inwardly push away on outer shroud 2306 (Figure 23 C), until audible and/or palpable " click " occurs.Inwardly push away and outer shroud 2306 can be caused to move forward, but in a further implementation, whole cap-like structure (comprise outer shroud 2306 and sensor ring 2304 covers with the glass of circular display monitor 2302) when being pushed away together with move inward.In one implementation, sensor ring 2304, circular display monitor 2302 and shared glass cover not along with outer shroud 2306 rotates.
Rotated by the rotation of outer shroud 2306 or ring and inwardly the pushing away or inwardly click of outer shroud 2306, intelligent thermostat 2300 can receive from user the information in need being used for basic setup and operation.To provide smooth to user but the mode of glutinous sensation mechanically installs outer shroud 2306, also reduce that forge or undesired rotations simultaneously input for improving overall succinct sensation further.Intelligent thermostat 2300 identifies three kinds of basic user's inputs: (1) hoop anticlockwise, (2) hoop right rotation, and (3) are inwardly clicked.In other realizes, more complicated basic user's input can be identified, the rotation input of such as double-click or the three inside pressings of hitting and speed sensitive or acceleration sensitive.
Figure 24 illustrates the decomposition diagram of the wall connector of intelligent thermostat and coupling HVAC.When intelligent thermostat 2300 is removed, the wall connector 2406 of coupling HVAC has the function of very simple, basic, independent thermostat, and this basic thermostat comprises standard temperature and reads/arrange dial 2408 and simple refrigeration-cut out-heater switch 2409.This can prove to be applicable to various situation, such as when intelligent thermostat 2300 need be removed in order to safeguard or repair reach the time period of prolongation time.In one implementation, basic thermostat parts 2408 and 2409 are entirely mechanical in itself, thus do not need electric power to carry out cutting-off controlling relay.In other realizes, provide simple electric control, the up/down button of such as electricity and/or LCD reader.In other realizes, can provide the subset of the advanced function of intelligent thermostat 2300, such as elemental network access is to allow the Long-distance Control providing brainstem function when temporarily removing intelligent thermostat.
Figure 25 A to Figure 25 B illustrates the front and back skeleton view of the decomposition of intelligent thermostat.Figure 25 A to Figure 25 B illustrates intelligent thermostat 2502:(1 about two critical piece) head unit 2404; (2) backboard 2506.In shown accompanying drawing, z direction is outside from wall, and y direction is the head-to-toe direction relative to the user upwards walked, and x direction is user direction from left to right.
Figure 26 A to Figure 26 B illustrates front perspective view and the back perspective view of the decomposition of head unit respectively.Head unit 2404 comprises head unit framework 2510, outer shroud 2511, head unit front assembly 2512, front lens 2513 and front grid 2514.Electric parts on head unit front assembly 2512 can be connected to the electric parts on backboard 2506 by the electric connector of flat cable and/or other grafting type.
Figure 27 A to Figure 27 B illustrates the front and back skeleton view of the decomposition of head unit front assembly respectively.Head unit front assembly 2512 comprises head unit circuit board 2516, head unit front plate 2518 and LCD module 3242.In Figure 27 A, the parts in the front of head unit circuit board 2516 are hidden in after RF guard shield.Rechargeable lithium ion battery 2525 is positioned on the back side of head unit circuit board 2516, and in one implementation, this lithium ion battery 2525 has the nominal voltage of 3.7 volts and the nominal capacity of 560mAh.In order to extending battery life, battery 2525 does not charge more than 450mAh by thermostat battery charger usually.In addition, although specified for battery 2525 one-tenth can be charged to 4.2 volts, intelligent thermostat does not charge more than 3.95 volts by intelligent thermostat battery charger usually.In Figure 27 B, optical finger navigation module 2524 is also shown, this module 2524 is configured and is positioned to the rotation sensing outer shroud 2511.Module 2524 uses the method being similar to the operation of optical computer mouse to sense the movement of grain surface on the periphery, opposite of outer shroud 2511.Note, module 2524 is one of little several sensors, and these sensors are subject to the head unit microprocessor of relative power sensitivity but not the backboard Microprocessor S3C44B0X of relatively low electric power.This is attainable, and does not need excess power consumption, because when user manually rotates dial, head unit microprocessor is waken up, thus avoids the excessive power consumption waken up.Advantageously, head unit microprocessor also can provide response quickly.Figure 27 A also illustrates Fresnel (Fresnel) lens 2520, these lens 2520 and the PIR motion sensor joint operation placed thereunder.

In order to determine environment temperature more accurately, when determining effective environment temperature, the temperature in conjunction with top thermal sensor 2541 measurement considers the temperature obtained from bottom thermal sensor 2542.This configuration may be used for the effect compensating the internal heat produced in thermostat by one or more microprocessor and/or other electronic unit, thus eliminates or minimize the temperature measurement errors that may stand in other side.In some implementations, by the top thermal sensor 2541 of temperature sensor 2540 is thermally coupled to grid members 2514 (therefore top thermal sensor 2541 reflects environment temperature better than bottom thermal sensor 2542), the accuracy that environment temperature is measured can be improved further.

Then, under the background of intelligent thermostat, the monitoring of various problem domain and above-mentioned intelligent controller and method of adjustment are discussed to the application of those problem domains.When starting, it should be noted that, in these examples, intelligent thermostat selects control strategy with in maximum response time, as far as possible with energy efficient manner, minimum cost mode or usually not only Energy Efficient but also the mode of minimum cost realize corresponding to the temperature variation of set point change.Usually, when the cost operating heat pump is a (ceneme of a is money/time or energy use/time), and when the cost operating AUX is b (ceneme of b is money/time or energy use/time), then the cost carrying out set point change is:
Cost=a × (time of heat pump operation)+b × (time of AUX operation)+(a+b) × (time that heat pump and AUX operate)
When ratio a/b is low, or in other words, when substantially operating heat pump and being less than the cost of operation AUX, then can be often following situation: the T.T. for the heat pump of the effective control strategy of cost and/or the heat pump being compared to cost not too effective control strategy T.T. of AUX operation and/or AUX operation is large.Such as, when a/b is 1/4, only operates cost that heat pump reaches first control strategy of 120 minutes and be starkly lower than and only operate heat pump and reach 60 minutes and operate the cost that heat pump and AUX reach second control strategy of 30 minutes simultaneously:
Cost=the a (120) of strategy 1
Strategy 1 time=120
Cost=a (60)+(a+b) (30) of strategy 2
Strategy 2 time=90
Therefore, adopting and take a long time the control strategy performing set point change may be that cost is less, and when only knowing the ratio of running cost, immediately when the absolute cost operated is unavailable, intelligent controller can be made about the relative cost efficiency of control strategy and determining.
Figure 32 A-Figure 32 B illustrates the problem domain that the intelligent thermostat relating to heat pump controls, and in the realization of an intelligent thermostat, how monitoring and the control method of intelligent controller discussed above are applied to this problem domain.Figure 32 A illustrates Figure 32 02 of the first set point change 3204 in Control and Schedule, its illustration conventions used in Figure 11 A, Figure 12 A-Figure 12 G and Figure 18 before using.In some cases, when ambient temperature is lower than the P for heat pump
low lockingtime (being called " compressor locking "), thermostat can call auxiliary heating element (" AUX ") at once at commit point 3206 place, thus produces the response 3208 performing set point change within the predetermined response time 3210.In this example and example afterwards, heat pump represents the first system, be often called as " compressor ", and AUX represents second system.For the P of AUX
high lockingoften be called as " AUX locking ".Due to initial deployment AUX, therefore the response time comprises the initial time section 3214 of AUX heating, follows by remaining time 3216, carries out maintenance heating in this remaining time 3216.This remaining time can be used for carrying out set point change, but is not used, and causes the AUX heating using high cost for whole set point change.Time period for high cost operation 3218 is denoted as b, and it uses cost discussed above to mark.Figure 32 A also illustrates Figure 32 20 of the second set point change in Control and Schedule.In this case, in the initial response result 3224 initially determining 3222 gentle gradients of inclining, initially AUX is not used.But over time, become, when determining not enough towards the progress of set point temperatures, thermostat is switched to AUX heating, forms the final response 3226 of sharply rising.In this case, the response time comprises initial heat pump interval 3228, AUX interval 3230 and remaining time interval 3232.And remaining time time interval can be used for slower, that energy more effectively heats time.As cost 3224 and cost 3236 shown in Figure 32 02.
Figure 32 B illustrates Figure 32 40 of the 3rd set point change in Control and Schedule.In this example, the monitoring of intelligent controller and method of adjustment have been merged in intelligent thermostat.In this case, intelligent thermostat thinks over such as with reference to the information that Figure 19 A-Figure 19 D describes, and initially determines that 3242 initially only can adopt heat pump, forms initial response 3244.For a long time, intelligent thermostat determines that 3246 need AUX to heat and dispose AUX, forms the response 3228 of finally sharply rising.Certainly, in many cases, AUX may do not needed completely.But, even if when needed, be equipped with the information above with reference to Figure 19 A-Figure 19 D description and close supervision can grow initial heat pump interval 3230, very short AUX interval and the control strategy without remaining time, as in the example as shown in Figure 32 A towards the intelligent controller employing formation of the progress of set point temperatures.As discussed above, when a/b is relatively low value (well below 1), the longer response time of the control strategy shown in Figure 32 B can represent the strategy that in Figure 32 A and kind of the strategy of three shown in Figure 32 B, cost is minimum.Especially, can avoid using in the whole circumstances of AUX, the monitoring of above-mentioned intelligent controller and method of adjustment may be used for utilizing available maximum response time, to adopt than not adopting the control strategy of all available maximum response time cost more time but the low control strategy of final cost.
The monitoring of above-mentioned intelligent controller and adjustment technology also can be extended to Control and Schedule adjustment.An example is that nocturnal temperature saves feature, and this feature adjusts Control and Schedule in evening hours, thus in the morning, at the set point change place of the first scheduling, the length of the response time of estimation will be not enough to the use causing auxiliary heating system.Only adopt this feature when the Weather information of accessing weather forecast or other type is available.Figure 33 illustrates nocturnal temperature saving.In set point schematic diagram 3202, set point represent first early morning set point.When ambient temperature is lower than a certain threshold value, intelligent controller can terminate to use the initial heat pump interval 3304 before AUX heating interval 3306.But as shown in lower set point schematic diagram 3308, by Control and Schedule at night is adjusted to temperature 3307 higher a little, intelligent controller can only use heat pump 3310 to carry out the set point change in maximum response time.
Figure 34 illustrates the example response of the set point change obtained for different self-winding parts configuration level for intelligent controller.In these examples, heat pump operates separately or AUX operates separately.In other situation, heat pump and AUX can together with operate, the cost that the cost being therefore designated as b in the drawings will be denoted as a+b replaces.Figure 34 illustrates three set point schematic diagram 3402-3404, its be respectively used to have self-winding parts configuration level save most, balance and the most comfortable set point after response.Set point change 3410 specifies the temperature variation from initial temperature 3406 to finishing temperature 3408.Intelligent controller is initially determined 3412 one-tenth and is only used heat pump, form response 3414, this is due to for the self-winding parts configuration level saved most, maximum response time 3415 and to preheat 3416 intervals are relative length, thus heat pump can be used to carry out set point change, and heat without any need for AUX.Depend on ambient temperature and other factors the need of AUX heating, but maximum response time is sufficiently long, uses to minimize AUX.Therefore, under most save mode, in both preheat mode 3412 and residual response time 3418, all use heat pump, form the cost 3420 of only heat pump operation.
When the self-winding parts configuration level balanced, intelligent controller initially determines that 3422 for only to use heat pump, forms response 3423, but determines that 3424 need AUX afterwards, and adopt AUX to produce the response curve 3425 more sharply risen.Due to shorter peak response 3426 with preheat 3427 intervals, therefore this is needs.The residual response time is divided between the heat pump 3428 and AUX with running cost 3432 and running cost 3434 heat 3429.And, in some cases, AUX can not be used to heat, and in other cases, can only use AUX to heat.When AUX is heated need to depend on maximum response time time, the example of Figure 34 is provided under the background of ambient temperature and other condition.When the self-winding parts configuration level of the most comfortable, intelligent controller is initially determined 3436 one-tenth and is only used AUX, forms response 3438, this is because too short maximum response time 3440 and preheat 3443 intervals.The residual response time is all AUX heating 3429, and it has running cost 3446.
As a/b<1, the cost be associated with set point strategy successively decreases according to following order: save most, close, balance and the most comfortable, and the time reaching assigned temperature be associated with set point strategy successively decreases according to following order: the most comfortable, balance, closedown and save most.Certainly, these order in varied situations can be different, but present exemplary illustrates the impact of self-winding parts configuration level on the response for set point change.It should be noted that intelligent thermostat environmentally condition and other consideration can select more complicated strategy, it has the interval of multiple heat pump and/or AUX with various order.
Figure 35 illustrates the step of the automatic system coupling that intelligent thermostat performs.Especially, have been found that special expect by the various available energy-conservation of the specific HVAC configuration of the automatic family being suitable for wherein installing thermostat advisably and improve comfort level control algolithm in select, come to carry out thermostat setting and management as far as possible user friendlyly.In step 3502, can be used for being determined by least one in following by thermostat controlled HVAC system feature: (i) automatically electric wire inserts and detect, (ii) oolhiu interactive user interview, (iii) the automatic deduction of the automatic trial run based on HVAC system when thermostat is installed or near the thermostat set-up time or reasoning, and (iv) is based on the automatic deduction of the system action observed or performance or reasoning.In US20120130679A1 and US20120203379A1 of common transfer and submitting on the same day with the application of common transfer, sequence number is _ _ _/_ _ _, _ _ _, [attorney docket 94021-849698/NES0258-US], name is called the example describing these methods in the one or more applications in the U. S. application of " HVAC Controller With User-Friendly Installation Features Facilitating BothDo-It-Yourself and Professional Installation Scenarios ", each application in these applications is incorporated in herein by reference.
Operate about refrigerating mode, if owing to operating in Special air-conditioning system on cooling direction and/or heat pump and determine that HVAC system comprises air-conditioning (step 3504), then in step 3506, start the intelligent preprocessed features being used for refrigerating mode operation.Common transfer the possession of submit on the same day with the application, name be called " Preconditioning Controls and Methods for an Environmental Control System ", sequence number for _ _ _ _/_ _ _ _, _ _ _ _, describe an example of intelligent preprocessed features in the U. S. application of [attorney docket 94021-852484/NES0257-US], this application is incorporated in herein by reference.Some are realized, intelligence preprocess method is configured to: such as, come unceasing study family by the nearest heating and cooling history (comprising external environmental information alternatively, ambient temperature, sun heating effect etc.) monitoring family and how soon to heat or cool; How long prediction HVAC system is carried out active heated by needing or cools with the set point reaching particular schedule; And just on the correct time, start pre-service towards the set point of particular schedule, thus the set point temperatures of scheduling will be reached on the set point time of scheduling.Improve users'comfort by the not too late set point temperatures reaching scheduling, the set point temperatures simultaneously by not too early reaching scheduling improves energy saving.
About heating mode operation, if determine that HVAC system comprises radiation heating (step 3508), then in step 3518, start the Intelligent Radiation controlling feature being used for heating mode operation.Common transfer the possession of submit on the same day with the application, name be called " Radiant Heating Controls and Methods for anEnvironmental Control System ", sequence number for _ _ _/_ _ _, _ _ _, describe an example of Intelligent Radiation controlling feature in the U. S. application of [attorney docket 94021-853384/NES0259-US], this application is incorporated in herein by reference.In some implementations, Intelligent Radiation controlling feature is configured to monitor radiation heating circulation constantly, calculate the thermal model of estimation of the family of heating as radiating system, and predictably control radiating system with the thermal model considering house, the time of one day and the mode of thermal cycle information before.Intelligent Radiation controlling feature is configured to realize comfortable maintenance band temperature, also minimizes the frequent variations of HVAC ON/OFF state simultaneously and minimizes HVAC energy loss.In other advantage, avoid target temperature that is uncomfortable and waste energy excessive.
When determining the heat pump that HVAC system comprises containing auxiliary electrical resistive electrical heating (i.e. so-called auxiliary or AUX heating) (step 3510), and when determine further (step 3512) thermostat interconnection network (thus it can position-based data and receive ambient temperature information based on the temperature information source of the Internet) or otherwise access ambient temperature information (such as by the wired or wireless connection to ambient temperature sensor) time, then in step 3516, start intelligent heat pump controlling feature.In step 3510, when not having the heat pump with AUX heating, (this situation is the most common, the non-heat pump because having traditional gas smelting furnace, or because in so-called not comprising in the bifuel system of AUX heating, there is heat pump), then in step 9814, start the intelligent preprocessed features being used for heating mode, this is similar to or is oppositely equal to above about the preprocessed features for refrigerating mode that step 9806 is discussed.Similarly, in step 3512, when not having internet connectivity or other access for external temperature information, then the intelligent heat pump controlling feature of not setting up procedure 3516, but the intelligent preprocessed features in setting up procedure 3514.
Although AUX heating function allows to heat family quickly, under lower ambient temperature (only heat pump compressor is that efficiency is lower at such a temperature) it can be useful especially, but the cost of energy using AUX heating can be often two to five times of the cost of energy only using heat pump.For some embodiments, intelligent heat pump controlling feature is configured to monitor heat pump circulation constantly, follows the trail of utilize separately heat pump compressor how soon to heat family (such as unit degree of being F/ hour) in view of the outside air temperature be associated.Based on the correlativity between the effective rate of heat addition calculated and outside air temperature, and being included in the user preference setting of (" balance " comprised these end points is selected) the scope of from " the most comfortable " to " save most " further, intelligent heat pump controlling feature activates AUX heating function in the mode realizing the appropriate balance between the comfortable and AUX heating cost of user advisably.For some embodiments, the factor that the wisdom affecting AUX heating is called comprises: (i) is used alone the premeasuring that heat pump realizes the time needed for current temperature setpoint, (ii) whether current temperature setpoint comes from the contrast of instant user's control inputs whether it is the temperature set-point of scheduling, and (iii) arrive the user preference of the special selection in the scope of " saving " at " the most comfortable ".Generally speaking, AUX function is determined to be more conducive to call AUX heating by when the independent time Estimate of compressor increases being, set point for instant user's control inputs contrast scheduling is more conducive to call AUX heating, and points to preference for " the most comfortable " and be compared to " saving most " and point to preference and be more conducive to call AUX heating.
In some implementations, intelligence heat pump controlling feature also provides the automatic adjustment to so-called AUX locking temperature based on the heat pump cyclical information of monitoring and the user preference between " the most comfortable " and " saving most ", AUX locking temperature corresponds to outside air temperature, will from disconnecting AUX heating on this outside air temperature.Generally speaking, for the good heat pump of execution, AUX locking temperature will lower (cause less AUX use), and trend towards " saving most " along with user preference, and AUX locking temperature also will lower (causing less AUX to use).Connect thus some embodiments that temperature forecast whole night can be provided for having available network, intelligence heat pump controlling feature also provides nocturnal temperature saving, wherein, if based on temperature forecast whole night learn when morning temporary needs AUX function reach set point temperatures in morning from common set point temperatures whole night, then set point temperatures whole night can be brought up to the set point whole night higher than usually dispatching.In this case, even if make the temperature whole night of household internal higher than the temperature whole night in other situation, user in fact also saves energy and money by avoiding carrying out Interim use AUX function in the morning.
According to some embodiments, the HVAC system performance information that the determination that the one or more places in step 3508 and step 3510 are done can be arrived based on automatic Observation, and non-dedicated system identifying information.Such as, can be following situation: the specific heating function of HVAC system is not radiating system physically, however still trend towards presenting the mark that high heat postpones in conjunction with basic controlling, thus make it be similar to radiating heat system in itself.For this situation, Intelligent Radiation controlling feature can be started and carry out improving SNR.May not be the situation that HVAC system has the heat pump with AUX function, but it can have two-step heating function, wherein, the first order (can select the type as the first order, because its cost effectiveness is higher) to trend towards under lower ambient temperature slowly or " backwardness ", the second level (can select the type as the second level, because its cost effectiveness is lower) trend towards when heating family very effective in time, thus make System Operation become extraordinary image to have the heat pump of AUX function.For this situation, intelligent heat pump controlling feature can be started and carry out improving SNR.
Figure 36 A to Figure 36 C illustrates the selection interface of the exemplary self-winding parts configuration level of intelligent thermostat.In Figure 36 A, heat pump balance characteristics not selected marker feature selecting display in.Selection is called in the input that user can call selection (as shown in figure 36b) by the input at the selection interface going to the intelligent thermostat inputting interface display of Balancing selection (formed heat pump) or self-winding parts configuration level.Then, the selection of self-winding parts configuration level turns back to feature selecting display, checks now heat pump balance characteristics simultaneously.
What Figure 37 illustrated intelligent thermostat arranges display.The instruction whether activating various feature is provided in this display.
Figure 38 A to Figure 38 C illustrates that intelligent thermostat is obtainable and the information of addition type being supplied to user or adopting during control operation.Figure 38 A illustrate heat pump data point 3802 actual Figure 38 00 and for the △ T/ △ t of the most matching of heat pump to the curve 3804 of T, be called heat pump rate curve (" HPR ").As discussed above, in during the inactive heat pump operation of AUX, intelligent thermostat collects data point along with the time.Figure 38 B illustrates the heat pump data point of collecting in intelligent thermostat is during the inactive heat pump operation of AUX and the Figure 38 04 for the most matching HPR of heat pump, it presents the exceptional data point 3808 close to solidifying point, the invalid heat pump operation that the instruction of these data points causes in the accumulation of internal heat pump part due to sediment (such as frost).Some heat pump comprises the logic for detecting sedimentary accumulation, and takes remedial action to remove sediment.Such as, heat pump logic can temporarily make heat pump operation reverse, and extracting heat from house has sedimentary heat pump components to add heat accumulation and remove this sediment, will operate afterwards oppositely to continue heating dwellings again.At this moment in section, heat pump logic can call AUX heating to prevent from cooling house.Current, detection and the improvement of sedimentary accumulation is carried out in heat pump inside.Because intelligent thermostat continuously, off and on or periodically monitors heat pump operation and collect △ T/ △ t to the data of T, so intelligent controller can analyze the △ T/ △ t that collects to the data of T and the exceptional data point detected close to solidifying point, therefore determine the accumulation of deposits characteristic of heat pump.Compared to inner heat pump accumulation of deposits logic, intelligent controller often can consider many more factors, therefore significantly describes the feature of the accumulation of deposits characteristic of heat pump better.In addition, intelligent controller can by the information combination of this information and many addition type to create the control strategy of the complexity being used for improving accumulation of deposits.
Figure 38 C illustrate one group of HPR heat pump data point another Figure 38 10 and for the most matching △ T/ △ t of heat pump to the curve 3812 of T.In this case, the critical temperature 3814 discussed above with reference to Figure 16 is close to 50 °F, and at this temperature place, the △ T/ △ t for heat pump becomes negative.The critical temperature that this critical temperature is compared to desired by heat pump working properly is high a lot, and represents poor operation or substantially inactive heat pump.Usually, occupant does not note the heat pump of inoperation or poor operation, this is because when heat pump not heating dwellings environment time generally start AUX as usual.Continuously, off and on or periodically monitor heat pump operation and collect △ T/ △ t and can detect this kind of problem easily to the intelligent thermostat of the data of T and be reported to user, utility company and other entity, thus can heat pump be repaired, then can heating dwellings or other controlled environment effectively.
Figure 39 provides the example arrangement of the response time method for supervising in the realization being used in intelligent thermostat.This figure is provided into the example of some parameter be used in an example implementation, but generally shall not be applied to all realizations.In Figure 32, each row 3902-3905 represents and activates for four different self-winding parts the steering logic that each rank in rank (comprise save most, balance, the most comfortable and closedown) occurs.For the heat pump controlled by intelligent controller, from such as deriving many parameters above with reference to the data of △ P/ △ t to P described by Figure 16.For heat pump, HPR curve is conclusive system performance, and this system performance allows the various parameters determining the response time monitoring technique that a kind of intelligent thermostat uses.In Figure 39, the every line description below the first row of table is used for the operating parameter monitoring relevant various functions with the response time.Such as, how row 3910 is the P that various self-winding parts activates rank determination auxiliary heating system if being discussed
high locking.As shown in the figure, there is the P of acquiescence
high locking, the P of this acquiescence is then ignored when HPR is available
high locking, P
high lockingbe configured to a temperature, at this temperature place, △ T/ △ t higher than threshold value, such as 1 °F/hour.Different threshold values is used for different self-winding parts configuration levels.Row 3912 discuss for each self-winding parts activate rank whether adopt nocturnal temperature to save.Nocturnal temperature is saved and is referred to the Control and Schedule of adjustment for night hour, thus time in the morning, at the set point change place of the first scheduling, the length of the response time of estimation will be not enough to the use causing auxiliary heating system.Only adopt this feature when the Weather information of addressable weather forecast or other type, therefore such as when the intelligent thermostat relying on WiFi and access this category information can not use WiFi, close this feature.Therefore, HPR and the use of response monitoring technology discussed above with reference to Figure 20-Figure 22 E can notify the Control and Schedule adjustment that intelligent controller is potential, and this can cause more economical integrated environment to control.Row 3914 and row 3916 describe to be explored, and when the response time estimated exceedes threshold value, activates auxiliary heating element according to exploration.Row 3914 discuss for control inputs time in sight after the activation of auxiliary heating element of response time, row 3916 illustrates the exploration for the response time after the set point change of scheduling.The set point change being compared to scheduling for instant control inputs for the threshold value activating AUX is lower, this is because for the set point change manually inputted, user expects to respond faster usually.Therefore, when the time estimated by the set point change for manually input to be greater than most save mode to temperature (" t2T ") under 60 minutes, activate AUX, but for the set point change of dispatching, threshold value is two double-lengths or 120 minutes.Whether row 3918 indicates various self-winding parts activation rank to adopt and preheats feature.Preheat is activated heat pump before the set point change of scheduling.When employing preheats, can be following situation: more effective heat pump can be used for larger △ t to be changed, this is because overall response time be distributed in prior to scheduling the initial pre-heat period of set point change and the set point change of scheduling after time period on.Therefore, suppose then to preheat the time point that the set point change indicating user desired temperature of dispatching raises and allow to use the heat pump with comparatively slow P response curve, but not adopt auxiliary heating on the time of set point change corresponding to scheduling.
Although describe the present invention with reference to particular example, be not intended to the present invention to be limited to these examples.Amendment in spirit of the present invention is apparent for a person skilled in the art.Such as, by changing the arbitrary parameter in many different Design and implementation parameters, can realize response time monitoring and the system reschedule technology of intelligent controller employing according to many different modes, above-mentioned parameter comprises programming language, hardware platform, logical type, control structure, data structure, modular organization, operating system and other this kind of parameter.As mentioned above, when the enough progress cannot carrying out head for target environmental parameter value can need to select to activate new system or system in combination, intelligent controller can the two initially, in sight time control inputs or time of set point change of scheduling is upper, prior to the set point change of scheduling or during the response time, use much dissimilar information to estimate the response time.Other considers to comprise the information about the information of environment, the information about system performance and system health, the information about controlled environment and many addition type.Such as, if intelligent controller know the window of controlled environment be open and significantly diminish for the efficiency of heating surface of the system of controlled environment is therefore inevitable, in these cases, intelligent controller can select different systems or system in combination to activate the temperature variation realizing expecting.
Should be appreciated that the above description of disclosed example is provided for those skilled in the art is carried out or uses present disclosure.Those skilled in the art expects the various amendments to these examples by being easy to, and the general principle defined in this paper can be applied to other example, and does not depart from the spirit or scope of the present invention.Therefore, the example shown in present disclosure is not intended to be restricted to herein, but will consistent with principle disclosed herein and new feature most wide region be met.
