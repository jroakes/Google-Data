Definitions
- a credential such as a One Time Password can be generated by a user, received by an intermediary and then forwarded to a verification server to be authenticated.
- An example of such a credential is a graphical indicium such as a QR code or the like.
- a user may not have access to a device with the sophistication to generate a OTP.
- the user may not have access to a network over which to transmit the credential to an intermediary such as a service provider. While a service provider may have access to a network to transmit the credential to a verification server and receive a result, such transmission may be expensive and slow.
- a message can be received that includes characters that can be arranged in a matrix. At least some of the characters can correspond to integers.
- An implementation can determine the rank of the received matrix. If the rank of the received matrix is equal to one the verification can be successful. If the rank of the received matrix is not equal to one, the received matrix may be invalid or contain entries that are erroneous or missing. Missing entries can be replaced with a zero or other numbers.
- An implementation can factor the received matrix to obtain two vectors and determine a projected matrix of rank one based on the product of the two vectors. The factoring can find the two vectors that minimize the distance between the received and the projected matrices, based on linear programming.
- the projected matrix can have one or more entries that are not integers, but which can be rounded to the nearest integer.
- a distance can be determined between the received matrix and the projected matrix.
- the distance can be the number of changed entries from the received matrix to the projected matrix. If the distance is not within a distance threshold, then the received matrix can be rejected. Otherwise, it can be accepted as successfully verified.
- An example of distance threshold for a matrix with M rows and N columns is whether the number of changed entries is greater than the lesser of M and N (not within the distance threshold) or less than or equal to the lesser of M and N (within the distance threshold.)
- An action can be taken based on the rejection or successful verification of the received matrix.
- FIG. 1 shows a system according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 2 shows a computer according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 3 shows a network configuration according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- An implementation in accordance with the disclosed subject matter can provide a way for a user with a basic mobile device with a limited display the ability to present a credential such as a OTP to a verifying authority.
- the verifying authority can verify the presented credential locally without having to send it over a network to a remote verification server.
- the verifying authority thus does not require a network connection to verify the credential and can do so without the delay and expense of accessing a remote server. Implementations can be useful in developing economies, where users may have access to basic cell phones and where network connections can be expensive and slow.
- the credential can be based on a message containing characters arranged in a matrix.
- the use of a matrix can allow for a greater number of characters to be presented as the credential using a limited (e.g., text-only) display on a basic cell phone or other mobile device.
- the matrix can be imaged and analyzed using machine vision.
- the character set from which message is composed can be a limited character set such as ASCII, UTF-8 and the like.
- the limited character set can improve the accuracy and reliability of the machine vision analysis of the matrix because using fewer different characters can simplify the machine vision problem and can thereby reduce errors.
- Characters of the matrix can be entered manually by a user.
- the user can obtain a string of characters that can be entered using a cell phone keypad.
- the mobile device can include a text wrap feature that automatically formats the string as a matrix.
- the characters may be presented to the user in a matrix (e.g., as a set of lines of characters) and the user can manually enter a “return” character at the end of each line to form the matrix on the mobile device.
- the characters can be delivered to the user device via SMS or other messaging service.
- a matrix in accordance with an implementation can be of the form:
- An example of such a matrix can be:
- a matrix can be written in the following singular vector decomposition factorization:
- the parameter r is called the rank.
- Matrices with a specific rank may be generated from u i , v i .
- the rank parameter can relate to a degree of coupling between entries. For example, a rank one matrix can be generating from the pair (u, v), where every entry of the generated matrix has depends on at least one element from each of the vectors. For example,
- factorization is not unique for the integer case, in contrast to the singular value decomposition.
- z u ⁇ v
- rank one matrices with u, v ⁇ + all of the entries of matrix S will also be in + .
- an arbitrary matrix in + may not have a factorization according to Equation (1) with u,v restricted to be integer.
- S is a rank one matric and S+E is a rank one matrix with factorization in +
- the number of change entries ⁇ E ⁇ 0 is more than the number of rows or columns of the message, i.e., ⁇ E ⁇ 0 ⁇ min( N,M )
- rank one matrices in + are far from one another. This insight can provide a basis for a valuable test of a matrix that is not rank one to help determine if it is based on a valid matrix, but has errors or omissions, or if it should be properly rejected as being invalid.
- a typographical or other error can alter an independent position in S.
- An error can be expressed as:
- An implementation can generate a rank one matrix, S, for a user to present as a credential.
- a verifying authority can receive a matrix to be tested, S′, which can be imaged using, for example, a smartphone camera associated with the verifying authority. The smartphone camera can take a picture of a user device display showing the matrix S′ and determine its rank. If the rank is determined to be equal to one, then the credential can be successfully verified and accepted. If the rank is greater than one, then the matrix S′ can be rejected as being erroneous.
- An implementation can test a matrix whose rank is greater than one to determine if it is based on a valid matrix but has one or more incorrect entries or is missing entries. This can be done by computing a nearby rank one matrix and gauging its similarity to the matrix that was received.
- rank one matrices S′ that may be sent in OTP messages:
- a typographical or other error may change a rank one matrix into a matrix having a higher rank:
- the missing entries can be replaced with zeros or another integer.
- the rank of S is equal to one and S ⁇ Z + , the nearest rank one matrix is
- u * , v * arg ⁇ ⁇ min u , v ⁇ ⁇ S - uv T ⁇ p p Equation ⁇ ⁇ ( 4 )
- An implementation can solve this in any suitable way, such as by using a sequence of linear programs.
- a message can contain non-integer characters, each of which can correspond to an integer.
- the character “&” can correspond to the integer 38
- the character “k” can correspond to the integer 107, etc.
- An encoding of non-integer characters to corresponding integers may be arranged to avoid conflicts with integer characters.
- the character “9” may correspond to the integer 9 and non-integer characters (such as “$”) can be mapped to integers other than 9.
- a user may wish to present the message to a receiving device to qualify the user, e.g., to verify the user's identity or to help establish that the user is entitled to a benefit, such as a product or service. For example, if the matrix presented by the user is verified, the user may receive a discount on an item, receive an item for free, activate a service such as an Internet service, a data plan or cellular service, be admitted to a restricted area or venue such as a sporting event, an airplane, a train, a movie theater, a place of business or government building or room, or bypass part or all of a security review or passport control process, and so on.
- the matrix can be a One Time Password (OTP) that is invalid after it has been used once.
- OTP One Time Password
- the user may present the matrix to a verifying authority, which can receive the matrix and may locally determine if it is authentic, without having to send the matrix to a remote server for verification.
- the verifying authority can have a smartphone or other device with a camera that can be used to image the display of the user's cell phone, thereby causing the verifying authority's device to receive the matrix.
- An advantage of an implementation is that the verifying device can verify the received matrix locally.
- the verifying authority's device can determine that the rank of the received matrix is equal to one and accept it as authentic. An action can then occur, based on the successful verification of the matrix.
- An alteration to a rank one matrix results in a matrix that is not rank one.
- the number of changed entries from one rank one matrix to another is equal to at least the number of rows or columns of the matrix, whichever is smaller. In other words, if ⁇ E 0 ⁇ is the number of change entries between one rank one N ⁇ M matrix and another, then ⁇ E 0 ⁇ min (N, M). In other words, rank one matrices are “far” from each other.
- a matrix that is not rank one may be analyzed for errors and corrected and/or be rejected.
- a received matrix that is not rank one may not have been imaged properly.
- a machine vision algorithm in the verifying authority device may not have been able to read one or more entries properly and may mark them as “unknown.”
- one or more entries may be erroneous, for example due to incorrect entry by the user, incorrect reading by the verifying device, defect in the display of the user device, etc.
- the received matrix may be factored to obtain two vectors.
- the unknown entries can be replaced by zero, which has no effect on the norm of the matrix.
- the unknown entries can be replaced by any integer number or numbers. The factoring can be accomplished in accordance with an implementation of the foregoing disclosure.
- the two vectors whose product minimizes the distance between the product of the two determined vectors and the received matrix can be obtained, e.g., using linear programming to solve Equation (4), above.
- the distance can be, for example, the p-norm of the difference between the product of the two vectors and the received matrix.
- the two vectors may have one or more elements that are real numbers.
- a projected matrix of rank one can be determined based on the product of the two vectors. If the projected matrix contains any elements that are not integers, those entries can be rounded to the nearest integer.
- a distance can be determined between the received matrix and the projected matrix. In an implementation, the distance can be the number of change entries between the received matrix and the projected matrix. If the distance between the received matrix and the projected matrix exceeds a distance threshold, then the received matrix can be rejected.
- An example of a distance threshold is the smaller of the number of rows and columns of the received matrix.
- Another example of a distance threshold is the p-norm of the difference between the product of the two vectors and the received matrix. If it does not, then the projected matrix can be the “corrected” version of the received matrix and the matrix is successfully verified.
- an action can be taken or not taken based on the successful verification or rejection of the received matrix.
- actions taken on successful verification can include logging onto a system, logging in to a web site or SaaS service, obtaining a product or service, gaining entry to a restricted area, etc.
- Actions taken upon rejection of the received matrix can include sending a request for another matrix for the user, requesting additional credentials, locking a service or disabling a product, etc.
- a user can send a message with a matrix that is received by a verifier. If the verifier determines that the received matrix is rank one, it is accepted as a successful verification. If not, the verifier can reject the matrix or determine if the received matrix is based on a valid matrix, but has errors or omitted entries. To determine if the received matrix is based on a valid matrix, the verifier can factor the received matrix (after adding zero or other numbers to any missing or indeterminate entries) to obtain two vectors. The product of the two vectors is a projected matrix of rank one. The distance can be determined between the received and projected matrices. If the distance is not within (exceeds) a distance threshold, then the received matrix can be rejected. If the distance is within the distance threshold, the received matrix can be successfully verified.
- Implementations of the disclosed subject matter can be configured to operate over a network.
- the receiver (e.g., imager) of the matrix can send it to a server (e.g., a verification server) over a network.
- the verification server can determine if the matrix is rank one and, if not, determine if it contains errors or omissions and compensate by generating the two vectors and the projected rank one matrix.
- the server can determine if the distance between the received and projected matrices is within a distance threshold and send an accept/reject message back to the receiver.
- the matrix may be transmitted from a user device directly to a verification server.
- the matrix can be used as a OTP by the user.

In other words, rank one matrices in
A typographical or other error may change a rank one matrix into a matrix having a higher rank:
where the X entry in the middle top row has erroneously changed to a Y.
Then the missing entries can be replaced with zeros or another integer. The missing entries can be solved for by attempting integer factorization
S′=uv T,

The p-norm can be optimized without being constrained to integers. Elements of the reconstructed matrix can be rounded to the nearest integer. For p=1,
An implementation can solve this in any suitable way, such as by using a sequence of linear programs.
