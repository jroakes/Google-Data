- HFC networks A hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) system is a point-to-multipoint, tree and branch access network in the downstream direction, with downstream frequencies in the 50-860 MHz bandwidth and a multipoint-to-point, bus access network in the upstream direction, with upstream frequencies in the 5-42 MHz bandwidth.
- the IEEE 802.14 working group is currently chartered with creating physical (PHY) layer and MAC layer specifications for HFC systems, and has produced a draft standard addressed in IEEE Project 802.14/a Draft 3 Revision 1, “Cable-TV Access Method and Physical Layer Specification,” IEEE, Apr. 13, 1998 supra.
- the Multimedia Cable Network System (MCNS), an industry consortium, has also contributed a document with PHY and MAC layer specifications (for details see the reference “MCNS Interim Specification, ‘Data Over Cable Interface Specifications—Radio Frequency Interface Specification,’ MCNS Holdings, L. P., Mar. 26, 1997,” supra, sections 4 and 6 of which are incorporated by reference.).
- the topology of a typical HFC network is illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the maximum round-trip delay between the HC 3 and a station 6 is of the order of 1 ms.
- Stations 6 are connected to the HC 3 over coaxial cables 4 , 9 , taps 1 , bi-directional split-band amplifiers 7 , splitters 8 , fiber nodes (FN) 5 , and fiber cables 4 .
- the ITU J.83 recommendation defines two transmission schemes referred to as Annex A and B by which data rates in the range of 30-45 Mbit/s are achieved in 6 or 8 MHz channel bandwidths. With the specified modulation schemes, spectral efficiencies of 5-8 bits/s/Hz are obtained, as described in ITU-T Recommendation J.83, “Digital Multi-Programme Systems for Television Sound and Data Services for Cable Distribution,” ITU-T Study Group 9, Oct. 24, 1995.
- impulse noise and narrowband interference are the limiting factors. These interferences stem mainly from home appliances and HF-radio and accumulate on the return path to the head end. These disturbances are usually referred to as “ingress noise” and exhibit time-varying characteristics. Because of the high level of these impairments, spectral efficiencies for upstream transmission are limited to about 2-4 bits/s/Hz.
- a TDMA scheme is considered where upstream transmission is divided into a stream of mini-slots.
- Each mini-slot is numbered relative to a master reference clock maintained by the HC.
- the HC distributes timing information to the stations 6 (e.g. cable modems) by means of Time Synchronization (SYNC) messages, which include time stamps. From these time stamps, the stations 6 establish a local time base slaved to the time base of the HC.
- SYNC Time Synchronization
- SYNC Time Synchronization
- SYNC Time Synchronization
- the stations 6 establish a local time base slaved to the time base of the HC.
- access to the mini-slots is controlled by Allocation Map (MAP) messages, which describe transmission opportunities on upstream channels.
- MAP message includes a variable number of information elements (IE), each defining the modality of access to a range of mini-slots in an upstream channel, as illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- a station 6 tunes its receiver to a downstream channel over which it receives SYNC messages from the HC.
- the acquired local time base is retarded by the propagation delay from the HC to the station 6 .
- the cable modem of station 6 then monitors the downstream channel until it receives a MAP message with an Initial Maintenance IE, which specifies a time interval during which new stations 6 may send a Ranging Request (RNG-REQ) message to join the network.
- RNG-REQ Ranging Request
- the station 6 sends a first RNG-REQ message with lowest transmit power level.
- the station 6 looks for a new MAP message with an Initial Maintenance IE, and at the specified time retransmit a RNG-REQ message with increased transmit power level. These steps are repeated until the HC eventually detects a RNG-REQ message, from which the HC can determine the round-trip delay and the power correction value to be used by the station's cable modem for future upstream transmission.
- the round-trip delay compensation is determined such that, when the round-trip delay compensation is applied in the station 6 , future upstream transmissions of this station 6 arrive at defined time instants (epochs) at the HC.
- the HC then sends the round-trip delay compensation and the transmit power adjustment value for future transmission to the station 6 in a Ranging Response (RNG-RSP) message.
- RNG-RSP Ranging Response
- MAP messages include Request IEs to provide mini-slots in which stations may send requests for upstream data transmission.
- the HC determines whether requests for resource allocation from multiple stations have collided.
- a random backoff protocol is also employed for contention resolution to reduce the probability of repeated collisions of request messages.
- OFDM systems are now considered that are represented by the block diagram shown in FIG. 3 .
- OFDM signals are thus regarded as baseband signals in the fundamental frequency band [ - ⁇ M 2 ⁇ T , W 2 ⁇ T ] ,
- M denotes the number of subchannels and T denotes the modulation interval.
- T denotes the modulation interval.
- the baseband signal is transated to a carrier frequency f c before transmission.
- the factor-M upsamplers in FIG. 3 insert M ⁇ 1 zeros between the symbols in each of the M symbol sequences.
- the filter output signals are sampled at the modulation rate 1/T, and the samples are used to determine a reliable estimate of the sequence of knitted symbols.
- ISI intersymbol interference
- ICI interchannel interference
- ⁇ i is defined as the Kronecker delta.
- the scheme of FIG. 4 can be regarded as a special case of the OFDM system shown in FIG. 3 .
- the transmit filter bank of the system in FIG. 4 can be implemented by an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) followed by an M-branch polyphase network and a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter as addressed in [13].
- IDFT inverse discrete Fourier transform
- P/S parallel-to-serial
- the receive filter bank can be implemented by a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter, an M-branch polyphase network, and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT).
- An efficient implementation of an OFDM system is illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- DWMT and DMT represent variants of OFDM that can be considered for practical applications.
- DWMT modulation may be viewed as a particular case of the scheme of FIG. 5 with real input symbol vectors and special grouping of subchannel filters.
- the prototype filter is usually designed such that perfect reconstruction of the transmitted input symbol vector is possible at the DWMT demodulator output under the assumption of an ideal channel without noise and distortion. Perfect reconstruction requires that some spectral overlap of adjacent subchannels is allowed.
- equalization must be employed to cope with a nonideal channel characteristic. See: S. D. Sandberg and M. A. Tzannes, “Overlapped Discrete Multitone Modulation for High Speed Copper Wire Communications,” IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol. 13, pp. 1571-1585, December 1995.G., supra.
- each block of M signals is cyclically extended by copying the last L signals in front of the block.
- the parameter 1/T thus denotes the modulation rate of a system where the cyclic extension of signal blocks is not performed.
- the cyclic extension yields a signal vector with L+M elements, which are converted from parallel to serial.
- the obtained signals are transmitted over the channel at the rate M/T.
- the length of the channel impulse response is assumed to be less than or equal to L+1.
- blocks of samples with length L+M are taken.
- Block boundaries are placed such that the last M samples depend only on the elements of one cyclically extended block of signals.
- the first L samples are discarded, and the last M samples of the block are demodulated by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).
- DFT discrete Fourier transform
- the sequence of transmitted symbol vectors can then be detected by assuming a bank of M independent subchannels, at the price of a decrease in the transmission rate by a factor (M+L)/M. It is therefore essential that the number of subchannels is much larger than the length of the channel impulse response, so that the reduction in data rate due to the cyclic extension may be considered negligible.
- the need for the addition of a cyclic extension also known as cyclic prefix, arises because of the large amount of spectral overlap between adjacent subchannels.
- equalization must be employed in the time domain to shorten the length of the channel impulse response. See: P. J. W. Melsa, R. C. Younce, and C. E. Rohrs, “Impulse Response Shortening for Discrete Multitone Transceivers,” IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 44, pp. 1662-1672, December 1996.
- SSB and VSB modulation schemes are currently used, e.g., for the broadcast of analog video signals, and may also be considered for data communications.
- SSB and VSB are characterized by inferior performance as compared to systems where all signal spectral components are transmitted, e.g., QAM Systems, owing to the difficulties that these schemes present for carrier-phase recovery.
- pilot tones are usually employed to provide carrier-phase information. A descriptin of this is found in K. J. Kerpez, “A Comparison of QAM and VSB for Hybrid Fiber/Coax Digital Transmission,” IEEE Trans. Broadcast., vol. 41, pp. 9-16, March 1995, which reference is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Transmission of pilot tones, however, would not be practical in the multiple-access environment considered herein.
- upstream transmission in an HFC network is based on OFDM of DMT type.
- a real baseband DMT signal is obtained after serial-to-parallel conversion.
- the passband signal can in principle be obtained by double-side band amplitude and phase modulation (DSB-AM/PM) with zero excess bandwidth.
- DSB-AM/PM double-side band amplitude and phase modulation
- Carrier-phase recovery does not represent a problem in this case.
- DMT systems require that the channel impulse response be shortened, so that the length of the cyclic extension is small compared to the modulation interval.
- the impulse responses of all the individual channels must be shortened. More important, even if a cyclic extension of sufficient length is used, orthogonality holds only if the individual subchannel signals are received in proper synchronism Be of the large amount of spectral overlap between contiguous subchannels, reception of a signal with improper timing phase results in ICI, i.e., the signal will disturb several other subchannel signals and vice versa. This situation cannot be avoided when a cable modem sends a request for registration in a subchannel specified by the HC, without any prior knowledge of the correct timing phase and transmit power level.

- the passband transmission scheme is shown in FIG. 10 .
- the discrete-time real and imaginary parts of the complex baseband signal ⁇ k are converted by D/A converters to analog signals, which are input to a DSB-AM/PM modulator with the carrier frequency f c .
- the rating signal is transmitted over the upstream channel.
- the signal at the receiver input is translated to baseband by a DSB-AM/PM demodulator.
- the obtained in-phase and quadrature signal components are sampled at the rate M/T to yield the real and imaginary parts of the received FMT signal.
- the discrete-time real and imaginary parts of the FMT signal ⁇ are converted by D/A converters to analog signals, which are input to a DSB-AM/PM modulator with the carrier frequency f c .
- the resulting signal is transmitted over the channel.
- the signal at the receiver input is translated to baseband by a DSB-AM/PM demodulator where perfect knowledge of the carrier frequency f c is assumed.
- the obtained in-phase and quadrature signal components are sampled at the rate M/T to yield the real and imaginary parts of the received signal, which is input to the FMT demodulator.
- the vector obtained at the output of the FMT demodulator could be directly employed to determine an estimate of the transmitted sequence of information symbols. In practice, it is necessary to further process the signal to eliminate residual ISI. Residual ICI can be considered negligible even for moderate lengths of the prototype filter.
- the frequency responses of FMT subchannels are characterized by steep roll-off towards the band-edge frequencies, where they exhibit near spectral nulls. This suggests that per-subchannel decision-feedback equalization be performed to recover the transmitted symbols.
- the function of decision-feedback filtering is preferably performed at the transmitter by employing precoding techniques. See: M. V. Eyuboglu and G. D. Forney, Jr., “Trellis Precoding: Combined coding, Precoding and Shaping for Intersymbol Interference Channels,” IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 38, pp. 301-314, March 1992, and R. Laroia, “Coding for Intersymbol Interference Channels—Combined Coding and Precoding,” IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 42, pp. 1053-1061, July 1996.
- trellis augmented precoding is the most suitable approach for joint trellis coding and precoding for transmission over channels with spectral nulls. See: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 947,356, filed Oct. 8, 1997, to G. Cherubini, S. ⁇ lcer, and G. Ungerboeck, entitled “Transmission Method and Apparatus Employing Trellis Augmented Precoding,” which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- trellis augmented precoding An essential element of trellis augmented precoding is Tomlinson-Harashima (TH) preceding described by M. Tomlinson, in “New Automatic Equalizer Employing Modulo Arithmetic,” Electron. Lett., vol. 7, pp. 138-139, March 1971 and by H. Harashima and H. Miyakawa, in “Matched Transmission Technique for Channels with Intersymbol Interference,” IEEE Trans. Commun, vol. COM-20, pp. 774-780, August 1972. These references are incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the present context, there is considered uncoded FMT transmission employing per-subchannel TH precoding. Extension to the case of a system with coded modulation employing trellis augmented precoding is straightforward.
- the block diagram of a FMT system that employs TH precoding is illustrated in FIG. 7 .
- a non-ideal channel In practice, a non-ideal channel must be considered. It is noted that, if the phase characteristic of the channel frequency response is linear and the number of subchannels is sufficiently large, channel distortion may be considered negligible and a simple one-tap equalizer for gain adjustment on each subchannel prior to inverse precoding is sufficient.
- the challenge to FMT systems comes from channels that are characterized by large phase distortion, because per-subchannel signal equalization/interpolation must then be performed. In this case an all-pass time-domain filter may be employed to compensate for a nonlinear channel phase characteristic, and thus the complexity of per-subchannel equalization/interpolation.
- the OFDM system represented in FIG. 3 yields M subchannels, all having the same bandwidth equal to 1/T Hz.
- the subchannels further exhibit almost zero spectral overlap and spectral nulls at the bandedges.
- S-CDMA is well suited for upstream transmission in HFC networks, since it represents a robust transmission technique in the presence of narrowband. See: M Varanasi and B. Aazhang, “Near-Optimum Detector in Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access Communications,” IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 39, pp. 725-736, May 1991 and also Z. Sivesky, Y. Bar-Ness, and D. Chen, “Error Performance of Synchronous Multiuser Code Division Multiple Access Detector with Multidimensional Adaptive Canceller,” European Trans. Commun. & Rel. Technologies, vol. 5, pp. 719-724, November-December 1994.
- TDMA time-varying characteristics of the disturbances that are present in the channel, and to the requests for resource allocation of each individual station, the HC dynamically assigns to each station a subchannel or a set of subchannels for upstream transmission.
- the HC also specifies whether during a mini-slot a subchannel is entirely dedicated to upstream transmission of a single station (TDMA), or may be shared by several stations using different signature codes (S-CDMA).
- a hybrid TDMA/S-CDMA scheme based on FMT modulation allows the HC to allocate resources efficiently to each individual station for a wide range of data rates. Upstream transmission over a singe subchannel was described in the previous section. If application in a TDMA environment is considered, however, two remarks are appropriate:
- the HC may compute the round-trip delay compensation value such that there is no need for signal interpolation at the output of a set of subchannels; the HC may then allocate those subchannels for upstream transmission of the registered station, thus avoiding the need for further processing;
- a “tail” with length equal to L modulation intervals will be observed after the last symbol of the message has been detected; to avoid the need for large guard bands between consecutive messages, cancellation of the tail may be performed.
- J ⁇ 1 synchronous interferers can be suppressed by expanding by a factor J the bandwidth of the transmitted signals, and by employing at the receiver adaptive equalization with T/J-spaced taps. Interference suppression achieved in this manner can be interpreted as a frequency diversity technique.
- the Peterson et al. reference is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- each subchannel may be chosen by the HC.
- the equivalent baseband realization of a system where K i stations transmit over the i-th subchannel is illustrated in FIG. 9 .
- Each input symbol sequence is transmitted with the modulation rate 1/KT, with K i ⁇ K.
- ⁇ n (i,k) ⁇ denotes the interpolated sequence of k-th user symbols input to the i-th subchannel
- ⁇ s n (k) ⁇ is the k-th user signature code sequence with length K
- h n (i,k) denotes the overall i-th subchannel impulse response for the k-th station
- B (ij) , j 0, . . . J ⁇ 1 respectively.
- the signal V n (f) is filtered by a bank of K i fractionally-spaced adaptive equalizers with T-spaced taps and KT-spaced equalizer output signals.
- ⁇ tilde over (H) ⁇ (i,k) (f) S (k) (f)H (i,k) (f) denote the overall frequency response from the k-th user symbol source of the i-th subchannel to the i-th DFT output
- C (i,k) (f) denote the frequency response of the k-th adaptive equalizer of the i-th receiver filter bark.
- Ranging and power adjustment In this section, a possible realization of the ranging and power adjustment process using FMT modulation is described.
- a station first tunes its receiver to a downstream channel that conveys MAC information and acquires the global timing reference provided by the HC. Thereafter, when an Allocation Map (MAP) message with an Initial Maintenance IE is received, the cable modem sends a RNG-REQ message in the specified subchannel, which results in negligible ICI in adjacent subchannels. If a Ranging Response (RNG-RSP) message is not received, subsequent RNG-REQ messages are sent with increasing transmit power, e.g., incremented by 1 dB steps.
- MAP Allocation Map
- RNG-RSP Ranging Response
- CAZAC constant-amplitude zero autocorrelation
- P P times
- SOM start-of-message
- Detection of periodic CAZAC sequences in the HC may be performed as described in [25].
- the HC Upon detection of the CAZAC sequence, the HC performs channel identification by a least-squares algorithm [26]. From the amplitude and phase characteristics of the identified channel response a transmit power level adjustment and a timing phase ⁇ [0, T] are derived. The timing phase is needed to compute the round-trip delay compensation to receive the FMT signal in proper synchronism.
- the detection of the signature sequence provides the HC with further timing information that is used to determine the total round-trip delay from the head-end node to the station, and hence the round-trip delay compensation.
- the HC After determining the transmit power level adjustment and the round-trip delay compensation, the HC sends this information to the station as part of a RNG-RSP message. The station then waits for a MAP message with an individual Station Maintenance IE, and sends at the specified time a RNG-REQ message using the power level and timing corrections. The HC receives this RNG-REQ message in proper synchronism at the T-spaced filter bank output. The HC returns another RNG-RSP message to the station with information about any additional fine tuning required. The ranging request/response steps are repeated until the response contains a Ranging Successful notification.
- a request message from a station consists of a pseudo-random signature sequence of N bits, which identifies the station and is transmitted using differentially encoded BPSK is proposed herein. Alsoan ideal upstream transmission for all stations sending request messages in the specified contention subchannel, i.e, transmitted symbols are received at the subchannel output in the absence of noise and interference is assumed. Because of possible multiple frequency translations of the upstream signals taking place at intermediate points of the network, the received symbols of a request message are rotated by a random phase, which is assumed to be constant over N modulation intervals. The phases associated to different messages are assumed to be independent.
- a n (i,k) ⁇ ( ⁇ 1,+1) and ⁇ k ⁇ (0, 2 ⁇ ).
- the algorithm can be described by the following two steps.
- Step I If ⁇ j ⁇ 2, ⁇ j, the HC selects two points V i 0 and V i 1 , such that
- max
- min
- the transmission rule is such that stations hat a signature sequence whose symbols differ in the i-th and m-th positions send a new request message in the first mini-slot, and the remaining sta-tions send a new request message in the second.
- the HC needs now to resolve contentions between two smaller groups of stations.
- 2, it is likely that all the stations but one have signature sequences whose symbols in the i-th and m-th position are equal.
- the HC then specifies a new mini-slot where only those stations that have a signature sequence whose symbols in the i-th and m-th position are different are allowed to send a new request message. Two cases must be considered.
- the HC will cor-rectly detect it and will also be able to determine the message ⁇ A n i,k 0 e f ⁇ k0 ⁇ in (8). From the recovered information, the HC then computes a new sequence
- Step I the HC applies Step I to the sequence (9), otherwise it applies Step II.
- Step I The resolution of the contention among the stations that have not retransmitted a new message is initiated by applying Step I.
- Steps I and II are repeated until all stations are identified. Note that the last two stations involved in a contention are identified with only one retransmission, since in this case yields the signature sequence of the last station.
- a typical multiple access communications network system has a head-end node, downstream and shared upstream channels, and at least one station node, where the head-end node comprises a head-end controller (HC) capable of transmitting data and medium-access control (MAC) information to said station node over at least one downstream channel within a first frequency range.
- At least one subchannel has spectral nulls at the bandedges, and at least one subchannel has zero guard bands.
- cable means can be replaced, in part or in toto, by wireless links of the type known in data transmission technology.
