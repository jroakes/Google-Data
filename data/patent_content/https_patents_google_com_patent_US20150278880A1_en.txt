- the client After receiving data from the ad system, the client displays a price range of the similar items 213. For example, the client can display “Your item recently listed for $3,000-3,300 USD.” In some implementations, the client then prompts the user to enter in details 214 , for example, a price for the item on sale. For example, the client can display a dialog box asking the user to enter input for additional information. The client can prompt the user for additional information other than price. For example, if the item on sale is a car, additional information can include mileage. Or if the item on sale is an electronic device, additional information can include when the user purchased the electronic device. In some implementations, the client prompts for user identifying information such as a name or contact information. After the user provides the additional information, the client sends the data, including the prompted information, to the ad system 216 .

Description
- This specification relates to content presentation.
- Sponsored content providers provide sponsored content items, e.g., advertisements, in different forms in order to attract consumers. An advertisement (“ad”) is a piece of information designed to be used in whole or part by a user, for example, a particular consumer. Sponsored content items can be provided in electronic form. For example, online ads can be provided as banner ads on a web page, as ads presented with search results, or as ads presented in a mobile application.
- This specification describes technologies relating to generating sponsored content items.
- A system can use image recognition to create a sponsored content item. The sponsored content item can be an ad by an individual for a single item or server, e.g., a classified ad. The system receives user selected media, e.g., an image, from a user device identifying an item for sale. For example, the user can provide an image corresponding to an item for sale. The system extracts information from the received media. Based on the extracted information, the system retrieves information regarding similar items to the item for sale, e.g., from other sponsored content items. The system can provide some or all of this information to the user. For example, the information can be provided directly or can be processed (e.g., aggregated, summarized, or filtered) prior to providing. The user device can display this information, e.g., a range of prices for items similar to the item for sale, and can prompt the user to enter additional information regarding the item for sale, e.g., a desired price. After the system receives additional information from the user device and incorporates details from a product catalog, the system can generate a sponsored content item for the item for sale.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a user request to generate a sponsored content item, the request including a media item representing an item for sale; extracting data from the media item, the extracted data being associated with one or more properties of the item represented by the media item; identifying product details in a product catalog using the extracted data; identifying similar items in a sponsored content item index using the extracted data, wherein the sponsored content item index includes a plurality of other sponsored content items describing items for sale; prompting the user for additional information using the similar items; and generating the sponsored content item using the media item, the extracted data, the additional information from the user, and user contact information. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The extracted data includes a title or description. The media item is an image, audio, video, or rich text. Sending the product details to the device, the product details including attributes and specification of the media item, which can cause the device to auto-populate fields associated with the sponsored content item. Sending a range of prices for the similar items to the device. The additional information includes a title, description, price or specification of the item for sale. Retrieving the user contact information. The user contact information includes a user ID, user name, email, phone number, or other identifying contact information. The user contact information is retrieved from a user database or from the user.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The system can quickly generate a sponsored content item after a seller submits an image. The user does not have to provide as much information because the system extracts information from the image and can automatically fill in information about the sponsored content item. Based on the item represented in the image, the system can find similar items through a sponsored content item index. A price range of similar items can be displayed to the user, guiding the user to make an informed decision regarding what information to put in the sponsored content item. The system can auto-populate key characteristics for a sponsored content item. The characteristics can be retrieved from a product catalog. For example, if the item is a car, the characteristics include a model, make, price, and additional car features. Another advantage is that the system can automatically incorporate user contact information when generating a sponsored content item.

-
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of anexample system 100 that uses image recognition to create sponsored content item, e.g., classified advertisements. Classified advertisements are examples of a particular type of sponsored content item, e.g., a single conversion sponsored content item. A conventional classified ad is an advertisement by a particular individual for a single item or service. Generally speaking, clients and anad system 108 can be data processing apparatus, for example, handheld devices, rack-mounted servers, or other computing devices. The data processing apparatus within thead system 108 can be in the same physical location (e.g., data center) or can be in different physical locations. The clients andad system 108 can have different capabilities and computer architectures. In some implementations, aclient 102 is an end-user device e.g., a personal computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or a cellular phone. Theclient 102 communicates with thead system 108 over anetwork 106. The client includes acamera 104 for generating images. Thead system 108 can have a sponsoredcontent item generator 114 that generates ads based on information from theclient 102, a sponsoredcontent item index 110, auser database 112, and aproduct catalog 116. - In some implementations, the
ad system 108 accesses the sponsoredcontent item index 110. Theindex 110 can be an electronic file system, a distributed file system, or other network-accessible persistent storage that can store information on computer-readable storage media. Theindex 110 can include one or more data processing apparatus and one or more computer-readable media. In some implementations, the sponsoredcontent item index 110 contains advertisements of numerous items for sale from different clients. In some implementations, the sponsoredcontent item index 110 contains, for each sponsored content item, one or more of a title, description, price, item information, one or more images, or owner information. For example, if the item in the sponsored content item index is a car, the item information can include one or more of a make, model, year, mileage, or additional vehicle options. - In some implementations, the
ad system 108 accesses auser database 112. Theuser database 112 can be an electronic file system, a distributed file system, or other network-accessible persistent storage that can store information on computer-readable storage media with one or more data processing apparatus. In some implementations, theuser database 112 contains information on users accessing the system, e.g., user profile information. For example, the information can include the user's name, phone number, email, or preferred contact type. The information can be used to automatically provide information in the sponsored content item created by the system for the user, for example, adding contact information to the sponsored content item based on user preferences so that a potential buyer can contact the user. The user can be provided with an opt-in option to have their user preferences or contact information provided when generating the sponsored content item. - In some implementations, the
ad system 108 accesses aproduct catalog 116. Theproduct catalog 116 can be an electronic file system, a distributed file system, or other network-accessible persistent storage that can store information on computer-readable storage media with one or more data processing apparatus. In some implementations, theproduct catalog 116 contains details on multiple items. For example, the details can include an item's title, description, or additional options. The details can also include brand or model. Thead system 108 can use this information from theproduct catalog 116 to automatically incorporate item details into the sponsored content item prior to generation. -
FIG. 2 is a flow chart ofexample communications 200 between a client and an ad system. The client selectsmedia 202 identifying an item for sale. In some implementations, this media includes an image, audio, video, or text that describes the item for sale. The client can capture the media using a camera, for example a camera incorporated into a mobile client device. Alternatively, the user can select from media stored on a device, for example, stored image files or image files downloaded from another device, e.g., a separate camera. The client sends data including the media to thead system 204. In some implementations, this data also includes a location, user identifying data, time, or other information related to the client. - After receiving the data, the ad system extracts information from the
media 206. For example, if the media received is an image of a car, the ad system can extract the color, vehicle type, make, or model of car from the image. In some alternative implementations, the image is provided to an extraction system that returns information extracted from the image. - The system then can identify product details from a
product catalog 207 based on the extracted information. For example, if the system extracted a model of the car, the product catalog can provide information about specifications of the car, such as the car's features, e.g., whether it has four wheel drive. If the system determines with confidence that the image matches an entry in the product catalog, the system can include information about the product in the system's communication with the client. - The extracted information also enables the ad system to identify similar items to the item for
sale 208. The system can search similar items in the sponsored content item index by comparing titles or descriptions. Entries in the sponsored content item index can be linked to products in the product catalog. Therefore, the system can also search similar items in the sponsored content item index by searching a product's make or model. - After obtaining similar items to the item for sale from the sponsored content item index, the ad system can then send data derived from the similar items to the
client 210. In some implementations, the data includes a range of prices that are associated with the identified similar items. For example, if the item for sale is a sedan and the ad system identified similar sedans having prices ranging from $3,000 to $4,000, the data can be provided to the client. In another example, if the item for sale is a computer, the ad system can identify a price range of computers having similar specifications, e.g., $1,200-$1,500. The ad system can provide the price range to the client. Providing this pricing information for similar items to the client can educate a user to make an informed decision as to what price should be set for the item on sale. - In some implementations, the data includes the product details from the product catalog described above. For example, this data can include color, model, or additional features of the media received by the ad system. Upon receiving the product details, the client can auto-populate an
ad 212 with product details, which facilitates creation of the ad. This data can also serve to confirm with the user that information about the image is properly identified. In some implementations, the client prompts the user with a message to confirm the correct identification of the image. For example, “Identified a 2000 Brand X Model Y, is this correct?” - After receiving data from the ad system, the client displays a price range of the similar items 213. For example, the client can display “Your item recently listed for $3,000-3,300 USD.” In some implementations, the client then prompts the user to enter in details 214, for example, a price for the item on sale. For example, the client can display a dialog box asking the user to enter input for additional information. The client can prompt the user for additional information other than price. For example, if the item on sale is a car, additional information can include mileage. Or if the item on sale is an electronic device, additional information can include when the user purchased the electronic device. In some implementations, the client prompts for user identifying information such as a name or contact information. After the user provides the additional information, the client sends the data, including the prompted information, to the
ad system 216. - The ad system receives the data from the client. In some implementations, the received data includes the price of the item. In some other implementations, the received data supplies additional details regarding the advertisement, for example, a timestamp or location of the device. In some implementations, the client's response includes user information. For example, user information can include a user's name, login information, or contact information. In some implementations, the ad system retrieves user information from a
user database 218. - In some alternative implementations, the ad system retrieves the user information when the user submits an image. In further alternative implementations, the system can draw partially from the user database and partially from user submitted contact information that was received from the client. The user can also specify what type of contact information to include in the ad, for example, only a phone number, only an email, or only phone number and email. The ad system can associate the user information with the item for sale.
- The ad system generates the sponsored
content item 220. For example, the sponsored content item can include the original image, title, description, price, the seller's name, or the seller's contact information. In some implementations, the advertisement only requires an image before it is generated. The ad system can then store the sponsored content item in the sponsored content item index or another database. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart of anexample method 300 of generating a sponsored content item through an ad system. For convenience, themethod 300 will be described with respect to a system having one or more computing devices that performs themethod 300. The system receives media from aclient 302. The system then extracts information from the media 304. With the extracted information, the system identifies product details of the media from aproduct catalog 306. The system can also identify similar products from a sponsoredcontent item index 308. The system then sends data, which can pertain to product details or similar products, to theclient 310. The system then receives the data, which can include user preferences or additional information, from theclient 312. Next, the system can retrieveuser information 314 from a database. The system generates a sponsoredcontent item 316. The system can store the generated sponsored content item in the sponsored content item index or another database. -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart of anexample method 400 of providing an advertisement for presentation. For convenience, themethod 400 will be described with respect to a system having one or more computing devices that performs themethod 400. - The system receives a request for an advertisement 402. The request can be a request to provide an advertisement within a rendered web page or search results. Alternatively, the request can be part of a request to provide a group of sponsored content items to browse, e.g., a request to provide a group of sponsored content items corresponding to bicycles for sale. In some implementations, the system receives a request from a mobile device. In some other implementations, the system receives a request from another type of computing device, e.g., a desktop, tablet, or laptop computer.
- The system identifies an
advertisement 404 responsive to the request. In particular, the system can identify a sponsored content item from a sponsored content item index or another database as responsive to the request. The system provides the identified ad for presentation 406. For example, the ad can be provided to a client device to be rendered by a browser along with other content. - For example, a user can enter a search query into a search engine. The search engine, in addition to compiling a resulting list of search results, can route the query to an ad system.
- Ads relevant to the query are identified. For example, ads with keywords that are the same, similar to, or synonymous with words in the search query can be identified. The identified ads can include a collection of candidate ads that match the keywords or other criteria. The ad system can then select particular ads from the collection of candidate ads. In some implementations, the ads are ranked according to one or more scoring criteria (e.g., based on the degree of match between the query and the ad keywords). One or more top scoring ads can be selected. In particular, the selected ads include a sponsored content item for a particular item or service from a user. The sponsored content item can be a single conversion ad, meaning that the item identified in the ad can only be purchased once, resulting in a single ad conversion.
- In some implementations, the location of the user and location targeting information associated with an ad can be used in identifying or ranking ads. For example, a sponsored content item having location targeting information indicating personal delivery in a twenty mile radius (e.g., ads for a couch or firewood) from the seller can have presentation limited to those potential buyers within the twenty mile radius (e.g., they can be omitted from candidate ads or can have a large location based penalty to the score when ranking candidate ads). In another example, a sponsored content item with location targeting information indicating a ship-from address (e.g., ads for a book, collectable, or handbag) can be ranked in part based on estimated shipping costs from the seller to the user.
- One or more selected ads are presented to the user along with the search results. In some implementations, the ads can be formatted or differentiated from the search results to indicate which of the presented elements are ads and which are search results. The presented ads include the selected sponsored content item.
-
FIG. 5 is a diagram of anexample view 500 of a sponsored content item embedded within search results. The advertisement can be provided for display on a user device 502. For example, in response to an ad request, the ad system can identify the ad to be provided. In theexample ad 516 shown inFIG. 5 , the advertisement is for a vehicle. Thead 516 includes animage 504 of the item for sale, a make, model, year, andmileage 506 of the vehicle. The ad also includes a description 508 of the item for sale,user information 510, and a price range 512. Theuser information 510 can allow the user of the user device 502 to contact the seller of the item for sale. For example, if a phone number is displayed, the client can provide a link that can place a call to the phone number. If an email address is displayed, the client can create a new email message with the recipient being the seller's email in response to a user selection of the email address. In some implementations, links for contact information (for example, phone number and email address) are embedded within the content of the data received from the ad system. - The ad can be embedded within a
results page 518.Results page 518 showssearch results 514 generated in response to a search query ‘Sedan’ submitted by a user associated with a particular location (e.g., location can be identified for the user based on a laptop with GPS, cell phone with tower triangulation, etc) in San Francisco. Thesingle conversion ad 516 was created with the keyword ‘Sedan’ by a seller with a home address in the San Francisco area. Thead 516 was selected as relevant to the search query by an ad manager because both a keyword and city associated with the ad matched a keyword and city associated with the search query. This is an example of an ad being provided with search results. Thead 516 can be provided with other content, for example, on a particular web page. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
