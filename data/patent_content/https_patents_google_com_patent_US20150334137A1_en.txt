- a location tagged comment refers to a comment made about a particular location, an entity at the particular location, or a comment made while situated at the particular location or an entity at the particular location.
- the comment is not identified as a review, no further action is taken. If the comment is identified as a review, then the user is prompted for permission to publish the content as a review of the location. If the user does not provide permission, the comment is not published as a review. If the user provides permission to publish the comment as a review, the user is prompted to select all or portions of the comment for publishing. The comment (or selected portions) is then stored as a review of the location. In some embodiments, all previous location-tagged comments from a user are processed. Additionally, in some embodiments, a user is prompted to tag the comment as a review upon submission of the comment.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a process 100 for identifying user reviews from user-authored comments associated with a location in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a user 100 writes a location-tagged comment 104 , and posts the location-tagged comment 104 on a social networking service 106 .
- the comment 104 is not explicitly identified as a review, a location tagged to the comment 104 indicates the comment is related to the location and may be a review of an entity at the location.
- the comment includes comment text 108 authored by the user 102 that may describe the user's experiences interacting with the entity at the location, the performance of the entity, the user's satisfaction with the entity, and so on.
- the comment 104 posted to the social networking service 106 is evaluated to determine whether it contains a review (block 110 ).
- the evaluation includes processing the comment using an n-gram based support vector machine.
- the evaluation includes determining if the comment is a review of an entity at the location (decision block 112 ). If the comment is not determined to be a review (line 114 ), no further action is taken (block 116 ). If the comment is determined to be a review (line 118 ), then permission to publish the comment is obtained from the user (block 120 ). If the user provides permission, the comment is published as a review of the entity at the location (block 122 ).
- the comment 104 and an associated location or entity identifier may be stored in a database 124 of location reviews.
- the published comment is then made available on a webpage identifying the location or entity and providing information about the location or entity (e.g., a “place page”), websites that provide reviews of locations or entities, and the like.

- the location-tagged comment is not identified as a review, but the location-tagged comment may include a description of a user's experience at an entity at the location, a user's opinion of the entity, and so on.
- the location-tagged comment is obtained (block 204 ).
- a user may explicitly submit the location-tagged comment for identification, or the location-tagged comment may be automatically extracted from the service on which it was posted (e.g., from a webpage provided by a social networking service, a blogging service, a microblogging service, and the like).
- the comment is evaluated to identify whether the comment is a review of the location or an entity at the location (block 206 ).
- the evaluation includes processing the comment using an n-gram based support vector machine 208 .
- the support vector machine is trained on a corpus of explicit reviews and location-tagged comments.
- the corpus of reviews and location-tagged comments are obtained from previously submitted reviews of a location and comments that are tagged with the location.
- the location-tagged comments are manually processed to identify comments that are and that are not reviews.
- a support vector machine is trained using word-based n-grams is trained to identify reviews in location tagged comments.
- the support vector machine may then be used to identify reviews from location-tagged comments that are not part of the training set using the n-gram indicators. For example, the support vector machine can be trained to identify location-tagged comments containing the n-grams “reasonably priced entrees” and “service was excellent” to be restaurant reviews.
- the execution time of the evaluation is compared to a latency threshold (decision block 210 ). If the execution time of the evaluation is greater than the latency threshold (line 212 ), no further action is taken (block 214 ). If the execution time is less than or equal to the latency threshold (line 216 ), then a decision is reached indicating whether the comment is a review (decision block 218 ). If the comment is not identified as a review (line 220 ), then no further action is taken (block 222 ). If the comment is identified as a review (line 224 ), then the user is prompted for permission to publish to the comment (decision block 226 ).
- the comment is not published (block 230 ). If the user provides permission to publish the comment (line 232 ) then, in some embodiments, the user is prompted to select the portions of the comment for publishing (block 234 ). For example, the user may select the entire comment for publishing or may select only portions of the comment for publishing.
- the comment is published as a review of the location associated with the comment or an entity at that location (block 236 ). For example, as described above, in some embodiments the comment is associated with an identifier for the location or entity, and is stored in a database or other data structure indexed by the location or entity identifier. The comment may be provided as a review of the location or entity in response to subsequent requests for reviews of the location or entity, such as in response to a selection of a search result.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a process 100 for identifying user reviews from user-authored comments associated with a location in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown inFIG. 100 , a user 100 writes a location-taggedcomment 104, and posts the location-taggedcomment 104 on asocial networking service 106. Although thecomment 104 is not explicitly identified as a review, a location tagged to thecomment 104 indicates the comment is related to the location and may be a review of an entity at the location. The comment includescomment text 108 authored by theuser 102 that may describe the user's experiences interacting with the entity at the location, the performance of the entity, the user's satisfaction with the entity, and so on. - Next, the
comment 104 posted to thesocial networking service 106 is evaluated to determine whether it contains a review (block 110). As described further below, in some embodiments the evaluation includes processing the comment using an n-gram based support vector machine. The evaluation includes determining if the comment is a review of an entity at the location (decision block 112). If the comment is not determined to be a review (line 114), no further action is taken (block 116). If the comment is determined to be a review (line 118), then permission to publish the comment is obtained from the user (block 120). If the user provides permission, the comment is published as a review of the entity at the location (block 122). For example, thecomment 104 and an associated location or entity identifier may be stored in adatabase 124 of location reviews. In some embodiments, the published comment is then made available on a webpage identifying the location or entity and providing information about the location or entity (e.g., a “place page”), websites that provide reviews of locations or entities, and the like. -
FIG. 2 depicts aprocess 200 for identifying a location-tagged comment submitted by a user as a review of an entity at the location in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a user submits a location-tagged comment (block 202), such as by submitting the comment to a social networking service, a blog, or other services or websites. As noted above, the location-tagged comment is not identified as a review, but the location-tagged comment may include a description of a user's experience at an entity at the location, a user's opinion of the entity, and so on. Next, the location-tagged comment is obtained (block 204). For example, a user may explicitly submit the location-tagged comment for identification, or the location-tagged comment may be automatically extracted from the service on which it was posted (e.g., from a webpage provided by a social networking service, a blogging service, a microblogging service, and the like). - Next, the comment is evaluated to identify whether the comment is a review of the location or an entity at the location (block 206). In some embodiments the evaluation includes processing the comment using an n-gram based
support vector machine 208. In such embodiments, the support vector machine is trained on a corpus of explicit reviews and location-tagged comments. The corpus of reviews and location-tagged comments are obtained from previously submitted reviews of a location and comments that are tagged with the location. The location-tagged comments are manually processed to identify comments that are and that are not reviews. Based on this corpus of explicit reviews and manually identified location-tagged comments that are and are not reviews, a support vector machine is trained using word-based n-grams is trained to identify reviews in location tagged comments. The support vector machine may then be used to identify reviews from location-tagged comments that are not part of the training set using the n-gram indicators. For example, the support vector machine can be trained to identify location-tagged comments containing the n-grams “reasonably priced entrees” and “service was excellent” to be restaurant reviews. - In some embodiments, the execution time of the evaluation is compared to a latency threshold (decision block 210). If the execution time of the evaluation is greater than the latency threshold (line 212), no further action is taken (block 214). If the execution time is less than or equal to the latency threshold (line 216), then a decision is reached indicating whether the comment is a review (decision block 218). If the comment is not identified as a review (line 220), then no further action is taken (block 222). If the comment is identified as a review (line 224), then the user is prompted for permission to publish to the comment (decision block 226). If the user does not provide permission to publish the comment (line 228), then the comment is not published (block 230). If the user provides permission to publish the comment (line 232) then, in some embodiments, the user is prompted to select the portions of the comment for publishing (block 234). For example, the user may select the entire comment for publishing or may select only portions of the comment for publishing. Next, the comment is published as a review of the location associated with the comment or an entity at that location (block 236). For example, as described above, in some embodiments the comment is associated with an identifier for the location or entity, and is stored in a database or other data structure indexed by the location or entity identifier. The comment may be provided as a review of the location or entity in response to subsequent requests for reviews of the location or entity, such as in response to a selection of a search result.
- In some embodiments, a user is provided with the option to manually identify a location-tagged comment as a review.
FIG. 3 depicts aprocess 300 for identifying a location-tagged comment submitted by a user as a review of a location or entity in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a user submits a location-tagged comment (block 302), such as by submitting the comment to a social networking service, a blog, or other services. As noted above, the location-tagged comment is not identified as a review of the location, but the location-tagged comment may include a description of a user's experience at the location, a user's opinion of the location, and so on. Next the user is prompted to identify the comment as a review (block 304). In some embodiments, a prompt is provided in response to all location-tagged comments submitted by a user. In other embodiments, a prompt is provided based on an evaluation of the location-tagged comment identifying the comment as a review. For example, the evaluation may include an identification of keywords or more detailed processing, such as the support vector machine processing described above. - Further processing is based on whether the location-tagged comment has been identified as a review (decision block 306). If the comment is not a review (line 308), then no further action is taken (block 310). If the comment is a review (line 312), then the user is prompted for permission to publish the comment (decision block 314). If the user does not provide permission to publish the comment (line 316), then no further action is taken (block 318). If the user provides permission to publish the comment (line 320) then the comment is published as a review of the location or an entity at the location (block 322). Additionally, in some embodiments, the user is prompted to select all or portions of the comment for publishing as the review. As described above, the comment may be associated with an identifier for the location or entity and stored in a database or other data structure and provided in response to requests for reviews.

FIG. 4 depicts asystem 400 for identifying location-tagged comments authored by a user as a review of a location or entity in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system includes aclient computer 402 for auser 404 and a server 406 (e.g., one or more servers) in communication via anetwork 408. Additionally, various web services are in communication with thenetwork 408 and accessible by theclient 402. For example, the web services may include asocial networking service 410, a location-basedservice 412, amicroblogging service 414, and ablogging service 416. As will be appreciated, each service may include or be described as a website and may provide webpages for viewing and interaction by users. Each service may be hosted or provided by one or more servers. The one or more servers may or may not be coextensive with the one ormore servers 406 providing the location-tagged commentreview identification process 424. Theclient computer 402 may include laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, etc., and may include a receiver for a satellite-based positioning system, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. In some embodiments, theclient computer 402 may include a desktop computer. A user may use theclient computer 402 to retrieve information, view interactive maps, perform computer-implemented searches, and author and submit comments to the web services described above. - The
server 406 may be a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Theserver 406 may include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. Additionally, theserver 406 may be, for example, computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. Such configurations may use thenetwork 408 for communication or may communicate over other networks. - The
client computer 402 andserver 406 are in communication with thenetwork 408, such as through a wired or wireless network interface. In some embodiments, thenetwork 408 may include multiple networks, and may include any suitable network and networking technology, such as the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or any other suitable network. Additionally, thenetwork 208 may include a wired network, a wireless network, or both. Moreover, it should be appreciated that theclient computer 402 andserver 406 may communicate over different networks separately and simultaneously. For example, theclient computer 402 may communicate over both a wireless Ethernet network and a cellular network - The
social networking service 410 may provide a social graph associated with theuser 404 and enable the user to communicate with persons included in the social graph, persons excluded from the social graph, and entities having a presence on thesocial networking service 410. In some embodiments, the social graph is automatically generated by thesocial networking service 410 or manually created by theuser 404, and the user may add or remove persons to and from the social graph. Content submitted to thesocial networking service 410 may be provided on a webpage associated with the user, a webpage associated with a person in the user's social graph, or a webpage associated with a location. For example, in some embodiments a location-tagged comment may be provided on one or more such webpages for viewing by the user, persons in the user's social graph, or other users of thesocial networking service 410. User permission may be required to post the user's content, e.g., to persons outside of the user's social network, and the user may generally be given controls to indicate where the user's content can be posted, and how it can be disseminated to people in and outside of the user's social graph. - The location-based
service 412 may allow a user to submit the user's location for various purposes, e.g., for viewing by persons in a social graph associated with the user or to receive advertisements or coupons from vendors at or near the location. For example, a user may “check-in” or “check-out” at a location to indicate the user's presence at the location. In some embodiments, the location-basedservice 412 may automatically indicate the user's presence at a location based on the position determined by and obtained from theclient computer 402. In some embodiments, user permission is required prior to obtaining or posting information regarding the user's location. Additionally, in some embodiments theuser 404 may view the location of persons in the user's social graph who have provided permission to share their location with theuser 404. Additionally, the location-basedservice 412 may receive content from theuser 404. For example, after “checking-in” to a location, theuser 404 may submit a location-tagged comment that is tagged with the location based on the user's “check-in.” The comments may be published with user permission, and viewed by other users, such as persons from the social graph associated withuser 404, when viewing information about the location. - The
microblogging service 414 may receive content, e.g., microblogs, from theuser 404. In some embodiments, the microblogs submitted by theuser 404 are automatically tagged with a location determined by and obtained from theclient computer 402. In other embodiments, theuser 404 may tag the microblog with a location during submission. In some embodiments, the microblog may be distinguished from other content by limitations on the size of the comment. For example, the microblog may be limited to a number of characters or a memory size. The microblogs submitted by theuser 404 may be provided on a webpage associated with theuser 404 and viewed by other users of themicroblogging service 414. Such microblogs may be public and viewable by any users of themicroblogging service 414 or such microblogs may be private and only viewable by other users having an identified relationship to theuser 404. The blog postings submitted by theuser 404 may be automatically tagged with a location determined by and obtained from theclient computer 402 or theuser 404 may tag the microblog with a location during submission. User permission may be required to tag the microblog with the user's location. - The
blogging service 416 may receive location-tagged comments (“blog posts”) from theuser 404. Theblogging service 416 may receive such comments for posting to a blog, e.g., a webpage that aggregates and displays a user's submitted comments for viewing on the Internet. In such embodiments, the blog may be public and viewable by any users of the Internet, or the blog may be private and only viewable by other users having an identified relationship to theuser 404. Here again, the blog posts submitted by theuser 404 may be automatically tagged with a location determined by and obtained from theclient computer 402, or, in some embodiments, theuser 404 may tag the blog post with a location during submission. User permission may be required to tag the blog post with the user's location, and/or to share the blog post with other users. - The
user 404 uses theclient computer 402 to author content and submitcontent 418 to the various web services via thenetwork 408. For example, theuser 404 may visit a location (e.g., a restaurant, bar, and the like) and submit content to thesocial networking service 410 that describes the user's experience at the location or an entity at the location. In another example, a user may submit a microblog (a “tweet”) during or after the user's visit to the location. In yet another example, the user may author a blog comment and submit the comment to the user's blog (or another blog) via theblogging service 416. In some embodiments, the location tagged to submitted content is generated from a determined position of theclient computer 402. For example, theclient computer 402 may determine its own position via GPS signals, or may have its position determined (e.g., via servers associated with the location-based service 412) via triangulation from Wi-Fi access point or cell tower connections, and that position may be associated with an entity at that location. As will be appreciated, thecontent 418 authored and submitted by theuser 404 may include both location-taggedcontent 420 anduntagged content 422. Theuntagged content 422 is not tagged with a location and is not processed by theserver 406. - The
server 406 includes areview identification process 424 that obtains location-taggedcontent 420 and processes the content in accordance with the techniques described herein. As described above, thereview identification process 424 identifiesreviews 426 of locations from the location-taggedcontent 420. In some embodiments, location-taggedcontent 420 can be identified as a review based on an n-gram analysis of the content by a support vector machine as described above. The identified reviews 426 may associated with a location identifier and stored in adatabase 428 or other data structure stored on or accessible by theserver 406. -
