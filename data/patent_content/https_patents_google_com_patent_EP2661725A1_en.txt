- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating example functions performed by call metric system 150, according to various implementations of the invention.
- call metric system 150 may receive, from a caller, one or more calls (illustrated in FIG. 2 as CALL 1, CALL 2, CALL 3, CALL N).
- Call metric system 150 may determine, for each call of the one or more calls, at least one phone number that originated the one or more calls. For example, call metric system 150 may determine that phone number 1 originated call 1, phone number 2 originated call 2, phone number 1 originated call 3, phone number N originated call N, and so forth.
- call metric system 150 may identify at least one tracked keyword of one or more tracked keywords based on the at least one phone number. In some implementations, call metric system 150 may identify at least one tracked keyword based on the association of the at least one tracked keyword with the at least one phone number. For example, tracked keyword 1 may be identified as the tracked keyword associated with phone number 1. In other words, tracked keyword 1 led to call 1. Tracked keyword 2 may be identified as the tracked keyword associated with phone number 2. In other words, tracked keyword 2 led to call 2. Similarly, tracked keyword N may be identified as the tracked keyword associated with phone number N. In other words, tracked keyword N led to call N.
- call metric system 150 may establish a call between the caller and an entity associated with the at least one tracked keyword based on the received one or more calls.
- call metric system 150 may determine that tracked keyword 1 has led to more calls for an entity than tracked keyword 2 or tracked keyword N. For example, as can be seen in FIG. 2, tracked keyword 1 lead to both call 1 and call 3, whereas tracked keyword 2 and N led to calls 2 and N, respectively.
- call metric system 150 may rank each tracked keyword based on the received one or more calls. For example, call metric system 150 may rank tracked keyword 1 higher than tracked keyword 2 or tracked keyword N because tracked keyword 1 led to a higher number of calls for the entity. In other words, tracked keyword 1 may be a more effective keyword that tracked keywords 2 and N because tracked keyword 1 led to more calls. For example, for a clothing retailer, tracked keywords related to women's garments may lead to a higher number of calls than tracked keywords related to accessories. Similarly, for a communications products website, tracked keywords related to internet products may lead to higher number of calls than tracked keywords related to land-line phone products.
- call metric system 150 may determine, for each tracked keyword of the one or more tracked keywords, a number of calls received from the phone number associated with the tracked keyword. For example, a determination may be made that two calls were received from phone number 1 associated with tracked keyword 1, one call was received from phone number 2 associated with tracked keyword 2, one call was received from phone number N associated with tracked keyword N, and so forth.
- call metric system 150 may generate a report.
- the report may include the one or more tracked keywords and the phone numbers associated with the tracked keywords.
- the report may include the determined number of calls for each tracked keyword.
- the report may include, for each tracked keyword, a number of calls received from the phone number associated with the tracked keyword.
- the report may include the monitored, recorded, and/or transcribed information associated with the calls.
- the report may include conventional metrics associated with keywords as would be appreciated.
- call metric system 150 may receive a request for the report from an advertiser or other entity.
- the advertiser or other entity may indicate, among other things, one or more tracked keywords for which they would like the report to be generated.
- call metric system 150 may generate the report for the tracked keywords and communicate the report to a remote computing device used by an advertiser (not otherwise illustrated in FIG. 1).
- call metric system 150 may determine whether a tracked keyword is an effective keyword for the entity based on, for example, the number of calls received from the phone number associated with the tracked keyword. If a tracked keyword has led to a large number (such as a predefined number according to particular needs) of calls, a determination may be made that the tracked keyword is an effective keyword.
- each tracked keyword may be associated with a bid.
- the bid may include a value or other indication that indicates a dollar or other currency amount that an entity, such as an advertiser, is willing to pay to have a promotional message associated with the tracked keyword to be displayed in the advertising network to which the promotional message serving system 110 has access.
- a higher bid may be associated with the tracked keyword than another keyword that is determined to be a less effective keyword.
- call metric system 150 may determine a tracked keyword led to a call based on one or more events.
- the events may include, but is not limited to, a user generating a request that includes request keyword(s), a promotional message associated with an entity being displayed in response to the request keyword(s), the user selecting the promotional message, a website associated with the entity being visited, the user calling the phone number included in the landing page/web page, wherein the phone number is associated with at least one tracked keyword and is selected based on a match between at least one tracked keyword and the request keywords.
- a browser cookie may be stored by the web browser used by the user of computing device 120.
- a URL uniform resource locator
- call metric system 150 may determine one or more events that led to a call 1.
- Call metric system 150 may determine that phone number 1 originated call 1.
- Call metric system 150 may identify tracked keyword 1 as the tracked keyword associated with phone number 1 (i.e., that tracked keyword 1 led to call 1).
- Call metric system 150 may determine a length of time in which phone number 1 was associated with tracked keyword 1. In other words, call metric system 150 may determine a time window for the association.
- Call metric system 150 may determine: an estimated time when a request keyword matching tracked keyword 1 was entered at computing device 120, an estimated time when a website associated with the entity (associated with tracked keyword 1) was visited and an estimated time when a promotional message that caused the website visit was selected by the user. Thus, call metric system 150 may determine that call 1 was received due to the selection of the promotional message. In other words, based on timing of various events, call metric system 150 may determine which of the one or more keywords and/or promotional message selections led to a particular call.
- selecting or “selection of a promotional message includes, but is not limited to, clicking with a finger, a stylus, or other object; shaking or tapping computing device 120 (in the case where the computing device is portable, for example); uttering a verbal command; and/or taking any other action in relation to computing device 120 to indicate a selection of a promotional message.
