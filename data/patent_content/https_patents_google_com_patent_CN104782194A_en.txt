Still with reference to figure 4, band inner region 402 can range of distribution 414 between edge 402C and 402D in the first and second boundary belt regions, and in this example, for 9MHz is wide.Can be take the PUSCH signal 416 of one group of 416 subcarrier striding across frequency range 416B and take the PUCCH signal 418 of the one group of 418A subcarrier striding across frequency range 418B in range of distribution 414.This group 416A subcarrier of PUSCH is carried by one group of 416C RB, and this group 418A subcarrier of PUCCH is carried by single RB 418C.When being assigned with carrying uplink data and control signal, the combination of this group RB of PUSCH and the RB of PUCCH will be called as " distributing RB in band ".The combined frequency ranges distributing the subcarrier of RB carrying in band will be referred to collectively as " range of distribution ".
And, be positioned at band can range of distribution 414 be by the subcarrier not being allocated for the RB 422 that carries uplink data and control signal and carrying.These RB are called as jointly " in band non-distribution RB ", and the combined frequency ranges taking their subcarrier will be referred to collectively as " non-range of distribution ".Non-distribution RB 422 is in the diagram only representational, and will understand, and there is the non-distribution RB taking the region do not taken by distributed RB more.In the following example, this group 416A subcarrier of PUSCH will be assumed to be and comprise 60 subcarriers, and this group 416C RB distributing to PUSCH comprises 5 RB, and each RB of this group 416C carries 12 subcarriers.Similarly, this group 418A subcarrier of PUCCH will be assumed to be and comprise 12 subcarriers, and the RB 418C distributing to PUCCH carries 12 subcarriers.The quantity of non-distribution RB 422 is assumed to be 44 RB.
Each in region 402,406,408,410,412 and 414 comprises signal.The subcarrier that signal generally includes carrying PUSCH and PUCCH adds those RB of the signal in the frequency leaking to non-range of distribution, AC region 406 and 408 and pseudo-region 410 and 412.The power of the signal in multiple region will be called as follows: for the P with interior range of distribution
in-band, allocated, for the P with interior non-range of distribution
in-band, non-allocated, for combining the P in AC region 406 and 408
aC, for combining the P in pseudo-region 410 and 412
