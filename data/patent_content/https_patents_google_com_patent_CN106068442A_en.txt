The purpose of this discussion, " map datum " can refer to single map data server or two or more map datum service to term
The group of device.
According to sample scenario, the user in San Francisco is taken a trip to show San Francisco on a client device at Chicago plan
The map content of some part.Several terminals in San Francisco for user's decision, but the uncertain starting point that she may start.So
And, user wants to receive navigation way and guides and have the imagination to the general area that user will be in during travelling.
Before the navigation way being shown to terminal guides, client device 10 shows the ground selecting for user in viewport
Figure content.Fig. 2 A, 2B illustrate with 2C the example map content at three the different viewports showing on a client device and
Navigation way guide to terminal.Terminal is generally selected by user, and can select in many ways.For example, referring to
Fig. 1, when user consults a map content on client device 10, user can be via the mouse of computer, calculating on knee
The touch-screen of the tracking plate of machine or mobile device clicks on the geographical position being automatically designated on map as terminal.As an alternative,
Title or the address in geographical position can be inputted the terminal showing on map via software keyboard or external keyboard by user
In hurdle.User also can be prompted to click on or touch terminal, or user not essential can select terminal.On the contrary, for example,
When user selects retail website, website can include the position of retailer, using as the terminal with regard to website.In another example
In sight, user submits geographic query to, and terminal be automatically displayed on numerical map (can also be automatic in this sight
Ground selects map viewport).But, these are merely illustrative, and terminal can be selected by any number of mode.
After all, after terminal is chosen, the geographical position in identification viewport is to determine one or more starting point.Reference
Fig. 2 A, viewport includes the whole geographic area 50 being shown on client device 10 with specific level of zoom.Display include for
Amplify and reduce geographic area zoom button 60.Carry out additionally, user can double-click in a part for map via mouse
Scaling, or in the case of a touch screen, user can be zoomed in and out by double-tap or pinching.Additionally, user is also permissible
Horizontal sliding shows to check extra geographical position.User by clicking on and can drag, roll, flick etc. and to carry out horizontal sliding.
In the example of Fig. 2 A, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA-SF) 42 in San Francisco has been selected as terminal simultaneously
And demarcated by ice cream drum label.In the viewport 50 of Fig. 2 A, identification of geographic location is to determine one or more
Point.For example, the 46th, green citizen company (GreenCitizen Inc.) the 48th, Europe, the 44th, San Francisco Four Seasons Hotel, station, Montgomery
Ba Bu also that park (Yerba Buena Gardens) 52 etc. be viewport 48 in geographical position, these geographical position can be by
Ranking is to determine one or more starting point, in order to generates navigation way and guides.After geographical position is identified, starting point scoring is drawn
Hold up the possibility of the starting point that 38 (as shown in fig. 1) determined that each geographical position can be user.
In order to determine this possibility, starting point rating engine 38 is in view of the level of zoom of viewport 50.When viewport is amplified to
When high-level, starting point rating engine assumes that user can be and to be possible to being somebody's turn to do in cities and towns in the very concrete part in cities and towns
Set out in sight spot in concrete part, POI, highway, transport hub etc..On the other hand, if viewport is reduced, then starting point scoring
Engine 38 assumes that user may be just from distant location.Therefore, major highways or even airport are more likely users
Starting point.
The popularity in geographical position is also counted by starting point rating engine 38 as factor.This can be for example by using social activity
The number to the people that ad-hoc location " is registered " for the website determines.Additionally, whether popularity can be ancient by identification of geographic location
Mark or famous tourist attractions determine.Additionally, time and date are likely to affect the popularity in geographical position.For example, auspicious
Lattice profit court may be higher than period ranking in terms of popularity in the winter time during summer.
Can be another of the possibility for determining starting point that geographical position can be user to the accessibility in geographical position
Factor.Accessibility is associated with the possible travel pattern to geographical position.For example, airport is more more difficult than expressway exit
Reaching, reason is that airport most possibly needs aircraft, and expressway exit most possibly needs automobile.It is further directed to this
The public transportation hub of point, such as railway station is easier to reach than expressway exit, and reason is that anyone can use public affairs
Transport hub altogether.Additionally, the distance from geographical position to terminal can be used to determine that the possibility that geographical position can be starting point.
But, this and nonexcludability are enumerated, and any number of factor can be used for determining that geographical position can be rising of user
The possibility of point.
Each factor can obtain score value and the score value of factor can be cumulatively added to determine accumulation score value.Can be by often
The accumulation score value in individual geographical position compares, in order to ranking geographical position.In other embodiments, can be according to each factor
Come ranking geographical position, and be then based on their average rankings in terms of several factors and come ranking geographical position again.So
And, ranking can be carried out by any number of mode in geographical position.
Return to the example of Fig. 2 A, station, Montgomery 44 be viewport 50 in geographical position in top ranked position, and
And as result, station, Montgomery 44 is the starting point that navigation way guides.This is possibly due to station, Montgomery is traffic
Hinge, therefore readily accessible this place.Station, Montgomery is also likely to be very popular railway station.After all, once starting point
Rating engine 38 determines starting point, just generates and guides 56 from the navigation way of origin-to-destination.As shown in Figure 2 A, route guiding bag
Include the instruction of the time span arriving at terminal based on travel pattern 58.
For the navigation server 32 (as shown in fig. 1) for generating route guiding, in addition to beginning and end, navigation
Server 32 also can receive the instruction of travel pattern.User by selecting walking, driving, public transport or can ride
Button (not shown) selects travel pattern on viewport 50.As an alternative, starting point rating engine 38 can based on starting point and other
Because usually determining possible travel pattern.For example, from station, Montgomery 44 to the possible traffic of Museum of Modern Art 42
Pattern can be walking, and reason is owing to station, Montgomery 44 is to the nearest railway station of Museum of Modern Art 42 or public affairs
Hand over station, so user is most likely at station, Montgomery 44 and detrains.Additionally, from station, Montgomery 44 to modern art
The distance in museum 42 is extremely short, and therefore walking is possible.On the other hand, if starting point is expressway exit, then with walking,
Riding or taking public transport and compare, travel pattern is more likely to drive.Therefore, navigation server 32 receives and generates from illiteracy
Station, Montgomery 44 is to the request of the Walking Route guide of Museum of Modern Art 42, and route guiding 56 is displayed on viewport
On 50.
Turning now to Fig. 2 B, viewport 70 indicates that user not yet changes terminal and level of zoom is identical, but user is eastwards
Nan Ping pushes away.When user horizontal sliding or change level of zoom on map, remove and determine one or more starting point and navigation is provided
Outside route guiding, map data server 36 (as shown in Figure 1) also generates for the map datum of new viewport and by this ground
Diagram data sends to client device 10.In the example viewport 70 of Fig. 2 B, station, Montgomery is no longer in viewport 70.To the greatest extent
Pipe still suffers from from some geographical position of the viewport 50 of Fig. 2 A, such as green citizen company 48 and Ou Babu also that park
52, but also have many new positions, such as No. 80 highway the 3rd streets outlet the 62nd, education in west Chinas (WestEd) 64 of the U.S. and
Sub-emerald green this fine work apartment (Ceatrice Polite Apartments) 66 of match.In this example, No. 80 highways of the U.S.
Three street outlets 62 are confirmed as the starting point of most probable user.This is possibly due to the popularity of No. 80 highways, Yi Jiyin
Be the 3rd street outlet be to the nearest expressway exit of Museum of Modern Art 42.As result, show high from the U.S. 80
Speed highway the 3rd street outlet 62 is to the driving directions 72 of Museum of Modern Art 42.
Fig. 2 C illustrates the map content at the 3rd viewport 80s and to the end identical with the terminal 42 in Fig. 2 A and 2B
The exemplary display that the navigation way of point 42 guides.In this viewport 80, it appears that user significantly reduces from viewport 50 and 70.
As result, map data server 36 (as shown in Figure 1) generates for the map datum of new viewport and by this map number
According to transmission to client device 10.Owing to viewport is in so low level of zoom, the unique geographical position therefore showing is state
Airport, border, such as San Francisco International Airport (SFO) 82 and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) 84.In this case, Yong Huyou
May watch geographical position from national another part or another country, thus airport is more likely rising of user
Point.
Due to SFO82 than LAX84 closer to Museum of Modern Art 42, therefore starting point rating engine 38 may determine that
SFO82 is starting point and asks the navigation way of from SFO82 to Museum of Modern Art 42 to guide.If user does not select to hand over
Logical pattern, then starting point rating engine may determine that possible traffic module is driving or public transport and modern skill is arrived in offer
The driving in art museum 42 or public transit route are guided.
In each example of Fig. 2 A to 2C, only determine a starting point and show route from an origin-to-destination
Guide.But, as set forth above, it is possible to determine several starting point and show route guiding from several starting points.By according to
The descending of its ranking selects geographical position, until selecting the starting point specifying number, it may be determined that several starting points.The number of starting point can
