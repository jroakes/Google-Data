Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to suggesting participation in an online social group.
- Social networks permit users to post information about themselves and to communicate with other people, e.g., their friends, family, and co-workers. Some social networks permit users to specify friendships with other users. Additionally, social networks may provide users with opportunities to interact with other users who are on, or outside of, the social network.
- An example of a technique for inviting participation in an online social group may include the following operations: receiving a first search query from a user; determining a topic associated with the first search query; sending a second search query to the user, where the second search query is associated with the topic and is different from the first search query; receiving a selection of the second search query from the user; and, when the second search query has been received from other users more than a specified number of times within a time window, sending an invitation to the user, where the invitation is for suggesting participation in an online social group that includes others who have sent the second query to the server system within the time window.
- the invitation can be for inviting participation in an online social group including other users (e.g., members of a social network) who have sent the second query to the server system within the time window.
- the online social group can include a participatory experience in which a user who sent the second search query may interact with the others (e.g., a forum or a chat room).
- determining the topic can include performing a search of a search index using the first search query to identify the topic.
- the foregoing technique can also include associating the topic to the second search query, where the second search query relates to the topic but is different from the first search query.
- the first search query can include a first search term relating to the topic and the second search query can include a second search term relating to the topic, where the second search term is different from the first search term; and a beginning of the time window can be set in response to a first receipt of the second search query, where the time window extends for a predefined duration following the beginning.
- a first receipt of the second search query can occur following expiration of a previous time window
- the foregoing technique can further include sending the second query to other users in response to third search queries received from the other users and prior to receiving the second query from the other users. At least one of the third search queries may be different from the first search query.
- the technique can also include storing a time that the second query is received from each of the other users; and comparing the time that the second query was received from the user to times that the second query is received from each of the other users in order to determine if the search query was received from the user within the time window.
- Another example of a technique for suggesting participation in an online social group may include the following operations: receiving a first search query from a user; determining a topic associated with the first search query; associating a second query associated with the topic; and establishing an online social group for which participation is suggested in response to receipt of the second query.
- the second query can be different from, or identical to, the first query.
- determining the topic can include performing a search of a search index using the first search query to identify the topic, and the foregoing technique can further include correlating the topic to the second search query, where the second search query relates to the topic but is different from the first search query.
- the second query can be associated with the topic based on historical data for queries about the topic.
- Advantages of the foregoing techniques may include guiding users toward social interaction with one another by providing appropriate query suggestions and invitations to online social groups.
- the systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices.
- the systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.

- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example method for suggesting participation in an online social group.
- FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate an example Web page that can be displayed on a client device associated with a user.
- the techniques includes receiving a first search query from a user; determining a topic associated with the first search query; and, in response, sending a second search query to the user.
- the second search query is associated with the topic but may be different from the first search query.
- the techniques may be used to suggest to a user that the user provide a search query about a topic that is the same as other search queries provided by other searchers about the topic.
- the first search query may be “Red Sox Nation”.
- the system may use analytical techniques to determine that the subject of the first query is the “Boston Red Sox”.
- the system may then send a proposed query, e.g., “Boston Red Sox” back to a computing device associated with the user.
- This proposed query may then be entered, at the computing device (e.g., as part of a search request).
- the second search query is received at the computing device, and may be sent back to a server.
- the server may perform a search based on the second search query, and may also determine whether to connect the user to an online social group based on the second search query or to start a new online social group based on the second search query. For example, in a case that the second search query has been received from different computing devices more than a specified number of times within a time window, the system may send an invitation to the user's computing device. The invitation may invite the user to participate in an online social group that includes others who have sent the second query to the server system within the time window.
- the system may start an online social group of searchers who are interested in the Boston Red Sox. If there is an existing group, the system may connect the user to the existing group. Searchers who submitted the second query within the past hour may be invited to join the online social group.
- the online social group may be, e.g., a chat room, an online forum, or other appropriate social tool.

- second search query 232 can be similar or identical to queries that are currently being received (or have recently been received) from other users (as described below). Accordingly, users receiving and accepting suggested queries can be led to initiate similar searches (e.g., searches with the same search query relating to the same topic) as other users. Users initiating an identical search may be considered by server system 112 as likely to interact with one another.
- Server system 212 can receive second search query 232 from computing device 202 .
- second search query 232 may be submitted to server system 212 as part of a search request initiated by user 222 .

- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 314 .
- Traffic engine 317 can analyze traffic related to submitted search queries, Web page accesses, downloads of images, video, audio, or other content, and so forth.
- the processes performed by traffic engine 317 can include analyzing query log 316 to identify the traffic volume of a query (and/or the historical volume of the query over a specific period of time) and determining, for a particular query, a forecasted volume based on the historical volume.
- the analysis can further include identifying queries that currently have a traffic volume spike above their forecasted volumes (e.g., largest positive difference between the actual traffic volume and the forecasted traffic volume). Queries that have volume spikes within a pertinent time interval can be indicative of events of interest, and can relate to other queries that have occurred during a specified time interval.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method for identifying online social groups.
- Process 400 may be performed by a system of one or more computers in one or more locations, appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, e.g., by server system 212 .
- Process 400 receives a search query ( 402 ).
- a user can submit a search query (e.g., text, images, audio, video, or other content) to a server system 212 through a network (e.g., network 200 ).
- the search query can be informational (covering a broad topic, e.g., “Texas” or “football”), navigational (seeking a particular Web site or page, e.g., “National Airlines”), and/or transactional (reflecting the intent of the user to perform a particular action, e.g., “dinner reservations”).
- the user can enter the search query, e.g., using input components of a computing device, in a search field of a Web page displayed on the user's computing device.
- the user can provide an instruction to implement a search based on the query, for example by selecting a search option on the Web page.
- the computing device outputs the search query to a search engine.
- the search engine described herein is part of, or capable of searching, a social networking service. However, search engines outside the context of a social networking service may be used.
- the search query is received along with a request for query suggestions (e.g., user interaction suggestions, as discussed in detail below).
- Process 400 identifies a query topic ( 404 ).
- server system can perform a search on an index using the received search query to identify a query topic. For instance, consider the informational search query “Yankees.” Matches in the search index may include content associated with the following topical tags: “sports”, “business”, and “New York”. As such, these topics can be considered topic candidates for the search query “Yankees.” Further consider that one-hundred of the matches are tagged with “sports”, two-hundred with “business” and three-hundred with “New York.” “New York” may be considered the most relevant topic because it is the most popular topical tag of the matches.
- the server system can identify common keywords (or images, audio or video, where appropriate) associated with matches in the index to the search query (e.g., content that is associated with at least a majority of the matches in the index can be identified as topics by the server system).
- the server system can also identify trending queries as query topics. For example, the server system can receive a unique search query from a user and identify a similar currently trending query as a topic associated with the unique search query.
- the server system can also access a query log to identify query topics.
- Process 400 generates a suggested query for the topic ( 406 ).
- the suggested query can be associated with the topic based on historical data for queries about the topic.
- the suggested query can be associated with the determined topic and be different from the originally received search query.
- Possible query suggestions can be identified by accessing a query log to determine queries that are currently trending.
- the server system can identify currently trending queries that are associated with the determined topic.
- the server system can identify and rank a number of possible query suggestions according to an order from a rank of most relevant to a rank of least relevant.
- Various ranking algorithms and criteria can be used to rank the possible query suggestions. For example, possible query suggestions can be ranked based on relevance to the determined topic or based on traffic volume.
- Process 400 associates an online social group with the suggested query ( 408 ).
- the server system can identify currently existing online social groups that are about, or are producing content related to, the suggested query (e.g., chat rooms or forums discussing the determined topic or mentioning the suggested query).
- the server system can also establish or create new online social groups based on the suggested query. For example, the server system can invite users who are likely to be interested in the determined topic or the suggested query to participate in a newly established online social group.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example method for suggesting participation in an online social group.
- Process 500 may be performed by a system of one or more computers in one or more locations, appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, e.g., by server system 212 .
- Process 500 receives a search query ( 502 ), e.g., from a user operated computing device, and identifies a topic associated with the received search query ( 504 ).
- the topic may be identified, e.g., in accordance with the process of FIG. 4 .
- Process 500 determines a suggested query based on the identified topic and outputs the suggested query ( 506 ) to the computing device.
- Process 500 receives the suggested query ( 508 ). For example, a user operating the computing device can confirm or accept the suggested query and initiate a search by submitting the suggested query to the server system with a search request.
- Process 500 determines the number of times the suggested query has been received within a specified time window ( 510 ). For example, the process can determine how many search requests including the suggested query have been received within the time window by accessing a query log.
- the server system can receive queries from a number of distinct computing devices.
- the server system can generate and store a time stamp associated with each receipt of the suggested query from each of the computing devices. Accordingly, the server system can compare the time that the second query was received from the user operated computing device to the time that the second query was received from the other computing devices in order to determine if the search query was received from the computing device within the time window.
- the beginning of the time window can be set by the server system in response to a first receipt of the second search query, and can extend for a predetermined duration (e.g., one minute, five, minutes, thirty minutes, and/or one hour) following the established beginning.
- process 500 can wait ( 512 ) to receive additional suggested query confirmations. If the number of second query receipts within the time window is greater than the threshold, process 500 can output invitations to join an online social group associated with the determined topic ( 514 ).
- Process 500 can determine if an invitation to join the online social group has been accepted ( 516 ). If the invitation has been accepted, process 500 can connect the user to the online social group ( 518 ). For example, the server system can connect the user to a video chat room by granting a computing device associated with the user access to a particular server hosting the video chat room. The server system can also provide, to the user associated computer device, a web address for the video chat room server. Other conventional methods for connecting users to online social groups (e.g. a chat room, an online forum, or other appropriate social tool) can also be used. If the invitation is not accepted, process 500 can take no action ( 520 ).
- process 500 can take no action ( 520 ).

- content stream 604 includes social media posts that have been retrieved and rendered based on the query entered in query input field 602 .
- the content stream may be updated, either automatically or in response to user input, e.g., a refresh or a search.
- a query e.g., a single word, a portion of a word, a string or words, an image, video, audio, etc.
- server system 212 can identify a topic associated with the query and a number of query suggestions (for example, by implementing process 400 ).
- the user associated client device can receive query suggestions 606 from server system 212 , and present the query suggestions in a suggestion box 608 according to a ranking order from a highest ranking to a lowest ranking.
- server system 212 can provide an invitation 612 to an online social group (see FIG. 6B ).
- the online social group can be associated with a topic related to the query suggestion confirmed by the user.
