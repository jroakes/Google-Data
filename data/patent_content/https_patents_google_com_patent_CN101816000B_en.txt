Embodiment
Fig. 1 illustrates the system 100 of the practice that is suitable for embodiments of the invention.The U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.10/987 of unsettled jointly, the common transfer of " Method and System for Autocompletion Using RankedResults (being used to use the method and system of the automatic completion of ranking result) " that is to submit on November 11st, 2004; 295; And the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.10/987 of unsettled jointly, the common transfer of " Method and System for Autocompletion for LanguagesHaving Ideographs and Phonetic Characters (being used to have the method and system of automatic completion of the language of pictograph and phonetic characters) " of submitting on November 12nd, 2004; The extra details relevant with its various functional modules with distributed system are provided in 769, by reference the content whole of said application have been merged at this.System 100 can comprise one or more FTP client FTPs or the equipment 102 that is positioned at away from the position of search engine 108.Sometimes each FTP client FTP 102 that is called as client or client device can be desk-top computer, laptop computer, information station, cell phone, personal digital assistant etc.Communication network 106 is connected to search engine 108 with FTP client FTP or equipment 102.As user's (also being called as search requestor) during, before this user accomplishes the input complete query, search for assistant 104 part at least of this user's partial query is sent to search engine 108 at FTP client FTP 102 place input inquiries at this.Search engine 108 uses the translator unit of partial query to come the final complete query of predictive user.These predictions are transferred back to this user.If one in the prediction is this user's expection inquiry, then this user can select the inquiry of prediction under the situation of the input that needn't accomplish inquiry.
Like what further describe at this, search system 100 is adjusted with its functional module, so that handle multilingual partial query with uniform way.Search system 100 is adjusted, so that under the situation of speech encoding of the partial query of not considering to be sent to by search assistant 104 search engine 108, the actual input that is based on the user at FTP client FTP 102 places provides the inquiry of prediction.For example use that this is particularly useful under the incorrect Input Method Editor setting at FTP client FTP 102 places has been imported the situation of partial query the user.
Referring to Fig. 2, two inquiry logs have been showed to illustrative: the inquiry log 201 of first language and the inquiry log 202 of second language.Inquiry log 201,202 comprises the daily record of inquiry of the previous submission of the language separately that in a period of time, is received from the user group by search engine.Alternatively, the user group of the inquiry of submission in inquiry log 201 can be different with the user group who submits the inquiry in inquiry log 202 to, and aforementioned in this case " user group " comprises two or more user groups.Each query entries in inquiry log 201,202 can comprise metamessage, inquires about the frequency information of the number of times of being submitted to such as indication.In the inquiry log 201,202 each can be filtered by one or more language-specific filtrators 204,205; The inquiry that for example is complementary with one or more predetermined sets of getting rid of with word, said predetermined set such as possibly be considered to offensive, culture sensitive etc. word.Inquiry in the inquiry log 202 of second language is utilized with its extant form.Yet the query conversion in 250 places will the inquiry log 201 at first language is the representation of second language.The character of the second language that the representation of second language generates with when use is set to the input method of second language, being attempted to import the inquiry of first language by the user is corresponding.For example, as be further described below, the inquiry of a kind of language such as Korean can be represented by the thump on alphanumeric keyboard, and said thump is with to use the Input Method Editor that is set to English improperly to import the Korean inquiry corresponding.Yet in other embodiments, first language needs not to be Korean, and alternatively can be Japanese, any language in Chinese or a large amount of other Languages.Similarly, second language needs not to be English, and alternatively can be French, any language in German, Spanish, Russian or a large amount of other Languages.The inquiry log 202 that filters is combined and is utilized simultaneously by ordered set structure device 208 with the output of the conversion of the inquiry log 201 that filters.Ordered set makes up device 208 and creates one or more data splitting structures, and the data splitting structure can be used to handle macaronic partial query.
Ordered set makes up the one or more inquiries of device 208 structures and accomplishes table 212.As further specify below, one or more inquiry completion tables 212 are used to generate and are used for both predictions of first and second language.Accomplish each clauses and subclauses storing queries character string and extraneous information in the table 212 in inquiry.Extraneous information comprises rank score value, the date value and/or the other factors when inquiry is submitted to by the user among the user group of the frequency that can be based on the inquiry in the inquiry log.The value that comprises the language of indicating complete search inquiry about the extraneous information of inquiry alternatively.The complete query of the prediction that each clauses and subclauses in each inquiry completion table 212 are represented to be associated with partial query.As described with reference to figure 9 below, in certain embodiments, received partial query is divided into two parts: prefix part and suffix portion.In addition, in certain embodiments, the complete query of the one group of prediction that is associated with same prefix is stored in the inquiry completion table 212 by frequency or score value ordering.Alternatively; Inquiry completion table 212 carries out index by the query fingerprints of the part search inquiry of correspondence, and wherein the query fingerprints of each part search inquiry generates through the prefix that hash function (or other fingerprint function) is applied to part search inquiry or part search inquiry.Alternatively, query fingerprints be stored in fingerprint to the table mapping table 210 in be used for searching fast.
In certain embodiments, the complete query of the prediction of first language (for example Korean, Japanese, the Chinese etc.) representation (for example romanization representation) with the conversion of the character that uses second language (for example English, Spanish, French, German, Russian etc.) is stored in one or more inquiry completion tables 212.Therefore; In these embodiment, ordered set makes up device 208 and is stored in one or more inquiry completion tables 212 with the set of complete second language (for example English) inquiry with the set of complete first language (for example Korean) inquiry of the representation of its conversion.Yet, will represent and show to the user with the language of the original query in inquiry log 201 in the complete query of the prediction in the inquiry completion table 212.Yet; In other embodiments; Although the inquiry of first language is stored in the inquiry completion table of discerning through the representation of the conversion that hash function (or other fingerprint function) is applied to corresponding part search inquiry, the complete query of prediction is stored in one or more inquiry completion tables 212 with its source language.
Referring to Fig. 3 A, when user's inputted search is inquired about, the input (308) of FTP client FTP 102 monitoring users.Before user's (being called as the requestor sometimes) signal to accomplish search inquiry, the part at least of user's inquiry is sent to search engine 304 (310) from FTP client FTP.The part of inquiry can be several characters, search terms or more than a search terms.Notice, can be with first language or the inquiry of second language importation.
Search engine 304 receiving unit search inquiries are used for handling (312) and advance to the complete query about user's expection is predicted (313).At first, search engine 304 confirms that partial query is with first language or with second language coding (314).If partial query is encoded with first language, then search engine 304 converts partial query into before advance the above-mentioned representation (316) of second language.If partial query is encoded with second language, then search engine 304 can directly advance to the processing section inquiry.Search engine 304 is used hash function (or other fingerprint function) (318) then and is created fingerprint 320.Search engine 304 uses fingerprint 320 to locate with the corresponding inquiry completion of partial query table 212 to the mapping table 210 of table with fingerprint and carries out search operation (322).Search operation comprises the fingerprint that fingerprint is complementary to the fingerprint 320 of mapping table 210 search of table and partial query.When finding when coupling, fingerprint is accomplished table (or as an alternative, in the set that has about the clauses and subclauses in the inquiry completion table of the clauses and subclauses of a plurality of partial queries) to the entry identification inquiry of the mapping table 210 of table.As be described in greater detail below, inquiry completion table 212 can comprise with partial query and to be complementary or corresponding a plurality of clauses and subclauses, and fingerprint is used to locating query completion table or these clauses and subclauses first (or last) to the mapping table of showing 210.The set of the complete query of the corresponding prediction of part search inquiry that search operation (322) produces and received.
Each clauses and subclauses in inquiry completion table comprise the complete query of prediction and such as about the frequency of the complete query of prediction or the out of Memory of score value.Search engine 304 use information are constructed the ordered set (326) of complete query prediction.In certain embodiments, will gather by frequency or score value ordering.Search engine 304 returns at least one subclass (328) of the complete query of predicting the client of the complete query (329) of the prediction that receives ordering then.Client advances at least one subclass (330) of the complete query of the prediction that shows ordering.
Notice and since partial query can with the potential coupling of query entries of accomplishing the arbitrary language in the table 212 in inquiry, so the ordered set that complete query is predicted can be with arbitrary language.Search engine 304 can be configured to return the complete query of hybrid language prediction or can be configured to select the more the sort of language of possibility predicted portions inquiry.Under the situation of search engine 304 generations with the complete query of the prediction of the linguistic form except that the language of in partial query, encoding, the complete query of prediction is represented automatic input method correction suggestion.
As noted with reference to figure 2 in the above, when making up inquiry and accomplish table, can filter inquiry from user group's historical query daily record.Yet on behalf of various users, extra filtration can perhaps organize and be employed by various user's groups (for example, having asked the user of such filtration) request.Therefore; In certain embodiments; Perhaps the complete query of prediction is being sent to client (328) before before in the complete query of predicting is sorted (326); The inquiry that is complementary with one or more words in one or more predetermined set of words to remove is filtered in the set of complete query of prediction, if there is such inquiry.For example, one or more predetermined set of words can comprise be considered to offensive or culture sensitive etc. english vocabulary and Korean word.The system that carries out this method can comprise one or more tables (or other data structure) of the one or more predetermined set of words of identification that are stored in the storer.In some other embodiment; The client place that is integrated into of sending to the complete query of the prediction of client (328) is filtered the inquiry that is complementary with one or more words in one or more predetermined set of words to remove, if there is such inquiry.Alternatively, a plurality of different filtrators can be used to a plurality of different users groups.In certain embodiments, filtering (carrying out in response to the part search inquiry) during the utilization and operation substitutes during the structure of inquiry completion table and filters.
Fig. 3 B illustrates the embodiment that can in the search assistant 104 of FTP client FTP 102, realize.Search assistant 104 monitoring users are input to search inquiry in the text input frame on the FTP client FTP 102 (352).User's input can be one or more characters or one or more words (the for example character or the sign of the new word of the phrase of first word of phrase or preceding two words or first word and beginning letter, compound word).Search assistant 104 can discern two kinds of dissimilar inquiries.First kind, when accomplishing input of character string prior to indicating the user, search assistant 104 receives when input is identified or identification division search inquiry (being described below).Second kind, search assistant 104 receives when the user has selected the prediction of showing or indicated the completion input of character string or identification user input.
When user input or when selecting to be identified as complete user and importing, this complete user input is sent to server and is used for handling (354).Server returns the set of Search Results, and this set receives (356) by search assistant 104 or by the client application such as browser application.In certain embodiments, browser application shows Search Results at least as the part of webpage.In some other embodiment, search assistant 104 display of search results.As an alternative, the transmission (354) of complete user input and can carry out by the mechanism except that search assistant 104 to the reception (356) of Search Results.For example, these operations can be carried out by the browser application of using standard request and response protocol.
In many ways; Such as when imported carriage return or character of equal value during the input of user at search inquiry, when having selected at " searching " or " search " button in the graphic user interface (GUI) that the user shows; Perhaps through at one that selects during the input of search inquiry in the set of the inquiry of the prediction that the user shows, search assistant 104 (or browser or other use) can be identified as complete user's input with user's input.Those skilled in the art will be familiar with the multiple mode of the final input of signalling search inquiry.
Before user's input that the user signals complete, the part search inquiry can be identified.For example, the part search inquiry is discerned the input or the deletion of the character in the text input frame through detecting.In case the part search inquiry is identified, this part search inquiry promptly is transmitted to server (358).In response to this part search inquiry, server returns the prediction of the complete search inquiry that comprises prediction.Search assistant 104 receives (360) and shows prediction (362) such as (for example show, expression).
After the complete query (362) of having showed prediction to the user, if confirming in the prediction one, the user is complementary, then in the user's complete search inquiry that can select to predict with the expection input.In some cases, prediction can provide the extraneous information that is not considered to the user.For example, the user can be at heart with the part of an inquiry as search strategy, but see that the complete query of prediction impels the user to change input policing.In case showed set (362), once more the input of monitoring user (352).If the user has selected in the prediction, then send user's input to server (354) as complete query (also being called as complete user's input) at this.After the request of transmitting, the input activity (352) of monitoring user once more.
In certain embodiments, search assistant 104 can be from extra the predicting the outcome of server preload (each extra the predicting the outcome is the set of the complete query of prediction) (364).Predicting the outcome of preload can be used to improve the speed that user's input is responded.For example, when user input <ban >, search assistant 104 can preload except that about the predicting the outcome of <ban>about <bana>..., and the predicting the outcome of <bank >.If the user imports a character again, for example < k>generates (part search inquiry) input <bank >, then can the part search inquiry be not sent to server or receive demonstration predicting the outcome about <bank>under the situation about predicting.
In certain embodiments, one or more set that buffer memory predicts the outcome on ground, client place.When search requestor is revised current inquiry with the part before reflecting input (for example through backspace to remove some characters); Substitute the part input sent to server, from the client-cache retrieval with before the set that predicts the outcome that is associated of part input and show this set to the user once more.
In certain embodiments; Behind the Search Results or document (356) that receive about final input; Perhaps behind the complete search inquiry (362) that shows prediction; And alternatively preload predict the outcome (364), search assistant 104 continues monitoring users inputs (352) and for example comprises the webpage of searching for assistant 104 and stop searching for assistant 104 through closing until the user.In some other embodiment, search assistant 104 only continues monitoring user input (352) at text input frame 1320 (below with reference to Figure 13 discussed) when being activated, and suspends during by inactivation at text input frame 1320 and to keep watch on.In certain embodiments; When the text input frame in user interface shows in the current active window of browser application or toolbar; Text input frame is activated; And be not shown or text input frame not in the active window of browser application or toolbar the time when the text input frame, text input frame is by inactivation.
Described system and technology have about solving with the application-specific such as the partial query of the linguistic form of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and many other Languages.Or the written Korean utilization that is called as the proverb literary composition is organized into the phonetic alphabet of the character of syllable piece.Each syllable piece is made up of a stem consonant, a middle part vowel and optional afterbody consonant.There are 19 kinds of possible stem consonants, 21 kinds of possible vowels and 27 kinds of possible afterbody consonants.Be illustrated in figures 4A and 4 B the tabulation of possible stem, middle part and the afterbody element of syllable piece.Can encode to the Korean text in a different manner; But its routine is represented with the Unicode transformat; This Unicode transformat uses different character codes to represent each syllable piece combination: i.e. 11,172 predetermined korean character from AC00 to D7AF.Conventional use west alphanumeric keyboard arranges and imports the Korean text that wherein Korean consonant and vowel are mapped to the letter key on the keyboard.Since the stem consonant need thump, middle part vowel and an afterbody consonant each to need once or twice thump and afterbody consonant be optional, so single Korean syllable piece character need be at the thump between twice on the keyboard to five times.
Therefore, the user imports the Korean inquiry and possibly import incomplete korean character midway when partial query is sent to search engine 304.In addition, the user possibly just use incorrect input method setting to attempt to import Korean or english language query.
Described system provides with technology and has been used for following unified solution: through part Korean query conversion is provided the complete query of the prediction of Korean and English for the romanization representation.The romanization representation of these Korean inquiry is with to use English inputting method to attempt to import through the user Korean to inquire about the character in the romanization alphabet that generates corresponding.For example, the Korean inquiry log can comprise such as following Korean word:
The romanization representation of these Korean inquiries will be following:
In other words, the user is being set to key in the word " mobile " that " ahqkdlf " will import Korean on the keyboard of korean input method.
Fig. 4 A, 4B and 5 illustrate korean character string in inquiry to the conversion of romanization representation.In order to realize this conversion, be each consonant or the vowel computation index of the component that forms each syllable piece character.For the korean character of representing with Unicode, said character is arranged to:
Unicode=(stem consonant * 21*28)+(middle part vowel * 28)+optional afterbody+0xAC00
This calculating can and be cut apart by several adjustings and accomplishes.In case for each korean character has been confirmed index, can buffer memory and consonant and the corresponding English letter of vowel index.Fig. 4 A and 4B show the romanization character how different Korean consonants and vowel can be mapped to the correspondence of given Unicode coding.Fig. 5 illustrates conversion and can how to be processed.Referring to Fig. 5, the character late (502) of retrieval in character string (for example, complete or part search inquiry).Initially, initial " character late " of the character representation of first in character string.Confirm whether character is coded in the scope interior (504) of the syllable piece representation of korean character.If (504-is) then derived stem and middle part and tail value (506) from this character as stated.According to Fig. 4 A and 4B said value is mapped to romanization character (508) then.Then the romanization character is appended to character string (509) as a result.On the other hand; If this character is not as syllable piece character (504-is not) but encodes as single consonant or vowel (510-is); Then consonant or vowel (being encoded as character code) are directly converted into romanization representation (512) according to the mapping of in Fig. 4 A and 4B, illustrating once more, and are affixed to the end of character string (514) as a result then.If this character is not with Korean coding (510-is), because this character of hypothesis then can directly append to character string (516) as a result with this character with the romanization representation.Process iteration (518) is until the end that arrives character string.
As stated, Korean inquiry is converted into the romanization representation and according to the romanization representation of Korean inquiry it is organized in the data structure at pretreatment stage.Through being the romanization representation with the Korean query conversion, the complete query of Korean and English prediction all can be stored in the uniform data structure that is used for predictive server together.Because english language query and Korean inquiry all use the romanization alphabet to represent, so identical prediction logic can be utilized to generate English prediction and Korean prediction.
When the user was input to the partial query of Korean in the system, the Korean partial query was converted into its romanization representation.As any English partial query, contrast is verified this romanization representation about the data structure of partial query then.Because korean character is by the romanization letter representation with order identical with original thump on keyboard, the inquiry of incomplete Korean is by processing correctly.Generate the tabulation of prediction (being complete query) based on this partial query.Obviously, the complete query of prediction can be with Korean or English.Therefore, in some cases, comprise Korean and English complete query with the complete query of the corresponding prediction of partial query.Use korean input method to come to import improperly under the situation of English partial query the user, system will think that the romanization representation is english language query potentially.For example, the user possibly import following inquiry or following partial query:
Because this inquiry does not form any correct syllable piece, so this inquiry can not generate any Korean prediction.Yet, be " mobile " about the romanization representation of this inquiry, it will be complementary with the complete query of the prediction that comprises English word " mobile ", although it is incorrect to be used for the speech encoding of partial query.
When the user is input to the partial query of English in the system, system will handle this partial query routinely.The contrasting data structure is verified the tabulation of this english language query and generation forecast.In addition, because data structure comprises the Korean inquiry with the romanization representation, so system will discern the Korean prediction that is produced by the input method mistake automatically.
Fig. 6 shows the example with the set 604 of the complete query of partial query " ho " 602 corresponding predictions.In this example, the primary importance in the set 604 of complete query comprises the inquiry (for example " hotmail ") with highest frequency value, and the second place in this set is occupied by the inquiry with next highest frequency value (for example " hot dogs "), or the like.In this example, given partial query and the correspondence between the complete query by partial query confirm in the existence of the beginning part of complete query (for example, character " ho " complete query "
HoTmail " and "
HoTels in San Francisco " the beginning part find).In other embodiments; Confirm in the existence of the beginning part of the search terms of any position that is arranged in complete query by partial query at given partial query and the correspondence between the complete query; Such as by the set 606 of complete query diagram (for example, character " ho " "
HoTmail " the beginning part and at " cheap
HoTels in Cape Town " in the beginning part of second search terms find).
In order to create the set of inquiry completion table 212, select inquiry (Fig. 7,702) from historical query daily record 201,202.In certain embodiments, the inquiry (for example, language is the inquiry of English) that only has a metamessage of expectation is processed.From selected inquiry identification first partial query (704).In one embodiment, first partial query first character (that is for inquiry string " hot dog ingredients ", being " h ") that is selected inquiry.In certain embodiments, before the identification division inquiry, use pre-service (for example, with the capitalization lower).In table, generate the indicating section inquiry, with the clauses and subclauses of the corresponding complete query of partial query and its frequency.In other embodiments, the out of Memory (the rank score value that date value when for example, being submitted to by the user group based on complete query and/or other factors calculate) that is used to rank is stored.If the partial query of being discerned is not represented whole inquiry, then (708-is not) do not accomplished in query processing.Therefore, discern next partial query (710).In certain embodiments, next partial query is discerned (that is for inquiry string " hot dog ingredients ", being " ho ") through the partial query that the character that the next one is extra adds previous identification to.Continue identification (710) and the process of inquiring about the renewal (706) of accomplishing table is processed (708-is) until whole inquiry.All inquiries if still be untreated (712-is not) are then handled until all inquiries from the historical query daily record next inquiry of selection (702) and to this inquiry and are processed (712-is).In certain embodiments, when adding the record item to inquiry completion table, the record item is inserted into the record item that makes in table and is sorted according to rank or score value.In another embodiment, all inquiry completion tables are made by sorting that at the end of table building process the record item in each inquiry completion table is sorted according to rank or the score value of inquiring about the record item in the completion table.In addition, one or more inquiry completion tables can be deleted letter, make table comprise the clauses and subclauses that are no more than predetermined quantity.
As stated; In certain embodiments; Filter the inquiry that complete query (714) are complementary with one or more predetermined sets of getting rid of with word from historical query daily record 201,202 before accomplishing in the table complete query being inserted inquiry, said predetermined set such as possibly be considered to offensive, culture sensitive etc. word.Alternatively, the user group of the inquiry of submission in inquiry log 201 can be different with the user group who submits the inquiry in inquiry log 202 to, and aforementioned in this case " user group " comprises two or more user groups.Therefore, then select next inquiry (if existence) (702) from historical query daily record 201,202 if inquiry is filtered and be removed from the set for the candidate's that is used for being inserted into inquiry completion table inquiry.
Referring to Fig. 8,804 to 812 places in table 802 illustrate the example process of the first five character of inquiry string " hot dogingredients ".Illustrate the example process of preceding four characters of inquiry string " hotmail " at 814 to 820 places.
In certain embodiments, create through following about the inquiry completion table of given partial query: make inquiry be positioned at the top of tabulation with the individual inquiry of the most often being submitted to of the given corresponding n of partial query and with it with the placement of rank order with the highest rank (for example the highest rank score value or frequency) from table identification.For example, about the inquiry completion table of partial query " hot " will comprise complete query character string 808 and 818 both.In rank during based on frequency; Because the frequency of inquiry string in 818 (promptly 300; 000) greater than the frequency of the inquiry string in 808 (promptly 100; 000), so will appear at top for the inquiry string of " hot dog ingredients " for the inquiry string of " hotmail ".Therefore, when the set of the ordering that will predict returns to the user, at first show inquiry with selecteed more high likelihood.As stated, other value can be used to the complete query of prediction is carried out rank.In certain embodiments, the customized information from user's profile can be used to the complete query of prediction is carried out rank.
Referring to Fig. 9 and 10, in certain embodiments, through the historical query character string being divided into the quantity that reduces inquiry completion table 212 such as " chunk (chunk) " of the predetermined big or small C of four (4) individual characters.Accomplishing table 212 about length less than the inquiry of the partial query of C keeps constant.For length is the partial query of C at least, partial query is divided into two parts: prefix part and suffix portion.The length (L) that the length S of suffix portion equals partial query is with the C delivery:
S＝L?modulo?C。
Wherein L is the length of partial query.The length P of prefix part is the length that the length of partial query deducts suffix: P=L-S.Therefore, for example, the partial query (for example " hot potato ") with length of ten (10) individual characters will have suffix length S=2 and prefix length P=8 when chunk sizes C is four (4).
When carrying out, in Fig. 9, illustrate the corresponding inquiry completion of identification or establishment and partial query table conceptually in the process shown in the step 706 of Fig. 7.Fig. 9 schematically illustrates the process that is used for generated query completion table and is used for when the partial query of process user input, searching both.In the length of partial query during less than " chunk " C big or small, for example through using hash function (or other fingerprint function) 318 that partial query is mapped to query fingerprints 320 (Fig. 3 A).To the mapping table of showing 210 fingerprint 320 is mapped to inquiry completion table 212 through fingerprint.
When the length of partial query is at least one chunk C big or small, partial query 902 is resolved into prefix 904 and suffix 906, its length is as explained above by the chunk sizes regulation.For example come for prefix 904 generates fingerprint 908, and to the mapping table of showing 210 this fingerprint 908 is mapped to " chunkization " inquiry completion table 212 through fingerprint then through hash function 318 being applied to prefix 904.In certain embodiments, the inquiry completion table 212 of each chunkization is the set of the clauses and subclauses in bigger inquiry completion table, and in other embodiments, the inquiry completion table of each chunkization is discrete data structure.Each clauses and subclauses 911 of each inquiry completion table are included as the inquiry string of the text of complete query, and can comprise alternatively and be used for score value 916 that the clauses and subclauses at inquiry completion table 212 are sorted.Each clauses and subclauses of the inquiry completion table of chunkization comprise the suffix 914 of corresponding partial query.It can be the length S of any value from zero to C-1 that suffix 914 in each clauses and subclauses 911 has, and comprises the zero or a plurality of characters in the prefix 904 that are not included in of partial query.In certain embodiments, when generation is used for the inquiry completion table clause 911 of historical query, in the inquiry completion table 212 of each chunkization, only generate one and the corresponding clauses and subclauses of this historical query.Especially, these clauses and subclauses 911 comprises the longest possible suffix about this historical query, and is long until C-1 character.In other embodiments, the inquiry of each chunkization accomplish generate in the table 212 about the particular historical inquiry until C clauses and subclauses, each clauses and subclauses is used for each different suffix.
Alternatively, each clauses and subclauses in each inquiry completion table 212 comprise the language value or the designator 912 of the language that indication is associated with complete query 913.Yet, be stored in its source language among the embodiment in the inquiry completion table 212 at all inquiry strings 913 and can omit language value 912.
Alternatively, each clauses and subclauses in each inquiry completion table 212 comprise and are used for the query fingerprints 918 that the fingerprint with table clause and partial query prefix matees.Yet, in some embodiment (for example, having embodiment), can accomplish the clauses and subclauses omission fingerprint 918 of table 212 from inquiry about the independent inquiry completion table 212 of each different portions inquiry prefix.
Figure 10 shows a group polling that comprises with the corresponding clauses and subclauses 911 of historical query " hot potato " and accomplishes table.This example hypothesis chunk sizes C equals four.In other embodiments, chunk sizes can be 2,3,5,6,7,8 or any other suitable value.Chunk sizes C can select based on posterior infromation.Accomplish table 212-1 to 212-3 respectively about partial query " h ", " ho " and " hot " in first three inquiry shown in Figure 10.(with " hot " is its prefix part with the partial query " hot pot " with partial query length of 7 and 10 respectively for following two inquiries completion table 212-4 and 212-5; And " pot " is its suffix portion) and " hot potato " (with " hot pota " is its prefix part, and " to " is its suffix portion) corresponding.Narration in another way, inquiry are accomplished table 212-4 and are begun with " hot " and to have all partial queries of the length between 4 and 7 corresponding; And inquiry is accomplished table 212-5 and is begun with " hotpota " and to have all partial queries of the length between 8 and 11 corresponding.
Return referring to Fig. 7; For by operation 710 round-robin that partly form iteration each time, the length of partial query has increased the step-length of a character at first, until the length that reaches C-1; And the length of partial query has increased the step-length of C character then, until the total length that reaches historical query.The result; When C=4, historical query " hot potato " be created in respectively with have 1,2,3, inquiry in corresponding five the such tables (212-1 to 212-5) of part search inquiry of the length of 4-7 and 8-10 character accomplishes table clause (shown in Figure 10).
Sort according to the clauses and subclauses 911 of the rank value of the inquiry string in clauses and subclauses 911 913 (by score value 916 expressions) to the inquiry completion table of each chunkization.For the partial query that has less than C character, the quantity of the inquiry in inquiry completion table 212 is first value (for example, 10,20 or any suitable value between 4 and 20), the quantity of the inquiry that it can represent to return as prediction.In certain embodiments, the maximum quantity (the for example quantity between 1000 and 10,000) of the clauses and subclauses 911 in the inquiry completion table 910 of each chunkization is significantly greater than first value.The inquiry completion table 212 of each chunkization can substitute tens of or hundreds of common inquiry completion tables.Therefore; The size of the inquiry completion table 212 of each chunkization is set up; Accomplish all of the corresponding prefix part of epiphase or nearly all individual clauses and subclauses of the historical query of checking and approving corresponding many (P) so that comprise with having, and can not reach the length that produces that kind of excessive time delay in generation during about the tabulation of the complete query of the prediction of the partial query of user's appointment with the inquiry of chunkization.
Generated inquiry completion table 212 and fingerprint after the mapping table 210 of table in the set from historical query, these identical data structures (or its copy) are used to discern the set of the prediction of the corresponding inquiry of importing with the user of partial query.As shown in fig. 9; As determined by the length of partial query; At first through hash function (or other fingerprint function) 318 being applied to the prefix part 904 of entire portion inquiry 902 or partial query, the partial query that the user is imported is mapped to query fingerprints 320.Through carrying out in the mapping table 210 of table at fingerprint, query fingerprints 320 is mapped to inquiry completion table 212 then to the searching of query fingerprints.At last, extract set from the inquiry completion table of being discerned until the ordering of N the inquiry of predicting.During less than chunk sizes, the set of the ordering of the inquiry of prediction is the top n inquiry in the inquiry completion table of being discerned in the length of partial query.When the length of partial query equals or is longer than chunk sizes, the top n item that the suffix of search and partial query is complementary in the inquiry completion table of being discerned.Because the clauses and subclauses in inquiry completion table 212 sort with the rank that reduces; So the process of the clauses and subclauses of search matched begins and continues from the top up to the prediction of having obtained desired amt to be returned (N) (for example 10), perhaps up to the end that has arrived inquiry completion table 212.When the counterpart of the suffix 906 of partial query and suffix 914 in clauses and subclauses 911 is identical, there be " coupling ".For example, referring to Figure 10, a letter suffix < p>is complementary with clauses and subclauses 911-3 and 911-4 with suffix < pot>and < pla>respectively.Have the empty suffix (also being called as null character string) of length zero and be complementary, and therefore when the suffix portion of partial query is null character string, the top n item in table is returned as the inquiry of prediction with all clauses and subclauses in inquiry completion table.
