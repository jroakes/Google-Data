Definitions
- the present invention relates to an optical coupling device.
- the present invention relates to an optical mode converter between a first optical waveguide and a second optical waveguide in which the two waveguides have different characteristics from each other.
- Said optical waveguides may be fibers, for example optical fibers of transmission lines, or planar waveguides, or integrated waveguides, for example input/output waveguides of integrated optics devices such as the output waveguide of a semiconductor laser.
- said different characteristics are different dimensions of the waveguides and/or different refractive index steps between the core and the cladding of the waveguides and/or different absolute refractive indexes between the two waveguides.
- An optical beam confined in an optical waveguide propagates with a predetermined mode shape, which depends on the absolute refractive index of said waveguide, on the refractive index step (or refractive index profile) between the core and the cladding of the waveguide and on the dimensions and shape of the waveguide.
- the mode shape, or mode profile defines at least one propagation mode, typically the propagation of the fundamental mode, of the optical beam into the waveguide.
- the modes associated to each waveguide are different in shape and/or in dimensions.
- the coupling is realized by means of a coupling device 4 optically coupled to the first and to the second waveguide.
- the coupling device acts on the mode profile of first waveguide 2 , for example elliptic or circular in cross section, in a way to change its dimension and/or shape in both of two orthogonal directions and make it similar to the mode profile of the second waveguide 3 .
- the waveguide receiving the beam is a planar waveguide
- horizontal and “vertical” stand for any two directions orthogonal to each other and to the beam propagation direction. “Over” and “under”, “top” and “bottom”, “upper” and “lower” shall have a correlative meaning.
- a coupling device between two waveguides with different characteristic is desirable if the coupling loss between the two waveguides without use of a coupling device is more than 0.2 dB.
- GB patent application N o 2,317,023 discloses a tapered rib waveguide tapering from a large, multi-mode optical waveguide to a smaller, single-mode optical waveguide, the tapered rib waveguide comprising two portions formed of the same material.
- GB patent application N o 2,345,980 discloses a mode shape converter having upper and lower optical rib waveguides.
- the core and waveguides are made of a single medium. The tapering effect in the depth direction is obtained even though only a tapering in a width direction is made.
- US patent application 2002/118,916 discloses a mode transformer that enables using an embedded dual taper to achieve low-loss coupling between two waveguides, one of them having a much higher index difference than the other.
- the mode transformer includes a first and a second dielectric channel waveguide, each including a core with a tapered region. A portion of the second tapered region is embedded within the first tapered region, and the embedded portion of the second tapered region is completely surrounded by the first tapered region in the cross-section transverse to the mode transformation direction.
- a waveguide taper structure with a similar thin but wide output, waveguide for coupling to an optical fiber is shown by R. Zengerle et al. in Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B, vol. 11, no. 6, November/December 1993, pp. 2641-2644.
- the simple two layer structure is suitable for very low-loss chip-fiber interconnections.
- Applicant has studied tapered optical mode converters that include an input/output coupling waveguide with a substantially square cross section.
- This type of coupling waveguides has, as a further advantage, a simple alignment with optical fibers.
- thin and wide coupling waveguides of the type shows, e.g., in the two papers by R. Zengerle et al. cited above, have a mode that, although substantially round in shape, shows a sharp peak in the direction orthogonal to the “thin” side of the coupling waveguide. This can make the alignment with the mode of an optical fiber critical.
- Applicant has faced the problem of reducing the length of a tapered structure for a predetermined desired value of coupling efficiency, while ensuring a smooth, i.e. almost adiabatic coupling of the optical mode between the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- a reduced length for a tapered structure of a mode converter can be achieved in a structure comprising two waveguides, at least one of which is tapered, arranged side by side so as to be optically coupled along a coupling region, if the refractive indexes of the cores of the two waveguides are selected so that the effective refractive index of the combined waveguide resulting from the coupling of the two waveguides has a small excursion over the length of the combined waveguide.

- the invention also relates to a method for fabricating an optical tapered waveguide, having the features set forth in the claims that follow.
- a first aspect of present invention relates to an optical mode converter comprises a coupling waveguide and a receiving waveguide.
- the coupling waveguide has at an input end a first effective refractive index n 1eff and includes a tapered core of a substantially constant refractive index n 1 with a substantially square cross section at the input end, having a size that tapers down moving away from the input end.
- the coupling waveguide has also a cladding at least partially surrounding the tapered core.
- the receiving waveguide has a second effective refractive index n 2eff at an output end and comprises a core of a substantially constant refractive index n 2 , greater than the refractive index n 1 of the tapered core of the coupling waveguide, and a cladding at least partially surrounding the core.
- a side surface of the tapered core of the coupling waveguide is optically in contact, in a coupling portion, with the receiving waveguide so as to allow optical coupling between the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- the refractive index n 1 of the tapered core of the coupling waveguide is selected so that the first effective refractive index n 1eff and the second effective refractive index n 2eff differ from each other in absolute value less than 30% of the difference (n 2 ⁇ n eff ) between the core refractive index and the effective refractive index of the receiving waveguide.
- a further aspect of the present invention relates to a method for fabricating an optical tapered waveguide comprising:
- the refractive index n 1 of the wedge is selected so that a first effective refractive index n 1eff of a receiving waveguide having the wedge as a core and a second effective refractive index n 2eff of a waveguide having the receiving core as a core differ from each other in absolute value less than 30% of the difference (n 2 ⁇ n 2eff ) between the refractive index of said receiving core and the effective refractive index of the receiving waveguide.

- a launching waveguide is a waveguide from which an optical beam is output
- a receiving waveguide is a waveguide in which an optical beam is input, although the mode converter can also work, equivalently, with the opposite beam propagation direction, i.e., from the receiving waveguide to the launching waveguide.
- the actual beam propagation direction will depend on the function of the optical components or devices that are coupled by the mode converter and may also vary during operation.
- the mode converter may even operate on two oppositely propagating beam at a same time, if required by the operation of the components or devices.

- the mode converter can be made as a separate optical component and coupled between a launching waveguide and an optical device. In the latter case, the mode profile of the receiving waveguide of the mode converter should match as close as possible the mode profile of the optical device, to ensure a proper optical coupling between them.
- the mode converter of the invention can be made by the techniques of integrated planar optics, as will be described in the following.
- a plurality of mode converters can be implemented on a single substrate by a single series of processing steps, resulting in an integrated component that can provide mode conversion between a plurality of launching waveguides, for example a plurality of pigtail fibers, and a plurality of receiving waveguides, for example the receiving waveguides of a multichannel component (filter, multiplexer, demultiplexer and the like) that can be used in WDM (wavelength division multiplexing, i.e., multi-wavelength) optics.
- WDM wavelength division multiplexing
- the launching waveguide 2 has a launching mode profile 23 which depends on the dimensions (core and cladding) of the waveguide, on the refractive index difference between the core and the cladding of said waveguide and on the absolute refractive indexes of core and cladding, and is defined as the contour of the area wherein the intensity of the optical beam is greater than I/e 2 where I is the peak intensity.

- Optical coupling waveguide 4 assists in the conversion between the launching mode profile and the receiving mode profile.
- the launching mode profile 23 is changed at least along one of the two axes, e.g. the vertical axis y. Typically, the launching mode profile 23 is changed both along the horizontal axis x and the vertical axis y.
- FIGS. 3 a and 3 b An example of a mode converter 6 according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. 3 a and 3 b.
- the device comprises a receiving waveguide integrated with a coupling waveguide on a common substrate 30 .
- the substrate 30 is for example made of silicon.
- the receiving waveguide comprises a plurality of superposed layers.
- Layer 32 is a first cladding layer, for example made of silica (silicon dioxide).
- a core layer 31 is arranged on top of said first layer 32 .
- the core layer is made of silica nitride.
- a second cladding layer 33 is arranged on top of the core layer 31 .
- said second cladding layer is made of silica.
- the first cladding layer and the second cladding layer are respectively a bottom cladding and a top cladding of the receiving waveguide.
- both cladding layers have a same refractive index of n 2,cl
- the core layer 31 has a refractive index n 2 .
- the receiving waveguide has an effective refractive index n 2eff in its portion that is not in contact with the coupling waveguide, e.g. at its output, i.e. close to the mode converter end opposite to input end 5 of the coupling waveguide.
- a tapered coupling waveguide is arranged so as to be in contact with the core layer of the receiving waveguide, so as to provide optical coupling between the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- the core 41 of the coupling waveguide has substantially a wedge shape and is arranged under the core layer 31 of the receiving waveguide with its top triangular surface 43 in contact with the lower surface of the core layer 31 for all its length.
- said wedge has a substantially triangular base in a plane identified by axes x and z of FIG. 3 a , an input end 5 and two vertical sides that are generally straight but may be, as an alternative, curved, e.g., with a shape of a hyperbole, or an exponential shape, or a segmented shape.
- the wedge has substantially a same height h, along the vertical axis y, for all the wedge length.
- the input end 5 of the coupling waveguide core 41 has typically a substantially square shape, i.e., a rectangular shape with an aspect ratio between about 0.5 and 2.
- the cross section of the coupling waveguide core at its input end has an aspect ratio of between about 0.8 and 1.25. Even more preferably, the cross section of the coupling waveguide core at its input end is square shaped.
- the tip of the wedge i.e., the end of the wedge opposite to input end 5 , is shown as a line in the schematic drawing.
- the tip of the wedge will have in practice a finite size, due to technological constraints.
- the effective refractive index of the wedge and surrounding cladding, in the wedge tip region should be much closer to the surrounding cladding refractive index than to the wedge refractive index.
- a ridge 34 is provided on the surface of the second cladding layer 33 .
- the shape of the ridge determines the lateral confinement and the propagation direction of the optical beam which travels in the receiving waveguide.
- a ridge receiving waveguide is provided.
- a different kind of waveguide may be provided, for example a buried waveguide in which a guiding element is buried into a cladding layer, for example of silica.
- Said guiding element works like a ridge and it determines the lateral confinement and the propagation direction of the optical beam, which travels along the waveguide.
- Another used waveguide is an ARROW waveguide (AntiResonant Reflecting Optical Waveguide) or a photonic crystal in which a plurality of holes are provided on an optical substrate. The position of the holes determines a waveguide on the optical substrate. Examples of other types of waveguide will be described in the following.
- the triangular top surface 43 of the coupling waveguide need not be in contact with the receiving waveguide. It is enough that the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide are optically in contact along a respective portion.
- “optically in contact” means that the coupling waveguide (e.g., at least a portion of the triangular top surface of its tapered core) and at least a portion of the receiving waveguide are relatively positioned in a way to have a superposition of the input mode profile with the receiving mode profile.
- “superposition” means that if I is the maximum intensity of the optical beam of the input mode profile, the overlap integral in a plane defined with respect to said x and y axes of the two mode profile has an intensity which is more than I/e 2 .
- a layer can be interposed between the two cores of the coupling and receiving waveguide.
- such layer has a refractive index lower than the refractive index n 2 of the core of the receiving waveguide, for example such layer can have a refractive index equal to that of other cladding layers 32 or 33 of the mode converter.
- the mode profile guided into the coupling waveguide in the vertical direction depends on the refractive index n 1 of the core of the coupling waveguide, on the refractive index n 2 of the core of the receiving waveguide, on the refractive index of the respective claddings and on the shape of the triangular surface 43 , but not on the vertical shape of the coupling waveguide core as long as the vertical height of the coupling waveguide core is substantially constant along the propagation direction.
- the input mode profile of the coupling waveguide depends on its refractive index and on the shape of its input surface 5 .
- Said input surface 5 is preferably a vertical surface having dimension substantially similar to the launching mode profile of the launching waveguide in a way to obtain a substantial matching between said launching mode profile of the launching waveguide and the input mode profile of the coupling waveguide.
- the input surface of the core of the coupling waveguide has preferably a square cross section with a side of between 6 and 10 ⁇ m, to match the mode profile of typical optical fibers.
- to obtain a substantial matching means substantially to obtain a value of an overlap integral between said launching mode profile of the launching waveguide and the input mode profile of the coupling waveguide between about 0.8 and 1. In said interval, the coupling loss is less than about 1 dB.
- the top triangular surface 43 of wedge 41 (tapered core of the coupling waveguide) substantially determines a change of the horizontal dimension (along the x axis in FIG. 3 a ) of the launching mode profile propagating along z axis from the launching waveguide to the receiving waveguide.
- the tapered core 41 of the coupling waveguide of the present invention is made of a material which is optically transmissive in the wavelength band of interest and has a refractive index n 1 lower than the core refractive index n 2 of the receiving waveguide.
- the refractive index n 1 is higher than the cladding refractive index n 2,cl of the receiving waveguide (n 2,cl ⁇ n 1 ⁇ n 2 ).
- Adequate materials for the tapered core 41 of the coupling waveguide are for example silica nitride or germanium doped silica, whose refractive index can be determined by selecting an appropriate composition.
- the guidance capacity of the core of the coupling waveguide becomes less than the guidance capacity of core of the receiving waveguide.
- the core 31 of the receiving waveguide 3 substantially attracts the mode guided in the coupling waveguide core during the propagation (z axis in figures) of the optical beam, which has in this way a “center of gravity” of the guided mode into the coupling waveguide which becomes closer to the receiving waveguide. This is due to the effect of the core refractive index n 2 of the receiving waveguide which is higher than the core refractive index n 1 of the coupling waveguide and to the effect of the wedge shape of the core of the coupling waveguide.
- the refractive index n 1 of the tapered core of the coupling waveguide is selected so that the effective refractive index n 1eff of the coupling waveguide at its input differs in absolute value from the effective refractive index n 2eff of the receiving waveguide at its output by less than 30%, preferably by less than 20%, and more preferably by less than 10%, of the difference (n 2 ⁇ n 2eff ) between the core refractive index and the effective refractive index of the receiving waveguide.
- Applicant has determined that the above selection criterion for the refractive index n 1 of the tapered core substantially corresponds to selecting the effective refractive index n 1eff of the coupling waveguide at its input and the effective refractive index n 2eff of the receiving waveguide at its output so that they differ from each other in absolute value less than the minimum excursion ⁇ mM along the length of the mode converter of the effective refractive index for the fundamental mode propagating through the converter in the combined waveguide resulting from the combination of the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- the excursion ⁇ mM of the effective refractive index along the length of the mode converter assumes a minimum value when the input effective refractive index n 1eff approximately equals the output effective refractive index n 2eff of the combined waveguide.
- each small variation in effective refractive index corresponds to a small refractive index step for the propagating mode and, hence, to a small reflection.
- a low overall variation in effective refractive index allows a quasi adiabatic propagation of the mode and reduces overall reflections in the mode converter and hence loss.
- the above selection criterion for the refractive index n 1 of the tapered core allows to significantly reduce the length of the tapered core for a predetermined desired value of coupling efficiency, while ensuring a smooth, i.e. almost adiabatic coupling of the optical mode between the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- the size of integrated optics devices is often very small in comparison to the size of typical mode converters.
- the length of the mode converter is dictated by the length of its tapered section, so a reduction in length of the tapered coupling waveguide entails a significant reduction of the mode converter size and of overall length of the optical device including the mode converter.
- a launching waveguide 2 can be disposed close to the input end 5 of the coupling waveguide, preferably in contact with said input surface, so that the coupling waveguide captures the optical beam from the launching waveguide 2 .
- the coupling waveguide is coaxially disposed with respect to a launching waveguide longitudinal axis A, so as to maximize the optical beam power transferred from the launching waveguide to the coupling waveguide.
- a possible selection criteria for the refractive index of the coupling waveguide would be to maximize the overlap integral of the mode profiles of the launching waveguide and the coupling waveguide.
- Applicant has remarked that in practice, if the input end of the coupling waveguide core is substantially square shaped, the “face” coupling between the above two modes is far less critical than the “side” coupling between the tapered coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- the refractive index n 1 of the tapered core of the coupling waveguide is advantageously selected, according to the invention, so as to achieve a good coupling between the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide.
- Applicant has observed that, in practice, a good coupling can be achieved with this value of n 1 even as to the coupling between the launching waveguide and the coupling waveguide, by appropriately selecting the size of the input end of the coupling waveguide.
- the Applicant has determined that the invention device has a small wavelength sensitivity. This is at least partly due to the fact that the operation of the device does not depend on resonant phenomena
- a mode converter according to the invention can be designed to operate over the band 1420-1620 nm, or even over the band 1290-1650 nm.

- the receiving waveguide core 404 has a constant height of 2 ⁇ m throughout its length, so that the output end of the receiving waveguide core has a square cross section of 2 ⁇ m ⁇ 2 ⁇ m.
- FIG. 5 a shows the evolution along the length of the mode converter of the effective refractive index n eff for the fundamental TM mode at a wavelength of 1550 nm that propagates through the combined waveguide resulting from the superposition of the coupling waveguide and the receiving waveguide, for the various tested values of n 1 .
- FIG. 5 b shows an enlargement along the y axis of the central portion of FIG.
- the difference (n 2 ⁇ n 2eff ) between the core and the effective refractive index of the receiving waveguide is, in the case of the example, of about 0.041, so that ⁇ mM corresponds in this case approximately to 10% of (n 2 ⁇ n 2eff ).
- FIG. 5 b The upper and the lower curves shown in FIG. 5 b correspond to excursions of n eff along the mode converter length of about 0.006 and respectively 0.007. Both values are within a range of about 2 ⁇ mM .
