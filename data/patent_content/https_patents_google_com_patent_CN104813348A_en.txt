When proceeding to block 315 following the "Yes" branch of block 310, payment system 140 determines whether transaction value meets configuration parameter.Payment system 140 can analyze the value of the transaction identified in block 310.
User 101, payment system 140 or other appropriate parties can configuration of transaction threshold value be worth.For example, payment system 140 can ask for the mean value of transaction, and determines described mean value whether lower than threshold value or be within the scope of predetermined value.In another example, payment system can adopt intermediate value to be worth, and determines that whether described value is lower than threshold value.In another example, payment system can determine that whether certain number percent of concluding the business is lower than threshold value.
Whether user 101 and payment system 140 can be analyzed transaction value to determine and be worth lower than threshold value, because user 101 may not want to skip authority levels in high-value transactions.For example, if user 101 carries out the transaction of many times 5 dollars at cafe, so user 101 may prefer to skip mandate to the transaction in future in cafe.If user 101 carries out the transaction of many times 200 dollars in office appliance shop, so user 101 may not want to skip mandate to the transaction in future in office appliance shop.
If the value of transaction meets value parameter, so method 220 is just followed the "Yes" branch of block 315 and proceeds to block 330.If the value of transaction does not meet value parameter, so method 220 is just followed the "No" branch of block 315 and proceeds to block 320.
When proceeding to block 320 following the "No" branch of block 310 and block 315, payment system 140 can determine that whether merchant system 130 is configured to the automatic payment candidate side of all users by payment system 140.If merchant system 130 is configured to the automatic payment candidate side of all users by payment system 140, so merchant system 130 just can be identified as the automatic payment candidate side of user 101 by payment system 140.The example being identified as the merchant system 130 of the merchant system 130 of the automatic payment candidate side as all users by payment system 140 will be, as partner or other merchant system 130 by trust partner of payment system 140.Another example can be meet other merchant system 130 by trust businessman classification many, as national chain restaurant or common convenience store, or is similar to other merchant system 130 that other pay businessmans 130 automatically.Another example can be have the merchant system 130 confirming confidence levels, and described confidence levels can be proved by long-term Successful Transaction history, stable financial position or other suitable evidence.
If merchant system 130 is configured to the automatic payment candidate side of all users by payment system 140, so method 220 is just followed the "Yes" branch of block 320 and proceeds to block 330.If merchant system 130 is not configured to the automatic payment candidate side of all users by payment system 140, so method 220 is just followed the "No" branch of block 320 and proceeds to block 325.
When proceeding to block 325 following the "No" branch of block 320, payment system 140 can be determined whether merchant system 130 meets and be established to identify the one group of parameter automatically paying candidate side.Payment system 140 can analyze the transactions history of merchant system 130.Payment system 140 can identify many times to conclude the business with multiple user and to be worth the businessman 130 meeting preferred parameter.For example, if 100 users make weekly 5 transaction in merchant system 130, and the value of transaction is between 5 dollars and 20 dollars usually, and so businessman may meet the preferred parameter automatically paying merchant system 130.Can be used for predicting which businessman 130 can as automatically paying candidate side for the transaction count of number of users, each user and any appropriate threshold of transaction value or scope.User 101 can configuration parameter further, to allow payment system 140 to recommend to meet the businessman 130 of the preference of user 101 to user 101.
Payment system 140 can additionally or alternatively define how many other users 101 and accept businessman 130 as automatically paying take over party.Payment system 140, user 101 or other appropriate parties can set up the threshold number of user 101, before merchant system 130 is identified as candidate side, the user 101 of described threshold number must be had to have accepted businessman 130 as automatically paying take over party.For example, other users 101 of 20,100,1000 or other suitable quantity any accept merchant system 130 as automatically paying take over party, this can be set to threshold value, and merchant system 130 needs to exceed this threshold value just can be identified as candidate side.
Payment system 140 additionally or alternatively can determine that merchant system 130 is the region or the area that are positioned at the frequent discrepancy of user 101.For example, if user 101 is through specific shopping center shopping of being everlasting, so all businessmans 130 in shopping center can be identified as candidate side and automatically pay merchant system 130 to become by payment system 140.Payment system 140 can select shopping center or the region with the highest customer transaction number of times, and user 101 can identify local shopping center or region, or can use other suitable regional selection method any.
If merchant system 130 meets any criterion become in the criterion automatically paying merchant system 130, so method 220 is just followed the "Yes" branch of block 325 and proceeds to block 330.If merchant system 130 does not meet any criterion become in the criterion automatically paying take over party, so method 220 just can terminate.
When proceeding to block 330 in the "Yes" branch following block 315, block 320 and block 325, merchant system 130 is just identified as automatically paying candidate side.Payment system 140 can transmit the alternatively square instruction of merchant system 130 to paying application 115.Merchant system 130 can be identified as the automatic payment candidate side in the database of payment system 140.
If user 101 also non-selectedly allows merchant system 130 become automatically to pay merchant system 130, so payment system 140 can continue the transaction monitoring merchant system 130, and on certain time in the future, recommend merchant system 130 as automatically paying merchant system 130.For example, if merchant system 130 continues to meet automatically pay parameter, so payment system 140 just after often carrying out concluding the business for 10 times with user 101, can recommend merchant system 130 to user 101.In another example, when each user 101 refuses merchant system 130, payment system 140 just can reduce the frequency of recommendation.For example, payment system 140 can recommend merchant system 130 after 10 transaction, and then recommends to be then after 20 incidental transactions, and then recommending again is then after 50 transaction.If after the chance (as 3 times or 10 chances) of pre-determined number, user 101 does not accept merchant system 130 yet as automatically paying merchant system 130, and so payment system 140 just can stop recommending merchant system 130.
