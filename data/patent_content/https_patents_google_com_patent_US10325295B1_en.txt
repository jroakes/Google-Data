Definitions
- Pricing and prioritization problems appear in many applications such as satellite scheduling, airline reservations, hotel bookings, and the like. Applications such as these involve allocating resources (e.g., imaging time on a satellite, seats on a plane, rooms in a hotel, etc.) that are typically scarce and constrained in various ways (e.g., in the capacity of resources). Solving a typical pricing and prioritization problem can involve creating a mapping of resources that satisfy certain constraints and are optimal according to one or more criteria. Solutions to such problems can be challenging.
- One goal in selecting, pricing, and prioritizing the collection of imagery can be to maximize revenue generation.
- a constellation of satellites represent a limited resource. It would be advantageous to exploit the limited resource such that the maximum number of imagery collections can take place.
- Another goal is to improve customer satisfaction with imagery collection requests. Balancing a desire to maximize revenue generation with improving customer satisfaction may be difficult. However, customer satisfaction may be increased if imagery collection requests that cannot be handled are not accepted, accurate imagery collection completion estimates are provided, and/or deadlines are met.
- systems and methods for selecting, pricing, and/or prioritizing images obtained by a constellation of imaging satellites can determine whether an imagery collection request should be accepted or rejected. If the imagery collection request is accepted, the systems and methods presented can determine an appropriate pricing option for the imagery collection request and how the imagery collection request should be prioritized in relation to other outstanding imagery collection requests.
- Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein can be used for pricing, scheduling, and/or collection of imagery of desired locations on the Earth or other planets, satellites, asteroids, comets, etc.
- the systems and methods can be used for a constellation of satellites around the Moon, Mars, or other planetary body.
- embodiments of the system and methods disclosed herein are applicable to types of combinatorial optimization problems other than scheduling problems for satellites, hotels, airlines, etc.
- the systems and methods can be applied to traveling salesman problems, spanning tree problems, shortest/longest path problems, routing problems, Boolean satisfiability problems, and so forth.
- traveling salesman problems spanning tree problems, shortest/longest path problems, routing problems, Boolean satisfiability problems, and so forth.

- Pricing and prioritization problems can involve one or more constraints.
- An example of a constraint may be increasing profitability.
- satisfying such a constraint may negatively impact customer satisfaction with the product or services offered.
- implementing a pricing and prioritization scheme that maximizes revenue while also improving customer satisfaction can be challenging.
- this disclosure is directed to systems and methods for selecting, pricing, and prioritizing images obtained by a constellation of imaging satellites, and more particularly for selecting, pricing, and prioritizing images in a manner that increases or maximizes generated revenue and improves customer satisfaction.
- the disclosed systems and methods can be used to determine whether an imagery collection request should be accepted or rejected.
- an appropriate pricing option can be generated for the imagery collection request and the imagery collection request can be prioritized in relation to other outstanding imagery collection requests.
- whether an imagery collection request can be accepted may be dependent on the load of the constellation of imaging satellites.
- the load may reflect the capacity for acquiring images (e.g., the amount of imaging time that is available), the capacity for delivering the imaging data from the satellite to a ground station, and the demand for imagery. For example, if the imaging satellites are occupied with taking previously scheduled images past a desired completion date for a new imagery collection request, the new imagery collection request may be rejected.
- the pricing of an imagery collection request may be based, among other factors, on the supply of images in the desired geographic region of the imagery collection request and the demand for images in the same geographic region.

- events can be any task to be performed by the imaging satellite and can generally include, without limitation, imagery collection (e.g., of the desired image area 18 ), imagery downlink (e.g., to the satellite ground communication station 16 ), and onboard maintenance.
- the selection, pricing, and/or prioritization of imagery collected by satellites can be computationally difficult, particularly as the number of requests for imagery increases.
- Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously difficult to solve and may be NP-complete meaning the computational time to solve the problem increases very rapidly as the size of the problem (e.g., the number of imagery requests, the number of satellites in the constellation, the number of constraints, etc.) grows.

- the pricing and delivery system 204 includes an order management system 210 , an image supply system 212 , a constellation load system 214 , a priority weighting system 216 , and a pricing system 218 .
- Each of the systems 210 , 212 , 214 , 216 , and 218 may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more hardware processors that execute one or more instructions.
- One or more of the systems 210 , 212 , 214 , 216 , and 218 may include an application programming interface (API) that can be accessed by a CSR using the CSR interface 206 .
- API application programming interface

- the CSR interface 206 is configured to provide a CSR with information regarding the options for the pricing of an image collection and/or a delivery date for said collection when discussing a potential imagery contract with a user or customer. For example, such information may allow the CSR to make the following example types of communications with the customer: (1) “We can guarantee (with 95% certainty) that your collection can be satisfied in 4 weeks for X dollars”; (2) “If you're willing to pay more, we can guarantee (with 95% certainty) that your collection can be satisfied in 2 weeks.

- the pricing and delivery system 204 is configured to increase and/or maximize revenue that can be generated by the requested imagery collection using one or more processes described herein.
- the pricing and delivery system 204 may increase and/or maximize revenue based on a calculated supply, a calculated priority weight, a constellation 10 load, and/or a calculated demand.
- Supply may represent a total amount of imagery that can be expected to be captured by the constellation 10 of satellites.
- the image supply system 212 is configured to determine a quantitative measure of the supply over a specified time period, such as a year (e.g., supply would then represent a total amount of imagery that can be expected to be captured per year).
- the calculated supply may include the spatial and/or temporal distribution of the images that can be captured.
- a quantitative measure of supply is the expected period of time it takes to satisfy image collection requests, e.g., E[T success ], where E[ ] is a statistical expectation operator or function, and T success is the time taken to satisfy an image collection request.
- the difficulty with which a collection request can be satisfied may be directly proportional to the expected period of time it takes to satisfy an image collection request after a previous image collection request has been satisfied.
- the image supply system 212 may be configured to determine the expected period of time it takes to satisfy an image collection request after a previous image collection request has been satisfied as follows:
- E ⁇ [ T success ] T revisit * E ⁇ [ n success ] * 1 ⁇ system ( 1 )
- T revisit represents a revisit period of time (e.g., a period of time it takes before a satellite can reach a location in which the satellite can capture an image of a desired location again)
- E[n success ] represents the expected number of satellite passes over a desired location before a successful image can be taken, n success .
- historical weather data e.g., historical cloud cover
- the parameter ⁇ system represents system performance (e.g., a measure of the efficiency at which one or more satellites can operate).
- T revisit is a function of a satellite's orbital period, n sat , the collection area's latitude, lat coll , the season of the year, and any geometric constraints specified for the image collection (e.g., images from certain angles are desired).
- the image supply system 212 may be configured to determine T revisit as a function of these parameters (where the subscript “coll” references the collection area): T revisit ( n sat ,lat coll ,season,constraints coll ) (2)
- T revisit n sat ,lat coll ,season,constraints coll
- image collections that occur closer to the poles of a planet (e.g., Earth) with less constraining geometric constraints are in greater supply (e.g., have a lower T revisit ) than image collections that occur closer to the equator of the planet and/or with more constraining geometric constraints.
- image collections may be in greater supply in the hemisphere that is in summer. Equation (2) may quantify these effects.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example embodiment of a geographical distribution 300 of a revisit period of time, T revisit .
- the geographical distribution 300 is for a revisit period of time (in days, on the vertical axis) as a function of latitude and longitude (in degrees) of the desired collection area.
- This example graph has been generated for the month of March for a point collection with a 30 degree maximum off-nadir angle.
- the revisit period is shorter for latitudes near the poles (+90 degrees) than near the equator (0 degrees).
- the image supply system 212 may be configured to generate the geographic distribution 300 . While FIG.
- the geographical distribution 300 may include a point collection with any degree angle (e.g., 0, 15, 20, 25, 35, 40, etc.) and with any type of angle.
- the expected number of passes before successfully capturing an image, E[n success ], can depends, for example, on whether the satellite can “see” the desired collection area through cloud cover, fog, haze, pollution, smoke, dust, sand, etc. that may be over or obscuring the desired collection area.
- historical weather data may assist in the quantification of supply. For example, a satellite may travel over a desired collection area while cloud cover obscures it.
- Historical weather data, and specifically historical cloud cover data can provide a likelihood function of whether or not a particular location on a planet (e.g., Earth) is obscured.
- Historical weather data may be function of a desired collection area's latitude and longitude and/or a time of year.
- the image supply system 212 may be configured to determine historical cloud cover data (e.g., the probability the desired collection area is obscured, e.g., by clouds) as a function of the following parameters: p clouds (lat coll ,long coll ,time) (3)
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example embodiment of a geographical distribution 400 of cloud cover during a period of time as a function of latitude and longitude of the desired collection area.
- the geographical distribution 400 represents the likelihood of clouds for a given location on a planet (e.g., Earth) during the month of March.
- the image supply system 212 is configured to generate the geographic distribution 400 .
- the image supply system 212 can be configured to determine the expected number of passes before an image is successfully captured by a satellite (e.g., E[n success ]) as follows, in some embodiments:
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example embodiment of a geographical distribution 500 of an expected time to successfully capture an image, E[T success ] (measured in number of passes before an image is successfully captured by a satellite) as a function of latitude and longitude of the desired collection area.
- the example distribution 500 in FIG. 5 is based on Equation (1) and allows for delays due to cloud cover over the desired imagery location and downtime of the satellite.
- the geographical distribution 500 is dependent on a given period of time. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 5 , the geographical distribution 500 is of an expected number of passes during the month of March.
- the image supply system 212 is configured to generate the geographic distribution 500 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example embodiment of a geographical distribution 600 of an expected period of time it takes to satisfy an image collection request after a previous image collection request has been satisfied.
- the distribution 600 is for a point collection with a 30 degree maximum off-nadir angle.
- the geographical distribution 600 is of an expected period of time (e.g., days) during the month of March. While FIG. 6 illustrates a point collection with a 30 degree maximum off-nadir angle, this is not meant to be limiting.
- the geographical distribution 600 may include a point collection with any degree angle (e.g., 0, 15, 20, 25, 35, 40, etc.) and with any type of angle.
- the geographical distribution 600 allows for delays due to cloud cover over the desired imagery area and/or downtime of the satellite.
- the image supply system 212 may be configured to generate the geographic distribution 600 .
- the image supply system 212 is configured to determine the quantitative measure of supply before the order management system 210 receives the imagery collection request.

- the image supply system 212 is configured to determine the quantitative measure of supply when the order management system 210 receives the imagery collection request.
- a priority weight can be used, at least partly, by the pricing and delivery system 204 to prioritize imagery to be scheduled by the control system 14 , 202 . Imagery requests with higher priority weights will tend to be handled earlier than imagery requests with lower priority weights and vice-versa.
- the priority weighting system 216 may be configured to determine one or more priority weights. In an embodiment, a priority weight is dependent on a customer satisfaction window.
- a customer satisfaction window may be a time period during which the customer desires an imagery collection at a desired imagery area to be completed or satisfied (e.g., T satisfaction ).
- the user interface 208 via the CSR interface 206 , may be configured to provide the customer satisfaction window to the priority weighting system 216 .
- the factor ⁇ may be greater than or equal to 1, since the time to satisfy the customer's request generally will be at least as long as the expected time to successfully acquire the requested image.
- a larger value of ⁇ may correspond with an imagery collection request that has a more relaxed satisfaction horizon.
- the customer is most demanding when ⁇ is 1 (e.g., the customer would like the imagery collection to be completed by the fastest statistically expected date).
- a particular desired imagery location may have an E[T success ] of 10 days (e.g., the fastest a satellite can be statistically expected to capture images of the desired imagery location is 10 days).
- the desired imagery location would be captured within about a month (30 days) to satisfy the imagery collection request (and could be captured about every month if the desired imagery location is rescheduled with an ⁇ of 3 every month).
- the desired imagery location could be captured any time during the year (360 days) to satisfy the imagery collection request.
- the priority weighting system 216 may be configured to determine the priority weight as follows:
- the priority weight may increase, thereby representing the increasing urgency to capture an image(s) of the desired imagery location and satisfy the imagery collection request before the customer satisfaction time expires.
- the priority weight can be represented as a function of time elapsed as follows:
- priority weights w(t 0 ) and/or w(t elapsed ) represent a higher priority when greater than 1.
- the priority weight can be determined with just one piece of information obtained from the customer (e.g., the customer satisfaction window by asking the question “when would you like your pictures by?”).
- the priority weight takes into account local conditions at the desired imagery location locathat could affect image collection (e.g., cloud cover, latitude, resource sharing with other satellites, etc.) via E[T success ].
- the priority weight represented as a function of time elapsed may be normalized. For example, with all else equal, a first imagery collection request with a T satisfaction of 60 days and 30 days already passed may have the same priority weight as a second imagery collection request with a T satisfaction of 30 days and 0 days have already passed.
- the system 204 (or a human collection planner) can determine which imagery collection requests are most urgent by identifying requests for which the priority weights are largest, for example, w(t elapsed ) greater than 1.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a graph 700 that depicts an example of the value of a priority weight as a customer satisfaction window nears completion (e.g., as the deadline for completing the imagery collection nears).
- the graph 700 depicts the value of a priority weight for a desired imagery location where T success is 10 days and where the customer has specified a T satisfaction of 60 days (e.g., a equals 6).

- T success e.g., three imagery collection requests are handled during a 60 day span.
- the priority weights increase as the satisfaction time approaches.
- the priority weight is zero before the start time, t start , which means the image will not be scheduled before the start time.
- the priority weighting system 216 may be configured to generate the graph 800 .
- the constellation load system 214 can be configured to determine a constellation load or a load on the constellation 10 of satellites.
- the constellation load or a load on the constellation 10 of satellites may be a function that determines whether a new imagery collection request is accepted or rejected based on an existing imagery collection requests.
- the constellation load may be a function of geography and time.
- the constellation load can be a function that guides the acceptance and/or rejection of new collection requests, base at least partly on the existing set of requests already accepted by the system.
- a load function can represent an amount of outstanding imaging collections that have already been accepted in the vicinity of a certain location x on Earth at a certain time t.

- the constellation load system 214 may use Equation (10) to determine the smallest value of T satisfaction for an imagery collection starting at t start that does not result in the value produced by the cumulative load function L(x,t 2 ) being greater than 1.
- the CSR interface 206 can relay such information to the user interface 208 .
- the various systems 212 , 214 , 216 , and/or 218 are notified and do not process the imagery collection request as described herein.
- the pricing system 218 still uses the imagery collection request to update or revise a determined quantitative measure of demand, which is described in greater detail below.

Description
The present application is based on and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 61/921,809 having a filing date of Dec. 30, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein.
Pricing and prioritization problems appear in many applications such as satellite scheduling, airline reservations, hotel bookings, and the like. Applications such as these involve allocating resources (e.g., imaging time on a satellite, seats on a plane, rooms in a hotel, etc.) that are typically scarce and constrained in various ways (e.g., in the capacity of resources). Solving a typical pricing and prioritization problem can involve creating a mapping of resources that satisfy certain constraints and are optimal according to one or more criteria. Solutions to such problems can be challenging.
The systems, methods and devices described herein have innovative aspects, no single one of which is indispensable or solely responsible for their desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the disclosure or claims, some of the advantageous features will now be summarized.
One goal in selecting, pricing, and prioritizing the collection of imagery can be to maximize revenue generation. A constellation of satellites represent a limited resource. It would be advantageous to exploit the limited resource such that the maximum number of imagery collections can take place.
Another goal is to improve customer satisfaction with imagery collection requests. Balancing a desire to maximize revenue generation with improving customer satisfaction may be difficult. However, customer satisfaction may be increased if imagery collection requests that cannot be handled are not accepted, accurate imagery collection completion estimates are provided, and/or deadlines are met.
Accordingly, provided herein are systems and methods for selecting, pricing, and/or prioritizing images obtained by a constellation of imaging satellites. The systems and methods presented can determine whether an imagery collection request should be accepted or rejected. If the imagery collection request is accepted, the systems and methods presented can determine an appropriate pricing option for the imagery collection request and how the imagery collection request should be prioritized in relation to other outstanding imagery collection requests.
Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein can be used for pricing, scheduling, and/or collection of imagery of desired locations on the Earth or other planets, satellites, asteroids, comets, etc. For example, the systems and methods can be used for a constellation of satellites around the Moon, Mars, or other planetary body.
Additionally, embodiments of the system and methods disclosed herein are applicable to types of combinatorial optimization problems other than scheduling problems for satellites, hotels, airlines, etc. For example, in various embodiments, the systems and methods can be applied to traveling salesman problems, spanning tree problems, shortest/longest path problems, routing problems, Boolean satisfiability problems, and so forth. Although certain goals and advantages are described, no single embodiment necessarily must include each and every such goal and advantage. Various implementations can be designed to achieve one, some, or all such goals and advantages and/or other goals or advantages.
Throughout the drawings, reference numbers can be reused to indicate general correspondence between reference elements. The drawings are provided to illustrate example embodiments described herein and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.
Overview
Pricing and prioritization problems can involve one or more constraints. An example of a constraint may be increasing profitability. However, satisfying such a constraint may negatively impact customer satisfaction with the product or services offered. Thus, implementing a pricing and prioritization scheme that maximizes revenue while also improving customer satisfaction can be challenging.
In certain aspects, this disclosure is directed to systems and methods for selecting, pricing, and prioritizing images obtained by a constellation of imaging satellites, and more particularly for selecting, pricing, and prioritizing images in a manner that increases or maximizes generated revenue and improves customer satisfaction. In some implementations, the disclosed systems and methods can be used to determine whether an imagery collection request should be accepted or rejected. In some implementations, if the imagery collection request is accepted, an appropriate pricing option can be generated for the imagery collection request and the imagery collection request can be prioritized in relation to other outstanding imagery collection requests.
For a constellation of imaging satellites, whether an imagery collection request can be accepted may be dependent on the load of the constellation of imaging satellites. The load may reflect the capacity for acquiring images (e.g., the amount of imaging time that is available), the capacity for delivering the imaging data from the satellite to a ground station, and the demand for imagery. For example, if the imaging satellites are occupied with taking previously scheduled images past a desired completion date for a new imagery collection request, the new imagery collection request may be rejected. The pricing of an imagery collection request may be based, among other factors, on the supply of images in the desired geographic region of the imagery collection request and the demand for images in the same geographic region.
Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, terms as used herein will be understood to imply their customary and ordinary meaning. For example, pair-wise constraint is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., it is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning), and includes, without limitation, constraints that prohibit an event based solely on properties of an immediately preceding event. For example, two image collection events are pair-wise constrained if there is insufficient time between the first image collection event and the second image collection event to change a pointing direction of an imaging satellite to perform the second image collection event.
Cumulative constraint is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., it is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning), and includes, without limitation, constraints that prohibit an event based on properties of preceding events. For example, an image collection event can be constrained if by performing the event the temperature of a camera acquiring the image would exceed acceptable temperature limits due at least in part to prior events.
In some implementations, a constellation of satellites can include any type of satellite including but not limited to satellites, mini-satellites, micro-satellites, nano-satellites, and so forth. Micro-satellite is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., it is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning), and includes, without limitation, satellites with a mass less than or equal to about 500 kg and/or physical dimensions less than or equal to about 125 cm×125 cm×175 cm, or satellites that launch as a secondary payload on a launch vehicle. According to some conventions, satellites having a mass less than or equal to about 500 kg are classified as small satellites with further divisions being made based on their mass. For example, in one classification system, small satellites are deemed mini-satellites when they have a mass between about 100 kg and 500 kg, micro-satellites when they have a mass between about 10 kg and 100 kg, nano-satellites when they have a mass between about 1 kg and 10 kg, pico-satellites when they have a mass between about 0.1 kg and 1 kg, and femto-satellites when they have a mass less than or equal to about 100 g. However, any reference to micro-satellite, mini-satellite, or small satellite in this disclosure should be understood to mean the general class of satellites having a mass less than or equal to about 500 kg and/or physical dimensions less than or equal to about 125 cm×125 cm×175 cm; and not to the more specific classification of satellites identified herein or other similar classification schemes.
Overhead image is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill the in the art (e.g., it is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning) and includes, without limitation, satellite images captured by satellites in earth-orbit, or other overhead images captured by aircraft (e.g., airplanes, helicopters, drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), balloons, etc.) surveying a geographic region, and the like. In some cases, the overhead image may be of an astronomical object rather than a terrestrial object. Images (or imagery) can include both still images and/or video.
Example Network of Imaging Micro-Satellites
The control system 14 can be configured to schedule events in the constellation. For example, the control system 14 can include embodiments of the control system 202 described with reference to FIG. 2 . The control system 14, 202 can interface with a pricing and delivery system 204 described with reference to FIGS. 2-11 . Scheduled events can include one or more tasks to be performed, data to be collected, information to be received or transmitted, duration, desired start time, desired end time, desired results, or any combination of these. For example, for an imaging satellite, events can be any task to be performed by the imaging satellite and can generally include, without limitation, imagery collection (e.g., of the desired image area 18), imagery downlink (e.g., to the satellite ground communication station 16), and onboard maintenance.
The selection, pricing, and/or prioritization of imagery collected by satellites can be computationally difficult, particularly as the number of requests for imagery increases. Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously difficult to solve and may be NP-complete meaning the computational time to solve the problem increases very rapidly as the size of the problem (e.g., the number of imagery requests, the number of satellites in the constellation, the number of constraints, etc.) grows. Hardware computational resources may be necessary to find an optimal, or near-optimal, solution to the problem in many cases.
Embodiments of the systems, methods, and algorithms described herein advantageously can be used to determine whether imagery can be collected, the pricing of collected imagery, and/or how to prioritize multiple requests for imagery. As an example, the availability of the constellation 10 of satellites and pricing information can be provided to users or customers. The control system 14, 202 can use the prioritization information to schedule events in a way that improves or maximizes the productivity of the constellation 10 of satellites. The pricing and delivery system 204 can utilize any method described herein for selecting, pricing, and prioritizing images obtained by a constellation of imaging satellites, such as the example method 1100 described herein with reference to FIG. 11 .
Example Selection, Pricing, and Prioritization Systems and Methodologies
In an embodiment, the pricing and delivery system 204 includes an order management system 210, an image supply system 212, a constellation load system 214, a priority weighting system 216, and a pricing system 218. Each of the systems 210, 212, 214, 216, and 218 may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more hardware processors that execute one or more instructions. One or more of the systems 210, 212, 214, 216, and 218 may include an application programming interface (API) that can be accessed by a CSR using the CSR interface 206. The systems 210, 212, 214, 216, and 218 are described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 2-10 .
The CSR interface 206 can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more hardware processors that execute one or more instructions. In an embodiment, the CSR interface 206 is configured to provide a CSR with information regarding the options for the pricing of an image collection and/or a delivery date for said collection when discussing a potential imagery contract with a user or customer. For example, such information may allow the CSR to make the following example types of communications with the customer: (1) “We can guarantee (with 95% certainty) that your collection can be satisfied in 4 weeks for X dollars”; (2) “If you're willing to pay more, we can guarantee (with 95% certainty) that your collection can be satisfied in 2 weeks. That will cost Y dollars extra”; (3) “Sorry, but at this time of year, we cannot guarantee (with 95% certainty) the satisfaction of your request for any timespan less than 2 weeks”; and (4) “Once you've committed, no other requests will enter our system that would threaten to delay the delivery of your imagery past the latest delivery date specified.” The foregoing are merely examples of the types of scheduling and/or prioritized communications that are possible. The CSR interface 206 may provide the CSR with such information via a graphical user interface (GUI).
A CSR can use the CSR interface 206 to communicate with a customer using the user interface 208. In an embodiment, the CSR interface 206 communicates with the user interface 208 via a network (e.g., a wired or wireless network, such as the Internet). The user interface 208 can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more hardware processors that execute one or more instructions. The user interface 208 may be configured to provide the customer with information regarding the options for the pricing of an image collection and/or a delivery date for said collection when discussing a potential imagery contract with a CSR. The user interface 208 may provide the customer with such information via a GUI and may be configured to accept user input (and communicate the user input to the CSR)
The order management system 210 of the pricing and delivery system 204 may be configured to produce or receive a request for an imagery collection from the CSR interface 206. The CSR interface 206 may have received such request from the user interface 208. One of more of the systems 212, 214, 216, and/or 218 may be configured to process the imagery collection request in order to provide the CSR interface 206, and ultimately the user interface 208, with scheduling and/or pricing options. In an embodiment, the pricing and delivery system 204 is configured to increase and/or maximize revenue that can be generated by the requested imagery collection using one or more processes described herein. For example, the pricing and delivery system 204 may increase and/or maximize revenue based on a calculated supply, a calculated priority weight, a constellation 10 load, and/or a calculated demand.
Supply
Supply may represent a total amount of imagery that can be expected to be captured by the constellation 10 of satellites. In an embodiment, the image supply system 212 is configured to determine a quantitative measure of the supply over a specified time period, such as a year (e.g., supply would then represent a total amount of imagery that can be expected to be captured per year). The calculated supply may include the spatial and/or temporal distribution of the images that can be captured.
In an embodiment, a quantitative measure of supply is the expected period of time it takes to satisfy image collection requests, e.g., E[Tsuccess], where E[ ] is a statistical expectation operator or function, and Tsuccess is the time taken to satisfy an image collection request. The difficulty with which a collection request can be satisfied may be directly proportional to the expected period of time it takes to satisfy an image collection request after a previous image collection request has been satisfied. In some implementations, the image supply system 212 may be configured to determine the expected period of time it takes to satisfy an image collection request after a previous image collection request has been satisfied as follows:
where Trevisit represents a revisit period of time (e.g., a period of time it takes before a satellite can reach a location in which the satellite can capture an image of a desired location again), and E[nsuccess] represents the expected number of satellite passes over a desired location before a successful image can be taken, nsuccess. As discussed herein, historical weather data (e.g., historical cloud cover) can influence the expected number of passes. The parameter ηsystem represents system performance (e.g., a measure of the efficiency at which one or more satellites can operate).
In an embodiment, for a given desired satellite and collection area, such as the desired image area 18, Trevisit is a function of a satellite's orbital period, nsat, the collection area's latitude, latcoll, the season of the year, and any geometric constraints specified for the image collection (e.g., images from certain angles are desired). For example, the image supply system 212 may be configured to determine Trevisit as a function of these parameters (where the subscript “coll” references the collection area):
T revisit(n sat,latcoll,season,constraintscoll) (2)
In some embodiments, image collections that occur closer to the poles of a planet (e.g., Earth) with less constraining geometric constraints are in greater supply (e.g., have a lower Trevisit) than image collections that occur closer to the equator of the planet and/or with more constraining geometric constraints. Furthermore, image collections may be in greater supply in the hemisphere that is in summer. Equation (2) may quantify these effects.
T revisit(n sat,latcoll,season,constraintscoll) (2)
In some embodiments, image collections that occur closer to the poles of a planet (e.g., Earth) with less constraining geometric constraints are in greater supply (e.g., have a lower Trevisit) than image collections that occur closer to the equator of the planet and/or with more constraining geometric constraints. Furthermore, image collections may be in greater supply in the hemisphere that is in summer. Equation (2) may quantify these effects.
The expected number of passes before successfully capturing an image, E[nsuccess], can depends, for example, on whether the satellite can “see” the desired collection area through cloud cover, fog, haze, pollution, smoke, dust, sand, etc. that may be over or obscuring the desired collection area. In an embodiment, historical weather data may assist in the quantification of supply. For example, a satellite may travel over a desired collection area while cloud cover obscures it. Historical weather data, and specifically historical cloud cover data, can provide a likelihood function of whether or not a particular location on a planet (e.g., Earth) is obscured. Historical weather data may be function of a desired collection area's latitude and longitude and/or a time of year. For instance, the image supply system 212 may be configured to determine historical cloud cover data (e.g., the probability the desired collection area is obscured, e.g., by clouds) as a function of the following parameters:
p clouds(latcoll,longcoll,time) (3)
p clouds(latcoll,longcoll,time) (3)
Given a likelihood function (such as the example shown in FIG. 4 ), or the function pclouds of Equation (3), the image supply system 212 can be configured to determine the expected number of passes before an image is successfully captured by a satellite (e.g., E[nsuccess]) as follows, in some embodiments:
For example, if a location on Earth has a value E[nsuccess] of 10, then 50% of the time an image of the desired imagery location successfully can be captured by the satellite with fewer than 10 passes, and 50% of the time an image of the desired imagery location successfully can be captured by the satellite with more than 10 passes. In some embodiments, Equation (4) can be summed to yield E[nsuccess]=1/(1−pclouds), which is equal to 1 divided by the probability that it is clear (e.g., not cloudy) at the desired collection area.
In an embodiment, the image supply system 212 is configured to determine the quantitative measure of supply before the order management system 210 receives the imagery collection request. The image supply system 212 may update the quantitative measure of supply when or after new data (e.g., revised historical weather data) is received. In another embodiment, the image supply system 212 is configured to determine the quantitative measure of supply when the order management system 210 receives the imagery collection request.
Priority Weights
A priority weight can be used, at least partly, by the pricing and delivery system 204 to prioritize imagery to be scheduled by the control system 14, 202. Imagery requests with higher priority weights will tend to be handled earlier than imagery requests with lower priority weights and vice-versa. The priority weighting system 216 may be configured to determine one or more priority weights. In an embodiment, a priority weight is dependent on a customer satisfaction window. A customer satisfaction window may be a time period during which the customer desires an imagery collection at a desired imagery area to be completed or satisfied (e.g., Tsatisfaction). The user interface 208, via the CSR interface 206, may be configured to provide the customer satisfaction window to the priority weighting system 216. The customer satisfaction window time period can be represented as follows:
T satisfaction =α×E[T success] (6)
where α is a proportionality factor. The factor α may be greater than or equal to 1, since the time to satisfy the customer's request generally will be at least as long as the expected time to successfully acquire the requested image. A larger value of α may correspond with an imagery collection request that has a more relaxed satisfaction horizon. The customer is most demanding when α is 1 (e.g., the customer would like the imagery collection to be completed by the fastest statistically expected date). As an example, a particular desired imagery location may have an E[Tsuccess] of 10 days (e.g., the fastest a satellite can be statistically expected to capture images of the desired imagery location is 10 days). For example, with an α of 3, the desired imagery location would be captured within about a month (30 days) to satisfy the imagery collection request (and could be captured about every month if the desired imagery location is rescheduled with an α of 3 every month). With an α of 36, the desired imagery location could be captured any time during the year (360 days) to satisfy the imagery collection request.
T satisfaction =α×E[T success] (6)
where α is a proportionality factor. The factor α may be greater than or equal to 1, since the time to satisfy the customer's request generally will be at least as long as the expected time to successfully acquire the requested image. A larger value of α may correspond with an imagery collection request that has a more relaxed satisfaction horizon. The customer is most demanding when α is 1 (e.g., the customer would like the imagery collection to be completed by the fastest statistically expected date). As an example, a particular desired imagery location may have an E[Tsuccess] of 10 days (e.g., the fastest a satellite can be statistically expected to capture images of the desired imagery location is 10 days).

With an α of 36, the desired imagery location could be captured any time during the year (360 days) to satisfy the imagery collection request.
In an embodiment, the priority weighting system 216 may be configured to determine the priority weight as follows:
As can be seen from Equation (7), as the customer satisfaction window grows closer (e.g., the deadline Tsatisfaction to complete the imagery collection request nears), the priority weight may increase, thereby representing the increasing urgency to capture an image(s) of the desired imagery location and satisfy the imagery collection request before the customer satisfaction time expires. In a further embodiment, the priority weight can be represented as a function of time elapsed as follows:
In an embodiment, priority weights w(t0) and/or w(telapsed) represent a higher priority when greater than 1. As follows from Equations (7) and (8), the priority weight can be determined with just one piece of information obtained from the customer (e.g., the customer satisfaction window by asking the question “when would you like your pictures by?”). Furthermore, the priority weight takes into account local conditions at the desired imagery location locathat could affect image collection (e.g., cloud cover, latitude, resource sharing with other satellites, etc.) via E[Tsuccess]. In addition, the priority weight represented as a function of time elapsed may be normalized. For example, with all else equal, a first imagery collection request with a Tsatisfaction of 60 days and 30 days already passed may have the same priority weight as a second imagery collection request with a Tsatisfaction of 30 days and 0 days have already passed. The system 204 (or a human collection planner) can determine which imagery collection requests are most urgent by identifying requests for which the priority weights are largest, for example, w(telapsed) greater than 1.
In an embodiment, the priority weighting system 216 is configured to provide priority weights determined using Equation (7) and/or (8) to the control system 14, 202. The control system 14, 202 may be configured to determine the scheduling of the constellation 10 of satellites based on the received priority weights.
Constellation Load
The constellation load system 214 can be configured to determine a constellation load or a load on the constellation 10 of satellites. The constellation load or a load on the constellation 10 of satellites may be a function that determines whether a new imagery collection request is accepted or rejected based on an existing imagery collection requests. The constellation load may be a function of geography and time. The constellation load can be a function that guides the acceptance and/or rejection of new collection requests, base at least partly on the existing set of requests already accepted by the system.
A load function can represent an amount of outstanding imaging collections that have already been accepted in the vicinity of a certain location x on Earth at a certain time t. The constellation load system 214 may be configured to determine the load function as follows:
where index j represents an outstanding collection, αj represents the j-th proportionality factor, and each of the N outstanding collections may take place near location x with a start time, tstart, before time t and a finish time, tstart+Tsatisfaction, after time t. In an embodiment, the
where the
t 1=min(t start,j) (11)
t 2=max(t start,j +T satisfaction,j). (12)
In an embodiment, if a value produced by the cumulative load function is greater than 1 over a time span from t1 to t2, then the constellation 10 of satellites are overloaded beyond the maximum amount of imagery that can be captured during a given period of time. Thus, the pricing and delivery system 204 (and specifically the constellation load system 214 in some embodiments) may reject a new imagery collection request if the value produced by the cumulative load function is greater than 1. In some embodiments, the constellation load system 214 provides information regarding whether a new imagery collection request should be accepted or rejected to the CSR interface 206. The CSR interface 206 may be configured to forward such information to the user interface 208. In further or other embodiments, the constellation load system 214 provides information regarding the minimum customer satisfaction window that can be accepted to the CSR interface 206. For example, the constellation load system 214 may use Equation (10) to determine the smallest value of Tsatisfaction for an imagery collection starting at tstart that does not result in the value produced by the cumulative load function L(x,t2) being greater than 1. The CSR interface 206 can relay such information to the user interface 208.
In some embodiments, if the constellation load system 214 determines that the imagery collection request received from the user interface 208 via the CSR interface 206 cannot be accepted, the various systems 212, 214, 216, and/or 218 are notified and do not process the imagery collection request as described herein. In other embodiments, if the constellation load system 214 determines that the imagery collection request received from the user interface 208 via the CSR interface 206 cannot be accepted, the pricing system 218 still uses the imagery collection request to update or revise a determined quantitative measure of demand, which is described in greater detail below.
Demand
In an embodiment, the pricing system 218 is configured to determine a price for completing an imagery collection request. The pricing may be dependent on the supply of imagery (e.g., determined by the image supply system 212) and/or the demand for imagery. Demand may represent spatial, temporal, and/or market segment distribution of imagery requested per time period (e.g., per year) for one or more providers of imagery (e.g., from the satellite constellation 10 or from some or all of the geospatial imaging community). For example, if the supply of imagery for a first geographic region (e.g., the northeastern United States) is less than the supply of imagery for a second geographic region (e.g., the Atlantic Ocean), then the pricing for the collection of imagery in the second geographic region may be higher than the pricing for the collection of imagery in the first geographic region. As another example, if the demand for imagery is higher in a first geographic region (e.g., the northeastern United States) than a second geographic region (e.g., the Atlantic ocean), then the pricing for the collection of imagery in the first geographic region may be higher than the pricing for the collection of imagery in the second geographic region. The pricing system 218 may provide the price for completing an imagery collection request to the CSR interface 206, which can then forward the pricing information to the user interface 208. The demand may be based on requests received by the scheduling system 200 or based on requests received by all scheduling systems including the scheduling system 200.
The pricing system 218 may be configured to determine a quantitative measure of demand. A quantitative measure of demand can be the likelihood pdemand that an imagery collection request is received for a geographic location x with a satisfaction window of Tsatisfaction on a given day of the year t. In some embodiments, the pricing system 218 can be configured to determine the quantitative measure of demand as follows:
P demand(t,x k ,T satisfaction,k). (13)
In an embodiment, thepricing system 218 can determine an expected value of how much imagery is requested in various locations on a planet (e.g., Earth) by integrating Equation (13) over a timespan (e.g., 365 days) and over a range of customer satisfaction windows as follows:
E[n images](x)=∫t=0 t=365∫Tsatisfaction =E[T success ] T satisfaction =∞ p demand(t,x,T satisfaction)dT satisfaction dt (14)
In a further embodiment, thepricing system 218 can determine a temporal demand profile of imagery in a geographic region X throughout a time period (e.g., a year) by integrating Equation (13) over the geographic region X and over a range of customer satisfaction windows (e.g., all customer satisfaction windows) as follows:
E[n images,x∈X](t)=∫x∈X∫Tsatisfaction =E[T success ] T satisfaction =∞ p demand(t,x,T satisfaction)dT satisfaction dx (15)
Equations (14) and (15) are two examples of data that thepricing system 218 can derive from the demand likelihood pdemand(t,xk,Tsatisfaction,k) and are not meant to be limiting. The pricing system 218 may be configured to determine or derive other data related to the geo-spatial imaging market (e.g., comparing what is the expected customer satisfaction window being requested in a geographic region in winter as opposed to summer). In some embodiments, the pricing system 218 can determine the quantitative measure of demand using additional variables not shown in Equation (13) (e.g., by customer, etc.). Further, by determining the quantitative measure of demand, the pricing system 218 can determine how imaging demand breaks down geographically and temporarily for a particular market segment (e.g., mining, agriculture, real estate, etc.). In some embodiments, the system 204 can depict various graphical representations of the demand likelihood pdemand(tsatisfaction,k), integrals of the demand likelihood (e.g., Equations (14) and/or (15)), such as by using a multidimensional heat map where values are shown as colors or gray scales.
P demand(t,x k ,T satisfaction,k). (13)
In an embodiment, the
E[n images](x)=∫t=0 t=365∫T
In a further embodiment, the
E[n images,x∈X](t)=∫x∈X∫T
Equations (14) and (15) are two examples of data that the
In an embodiment, the pricing system 218 is configured to determine the quantitative measure of demand empirically based on historical data obtained from previous imagery collection requests received by the scheduling system 200 (e.g., the order management system 210) or received by all scheduling systems including the scheduling system 200. The scheduling system 200 may receive imagery collection requests that then are communicated to other scheduling systems for imagery acquisition, thereby becoming a clearinghouse for imagery collection requests and receiving more accurate historical data of previous imagery collection requests.
Example Method of Selecting, Pricing, and/or Prioritizing Images Obtained by a Constellation of Imaging Satellites
In block 1102, the pricing and delivery system 204 receives a request for an image collection event. For example, the image collection event can be received from a customer.
In block 1104, the pricing and delivery system 204 determines whether to accept the request for the image collection event based at least partly on a load on the constellation of imaging satellites created by previous requests received for other image collection events. In block 1106, the pricing and delivery system 204 determines, if the request for the image collection event is accepted, a second period of time that defines a time by which the image collection event can be satisfied by the constellation of imaging satellites.
In block 1108, the pricing and delivery system 204 assigns, if the request for the image collection event is accepted, a priority weight to the image collection event based at least partly on the first period of time and the second period of time. The pricing and delivery system 204 may provide the priority weight to a control system, such as the control system 14, 202, for the scheduling of imaging satellites.
In block 1110, the pricing and delivery system 204 determines, if the request for the image collection event is accepted, a price for completing the image collection event based at least partly on an analysis of the other image collection events. For example, the price may be based on the supply of images in a geographic region of the image collection event and the demand for images in the same geographic region.
