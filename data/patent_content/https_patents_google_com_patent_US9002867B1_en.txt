- Internet search engines provide information about Internet accessible documents (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content) that are responsive to a user's search query by returning a set of search results in response to the query.
- a search result can include, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and a snippet of information for each of a number of documents responsive to a query.
- the search results can be ranked, i.e., placed in an order, according to scores assigned to the search results by a scoring function or process.
- the scoring function value for a given document is derived from various indicators, for example, where, and how often, query terms appear in the given document, how common the query terms are in the documents indexed by the search engine, or a query-independent measure of quality of the document itself.
- Some scoring functions alternatively, or additionally, use quality of result statistics for pairs of queries and documents.
- These quality of result statistics can be derived from indicators that describe past user behavior. For example, a quality of result statistic for a given document and a given query can be derived from how frequently a user selected a search result corresponding to the given document when the search result was presented on a search results page for the given query.
- a system generates weighted quality of result statistics for documents from version-specific quality of result statistics for different versions of the document by weighting the version-specific quality of result statistics by weights derived from differences between the respective versions of the document and a reference version of the document.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining a weighted overall quality of result statistic for a document with respect to a query from respective version-specific quality of result statistics for each of a plurality of different versions of the document with respect to the query, the determining comprising: receiving quality of result data for a query and a plurality of versions of a document, the quality of result data specifying a version specific quality of result statistic for each of the versions of the document with respect to the query; determining a weighted overall quality of result statistic for the document with respect to the query, wherein determining the weighted overall quality of result statistic comprises weighting each version specific quality of result statistic and combining the weighted version-specific quality of result statistics, wherein each quality of result statistic is weighted by a weight determined from at least a difference between content of a reference version of the document and content of the version of the document corresponding to the version specific quality of result statistic; and storing the weighted overall quality of result statistic and

- Each of the plurality of versions of the document is stored at a same address.
- the address is a Uniform Resource Locator.
- the reference version of the document is a version of the document that was most-recently crawled by a web-crawler.
- Determining the weighted overall quality of result statistic comprises: determining a respective difference score for each of the plurality of versions of the document with reference to the reference version of the document, wherein the difference score for a particular version in the plurality of versions of the document and the reference version of the document measures a difference between a representation of the particular version and a representation of the reference version of the document; and weighting each version specific quality of result statistic by a weight derived from the difference score for the version of the document associated with the version specific quality of result statistic.
- the representation of a version of the document comprises shingles extracted from the version of the document.
- the representation of a version of the document comprises a time distribution of shingles in the version of the document.

- the actions further include determining a difference score for the reference version of the document and a current version of the document, and wherein selecting either the weighted overall quality of result statistic or non-weighted overall quality of result statistic comprises selecting a statistic according to the difference score.
- the actions further include receiving an indication that the document has changed; and updating the weighted overall quality of result statistic in response to the indication.
- a search system can determine when a document responsive to a search query has changed, and can accordingly modify data indicating past user behavior that is used to rank the search result.
- the document can be ranked using indicators that more closely represent the current content of the document, rather than past content of the document.

- time A when a search result corresponding to the first version 102 a of the document is presented to users, users only select the search result for the document for certain queries. For example, users select the search result for version 102 a in response to the queries “dog breeds” 104 a , “wombat facts” 108 a , and “information on cats” 112 a.
- One indicator a search engine can use to rank documents responsive to a given query is a quality of result statistic that measures how good a result a given document is for the given query.
- the quality of result statistic can be derived from various indicators.
- One example indicator can be determined based on which documents users click on, i.e., select, when the documents are presented as search results for a given query.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example search system 200 for providing search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an interne, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 200 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.

- a quality of result statistic engine 216 generates weighted overall quality of result statistics for query-document pairs and optionally generates non-weighted overall quality of result statistics for query-document pairs. Each query-document pair consists of a query and a document.
- the quality of result statistic engine 216 provides either the weighted overall quality of result statistics or the non-weighted overall quality of result statistics to the ranking engine 210 , as described in more detail below.
- FIG. 3 illustrates building an example model database 302 for use with an information retrieval system.
- the model database 302 is one or more databases that store version-specific quality of result statistics for queries and versions of documents.
- FIG. 3 shows building a model that stores version-specific quality of result statistics for document versions.
- the version-specific quality of result statistics illustrated in FIG. 3 are determined based on user click data. However, other version-specific quality of result statistics can also be generated and used.
- a user submits a query 306 a “used car,” to a search engine through a graphical user interface 309 presented on a user device.
- a search engine returns a result list 308 which is an ordered (ranked) list of references to documents that are responsive to the query 306 a .
- the result list 308 includes, for each document, a respective hyperlink that shows a document reference URL A, URL B, URL C ( 301 a ), and URL D. If a user selects (e.g., clicks) the hyperlink for URL C 310 a in the result list 308 , the user interface 309 (e.g., a web browser) obtains and presents the associated document 312 .
- the user interface 309 e.g., a web browser
- the model database 302 stores records for documents that are selected by users from among documents presented in response to a query. Each record within the model 302 associates a query, an identifier of a document 310 selected by users in response to that query, and a respective version-specific quality of result statistic for each version of the document.
- record 318 a relates query 306 a , an identifier 307 a of URL C, for example a universal resource locator (URL), and version-specific quality of result statistics 314 a and 316 a for versions of the document at URL C with respect to the query 306 a .
- the information used to generate the version-specific quality of result statistics can be aggregated or otherwise anonymized.
- Each record can also include a representation of each version of the document for which version-specific quality of result statistics were generated.
- record 318 a stores representations 320 a and 322 a of URL C
- record 318 b stores representations 320 b and 322 b of URL K. Version representations are described in more detail below, with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the document representations are created at the same time the rest of the model data is gathered and generated. In other implementations, the document representations are created separately from the rest of the model data, and the two types of data are merged at a later time to create the record.
- the version-specific quality of result statistics stored in the model data are specific to a geographic location, e.g., a city, metropolitan region, state, country, or continent, specific to a language preference, or a combination of the two.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example weighted statistic engine 402 implemented on one or more computers.
- the weighted statistic engine 402 generates weighted overall quality of result statistics for one or more query-document pairs.
- the weighted statistic engine 402 is part of the quality of result statistic engine 216 described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the weighted statistic engine 402 will be described as generating the weighted overall quality of result statistics in advance and storing them for later use.
- the weighted statistic engine can alternatively generate the weighted overall quality of result statistics 408 in real time, as needed.
- the weighted statistic engine 402 includes a weight generator 404 and a weighted quality of result statistic generator 406 .
- the weight generator 404 processes model data 412 including quality of result data for multiple versions of the document and the query.
- the weight generator 404 determines an appropriate weight for version-specific quality of result statistics corresponding to each version of the document represented in the model data 412 for the document and the query.
- the weight for a given version is determined at least in part from an estimate of the difference between the given version of the document and the current version.
- the representations of the versions of the documents can be stored in the model data 412 .
- the versions of the documents can be represented in different ways.
- the representation of a version of a document is a time distribution of the shingles in the document.
- shingles can be extracted from the version of the document, or from snippets of the version of the document.
- a snippet is, for example, one or more parts of the document that are identified as being significant for ranking purposes.
- Shingles are contiguous subsequences of tokens in a document.
- the time can be, for example, the first time the shingle was ever observed in any version of any document by the system generating the representations of the versions, or the first time the shingle was ever observed in a version of the document itself.
- the distribution of the times associated with the shingles is then used as the representation of the version of the document.
- the representation of a version of a document is the text of the document itself. In other implementations, the representation of a version of a document is text extracted from snippets of the document. In still other implementations, the representation of a version of a document is the shingles extracted from the document, or from snippets of the document.
- the representation of a version of a document is a document fingerprint of the document.
- the document fingerprint can be, for example, a hash value generated from shingles extracted from the document and having a length equal to or less than a predetermined length.
- a document can be processed to identify non-boilerplate text, and the representation of a version of a document can be derived from just the non-boilerplate text in the document.
- Various algorithms for identifying boilerplate and non-boilerplate text can be used.
- boilerplate text can be identified by comparing multiple related documents and identifying text that is common to all, or a majority, of the documents. Documents can be determined to be related, for example, when they are from the same domain. For example, if all of the related documents have common text in a similar physical location, e.g., on the left hand side of the documents or at the bottom of the documents, the common text can be determined to be boilerplate. Other conventional methods for identifying boilerplate text can also be used. The text that is not boilerplate text can then be identified as non-boilerplate text.
- the difference between the two documents is represented as a difference score.
- the weight score generator 404 can use various techniques to calculate the difference score.
- the difference score can be calculated by comparing the two time distributions for the two versions of the document.
- the difference score can be derived from the distance between the mean of one distribution and the mean of the other distribution. Two versions of the document that are similar will have similar distributions and thus close means. In contrast, a version of the document that has changed dramatically from a previous version of the document will have a different distribution than the previous version. Because there will be more distance between the means of the distributions when the documents are different than when the documents are similar, the distance between the means of the distribution is a measure of how much the versions have changed.
- the difference score can alternatively or additionally be based on other factors, for example, a measure of the dispersion of the distribution.
- the entire text of both versions of the document, or text from the significant parts of the versions of the document, e.g., the parts of the documents that are identified as being significant for ranking purposes, can be compared, for example, using conventional text comparison techniques.
- the longest common subsequence of the two versions can be identified and the percentage of the two versions that overlap can be computed from the length of the longest common subsequence and the length of the document versions.
- the difference score can be derived from a comparison of shingle representations of each version of the document.
- the system can compare the shingles to obtain a similarity score for the two versions of the documents, and then derive a difference score from the similarity score, e.g., by taking the inverse of the similarity score.
- a similarity score for the two versions of the document can be determined from a comparison of the shingles, e.g.:
- the system can use various modified forms of the formula given above.
- the system can use a formula where the shingles in each set are weighted according to their frequency in documents indexed by the search engine, e.g., according to their inverse document frequency.
- the system can use the formula:
- the difference score can be calculated by comparing the fingerprint representations. For example, if each fingerprint is represented by multiple bits, each bit having a value of 1 or 0, the difference score can be calculated by taking an exclusive or of two document fingerprint representations, and then summing the resulting bits.
- the weight generator 404 can calculate the difference score by matching individual fingerprints for the two documents using best case matching, and summing the resulting bits of an exclusive or of each matching pair of fingerprints. In some implementations, the weight generator 404 further penalizes the difference score according to a factor derived from any ordering mismatch that results from the best case matching.
- version A of a document is represented by ordered fingerprints F1A, F2A, and F3A
- version B of the document is represented by ordered fingerprints F1B, F2B, and F3B
- the best case matching is F1A matched with F1B, F2A matched with F3B, and F3A matched with F2B.
- the weight generator 404 can calculate the exclusive or of F1A and F1B, the exclusive or of F2A and F3B, and the exclusive or of F3A and F2B. The weight generator 404 can then sum the bits of the resulting exclusive or values. Because the fingerprints were not matched in order, the system can then apply a penalty factor to the difference score.
- the weight generator 404 calculates the appropriate weight for the version-specific quality of result statistics for the version of the document in the model data.
- the appropriate weight can be based on factor scores for one or more factors. These one or more factors can be combined according to a pre-defined function that maps scores for the factors to a corresponding weight.
- the weight can be derived from a polynomial of factor values and constants. The function can be hand-tuned manually, or can be derived, for example, using machine learning techniques.
- Example factors include the difference score, the number of times the document changed subsequent to the time the historical version of the document was first detected, the amount of time the historical version of the document was unchanged, the amount of time subsequent versions of the document were unchanged, and the amount of data that has been collected for subsequent versions of the document. Other factors that are external to the versions of the document can also be used.
- the difference score measures the difference between the reference version of the document and the historical version of the document, as described above. In general, difference scores indicating larger differences should result in smaller weights than difference scores indicating smaller differences.
- the number of times the document changed subsequent to the time the historical version of the document was detected can serve as a proxy for the age of the document or the frequency with which a document is updated. Versions that are older or that are for a document that is updated more frequently since the historical version of the document was detected generally should have lower weights that versions that are newer or for a document that is updated less frequently since the historical version of the document was detected. Therefore, the larger the number of times the document changed since the version was detected, the lower the weight for version-specific quality of result statistics for the document version and the query should be. This can be reflected in the function, for example, by raising a constant weight that is less than one to an exponent equal to the number of times the document changed since the version was created. Alternatively, the overall number of times the document changed can be used instead of the overall number of times the document changed since the version was detected.
- the amount of time subsequent versions of the document went unchanged can serve as a proxy for the quality of data associated with more recent versions of the document.
- the longer the amount of time any subsequent version of the document was unchanged the lower the weight associated with the historical version of the document should be.
- the amount of data that has been collected for subsequent versions of the document can serve as an indicator of whether the data for the historical version will be useful. In general, the more data that has been collected for subsequent versions of the document, the lower the weight for the historical version should be.
- the weight generator 404 can use the difference score itself, or a weight derived from the difference score.
- the weight generator 404 can use a function that takes the difference score as an input and generates a corresponding weight.
- the function can be, for example, a linear function, a quadratic function, a step function, or any other type of function.
- the function can be hand-tuned manually, or can be derived, for example, using machine learning techniques.
- the weighted quality of result statistic generator 406 receives an identification of the document and the query 414 along with the weights 416 for the different versions of the document in the model data 412 .
- the weighted quality of result statistic generator 406 can use various conventional methods to combine the weighted version-specific quality of result statistics for each version of the document to generate a weighted overall quality of result statistic for the query and the document.
- weighted overall quality of result statistic is generated for a query and a document
- data associating the query and the document with the corresponding weighted overall quality of result statistics can be stored, for example, in a database of weighted overall quality of result statistics.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example method 500 for generating a weighted overall quality of result statistic.
- the example method 500 will be described in reference to a system that performs the method 500 .
- the system can be, for example, the quality of result statistic engine 216 described above with reference to FIG. 2 , or another system of one or more computers.
- the system receives quality of result data for a query and multiple versions of a document ( 502 ).
- the quality of result data includes a respective version-specific quality of result statistic for the query with respect to each of the versions of the document.
- the system determines a weighted overall quality of result statistic for the query and the document ( 504 ), for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the system stores data associating the query and the document with the weighted overall quality of result statistic ( 506 ), for example, in the database of weighted overall quality of result statistics described above with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the system further stores data associating the query and the document with a non-weighted overall quality of result statistic for the query and the document.
- the non-weighted overall quality of result statistic can be generated by combining the version-specific quality of result statistics for each version of the document, either without weighting the version-specific quality of result statistics or by weighting the version-specific quality of result statistics by a weight derived from factors other than those derived from the differences between versions of the document. Examples of such factors are described above with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the system penalizes the weighted or non-weighted overall quality of result statistic for a given document and query when the given document does not change very much over time and other documents responsive to the given query, for example, the other documents with the highest overall quality of result statistics, do change over time.
- Change can be measured, for example, as the frequency with which document content changes or the amount of content that changes.
- the amount of content can be measured, for example, by a difference score.
- the system can determine whether the amount of change of the given document, either frequency of change or amount of content is low relative to the amount of change of other documents responsive to the given query.
- the system can penalize the overall or non-weighted quality of result statistic for the given document and the given query, e.g., by reducing the value of the statistic.
- An amount of change is low relative to the amount of change of other documents responsive the query, for example, when it is less than a threshold value computed from the amount of change of the other documents responsive to the query.
- the system receives an indication that the document has changed.
- a search system may periodically crawl the Internet to update documents stored in its index. During the crawl, the search system can determine that the document has changed and send a signal indicating the change to the system.
- the system can update the weighted overall quality of result statistic.
- the system can update the weighted overall quality of result statistic, for example, by re-calculating difference scores between the new version of the document and the versions stored in the model data, and then re-weighting the version-specific quality of result statistics according to the new difference scores.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example technique 600 for determining whether to provide a weighted or a non-weighted overall quality of result statistic to a ranking engine.
- the example technique 600 will be described in reference to a system that performs the technique 600 .
- the system can be, for example, the search engine 204 described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system receives a query and a document responsive to the query ( 602 ).
- the system selects a weighted overall quality of result statistic or a non-weighted overall quality of result statistic for the query and the document ( 604 ).
- the system can make this selection based on one or more factors.
- the system can make the selection by comparing one or more factors to a respective threshold, and selecting the weighted overall quality of result statistic if each threshold is satisfied, and otherwise selecting the non-weighted quality of result statistic.
- the system can combine scores for one or more individual factors into a combined score and select the weighted overall quality of result statistic if the combined score satisfies the threshold and otherwise select the non-weighted quality of result statistic.
- These one or more factors can be combined according to a pre-defined function that maps scores for the factors to a corresponding weight.
- the weight can be derived from a polynomial of factor values and constants. The function can be hand-tuned manually, or can be derived, for example, using machine learning techniques. While the above describes selecting the weighted overall quality of result statistic if one or more thresholds are satisfied, in alternative implementations, the system can select the non-weighted quality of result statistic if the one or more thresholds are satisfied.
- One factor the system can consider is a difference score that represents a degree of difference between a most recently crawled version of the document and the version of the document at the time the weighted overall quality of result statistic was generated. If the versions are different enough, the system uses the non-weighted overall quality of result statistic. This is because the weights used to generate the weighted overall quality of result statistic do not accurately reflect the most recently crawled version of the document.
- the system can determine the difference score between the two versions, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 4 . The system can then determine whether the difference score satisfies a difference threshold. If so, the system does not select the weighted overall quality of result statistic, and instead selects the non-weighted overall quality of result' statistic.
- the system selects the weighted overall quality of result statistic.
- the threshold can be determined empirically, for example, from an analysis of difference scores for versions of documents whose difference is determined to be small enough that the weighted overall quality of result statistic should be selected and versions of documents whose difference is determined to be large enough that the weighted overall quality of result statistic should not be selected.
- Another factor the system can consider is how frequently the content of the documents change. Some documents, for example, the home page of a news website, have frequent turnover in content. If the system determines the turnover frequency satisfies a threshold, the system can use the non-weighted overall quality of result statistic instead of the weighted overall quality of result statistic, for example, because the weighted overall quality of result statistic reflects a single moment in the frequently changing history of the document. Because the document changes frequently, it is unlikely that the current version of the document is the same as the version of the document at the time the weighted overall quality of result statistic was calculated.
- the weighted overall quality of result statistic is likely less accurate than the non-weighted overall quality of result statistic, e.g., because the weights used to calculate the weighted overall quality of result statistic are biased in the wrong direction.
- the system can determine how often the content of the page changes, for example, by determining how often new versions of the document are recorded and also comparing the versions of the document, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 4 , to determine the magnitude of the change between each version.
- the system can consider is whether the content of other documents responsive to the query frequently change.
- the system can identify a top number of documents responsive to the query (e.g., according to a ranking assigned to the documents by the search engine).
- the system can then determine whether the frequency with which those documents change satisfies a threshold. For example, the system can compare the frequency with which each identified document changes to a first threshold.
- the system can then count the number of identified documents that change more frequently than the first threshold and compare that number to a second threshold. If the number exceeds the second threshold, the system can determine that the documents responsive to the query change frequently, and therefore, the non-weighted overall quality of result statistic should be used for documents with respect to the query.
- the categorization can be received from one or more components of the search engine. For example, some queries may be categorized as seeking recent information. If a query is categorized as seeking recent information, the weighted overall quality of result statistic can be used. This is because if a user is seeking recent information, greater weight should be given to versions of the document that are most likely to answer the user's question, i.e., to the most recent versions of the documents.
- queries might be categorized as related to sports, or celebrities, or as having a commercial purpose.
- Each category of query can be associated with data indicating whether the weighted or non-weighted overall quality of result statistic should be used.
- the appropriate overall quality of result statistic can then be identified according to the category of query. For example, some categories, such as celebrities, can be associated with data indicating that the weighted quality of result statistic should be used, because these queries are more likely to be seeking the latest information.
- the system can calculate a new weighted overall quality of result statistic to minimize the impact of data collected before the particular date. For example, if the query is for “Results of Summer Olympics 2008,” the system can determine that data prior to 2008 will not be relevant to the query.
- the system stores weights for each version of the document, calculated as described above, re-weights versions before the particular date to have a zero weight, and re-calculates the weighted overall quality of result statistic as needed.
- the system stores weighted overall quality of result statistics for several dates (for example, in five year increments), and uses the weighted overall quality of result statistic for the closest date.
- the system then provides the selected overall quality of result statistic to a ranking engine that scores documents based at least in part on an overall quality of result statistic ( 606 ).
- the selected overall quality of result statistic 606 can be provided to the ranking engine 210 described above with reference to FIG. 2 .

- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on a computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus.
