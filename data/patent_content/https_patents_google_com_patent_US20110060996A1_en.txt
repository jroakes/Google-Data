Definitions
- This invention relates generally to a method of filtering data received by a mobile device, and more particularly to a filter having content mapped therein that can be configured to throttle data being received from a server so as to limit a number of updates per unit of time.
- Modern portable electronic devices offer a wide array of communication capabilities. Not too long ago, the only practical way to electronically communicate with another person was with a telephone conversation. This is no longer the case due to new advances in technology. For example, modern portable electronic devices like smart phones facilitate many types of asynchronous communication in addition to being able to make traditional telephone calls. Examples of asynchronous communication include the transmission of electronic mail, the delivery of information via websites by “posting,” the delivery of information by text and multimedia messages, and so forth. Asynchronous communication can at times even be more efficient than synchronous communication because two communicating parties need not be available simultaneously.
- Asynchronous communicators are also using the technology to reach more people with a single message.
- Asynchronous communicators are also using the technology to reach more people with a single message.
- Social networking websites, push data feeds, music, photograph, and video sharing websites, and other interactive websites allow a person to broadcast a message to all of their friends or contacts at once.
- Such sites allow a user to “post” various forms of data, such as news, personal or business information, pictures, videos, and songs to a site. The data is then pushed to a list of contacts so that everyone receives the same message.
- These sites allow each contact to stay up-to-date with the poster, who desires to create and maintain interpersonal connections among persons and groups of persons.
- FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a system configured in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 2 illustrates one example of a mobile device configured in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates one method of filtering data received by a mobile device in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 4 illustrates one method of filtering data received from a server in communication with a plurality of content delivery servers for delivery to a mobile device in accordance with embodiments of the invention
- FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of a user interface for a throttle filter configured in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.
- FIGS. 6-8 illustrates embodiments of a mobile device configured in accordance with embodiments of the invention operating in accordance with methods described herein.
- embodiments of the invention described herein may be comprised of one or more conventional processors and unique stored program instructions that control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions of throttling or reducing data delivery as described herein.
- the non-processor circuits may include, but are not limited to, a radio receiver, a radio transmitter, signal drivers, clock circuits, power source circuits, and user input devices. As such, these functions may be interpreted as steps of a method to perform data throttling.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide a solution to this problem by “throttling” back the amount of data that is received.
- “throttle” means to reduce in a strategic and systematic manner such that the reduction is in concert with a user's needs or interests.
- embodiments of the invention incorporate the preferences of a particular user such that notifications, messages, and data of high interest is delivered to a mobile device, while other messages can be retained for delivery to other, higher bandwidth devices.
- Embodiments of the invention thus work to throttle data updates from particular data sources, such as particular servers or applications.
- This throttling can occur as a reduction in quantity, a reduction in the number of notifications per unit of time, or can be based upon other matrices.
- a server which can be referred to as an “aggregation server,” receives data and messages from a plurality of content delivery servers.
- the aggregation server is configured to deliver these messages to a user's communication devices.
- the communication devices may include a mobile device that communicates with the aggregation server across a wide-area network, a computer that communicates through a local-area network and the Internet, and so forth.
- a throttle filter operating on one or more of the devices maps throttle criteria to the various sources of information.
- the throttle filter can be configured manually by the user, or alternatively can be automatically configured by firmware operating in the background.
- one or more keywords that indicate content of interest to the user can then be established and mapped to the sources of data.
- Each keyword or anti-keyword can have associated therewith preference indications that distinguish content of high priority to the user from content of low priority.
- the data of the throttle filter can then be delivered to the aggregation server. Messages of importance to the user can be delivered to some devices, such as mobile devices, while other messages can be delivered to other devices, such as computers.
- the league may push messages from a content delivery server to all of the members.
- the content of the messages may vary from promotional offers for league merchandise to notifications about practices or matches.
- the user is interested in notifications about practice and matches, but is not interested in promotional offers for merchandise.
- the user wishes to know when a match date is changed, but has no interest when a new shirt goes on sale.
- the user has both a mobile device, such a smart phone or personal digital assistant, and another device, such as a computer capable of communicating over the Internet.
- Each device is configured to receive notifications from the content delivery server.
- the user may define one or more keywords or anti-keywords for the league's content server. Further, the user may provide a preference indication for each word. Accordingly, the user may establish “practice” or “match” as keywords. Similarly, the user may establish “discount” or “sale” as anti-keywords.
- the preference indications may be on a sliding scale, such that higher preferences mean more frequent updates for content containing a keyword, while lower preferences indicate less frequent updates. For this particular example, consider the sliding scale to be a scale from one to ten.
- the user may set the preference for the word “match” to a high value, such as a nine.
- the user may set the preference for the word “practice” to a slightly lower value, such as a seven.
- the user may set the preference for the word “sale” to a low value, such as one, while the preference for the word “discount” is a slightly higher value, such as three.
- This data is then sent to either the content server or an aggregation server configured to receive data from a plurality of content servers.
- the server can use this information to reduce the amount of data that is delivered to selected devices.
- the reduction can be accomplished by limiting the number of updates that are transmitted per unit of time. Alternatively, the reduction can be accomplished by sending some messages to one electronic device and other messages to another device.
- all messages from the content server including the word “match” may be updated to the user's mobile device at a normal frequency, while messages including the word “practice” may be updated less frequently.
- “match” messages may be updated as they are pushed, while “practice” messages may be updated only once or twice a day.
- Messages from the content server including the word “discount” may only be updated to the mobile device once or twice per week. Messages including the word “sale” may not be updated to the mobile device at all.
- the user may configure the system such that all messages are sent to a second device, such as the computer. Thus, while the user is on the go messages of importance are delivered to the user's mobile device. Messages of less importance, or perhaps all messages, are then delivered to the user's computer. When the user has more time, the user can sort through the messages on the computer.
- the server 104 can also be referred to a web server, an intermediary web server, an aggregation server, or aggregation service.
- the server 104 can be configured to pull information from content delivery servers 106 , 107 , 108 and make the information available to the user devices. The delivery may be in response to a poll of the server 104 from a user device.

- the factors can include user input 309 , such as when a user manually adds or deletes a keyword or anti-keyword, or manually alters the preference indication associated with one or more keywords or anti-keywords.
- Other factors include monitoring the timeliness until a message is opened 310 , commonly occurring content 311 , or whether a message or notification is opened. It will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that these factors are illustrative only, and that any number of other factors indicating the preferences of a user may be used in addition or in place of the factors shown.
- step 308 includes detecting a commonly occurring content segment found in messages or notifications received by the mobile device ( 102 ). Where the commonly occurring segment is detected, it can be either added to the list of preferred content segments or added to the list of non-preferred content segments. For example, when a commonly occurring content segment appears in messages that are quickly opened or opened and read by the user, it will be added to the list of preferred content segments. Similarly, where the commonly occurring segment appears in messages that are either deleted without opening or are quickly deleted by the user, it will be added to the list of non-preferred content segments.
- throttle filter data is received from the mobile device ( 102 ).
- the throttle filter data can include one or more preferred notification content segments, one or more non-preferred notification content segments, and a preference indication for each content segment that indicates a priority of a corresponding content segment in the throttle data.
- the preference indication can be configured as an adjustable scale.
- a communication module ( 116 ) receives input streams ( 126 , 127 , 128 ) of messages or notifications from the content delivery servers ( 106 , 107 , 108 ).
- the content of each message or notification of the input streams ( 126 , 127 , 128 ) is examined to determine the presence of keywords or other preferred content segments and anti-keywords or other non-preferred content segments.
- the input streams ( 126 , 127 , 128 ) are filtered in accordance with the throttle filter data to obtain the filtered notification subset ( 121 ).
- the messages or notifications of the filtered notification subset ( 121 ) will include only messages from sources identified by the throttle filter data.
- the step 404 of filtering can also include a prioritization.
- step 404 includes a step of sorting the filtered notification subset ( 121 ) in accordance with preference indications in the throttle data to determine higher priority notifications and lower priority notifications.
- step 405 the filtered notification subset ( 121 ) is delivered to the mobile device ( 102 ).
- step 405 can include delivering higher priority notifications before delivering the lower priority notifications.
- Notifications not sent to the mobile device ( 102 ), or optionally a copy of all notifications, can be stored on the server ( 104 ) at step 406 . These stored notifications can then be delivered to another device, such as the computer ( 109 ) of FIG. 1 , at step 407 . This can be done on a push or pull basis.
- FIG. 5 illustrated therein is one embodiment of a throttle filter user interface 500 suitable for presentation on a display 222 of a mobile device ( 102 ) in accordance with embodiments of the invention. While providing one illustration a throttle filter user interface 500 , FIG. 5 also serves to show the function of the user preferences associated with each keyword and anti-keyword as well.
- a plurality of keywords, anti-keywords, and content segments 501 , 502 , 503 , 504 , 505 , 506 , 507 , 508 , 509 , 510 , 511 are mapped to one or more content delivery server types 512 , 513 , 514 , 515 .
- the content segments 501 , 502 , 503 , 504 , 505 , 506 , 507 , 508 , 509 , 510 , 511 are shown being mapped to content delivery server types 512 , 513 , 514 , 515 in the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 5 , they could equally be mapped to specific content delivery servers ( 106 , 107 , 108 ) as described above.
- Each content segment 501 , 502 , 503 , 504 , 505 , 506 , 507 , 508 , 509 , 510 , 511 has associated therewith an adjustable scale 516 , 517 , 518 , 519 , 520 , 521 , 523 , 524 , 525 , 526 , 527 .
- the adjustable scales 516 , 517 , 518 , 519 , 520 , 521 , 523 , 524 , 525 , 526 , 527 are configured in this embodiment ad sliding verniers that can be either manually adjusted by a user or automatically adjusted by modules of the mobile device ( 102 ).
- Each adjustable scale 516 , 517 , 518 , 519 , 520 , 521 , 523 , 524 , 525 , 526 , 527 represents a preference threshold by defining a preference value for its associated content segment.
- the throttle filter user interface 500 thus permits adjustment of priority for each associated content segments.
- each adjustable scale 516 , 517 , 518 , 519 , 520 , 521 , 523 , 524 , 525 , 526 , 527 represents a number of updates per source per unit time.
- the sliding verniers can be set in accordance with a scale 528 that indicates how many updates for a preferred content segment are received in one day.
- vernier 529 is set to a threshold value of “12” such that twelve updates from “Jane” originating from social networking sites will be received by the mobile device ( 102 ) in a given day.
- each adjustable scale 516 , 517 , 518 , 519 , 520 , 521 , 523 , 524 , 525 , 526 , 527 represents a number of occurrences of a content segment that must appear before the notification can be received by the mobile device ( 102 ).
- each adjustable scale 516 , 517 , 518 , 519 , 520 , 521 , 523 , 524 , 525 , 526 , 527 represents a priority threshold against with other notifications are sorted, with only notifications exceeding a priority threshold being sent to the mobile device ( 102 ).
- Other scales suitable for limiting notifications received by the mobile device ( 102 ) will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.
- each content delivery server type 512 , 513 , 514 , 515 also has an adjustable scale 530 , 531 , 532 , 533 associated therewith. Where so configured, a user may adjust a single scale to cause all sub-channels from this content source type to be adjusted up or down as a group. Such a configuration is optional.
- FIG. 5 note that some of the content segments are people. This is because the embodiment of FIG. 5 allows mapping of keywords and anti-keywords not only to content delivery servers, but sources of notifications as well.
- a user may click on a content segment 501 , i.e., “Jane,” to enter keywords and anti-keywords. If Jane is the coach of the tennis team, keywords might include “match” and “practice.”
- Anti-keywords may include words from frequent updates from Jane to which the user has no interest, such as “babysitting” or “yoga.”
- the information represented in the throttle filter user interface 500 can then be transmitted to the server ( 104 ) for filtering as described above.
- the server ( 104 ) can then filter and sort updates so that only a certain number of most user-relevant updates, notifications, or messages are transmitted to the mobile device ( 102 ), with other messages being delivered to a higher-bandwidth device.
- FIGS. 6-8 illustrated therein is one exemplary use case showing the benefits of a throttle filter configured in accordance with embodiments of the invention. It will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that numerous other use cases can exist, and that the one shown in FIGS. 6-8 is used solely as a description of some of the features of embodiments of the invention.
- a mobile device 600 includes a throttle filter. As shown in FIG. 6 , line 601 indicates that forty notifications have been received. One notification has been received from Blue Cow as indicated at line 603 , with two messages being received from the Watch Man as indicated at line 604 .
- a prolific message poster named Harry has caused twenty-four messages to be delivered as is indicated at line 602 . Presume for the moment that the messages from Harry are of less interest to the user of the mobile device 600 than are messages from Blue Cow and the Watch Man. There could be a variety of reasons, such as the fact that the user does not know Harry well. Alternatively, the user may simply not have enough time in the day to read all of Harry's messages.
- an adjustable scale 701 corresponding to Harry 702 is adjusted downward.
- the user may make this adjustment manually after seeing that far too many messages were received from Harry 702 in FIG. 6 .
- an analyzer in the mobile device 600 may automatically adjust the adjustable scale downward after determining that several messages have been deleted without opening, with the commonly occurring element in the messages being the fact that they came from Harry 702 .
- the throttle filter data 703 which includes the adjustment, is then sent to a server 704 .
- Harry generates another forty notifications 801 from a content delivery server 802 . These notifications 801 are transmitted across a network 803 to a server 704 .
- the server 704 filters the notifications 801 in accordance with the throttle filter data ( 703 ) transmitted to the server 704 in FIG. 7 .
- the server analyzes the content of the notifications 801 to determine which are of highest preference or priority to the user of the mobile device 600 . That subset of messages 805 is transmitted to the mobile device 600 across a first network 806 , which in this case is a wide area wireless cellular network.
- the non-preferred or lower priority subset of messages 807 is transmitted to another electronic device 809 across another network 808 .
- the mobile device 600 has therefore received less messages with the throttle filter than it would have without the throttle filter.
- the messages have been reduced in accordance with preferences of the user.

- 1. Technical Field
- This invention relates generally to a method of filtering data received by a mobile device, and more particularly to a filter having content mapped therein that can be configured to throttle data being received from a server so as to limit a number of updates per unit of time.
- 2. Background Art
- Modern portable electronic devices offer a wide array of communication capabilities. Not too long ago, the only practical way to electronically communicate with another person was with a telephone conversation. This is no longer the case due to new advances in technology. For example, modern portable electronic devices like smart phones facilitate many types of asynchronous communication in addition to being able to make traditional telephone calls. Examples of asynchronous communication include the transmission of electronic mail, the delivery of information via websites by “posting,” the delivery of information by text and multimedia messages, and so forth. Asynchronous communication can at times even be more efficient than synchronous communication because two communicating parties need not be available simultaneously.
- As the technology for communicating asynchronously has advanced, so too has the number of people using this technology to communicate. Asynchronous communicators are also using the technology to reach more people with a single message. When a person wants to communicate with many friends, it is no longer necessary for the person to send, for example, ten asynchronous messages to ten recipients. Social networking websites, push data feeds, music, photograph, and video sharing websites, and other interactive websites allow a person to broadcast a message to all of their friends or contacts at once. Such sites allow a user to “post” various forms of data, such as news, personal or business information, pictures, videos, and songs to a site. The data is then pushed to a list of contacts so that everyone receives the same message. These sites allow each contact to stay up-to-date with the poster, who desires to create and maintain interpersonal connections among persons and groups of persons.
- One issue that can result from this communication platform is the resulting “blizzard” of data. When a person has many contacts, all of whom post messages regularly, the resulting number of messages can be quite large. This large number of messages can clog wireless network bandwidth and resources. Additionally, many of the messages coming from contacts may be trivial or of no interest to the recipient, and therefore may become annoying.
- There is thus a need to reduce the amount of push data that is received in a portable electronic device.

FIGS. 6-8 illustrates embodiments of a mobile device configured in accordance with embodiments of the invention operating in accordance with methods described herein. - Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.
- Before describing in detail embodiments that are in accordance with the present invention, it should be observed that the embodiments reside primarily in combinations of method steps and apparatus components related to throttling data received by a mobile device. Accordingly, the apparatus components and method steps have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.
- It will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention described herein may be comprised of one or more conventional processors and unique stored program instructions that control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions of throttling or reducing data delivery as described herein. The non-processor circuits may include, but are not limited to, a radio receiver, a radio transmitter, signal drivers, clock circuits, power source circuits, and user input devices. As such, these functions may be interpreted as steps of a method to perform data throttling. Alternatively, some or all functions could be implemented by a state machine that has no stored program instructions, or in one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), in which each function or some combinations of certain of the functions are implemented as custom logic. Of course, a combination of the two approaches could be used. Further, it is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs and ICs with minimal experimentation.
- Embodiments of the invention are now described in detail. Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. As used in the description herein and throughout the claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise: the meaning of “a,” “an,” and “the” includes plural reference, the meaning of “in” includes “in” and “on.” Relational terms such as first and second, top and bottom, and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. Also, reference designators shown herein in parenthesis indicate components shown in a figure other than the one in discussion. For example, talking about a device (10) while discussing figure A would refer to an element, 10, shown in figure other than figure A.
- As noted above, problems can arise when too much content is being delivered to a mobile device. The amount of data can congest limited wireless network communication resources. More importantly, messages and other data that are of little interest to the user can be annoying to a user. Embodiments of the present invention provide a solution to this problem by “throttling” back the amount of data that is received. As used herein, “throttle” means to reduce in a strategic and systematic manner such that the reduction is in concert with a user's needs or interests. To this end, embodiments of the invention incorporate the preferences of a particular user such that notifications, messages, and data of high interest is delivered to a mobile device, while other messages can be retained for delivery to other, higher bandwidth devices. Embodiments of the invention thus work to throttle data updates from particular data sources, such as particular servers or applications. This throttling can occur as a reduction in quantity, a reduction in the number of notifications per unit of time, or can be based upon other matrices.
- In one embodiment a server, which can be referred to as an “aggregation server,” receives data and messages from a plurality of content delivery servers. The aggregation server is configured to deliver these messages to a user's communication devices. Illustrating by example, the communication devices may include a mobile device that communicates with the aggregation server across a wide-area network, a computer that communicates through a local-area network and the Internet, and so forth.
- A throttle filter operating on one or more of the devices maps throttle criteria to the various sources of information. The throttle filter can be configured manually by the user, or alternatively can be automatically configured by firmware operating in the background.
- In one embodiment, one or more keywords that indicate content of interest to the user, and one or more “anti-keywords” that indicate content that does not interest the user, can then be established and mapped to the sources of data. Each keyword or anti-keyword can have associated therewith preference indications that distinguish content of high priority to the user from content of low priority. The data of the throttle filter can then be delivered to the aggregation server. Messages of importance to the user can be delivered to some devices, such as mobile devices, while other messages can be delivered to other devices, such as computers.
- Illustrating with a simple example, suppose a user plays tennis in a recreational league. The league may push messages from a content delivery server to all of the members. The content of the messages may vary from promotional offers for league merchandise to notifications about practices or matches.
- Suppose that the user is interested in notifications about practice and matches, but is not interested in promotional offers for merchandise. The user wishes to know when a match date is changed, but has no interest when a new shirt goes on sale. Suppose also that the user has both a mobile device, such a smart phone or personal digital assistant, and another device, such as a computer capable of communicating over the Internet. Each device is configured to receive notifications from the content delivery server.
- In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the user may define one or more keywords or anti-keywords for the league's content server. Further, the user may provide a preference indication for each word. Accordingly, the user may establish “practice” or “match” as keywords. Similarly, the user may establish “discount” or “sale” as anti-keywords. The preference indications may be on a sliding scale, such that higher preferences mean more frequent updates for content containing a keyword, while lower preferences indicate less frequent updates. For this particular example, consider the sliding scale to be a scale from one to ten.
- In this exemplary use case, presume the user is very interested in making all of the matches. The user wants to make practices, but would be less concerned about missing a practice than a match. Further, the user really has no interest in new merchandise offers. However, the user would be mildly interested in a deep discount on equipment.
- Accordingly, the user may set the preference for the word “match” to a high value, such as a nine. The user may set the preference for the word “practice” to a slightly lower value, such as a seven. The user may set the preference for the word “sale” to a low value, such as one, while the preference for the word “discount” is a slightly higher value, such as three.
- This data is then sent to either the content server or an aggregation server configured to receive data from a plurality of content servers. The server can use this information to reduce the amount of data that is delivered to selected devices. The reduction can be accomplished by limiting the number of updates that are transmitted per unit of time. Alternatively, the reduction can be accomplished by sending some messages to one electronic device and other messages to another device.
- In this illustrative example, all messages from the content server including the word “match” may be updated to the user's mobile device at a normal frequency, while messages including the word “practice” may be updated less frequently. For instance, “match” messages may be updated as they are pushed, while “practice” messages may be updated only once or twice a day.
- Messages from the content server including the word “discount” may only be updated to the mobile device once or twice per week. Messages including the word “sale” may not be updated to the mobile device at all. To ensure that no messages are lost, the user may configure the system such that all messages are sent to a second device, such as the computer. Thus, while the user is on the go messages of importance are delivered to the user's mobile device. Messages of less importance, or perhaps all messages, are then delivered to the user's computer. When the user has more time, the user can sort through the messages on the computer.
- Turning to
FIG. 1 , illustrated therein is a block diagram of anillustrative system 100 for filtering data in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Theserver 104 can also be referred to a web server, an intermediary web server, an aggregation server, or aggregation service. Theserver 104 can be configured to pull information fromcontent delivery servers server 104 from a user device. - Different user devices communicate with a
server 104. In the illustrative embodiment ofFIG. 1 , the user devices include amobile device 102, shown as a smart phone, and a computer 109. The user devices, in one embodiment, can also push data tocontent delivery servers server 104. Theserver 104 accesses the content that thecontent delivery servers network 111 according to selected application program interfaces associated with each particular content provider. Theserver 104 delivers the information according to settings for each user device so as to make the content available to the user device in an easily processed format. - Some devices communicate through higher bandwidth channels than others. For example the
mobile device 102 may communicate through a wide-area network such ascellular network 110, while the computer 109 communicates via an alternate network, such as local-area network 103 andnetwork 105. Data transmission through thecellular network 110 may be limited by bandwidth or transmission speed issues, or a service provider may charge the user for usage or data volume on thecellular network 110. By contrast, the local-area network may have larger bandwidths, faster transmission speeds, and lower costs. Accordingly, the user may desire that only higher priority information be delivered from theserver 104 to themobile device 102. Other or all data can then be transmitted to the computer 109. - While a smart phone is used as an illustrative
mobile device 102, it will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that embodiments of the invention are not so limited.Mobile device 102 can be other types of communication devices operated by users or other entities, such as netbooks, personal digital assistants, or other computers. The same is true of the computer 109. Any number of devices can be substituted for the computer 109 without departing from the spirit, scope, or operation of thesystem 100. For example, a message board, accessible by the user, can be substituted for the computer 109 such that some or all messages are stored on the message board. Although two user devices, i.e.,mobile device 102 and computer 109, are shown inFIG. 1 , any arbitrary number of devices can be in communication with theserver 104. - In the illustrative embodiment of
FIG. 1 , theserver 104 is configured as an aggregation server that receives messages and data from threecontent delivery servers content delivery servers FIG. 1 , in other embodiments any arbitrary number of content provider websites, or content sources can be in communication with theserver 104. Thesecontent delivery servers server 104 across anetwork 111, such as the Internet. - The
content delivery servers content delivery servers server 104. In this sense,server 104 is an “aggregation” server in that it is configured to deliver messages and data from a plurality ofcontent delivery servers mobile device 102 and computer 109. Examples ofsuch servers 104 are described in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. Application No. 61/214,301, filed Sep. 10, 1029, entitled “Method and System for Intermediating Content Provider Website and Mobile Device,” which is incorporated herein by reference. - Note that alternative communication links are provided in addition to those that pass directly through the
server 104. For example, any arbitrary number of mobile devices can be in direct communication with any arbitrary number of content provider websites in addition to being in communication with theserver 104.FIG. 1 is illustratively representative of any of a variety of systems employing any arbitrary number of mobile devices and any arbitrary number of content provider websites that are in communication with one another either indirectly via a server interface or directly with one another. The various communication links can be part of a single network or multiple networks, and each link can include one or more wired and/or wireless communication pathways, for example, landline (e.g., fiber optic, copper) wiring, microwave communication, radio channel, wireless path, intranet, internet, and/or World Wide Web communication pathways (which themselves can employ numerous intermediary hardware and/or software devices including, for example, numerous routers, etc.). In addition, a variety of communication protocols and methodologies can be used to conduct the communications via the communication links, including for example, transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP), extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP), file transfer protocol (FTP), etc. - In one embodiment,
server 104 is configured to serve as an intermediary between the user devices and thecontent delivery servers communication module 116, operating within theserver 104, is configured to obtain information from thecontent delivery servers network 111. In one embodiment, thecommunication module 116 processes the information to identify new content. Where new content is identified, theserver 104 generates notifications of the new content for delivery to the user devices. Adata transmission module 118 is configured to deliver the information or notifications to the user devices. Accordingly, various types of communications between the user devices andcontent delivery servers server 104. - The communications, messages, and data can include, for example, communications involving the uploading and downloading of files such as photos, music, videos, text entries, and so forth. The communications can further include blog postings, and messages, such as text messages, multimedia messages, and instant messages. The
content delivery servers - In one embodiment, a throttle filter is established on one of the user devices to reduce the amount of data received by one or more user devices in a systematic manner. A
processing module 115 is configured to filter data in accordance with throttle filter data received from a user device, such that thedata transmission module 118 delivers data to a first user device, e.g.,mobile device 102, in accordance with a first set of rules, while other or all data is delivered to a second user device, e.g., computer 109, in accordance with a second set of rules. - For example, a user may define one or more keywords or anti-keywords in a throttle filter on
mobile device 102. (This process can also occur automatically without user input as will be described below.) The one or more keywords or anti-keywords can optionally be mapped to each of thecontent delivery servers content delivery servers FIG. 5 . - In this illustrative embodiment, a
data throttle manager 114 operating in theserver 104 receives the throttle filter data frommobile device 102. Each keyword represents a preferred notification segment that can be contained in notifications coming from thecontent delivery servers processing module 115 then filters, with the assistance of one or more controllers and executable instructions stored in a memory, the input streams 126,127,128 received from thecontent delivery servers data transmission module 118 can then deliver a filterednotification subset 121, which represents a preferred information subset of the input streams 126,127,128, to a first user device, such asmobile device 102. Other non-preferred or allnotifications 122 can be delivered to a second user device, such as computer 109. - Thresholds can be established as well. For example, in one embodiment, the preferred information subset can be configured to include content having more keyword occurrences than a predefined keyword threshold. Using the tennis example from above, a keyword threshold may be set such that a keyword must appear twice in a notification—such as in the subject line and body—before being deliverable to the
mobile device 102. Similarly, anti-keyword thresholds can be established such that only messages having fewer anti-keyword occurrences than a predefined anti-keyword threshold are delivered to themobile device 102. - For example, in one embodiment notifications containing preferred notification segments are delivered to
mobile device 102, while those containing non-preferred notifications are not. In another embodiment, notifications containing preferred notification segments are delivered tomobile device 102 on a more frequent basis than those containing non-preferred notifications. Other or allnotifications 122 can be delivered to a second user device, such as computer 109. Thus, higher priority notifications are delivered to themobile device 102, while lower priority notifications are delivered to the computer 109. Continuing with the tennis example from above, notifications about matches would be delivered to themobile device 102, while sale notifications would only be delivered to the computer 109. - Turning now to
FIG. 2 , illustrated therein is onemobile device 102 configured to reduce received data and notifications in accordance with embodiments of the invention.FIG. 2 illustrates both the device itself and a block diagram illustrating example internal components. As shown inFIG. 2 , the exemplary internal components can include one or morewireless transceivers 202, aprocessor 204, which can be a microprocessor, microcomputer, application-specific integrated circuit, and so forth, and amemory 206. - One or
more output devices 208 and one or more input devices 210 are configured as a user interface. For example, in some embodiments a user interface includes one ormore output devices 208, such as a display, and one or more input devices 210, such as a keypad or touch screen. The internal components can further include a component interface 212 to provide a direct connection to auxiliary components or accessories for additional or enhanced functionality and apower supply 214, such as a battery, for providing power to the other internal components while enabling themobile device 102 to be portable. All of the internal components can be coupled to one another, and in communication with one another, by way of one or moreinternal communication links 232, such as an internal bus. - The
wireless transceivers 202 utilize wireless technologies for communication, which can include for example, but are not limited to, cellular-based communication technologies such as analog communications (using AMPS), digital communications (using CDMA, TDMA, GSM, iDEN, GPRS, EDGE, etc.), and next generation communications (using UMTS, WCDMA, LTE, IEEE 802.16, etc.) or variants thereof, or peer-to-peer or ad hoc communication technologies such as HomeRF (radio frequency), Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11(a, b, g or n), or other wireless communication technologies such as infrared technology. In one embodiment, thewireless transceivers 202 include a wide area network transceiver, such as a cellular transceiver, and a wireless local area network transceiver. In other embodiments, only one of these types of wireless transceivers (and possibly neither of these types of wireless transceivers, and/or other types of wireless transceivers) is present. By virtue of the use of thewireless transceivers 202, themobile device 102 is capable of communicating either or both with the server (104) and one or more content delivery servers (106,107,108). - Example operation of the
wireless transceivers 202 in conjunction with others of the internal components of themobile device 102 can take a variety of forms and can include, for example, operation in which, upon reception of wireless signals, the internal components detect communication signals and thewireless transceiver 202 demodulates the communication signals to recover incoming information, such as voice and/or data, transmitted by the wireless signals. After receiving the incoming information from thewireless transceiver 202, theprocessor 204 formats the incoming information for the one ormore output devices 208. Likewise, for transmission of wireless signals, theprocessor 204 formats outgoing information, which may or may not be activated by the input devices 210, and conveys the outgoing information to one or more of thewireless transceivers 202 for modulation to communication signals. The wireless transceiver(s) 202 convey the modulated signals by way of wireless and (possibly wired as well) communication links to other devices. - Depending upon the embodiment, the input and
output devices 208, 210 of the internal components can include a variety of visual, audio and/or mechanical outputs. For example, theoutput devices 208 can include one or morevisual output devices 216 such as a liquid crystal display and light emitting diode indicator, one or moreaudio output devices 218 such as a speaker, alarm and/or buzzer, and/or one or moremechanical output devices 220 such as a vibrating mechanism. Likewise, by example, the input devices 210 can include one or morevisual input devices 222 such as an optical sensor, e.g., a camera, one or more audio input devices 224 such as a microphone, and one or moremechanical input devices 226 such as a flip sensor, keyboard, keypad, selection button, navigation cluster, touch pad, touchscreen, capacitive sensor, motion sensor, and switch. Actions that can actuate one or more of the input devices 210 can include not only the physical pressing/actuation of buttons or other actuators, but can also include, for example, opening the mobile device, unlocking the device, moving the device to actuate a motion, moving the device to actuate a location positioning system, and operating the device. - The
memory 206 can encompass one or more memory devices of any of a variety of forms, such as read-only memory, random access memory, static random access memory, dynamic random access memory, and so forth. Theprocessor 204 can use thememory 206 to store and retrieve data. The data that is stored by thememory 206 can include, but need not be limited to, operating systems, applications, and informational data. Each operating system includes executable code that controls basic functions of the communication device, such as interaction among the various components included among the internal components, communication with external devices via thewireless transceivers 202 and/or the component interface 212, and storage and retrieval of applications and data, to and from thememory 206. Each application includes executable code that utilizes an operating system to provide more specific functionality for the communication devices, such as file system service and handling of protected and unprotected data stored in thememory 206. Informational data is non-executable code or information that can be referenced and/or manipulated by an operating system or application for performing functions of the communication device. - The internal components of the
mobile device 102 also can include one ormore modules 228 that are configured to be operable with theprocessor 204. Thesemodules 228, which can be configured for the establishment of the throttle filter, can be configured as sets of instructions stored in thememory 206 that are usable by theprocessor 204 to execute a method to provide reduced data delivery to themobile device 102 as described herein. Alternatively, themodules 228 could be configured in hardware, such as through programmable logic. - A data
throttle establishment module 240 can be configured to establish a throttle filter in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The throttle filter is configured to reduce the quantity of notifications or the frequency of notifications that are delivered to themobile device 102 in a strategic manner. This is accomplished through the use of keywords, which represent preferred content segments of notifications, and anti-keywords that represent non-preferred content notification segments. - As noted above, the data throttle
establishment module 240 can establish the data throttle by receiving keywords, or preferences, and anti-keywords, or non-preferences, from user input. For example, a user can input keywords and anti-keywords through themechanical input 226. - Alternatively, the data throttle
establishment module 240 can automatically establish the data throttle. For example, ananalyzer 241 that is operable with the data throttleestablishment module 240 can configured to monitor data or notifications opened on themobile device 102 to establish a throttle filter as a background application. Where preference indicators are included with each keyword or anti-keyword, theanalyzer 241 can be configured to further alter the throttle filter data set based upon identified segments occurring in the notifications opened on themobile device 102. - Illustrating by way of example, in one embodiment, the
analyzer 241 can be configured to detect commonly occurring content segments appearing in messages or notifications opened by the user on themobile device 102. Where preference indications are associated with the keywords and anti-keywords in the throttle filter, the analyzer can be configured to adjust the preference value in accordance with usage of notifications containing the commonly occurring content segment. - In another embodiment, the
analyzer 241 can be configured to determine an amount of time between receipt and opening or other usage of each message or notification. Theanalyzer 241 can then search for commonly occurring content segments appearing in messages opened quickly and associate those commonly occurring segments as preferences or keywords. Alternatively, theanalyzer 241 can be configured to adjust preference values for commonly occurring segments in quickly opened messages to increase the preference of these commonly occurring segments. - Similarly, the analyzer can search for commonly occurring content segments appearing in messages that are deleted without opening, and can associate those commonly occurring segments as non-preferred segments or anti-keywords. Alternatively, the
analyzer 241 can be configured to adjust preference values for commonly occurring segments in quickly opened messages to reduce the preference of these commonly occurring segments. This will become clearer in the discussion of the use cases ofFIGS. 6-8 . - Turning now to
FIG. 3 , illustrated therein is amethod 300, executable within the mobile device (102) for filtering the amount of data received by the mobile device (102) in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Atstep 301, a throttle filter is established. As noted above, the establishment can be automatic 302 or viauser input 303. For example, the user can define atstep 304 keywords or preferred content segments for various channels of data or notifications. Alternatively, an analyzer (241) of the mobile device (102) can examine criteria of data or notifications to automatically (302) define atstep 304 the keywords or anti-keywords and map them to the channels of data or notifications. Criteria used by the analyzer can include which messages or notifications are opened, which messages or notifications are deleted without opening, how fast a message or notification is opened, read or deleted, and so forth. Regardless of the method of establishment, the keywords comprise preferred content segments that indicate content of key interest to the user, while anti-keywords comprise non-preferred content segments that indicate content that is of little or no interest to the user. - At
optional step 305, one or more preference thresholds can be associated with each keyword or anti-keyword. In one embodiment, the preference thresholds comprise a plurality of adjustable scales. The adjustable scales can be adjusted by the user or may be automatically adjusted by the analyzer (241) of the mobile device (102). Each adjustable scale can represent a preference threshold for each keyword or anti-keyword. Examples of the adjustable scales will be given in more detail in the description ofFIG. 5 . - At
step 306, the throttle filter data is transmitted to a server (104). As noted above, the server (104), upon receiving the throttle filter data, is configured to filter an input stream (126,127,128) of notifications from a plurality of content delivery servers (106,107,108) in accordance with the throttle filter data to obtain a filtered notification subset, which is a reduced number of notifications. Atstep 307, the mobile device (102) receives the reduced number of notifications in accordance with the throttle filter data. Said differently, atstep 307 the mobile device (102) receives a reduced quantity of notifications from the server (104), with each notification of the reduced quantity of notifications being selected by examining content in the quantity of notifications from the input stream (126,127,128) in accordance with the parameters associated with the keywords and anti-keywords. - In one embodiment, it is beneficial to keep the throttle filter active. Using the tennis example above, the user may quit the tennis team and take up golf. Accordingly, the keywords, anti-keywords, and where used, the adjustable scales associated with the key-words and anti-keywords may change. The adjustment of these parameters occurs at
step 308. - Specifically, at
step 308 themethod 300 includes adjusting parameters associated with the at least one preferred content segment and the at least one non-preferred content segment by monitoring usage of received notifications. In one embodiment, the parameters are adjusted when the analyzer (241) monitors the usage of received notifications. A variety of factors can be monitored, some of which have been mentioned above. As shown inFIG. 3 , the factors can includeuser input 309, such as when a user manually adds or deletes a keyword or anti-keyword, or manually alters the preference indication associated with one or more keywords or anti-keywords. Other factors include monitoring the timeliness until a message is opened 310, commonly occurringcontent 311, or whether a message or notification is opened. It will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that these factors are illustrative only, and that any number of other factors indicating the preferences of a user may be used in addition or in place of the factors shown. - In one embodiment,
step 308 includes detecting a commonly occurring content segment found in messages or notifications received by the mobile device (102). Where the commonly occurring segment is detected, it can be either added to the list of preferred content segments or added to the list of non-preferred content segments. For example, when a commonly occurring content segment appears in messages that are quickly opened or opened and read by the user, it will be added to the list of preferred content segments. Similarly, where the commonly occurring segment appears in messages that are either deleted without opening or are quickly deleted by the user, it will be added to the list of non-preferred content segments. - Turning now to
FIG. 4 , illustrated therein is onemethod 400 suitable for execution by a server (104) for filtering data for delivery to a mobile device (102) in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Atstep 401, throttle filter data is received from the mobile device (102). As described above, the throttle filter data can include one or more preferred notification content segments, one or more non-preferred notification content segments, and a preference indication for each content segment that indicates a priority of a corresponding content segment in the throttle data. The preference indication can be configured as an adjustable scale. - At
step 402, a communication module (116) receives input streams (126,127,128) of messages or notifications from the content delivery servers (106,107,108). Atstep 403, the content of each message or notification of the input streams (126,127,128) is examined to determine the presence of keywords or other preferred content segments and anti-keywords or other non-preferred content segments. - At
step 404, the input streams (126,127,128) are filtered in accordance with the throttle filter data to obtain the filtered notification subset (121). Recall from above that keywords and anti-keywords can be mapped to predefined content delivery servers. Accordingly, the messages or notifications of the filtered notification subset (121), in one embodiment, will include only messages from sources identified by the throttle filter data. Thestep 404 of filtering can also include a prioritization. For example, in oneembodiment step 404 includes a step of sorting the filtered notification subset (121) in accordance with preference indications in the throttle data to determine higher priority notifications and lower priority notifications. - At
step 405, the filtered notification subset (121) is delivered to the mobile device (102). Wherestep 404 included a sorting step, step 405 can include delivering higher priority notifications before delivering the lower priority notifications. Notifications not sent to the mobile device (102), or optionally a copy of all notifications, can be stored on the server (104) atstep 406. These stored notifications can then be delivered to another device, such as the computer (109) ofFIG. 1 , atstep 407. This can be done on a push or pull basis. - Turning now to
FIG. 5 , illustrated therein is one embodiment of a throttlefilter user interface 500 suitable for presentation on adisplay 222 of a mobile device (102) in accordance with embodiments of the invention. While providing one illustration a throttlefilter user interface 500,FIG. 5 also serves to show the function of the user preferences associated with each keyword and anti-keyword as well. - In the illustrative throttle
filter user interface 500, a plurality of keywords, anti-keywords, andcontent segments delivery server types content segments delivery server types FIG. 5 , they could equally be mapped to specific content delivery servers (106,107,108) as described above. - Each
content segment adjustable scale adjustable scales adjustable scale filter user interface 500 thus permits adjustment of priority for each associated content segments. - In one embodiment, each
adjustable scale scale 528 that indicates how many updates for a preferred content segment are received in one day. Usingcontent segment 501 as an example,vernier 529 is set to a threshold value of “12” such that twelve updates from “Jane” originating from social networking sites will be received by the mobile device (102) in a given day. - In another embodiment, each
adjustable scale adjustable scale - In the illustrative embodiment of
FIG. 5 , each contentdelivery server type adjustable scale - In the illustrative embodiment of
FIG. 5 , note that some of the content segments are people. This is because the embodiment ofFIG. 5 allows mapping of keywords and anti-keywords not only to content delivery servers, but sources of notifications as well. For example, where thedisplay 222 ofFIG. 5 is configured as a touch-sensitive display, a user may click on acontent segment 501, i.e., “Jane,” to enter keywords and anti-keywords. If Jane is the coach of the tennis team, keywords might include “match” and “practice.” Anti-keywords may include words from frequent updates from Jane to which the user has no interest, such as “babysitting” or “yoga.” - The information represented in the throttle
filter user interface 500 can then be transmitted to the server (104) for filtering as described above. The server (104) can then filter and sort updates so that only a certain number of most user-relevant updates, notifications, or messages are transmitted to the mobile device (102), with other messages being delivered to a higher-bandwidth device. - Turning now to
FIGS. 6-8 , illustrated therein is one exemplary use case showing the benefits of a throttle filter configured in accordance with embodiments of the invention. It will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that numerous other use cases can exist, and that the one shown inFIGS. 6-8 is used solely as a description of some of the features of embodiments of the invention. - Beginning with
FIG. 6 , amobile device 600 includes a throttle filter. As shown inFIG. 6 ,line 601 indicates that forty notifications have been received. One notification has been received from Blue Cow as indicated atline 603, with two messages being received from the Watch Man as indicated atline 604. - A prolific message poster named Harry has caused twenty-four messages to be delivered as is indicated at
line 602. Presume for the moment that the messages from Harry are of less interest to the user of themobile device 600 than are messages from Blue Cow and the Watch Man. There could be a variety of reasons, such as the fact that the user does not know Harry well. Alternatively, the user may simply not have enough time in the day to read all of Harry's messages. - Consequently, as shown in
FIG. 7 , anadjustable scale 701 corresponding toHarry 702 is adjusted downward. As noted above, the user may make this adjustment manually after seeing that far too many messages were received fromHarry 702 inFIG. 6 . Alternatively, an analyzer in themobile device 600 may automatically adjust the adjustable scale downward after determining that several messages have been deleted without opening, with the commonly occurring element in the messages being the fact that they came fromHarry 702. Thethrottle filter data 703, which includes the adjustment, is then sent to aserver 704. - Now, as shown in
FIG. 8 , Harry generates another fortynotifications 801 from acontent delivery server 802. Thesenotifications 801 are transmitted across anetwork 803 to aserver 704. Theserver 704 then filters thenotifications 801 in accordance with the throttle filter data (703) transmitted to theserver 704 inFIG. 7 . As the preference value corresponding to Harry was shifted down inFIG. 7 , the server analyzes the content of thenotifications 801 to determine which are of highest preference or priority to the user of themobile device 600. That subset ofmessages 805 is transmitted to themobile device 600 across afirst network 806, which in this case is a wide area wireless cellular network. The non-preferred or lower priority subset ofmessages 807 is transmitted to anotherelectronic device 809 across anothernetwork 808. Themobile device 600 has therefore received less messages with the throttle filter than it would have without the throttle filter. The messages have been reduced in accordance with preferences of the user. - In the foregoing specification, specific embodiments of the present invention have been described. However, one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims below. Thus, while preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is clear that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. Accordingly, the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of present invention. The benefits, advantages, solutions to problems, and any element(s) that may cause any benefit, advantage, or solution to occur or become more pronounced are not to be construed as a critical, required, or essential features or elements of any or all the claims.
