In addition, the particular category of the new issue of playlist, the wireless station of recommendation and the recommendation such as playing recently/follow can have relevant that can show in landing page 201, from the maximum number quantitative limitation of the media item of each in these media categories. For each part 202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210 of landing page 201, it is possible to based on the indicating probability of each in media categories, select media categories from classification set. Such as, as shown in table 1, for each part 202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210 of landing page 201, there is 60% probability is the special edition classification play/buy recently, 10% probability will be selected to be playlist classifications selection play recently/follow, 10% probability to select the wireless station's classification play recently, 10% probability to select the wireless station's classification recommended, and 10% probability recommends newly to issue classification by selection. If being the part selection media categories of landing page 201, the selected media item in media categories can be the shown media item in this part of landing page 201. Each media categories can comprise multiple media item. As shown in Table 1, in the special edition play recently/buy and song classification, can there be 50 media items (such as 50 special edition/songs), play and the playlist classification followed has 5 media items (such as 5 playlists), the wireless station's classification play recently has 2 media items (such as 2 wireless stations), wireless station's classification has 8 media items (such as 8 wireless stations) and is recommending new issue in classification to have 25 media items (such as recommending recently, newly issue for 25, such as song/special edition).
According to realization, for each part 202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210 of landing page, it is possible to based on the indicating probability of each media categories, select media categories from media categories set. For each part 202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210, it is possible to select media categories from media categories set, select the media categories of other parts for landing page unrelated with from it. Specifically, each of the part 202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210 of landing page has the identical possibility selecting from 5 media categories, namely selects 60% probability of the special edition classification play/buy recently, selects 10% probability of the playlist classification play recently/follow, selects 10% probability of the wireless station's classification play recently, selects 10% probability of the wireless station's classification recommended and select to recommend new 10% probability issuing classification.
As shown in Figure 2, for first part 202, it is possible to select media categories from 5 media categories of the special edition play recently/buy and wireless station's classification of song, the playlist play recently/follow, the wireless station play recently and recommendation. Media categories can be selected to recommend new issue based on 10% indicating probability. As a result, it is possible to select from recommending the media item in new 25 media items issued in classification. Media item can be selected randomly from 25 media items. As an alternative, it is possible to add to based on this media item and recommend new classification of issuing to have how close, rank 25 media items in lists so that the media item added recently is first in the list. In this case, it is possible to be displayed in the first media item recommending to list in new issue classification in part 202. As shown, it is possible to show in the part 202 of landing page 201 and recommend new issue song PartyChick.
As another example, for part 201, it is possible to select special edition that media categories plays recently/buy and song based on 60% indicating probability. Therefore, it is possible to select the media item from the special edition play recently/buy and song classification. As above, described in table 1, can there be 50 special edition/songs in the special edition play recently/buy and song classification. As shown in 210, it is possible to select special edition NoNewGuys from 50 special edition/songs this classification and can show. As mentioned above, it is necessary, display media project can comprise the content showing and being associated with media item. As shown in 210, it is possible to show special edition NoNewGuys by display special edition artistic illustration and the action items starting to play this special edition can be comprised.
In some cases, selected first category can be identical with the 2nd selected classification. Such as, it is possible to for the part 203 of landing page selects the playlist classification of nearest broadcasting/follow. Therefore, it is possible to from 5 playlists of the playlist classification play recently/follow, select the first playlist, such as Workout playlist at random, and may be displayed in part 203. It can be the playlist classification that the part 204 of landing page is selected to play/follow recently again. Therefore, it is possible to random selection the 2nd playlist, such as SaturdayNight playlist from 4 playlists of the residue the playlist classification play recently/follow (not comprising the Workout playlist of previously display). Again, the playlist of nearest broadcasting/follow can be selected for part 206, and the 3rd playlist can be selected randomly from remaining 3 playlists (not comprising Workout playlist and the SaturdayNight playlist of previously display), such as Summer playlist, and be displayed in part 206.
As mentioned above, it is necessary, can based on recency, such as this media item is added to media categories to be had how close, in lists the media item in rank media categories so that the media item added recently is the first media item etc. in list. According to realization, for the Part III of landing page, it is possible to based on the indicating probability of first category, from classification set, select first category. As a result, it is possible to from more than first media item of first category, select the media item shown by the 3rd so that after the media item shown by first in the list of more than first media item, list the media item shown by the 3rd.In conjunction with above-mentioned example, if for the part 203 of landing page selects the playlist classification of nearest broadcasting/follow, it is possible to be displayed in the portion the playlist classification of nearest broadcasting/follow playlist list in the first playlist (such as Workout playlist). If being the playlist classification that another part 204 of landing page is selected to play/follow recently again, such as, the 2nd playlist (SaturdayNight playlist) in the list of such other playlist can be shown in this another part. In this case, it is possible to more than once select a classification and to such other each follow-up selection, the media item of follow-up display can in such other list of media items after the media item of front display.
In some cases, the selection of specific media categories for part can not cause the media item from selected classification to show in the portion. According to realization, for the second section of landing page, it is possible to based on the indicating probability for the first media categories, from media categories set, select the first media categories. Each of the media item in more than first media item previously having shown in the first media categories can be determined. Previously each media item in more than first media item has been shown, it is possible to from media categories set, select the 2nd media categories in response to determining. Therefore, it is possible to from the 2nd many media items of the 2nd classification, select the media item shown by the 2nd. Such as, as shown in table 1, the wireless station's classification play recently can comprise 2 media items, wireless station Wings and LuckyTunes such as play recently. As shown in Figure 2, it is possible to for part 205 selects wireless station's classification of broadcasting recently. As a result, it is possible to from the wireless station that 2 this classification play recently, select the wireless station Wings play recently and show Wings in part 205. Then, for part 209 selects wireless station's classification of broadcasting recently. As a result, it is possible in part 209, show the wireless station LuckyTunes of remaining nearest broadcasting. For another part 208, it is possible to select the wireless station's classification play recently. But, because previously having shown all media items in wireless station's classification of broadcasting recently (that is, 2 wireless station Wings and LuckyTunes play recently) in part 205 and 209, it is possible to for part 209 selects another classification. The 2nd classification can be selected for part 208, newly issue, as a result, it is possible to select new issue song EverBlue from new 25 media items issued classification and may be displayed in part 208. Therefore, when previously having shown for all media items in the media categories selected by part, it is possible to for this part selects another media categories.
In some instances, it is possible to the quantity from the media item shown by specific media categories is limited to the maximum quantity set by the media item that can show in landing page. The maximum quantity of the media item from specific media categories can be set by user, Operation system setting etc. Similarly, it is possible to for specific media categories arranges the maximum quantity of shown media item. According to realization, it is possible to selected the 2nd classification based on previously selecting the number of times of first category. As shown in table 1, the playlist classification play recently/follow can be limited to maximum quantity 3 media items, wireless station's classification of recommendation can be limited to maximum quantity 5 media items, and the new issue classification recommended can be limited to maximum quantity 5 media items.In fig. 2, for part 207, it is possible to select the playlist classification of nearest broadcasting/follow based on indicating probability 10%. But, may be previously the playlist classification that each selection of part 203,204 and 206 is play recently/followed. Because the playlist classification play recently/follow is limited to can show maximum quantity 3 media items in landing page, it is possible to for part 207 selects the 2nd media categories. Therefore, for part 207, it is possible to based on 60% indicating probability, select the 2nd media categories, the special edition play recently/buy and song. As a result, it is possible to from 50 media items the special edition play recently/buy and song classification, select special edition TheLionQueen and may be displayed in part 207.
In some cases, can based on the number of times previously selecting first category to the selection of first category. Similarly, the classification selected for the second position on the page can be based upon the classification that first location is selected. Such as, user can indicate they do not wish to see from the first media categories more than 1 media item. In this case, the first part of landing page can show the media item from the first media categories. For the second section of landing page, it is possible to select the first media categories, but, owing to showing 1 media item (that is, the maximum quantity arranged by user) from first category in the first portion, it is possible to select the 2nd media categories. Therefore, it is possible in the second section of landing page, show the media item from the 2nd classification.
According to realization, it is possible to generate whole landing page immediately so that each part of landing page shows the media item from selected media categories simultaneously. As an alternative, one or more parts of landing page can upgrade/change, and other parts one or more can be kept intact. , it is possible to not in the same time, in addition such as refresh landing page every time, generate landing page when user starts new landing page session, user opens media application etc.
For generating and/or provide landing page to user, it is possible to there is various realization. With webpage, application on site, desktop and/or Mobile solution (such as media application), document and any other technology of landing page can be provided to provide landing page to user. Media provider can provide landing page or media provider can provide the media application comprising landing page feature to user.
