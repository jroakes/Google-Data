- This specification relates to managing loads on an electrical grid.
- An electrical grid is an interconnected network for distributing electrical power from power sources to power consumers.
- An electrical grid can include generating stations that produce electrical power, transmission lines that carry power over large distances to regional centers, and distribution lines that connect to individual loads.
- One example of an electrical grid is a microgrid that includes multiple loads and optionally power sources that can be operated in coordination with a broader public utility grid or as an electrical island.
- This specification describes a load control system coupled between an electrical grid and a load.
- the load control system sums the differences between a specified normal voltage and measured voltages to determine a curtailment level.
- the load control system adjusts an amount of power drawn by the load using the curtailment level.
- the load control system adjusts the amount of power in response to primary electrical power, e.g., power provided from a utility provider, becoming unavailable, e.g., during a blackout, or not being within predefined operational specifications, e.g., during brown outs.
- a system comprising: a power source coupled to an electrical grid and configured to provide power to the electrical grid, wherein the power source is configured to reduce a voltage on the electrical grid as a consequence of a current drawn by the electrical grid exceeding a threshold current; a first load control system coupled between the electrical grid and a first load, wherein the first load control system is configured to perform load control operations comprising: measuring the voltage on the electrical grid at a plurality of times; determining, for each time of the plurality of times, a difference between a specified normal voltage and the respective measured voltage at that time; summing the differences between the specified normal voltage and the measured voltages to determine a curtailment level; determining whether the curtailment level exceeds a first threshold curtailment level; and in response to determining that the curtailment level exceeds the first threshold curtailment level, adjusting an amount of power drawn by the load.
- the system includes: a second load control system coupled between the electrical grid and a second load; and a system controller configured to communicate with the first and second load systems over a data communications network, wherein the system controller is configured to provide the first threshold curtailment level to the first load control system and to provide a second threshold curtailment level to the second load control system.

- the droop voltage can appear as a function of overall load current, e.g., by operation of an inverter.
- load curtailment can be prioritized, preserving power for higher priority loads.
- Load control systems can curtail loads without directly communicating with a power source by measuring a voltage on a grid.
- Load control systems can curtail loads on an electrical grid when the grid is disconnected from a utility grid or in other power constrained scenarios, e.g., when power supplied to the grid is transferred from a primary source to a secondary source, or when a heavier load is added to the grid and the grid is drawing power from the secondary source.
- a secondary power source can deliver power without bringing down the grid voltage by adjusting the load power, e.g., by applying the droop voltage to signal load curtailment.
- Load curtailment can be applied without being sensitive to voltage measurement error.

- the load control systems 210 a - b of FIG. 2A can measure the voltage. The voltage varies as the power sources applies a droop voltage and loads are curtailed.
- a third curve 508 illustrates the difference between the measured voltages and the specified normal voltage.
- a bold line 510 illustrates a curtailment level as determined for one of the loads on the electrical grid.
- the curtailment level is determined by continuously summing, i.e., integrating, the differences between the measured voltage and the specified normal voltage multiplied by a weighting factor k.
- the subscript j denotes a branch of the loads.
- the subscript k is a weighting factor determined by, e.g., the amount of either load power or load current. k may be slowly changing over time.
- V th is the lower bound of specified normal AC voltage.
- Each load control system can determine the curtailment level and compare the curtailment level with a threshold curtailment level for the load control system's respective load.
- the system controller 202 of FIG. 2A can specify the threshold curtailment levels for the loads.
- the curtailment level CL 1 reaches a first threshold curtailment level, A.
- One of the loads, or a first branch of loads, is configured to be curtailed when the curtailment level reaches the first threshold curtailment level.
- the measured voltage begins rising again as a result of that load being curtailed, the curtailment level CL 2 rises more slowly and then is reset to zero when the measured voltage is greater than V th for longer than time T.
- the curtailment level CL 2 reaches a second threshold curtailment level, B.
- Another load, or a second branch of loads, is configured to be curtailed when the curtailment level reaches the second threshold curtailment level.
- the measured voltage begins rising again as a result of that other load being curtailed. Because the two loads have been curtailed, the voltage on the electrical grid is maintained for higher priority loads.
- the bold line 510 illustrates the curtailment level for all of the devices, because in this example all the devices see about the same voltage.
- the voltage may vary across a grid and each load control system will have a different curtailment level.
- the curtailment level can be based on the priority of each load or branch of loads.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an example process 600 performed by a load control system coupled between an electrical grid and a load.
- the load control system measures the voltage on the grid ( 602 ).
- the load control system determines the difference between the measured voltage and a specified normal voltage ( 604 ).
- the load control system adds the difference to a running sum of the differences to determine a curtailment level ( 606 ).
- the load control system compares the curtailment level to a threshold curtailment level ( 608 ), and if the curtailment level exceeds the threshold curtailment level, adjusts an amount of power drawn by the load ( 610 ).
- the load control system can begin performing the process as a consequence of determining that the electrical grid is not receiving power from a utility grid, e.g., and is instead receiving power from a secondary power source.
- the load control system can receive a signal from a utility disconnect switch that the utility grid has been disconnected.

Description
This specification relates to managing loads on an electrical grid.
An electrical grid is an interconnected network for distributing electrical power from power sources to power consumers. An electrical grid can include generating stations that produce electrical power, transmission lines that carry power over large distances to regional centers, and distribution lines that connect to individual loads. One example of an electrical grid is a microgrid that includes multiple loads and optionally power sources that can be operated in coordination with a broader public utility grid or as an electrical island.
This specification describes a load control system coupled between an electrical grid and a load. The load control system sums the differences between a specified normal voltage and measured voltages to determine a curtailment level. The load control system adjusts an amount of power drawn by the load using the curtailment level. In some implementations, the load control system adjusts the amount of power in response to primary electrical power, e.g., power provided from a utility provider, becoming unavailable, e.g., during a blackout, or not being within predefined operational specifications, e.g., during brown outs.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system comprising: a power source coupled to an electrical grid and configured to provide power to the electrical grid, wherein the power source is configured to reduce a voltage on the electrical grid as a consequence of a current drawn by the electrical grid exceeding a threshold current; a first load control system coupled between the electrical grid and a first load, wherein the first load control system is configured to perform load control operations comprising: measuring the voltage on the electrical grid at a plurality of times; determining, for each time of the plurality of times, a difference between a specified normal voltage and the respective measured voltage at that time; summing the differences between the specified normal voltage and the measured voltages to determine a curtailment level; determining whether the curtailment level exceeds a first threshold curtailment level; and in response to determining that the curtailment level exceeds the first threshold curtailment level, adjusting an amount of power drawn by the load.
The foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. The system includes: a second load control system coupled between the electrical grid and a second load; and a system controller configured to communicate with the first and second load systems over a data communications network, wherein the system controller is configured to provide the first threshold curtailment level to the first load control system and to provide a second threshold curtailment level to the second load control system. The system controller is configured to send, to a user device, instructions for presenting a user interface for selecting curtailment thresholds and to receive, from the user device, first and second selections for the first and second threshold curtailment levels. Presenting the user interface comprises presenting a plurality of names for a plurality of loads, and wherein receiving first and second selections for the first and second threshold curtailment levels comprises receiving an ordered list of the names, and wherein the system controller is configured to determine the first and second threshold curtailment levels using the ordered list of names. The power source comprises an inverter coupled to a direct current (DC) bus coupled to a plurality of DC power sources. Summing the differences between the specified normal voltage and the measured voltages to determine the curtailment level comprises multiplying the differences by a weighting factor The electrical grid is coupled to a utility grid, and wherein at least one of the DC power sources is a photovoltaic power system, and wherein the load control system is configured to begin summing the differences as a consequence of determining that the electrical grid is not receiving power from the utility grid. The load control system is configured to reset the summing as a consequence of determining that the differences between the specified normal voltage and the measured voltages are each below a threshold for a specified duration of time. The load control system comprises: a communications device configured to communicate over a data communications network; and a power controller configured to adjust the amount of power drawn by the load. The load control system comprises a microcontroller configured to receive, using the communications device, the first threshold curtailment level from a system controller. The load control system comprises a circuit breaker, and wherein adjusting the amount of power drawn by the load comprises tripping the circuit breaker.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more advantages. Loads can be curtailed based on a measured voltage and time duration, e.g., a droop voltage appearing for a certain time period, or based on power or load current. The droop voltage can appear as a function of overall load current, e.g., by operation of an inverter. By curtailing certain loads before other loads, load curtailment can be prioritized, preserving power for higher priority loads. Load control systems can curtail loads without directly communicating with a power source by measuring a voltage on a grid. Load control systems can curtail loads on an electrical grid when the grid is disconnected from a utility grid or in other power constrained scenarios, e.g., when power supplied to the grid is transferred from a primary source to a secondary source, or when a heavier load is added to the grid and the grid is drawing power from the secondary source. A secondary power source can deliver power without bringing down the grid voltage by adjusting the load power, e.g., by applying the droop voltage to signal load curtailment. Load curtailment can be applied without being sensitive to voltage measurement error.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
The loads 102 can be, e.g., branch circuits in a residence or light commercial facility, each connected to a respective breaker 130. To avoid congestion in the drawings, the loads 102 and breakers 130 are collectively represented by respective single schematic blocks.
A load can be any type of device that draws electrical power, e.g., an appliance within a home, a charging device for an electrical vehicle, manufacturing equipment, and so on. The electrical grid 132 is coupled to a utility grid 104 that provides power to the loads 102. The utility grid 104 is coupled to the electrical grid by a utility grid disconnect switch 106. The utility disconnect switch 106 can be configured to automatically disconnect the utility grid 104 when the utility power fails, e.g., during a blackout, brownout, or some other operational anomaly.
The system includes an inverter 108 coupled to a direct current (DC) bus 114. The DC bus 114 can receive power from various power sources, e.g., a photovoltaic power source 110 coupled to a DC/DC converter 112; a first AC Genset 116 powered by diesel fuel 116 coupled to a rectifier 118; and a battery or battery system 120 coupled to a DC/DC converter 122. These various power sources are local to an entity, e.g., alternate power sources for a house, for example. Additionally, other power sources can also be used instead of the particular power sources 110, 116 and 120 shown in FIG. 1 .
The inverter 108 converts DC power on the DC bus 114 to alternating current (AC) power, e.g., real or reactive power or both, that can be consumed by the loads 102 or provided to the utility grid 104. The inverter 108 can produce split AC phases with output voltages of 120 VAC and 240 VAC. The inverter 108 can be configured, e.g., by virtue of suitable programming of a microcontroller, to reduce its output voltage as a consequence of determining that the loads are drawing a current exceeding a threshold current. In some implementations, the inverter 108 is implemented using a circuit topology that lacks a transformer so that the inverter 108 does not provide galvanic isolation between a PV system and the utility grid.
The system includes a second AC Genset 124 coupled to the electrical grid 132 by a Genset disconnect switch 126. The second AC Genset 124 can provide AC power directly to the electrical grid 132; the inverter 108 may operate in parallel with the first AC Genset 116 to power the loads.
The system optionally includes an electric vehicle (EV) charger 128 that draws power from the electric grid 132 to charge an electric vehicle. The EV charger 128 can also be configured for EV discharging, e.g., so that the vehicle's battery can be used to power loads 102 on the electric grid 132.
The system includes circuit breakers 130 or disconnect switches that are configured to provide overcurrent protection to the loads and, in some examples, to curtail the loads. The system also includes load control systems 134, which are configured to communicate with a system controller 136 and to adjust an amount of power drawn by the loads 102. The system controller 136 sends instructions to the load control systems 134 and the load control systems 134 can send monitoring information back to the system controller 136. In some implementations, the load control systems are integrated with the circuit breakers 130, and the circuit breakers 130 are configured to perform load curtailment, or used in a load control system to perform load curtailment. Example load control systems that can be used in the system of FIG. 1 are described further below with reference to FIG. 2A , FIG. 5 , and FIG. 6 .
The system depicted in FIG. 1 is one example of a system which can use the techniques described in this document. Various other systems can use the techniques, e.g., systems having more or fewer components than those depicted in FIG. 1 .
A user 204 uses a user device 206, e.g., a mobile device or personal computer, to communicate with the system controller 136 over a data communications network 208, e.g., a WiFi network or the Internet or both. The system controller 136 communicates with a number of load control systems 134 a-b that are configured to adjust the amount of power drawn by respective loads 102 a-b.
Each load control system 134 includes a power controller 216 a-b and a communications device 214 a-b. The power controller 216 is configured to adjust the load's real and, in some implementations, reactive power level in response to a signal it receives from the communications device 214.
The power controller 216 can be, e.g. a switch that opens or closes, or it can be a complex power-electronic device with arbitrarily controllable real and reactive power levels, or any appropriate device that can adjust the amount of power drawn by the load. The power controller 216 can be physically integrated with the load or it can be a separate device or integrated into another device. The power controller 216 can be collocated with other loads' power controllers, e.g., in a home's panel or sub-panel.
The communications device 214 is configured to communicate with the system controller 136, e.g., over a wired or wireless communications link. The communications device 214 receives load curtailment information from the system controller 136. The load curtailment information includes one or more parameters that specify when to curtail the load. The load curtailment information can include, e.g., load priority, load curtailment level, a normal voltage range, load power rating, inverter or secondary power source power rating, and so on.
For example, the load curtailment information can specify a threshold curtailment level. The load control system 134 can measure periodically measure the voltage of the load to obtain a measured voltage, and sum the differences between the measured voltages and a specified normal voltage. When the sum reaches the threshold curtailment level, the load control system 134 adjusts the power drawn by the load 102, e.g., by tripping a circuit breaker for the load or sending an instruction to the load 102 to gracefully shut down. Threshold curtailment levels are described further below with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6 .
The system controller 136 can send, to the user device 206, instructions for presenting a user interface for selecting threshold curtailment levels. The system controller 136 can then receive, from the user device 206, selections for threshold curtailment levels for the loads 102.
Up to 100% RMS current, the inverter does not apply any droop voltage, and the inverter outputs the max voltage. For currents greater than 100% RMS current, the inverter applies an increasing droop voltage, so that at 200% RMS current the inverter is supplying on the droop voltage B. Downstream circuits can detect the lower voltage for load curtailment. The inverter will shut off when the voltage drops below the UVLO voltage.
The inverter can be configured to apply the droop voltage, e.g., using a microcontroller or other control system. The control system measures the current being drawn, determines the corresponding droop voltage specified by the droop curve, and then adjusts the inverter operation to produce the droop voltage.
The vertical axis of the bottom chart 500 shows the measured voltage on the electrical grid, e.g., the AC RMS voltage. The vertical axis of the top chart 550 shows curtailment thresholds.
A bracket 502 illustrates a range of specified normal voltages. One of the voltages of the range, e.g., the lower bound of the range or the middle of the range, is selected to be the specified normal voltage. The normal voltage can be set by the system controller 202 of FIG. 2A , which can receive the normal voltage from a user or a system designer or other appropriate source. A first curve 504 illustrates the specified normal voltage for this example scenario.
A second curve 506 illustrates an example of measured voltages over time. The load control systems 210 a-b of FIG. 2A can measure the voltage. The voltage varies as the power sources applies a droop voltage and loads are curtailed. A third curve 508 illustrates the difference between the measured voltages and the specified normal voltage.
A bold line 510 illustrates a curtailment level as determined for one of the loads on the electrical grid. The curtailment level is determined by continuously summing, i.e., integrating, the differences between the measured voltage and the specified normal voltage multiplied by a weighting factor k. The curtailment level can be expressed as:
CL j =k j·∫(V th −V j,measured(t))dt
The subscript j denotes a branch of the loads. The subscript k is a weighting factor determined by, e.g., the amount of either load power or load current. k may be slowly changing over time. Vth is the lower bound of specified normal AC voltage.
CL j =k j·∫(V th −V j,measured(t))dt
The subscript j denotes a branch of the loads. The subscript k is a weighting factor determined by, e.g., the amount of either load power or load current. k may be slowly changing over time. Vth is the lower bound of specified normal AC voltage.
Each load control system can determine the curtailment level and compare the curtailment level with a threshold curtailment level for the load control system's respective load. The system controller 202 of FIG. 2A can specify the threshold curtailment levels for the loads.
At time t1, the curtailment level CL1 reaches a first threshold curtailment level, A. One of the loads, or a first branch of loads, is configured to be curtailed when the curtailment level reaches the first threshold curtailment level. After time t1, the measured voltage begins rising again as a result of that load being curtailed, the curtailment level CL2 rises more slowly and then is reset to zero when the measured voltage is greater than Vth for longer than time T.
Eventually, at time t2, the curtailment level CL2 reaches a second threshold curtailment level, B. Another load, or a second branch of loads, is configured to be curtailed when the curtailment level reaches the second threshold curtailment level. After time t2, the measured voltage begins rising again as a result of that other load being curtailed. Because the two loads have been curtailed, the voltage on the electrical grid is maintained for higher priority loads.
In the example shown, the bold line 510 illustrates the curtailment level for all of the devices, because in this example all the devices see about the same voltage. In a different setting, e.g., a light commercial setting, the voltage may vary across a grid and each load control system will have a different curtailment level. The curtailment level can be based on the priority of each load or branch of loads.
The load control system can begin performing the process as a consequence of determining that the electrical grid is not receiving power from a utility grid, e.g., and is instead receiving power from a secondary power source. For example, the load control system can receive a signal from a utility disconnect switch that the utility grid has been disconnected. In some implementations, the load control system is configured to reset the summing, e.g., by setting the curtailment level to zero, as a consequence of determining that the differences between the specified normal voltage and the measured voltages are each below a threshold for a specified duration of time, or that the measured voltage is greater than a specified normal voltage for a specified duration of time.
