Definitions
- the present invention relates, in general, to wireless communication systems and, more particularly, to a method for wireless communication system planning using ray-tracing.
- base stations are located such that radio signals are available through out the service area.
- many cells are required. Predicting the coverage of such cells is a difficult job, and a number of tools have been developed which make some use of terrain data, with building clutter information, such as that available by the US Geological Survey within the United States.
- This data is used in conjunction with models that are well known in the art, such as the Longley-Rice model which uses base and subscriber heights, along with a description of the terrain to calculate a prediction of the expected propagation loss for the locations under consideration.
- microcells typically cover a much smaller area, especially in dense urban areas. Tools to predict micro-cell coverage typically use information about the building sizes, shapes, and sometimes material types to aid in modeling the propagation paths in and around the buildings in the coverage area.
- a deterministic process as opposed to the above statistical process, basically attempts to model the radiowave propagation as rays radiating from the transmitter to the receiver.
- This approach can be effective and accurate when the objects in the modeled environment are much larger in dimension than the wave length of the transmitted signal.
- the propagation phenomena that can be modeled in a ray-tracing process include reflection, diffraction, transmission and the combinations of the above.
- Within ray tracing there are two generally known approaches. The first is called the "shooting-and-bouncing" method, in which a fixed number of rays are launched from the source (transmitter), then forward-traced to follow the different propagation paths, with a ray being terminated when it hits a detection sphere at the receiver.
- a major advantage of this approach is that it can be applied to most any type of surface.
- a key disadvantage is that for every receiver location, the rays have to be launched and traced again in all directions. This could mean hours or even days of computation time for a practical environment.
- the second method is based on image theory, which is traditionally limited to more or less planar surfaces in the environment.
- image theory which is traditionally limited to more or less planar surfaces in the environment.
- the basic notion here is that the images of a source at a fixed location in a given environment are independent of the location of the point of observation (receiver) as long as there are basically planar surfaces in the environment. Therefore one can build all the images for a given location of the source and environment and reuse it for as many receiver locations as one needs. This represents an improvement in terms of computational efficiency, but of course, one is limited by the planar surfaces in the environment. This is, however, typical of an urban microcellular environment.
- a conventional image theory approach may be advantageously used for microcells, with one first determining an image tree (hierarchically organized for ease of use) based on the location of the source in the environment and the environment itself.
- the environment consists of mirrors (or reflective surfaces) and corners. Starting from the source image, each mirror or corner has the potential of generating a "child" image from the source image. Each child image can further generate child images for every mirror and every corner.
- N mirrors there are also (typically) approximately N corners. Each of the N mirrors can potentially generate a reflective image, and each of the N corners can potentially generate a diffractive image.
- each image object takes 100 bytes of memory (i.e., in order to hold its own attributes and pointers to its ancestor image and descendant images), the total memory needed to hold the above image tree with fairly modest assumptions is 200 megabytes
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating how a reflective image is generated for a reflective surface of "mirror,” and how a diffractive image is generated for a diffractive surface or "corner,” in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a hierarchical view of an image tree for a given environment and source
- FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating "back-tracing" of an image on the image tree from the receiver to the transmitter;
- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating the use of a scope for both a reflective image and a diffractive image in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for determining an image tree in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for received power estimation in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a plot of received signal powers for a coverage area in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention.
- a preferred method for determining signal propagation characteristics for the known environment starts with minimizing the size of (i.e., pruning) the image tree by defining a scope for each image on the image tree.
- a "scope” is defined as an angle within which the majority of the radiated energy from the image is confined.
- the source image has a predetermined scope angle-typically 360 degrees, but it could be a set lesser amount if directed (e.g., so as not to transmit towards an immediately adjacent wall, or for sectorized antennas).
- the scope angle of a reflective image is usually much less than 180 degrees.
- the scope angle of a diffractive image is usually less than 45 degrees.
- the inherent information in the hierarchy of the image tree is preferably used to partially trace the image tree based on a received signal level (or similar propagation/quality measure, including signal power loss).
- a received signal level or similar propagation/quality measure, including signal power loss.
- its reflective child image contributes less power compared to the parent image due to the extra reflection. The difference can be 14 dB or more for realistic environments.
- a diffracted child image typically contributes at least 6 dB less power than the parent image, and usually a lot less. Therefore by setting an absolute and a relative signal level threshold, the received signal level from the current image can be compared to the threshold and the current total received power, and decisions made whether or not to examine the child images of the current image.
- partial examination of the image tree for the computation of the summed signal level at a given location is accomplished. This reduces the time needed to calculate the signal power for each possible receiver location.
- image generation is generally illustrated, showing how a reflective image 103 is generated on a mirror 110, and how a diffractive image 113 is generated on a corner 120.
- a source (s) 101 can create a reflective image (i) 102 behind the mirror 110, which defines the path of the reflected ray from the source to the receiver 103 if a receiver location is defined. Notice that the location of the image 102 is independent of the location of the receiver 103.
- a source (s) 111 can also create a diffractive image (i) 112 at a diffracting corner 120, which defines a diffracted path from the transmitter to the receiver 113 if the location of the receiver is defined. Again, the location of the diffractive image 112 is independent of the location of the receiver 113.
- FIG. 2 generally depicts the hierarchy of an image tree (generally designated 200).
- the source 201 can generate for every mirror in the environment a reflected child image, and for every corner in the environment a diffractive image. These are called first generation (or first order) images 210. Each first generation image can in turn act like the source image and generate for every mirror in the environment a reflected child image, and for every corner in the environment a diffractive image. These are called second generation or second order images 220. This process can be repeated for second and higher order images and stopped after a predetermined number of reflections and diffractions is reached. The images generated in this process are then linked together to form a hierarchical image tree 200.
- the power contribution from image B is less by an amount equal to the loss due to the reflection plus the extra free space loss below that from image A. For real environments this is at least 14 dB plus the difference in free space loss (determined based on the path segment length from a reflective/diffractive surface corresponding to image A and a reflective point on the surface corresponding to image B--e.g., the distance between r1 312 and r2 322 of FIG. 3).
- back-tracing of an image is illustrated, i.e., tracing an image tree back from the receiver 331 to the transmitter 301.
- each of the images on the image tree may be examined to see whether it lies on a propagation path between the transmitter 301 and the receiver 331. This is done by back-tracing.
- a propagation line is first drawn between the second generation image (aa) 321 and RX 331, from which a point of reflection (r2) 322 on the surface (mirror 320) is found.
- r2 322 is not on mirror 320 or the line-of-sight (LOS) path between RX 331 and r2 322 is blocked, then this image does not constitute a possible propagation path. Otherwise a line or ray is drawn between r2 322 and (a), which is the parent image 311 of the image aa 321. Another point of reflection (r1) 312 on surface 310 is then found. Again, if (r1) 312 is not on mirror 310 or the LOS path between (r2) 322 and (r1) 312 is blocked, then this image 311 does not constitute a valid propagation path. If the LOS clearance between (r1) 312 and the source (s) 301 (which is the parent image of the image a 311) exists, then there is a propagation path from the source 301 to the receiver RX 331 through two reflection points 312, 322.
- LOS clearance between (r1) 312 and the source (s) 301 which is the parent image of the image a 311) exists, then there is a propagation path
- FIG. 4 generally depicts how a scope can be used in building an image tree in an urban canyon 400.
- the scope is an angle that defines the energized region of space based on possible propagations from the image.
- image i 1 411 is the image for any reflections off surface 415 from transmitter source location 401.
- scope 412 can be used to significantly reduce the possible daughter images of image i 1 411 (i.e., to those images having reflection or diffraction points within the region defined by scope 412).
- image i 2 421 is the image for any diffractions off surface 425 from source 401.
- image i 2 421 can only serve as an image for those rays propagating from edge 425 within the region defined by the scope 422, and scope 422 can be similarly used to significantly reduce the possible daughter images of image i 2 421 (i.e., to those images having reflection or diffraction points within the region defined by scope 422).
- the scope angles of reflected and diffractive images are much smaller than 360 degrees, which would conventionally be required for the two dimensional case.
- the growth of the image tree will be limited within the energized portion of the potential image tree. This will effectively "prune" the image tree to a manageable size for a realistic environment such as urban microcellular applications.
- FIG. 5 generally illustrates a method 500 by which a pruned image tree can be built.
- the location of all significant structures buildings, towers, terrain, etc.
- any desired structural characteristics e.g., the location of each of plural reflective surfaces (defining all potential reflective points on the surface) and plural diffractive surfaces, along with signal power loss characteristics
- the source is set as the current image, and its predetermined scope set (typically to 360 degrees)) (step 510).
- the image tree would be five levels deep at that branch; however, all third level reflective images (and their child images), even if third order images, would be pruned.
- determination of two levels of reflection and three levels of diffraction are generally sufficient to adequately model the actual propagation environment.
- an additional level or perhaps even more, may be necessary.
- One skilled in the art will appreciate how to choose an appropriate level of image generation based on the environmental density, as well as considerations such as the available memory/processing power (which increase dramatically as each additional level is added).
- FIG. 6 generally illustrates a preferred method (600) for back-tracing the images on the image tree and determining a received signal quality measure (e.g., the total received power, propagation loss, etc.) for given receiver locations.
- a received signal quality measure e.g., the total received power, propagation loss, etc.
- the process is initialized by starting with the 25 top of the image tree, the transmitter (610).
- a back-tracing process (such as illustrated in FIG. 3) is performed to determine whether the first receiver location is in a direct line of sight with the transmitter (620). If it is, the path from the transmitter to the receiver forms a first propagation path, and the signal quality change (e.g., power loss, attentuation, or change in another quality measure) across the path, in this case due solely to free space path loss, is determined (630). If not, the next image, preferably in descending order on the image tree, is set as a current image (640).
- the signal quality change e.g., power loss,
- step 620 determines whether the line defined by image A and the receiver is unobstructed between the reflective surface of image A and the receiver (the intersection of this line and the reflective surface defining the reflective point) and whether the line from the reflective point to the transmitter is unobstructed--in other words, whether a propagation path exists using image A.
- a power loss estimation is performed by determining each contribution--i.e., the free space loss across the two path segment lengths and a reflective surface loss.
- the reflective surface loss may be defined as a set value for all reflective surfaces (e.g., 14 decibels) for simpler calculations; alternatively, where known the reflective characteristics of the materials/structure of each reflective surface may be used, even including an angular factor for certain rough/irregular surfaces, so that a more precise power loss estimation may be obtained. Similar diffractive characteristics may by used, along with the angle of diffraction, in calculating power loss around diffractive surfaces.
- a comparison is made between the power contribution (e.g., initial transmit power times power loss) of the current propagation path and a predetermined threshold.
- the threshold is preferably set low enough (e.g., a 120 dB drop from the transmit power) to exclude de minimus contributions. If the power contribution of, say image B of FIG. 2, were less than the threshold, no determination of the contribution of its child images (e.g., image D) would be made, since such would necessarily be de minimus too. In this case, the next sibling or same-order image would be set as the current image (e.g., image C) (step 660), and the process repeated.
- the power contribution is also preferably compared against the difference between the cumulative power contributions already determined and a relative threshold (e.g., 20 dB) to exclude de minimus relative contributions; this is useful, e.g., in excluding contributions above the first threshold but still de minimus when short propagation paths with little loss are also present. If the power contribution is greater than both thresholds, then a determination of the contribution of each child/lower order image is then made (670).
- a relative threshold e.g. 20 dB
- This process is repeated (steps 541, 571) until all images on the tree have been examined or excluded by a threshold determination, yielding a received signal quality measure (e.g., received power) cumulated during step 630.
- a received signal quality measure e.g., received power
- the region of interest for microcellular systems will be defined typically as all regions within a predetermined radius of the transmitter location that are external to the structures within the region (internal calculations could also be performed, but would require more complex calculations involving power loss based on penetration characteristics). For in-building systems, the region of interest would be limited by the building boundaries.
- the accuracy of the signal propagation characteristics is dependent on the number/distance between receiver locations, and how to select an appropriate number based on a balance between factors such as the accuracy desired and the computational capacity/time available.
- the signal power for each receiver site can be used in a variety of ways to determine system planning, for example by factoring together for some overall measure of coverage quality, outputting the receiver locations and powers below a desired received signal level (indicating shadowing or cell boundaries), and displayed for a user so as to show relative receiver powers.
- This latter approach may be advantageously used in determining the placement for a receiver, such as a wireless fixed access unit (WAFU) for use in PCS (personal communication services) systems.
- a receiver such as a wireless fixed access unit (WAFU) for use in PCS (personal communication services) systems.
- WAFU wireless fixed access unit
- FIG. 7 where one transmitter location 701 is used to cover a local region 700 such as a residential neighborhood with plural houses 710, 720.
- Relative received powers is determined for different possible receiver locations, illustrated by areas 711-713 and 721-722. The size of such areas may vary depending on the placement accuracy desired. Further, for ease of determination only relative power levels are displayed (in this case on a scale of 1 to 10, although any scale could be used, including color coding on a computer display). This is sufficient to determine the placement of a WAFU in area 711 adjacent building 710.
- the entire process can be repeated to determine the receive powers throughout the coverage area based on use of the second transmitter location 702.
- the results may be compared in a variety of ways, two such being either comparing the coverage for known receiver/subscriber locations (e.g., if only buildings 710 and 720 were likely subscribers, TX 702 would be the preferred site), or assigning an overall coverage rating for the region 700.
