Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. An example content presentation opportunity is identified as being associated with a reservation system. The content presentation opportunity is characterized, including creating a signature defined by signals. Creating the signature includes defining a value for each signature element, wherein an element corresponds to one or more of signals. The value for a respective element is based on a value for a respective signal as defined by the content presentation opportunity. At least a portion of the signature is provided for presentation to a user. The user is queried for an indication of a relative importance of signature elements. The signature is evaluated in context of an exchange system including creating a proposed campaign including selection criteria based on the signature and the received indication. Information related to the campaign is provided.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented. Some opportunities for presenting content can be similar to, or based on, other opportunities.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes identifying an example of a content presentation opportunity from a publisher, the content presentation opportunity being characterized as being associated with a reservation system in which opportunities are booked in advance by an entity for presentation of their respective content. The method further includes characterizing, using one or more processors, the content presentation opportunity including creating a signature defined by a plurality of signals, wherein creating the signature includes defining a value for each element of the signature, wherein an element corresponds to one or more of the plurality of signals, and wherein the value for a respective element is based at least in part on a value for a respective signal as defined by the content presentation opportunity. The method further includes providing, for presentation to a user, at least a portion of the signature. The method further includes querying the user for an indication of a relative importance of elements included in the signature. The method further includes receiving the indication of the relative importance. The method further includes evaluating the signature in a context of an exchange system including creating a proposed campaign that includes selection criteria that are based at least in part on the signature and the received indication. The method further includes providing, for presentation to the user, information related to the proposed campaign.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The content presentation opportunity can be a prior direct purchase reservation from the publisher or a prior reservation associated with the user. The method can further include processing the signature including predicting a volume of traffic for the proposed campaign and a relative impact for inclusion of individual elements of the signature in the proposed campaign as selection criteria, and presenting at least a portion of the signature can further include providing relative impact information for one or more elements in the signature. The relative impact can be a relative cost for inclusion of the element in the proposed campaign. Querying the user for an indication of relative importance can include querying the user for an indication of which elements in the signature should be included in the proposed campaign, receiving the indication for which elements to include and creating the proposed campaign. Receiving the indication of relative importance can include receiving an indication of an element to exclude from the proposed campaign and excluding the element from the proposed campaign. The method can further include receiving an indication from the user to activate the proposed campaign, activating the proposed campaign including creating an actual campaign for inclusion in inventory of the exchange system, and reporting activity of the actual campaign over time to the user. The plurality of signals can include volume, cost and location signals, wherein the volume signal represents a number of presentation opportunities in the content presentation opportunity, the cost signal represents the cost for the presentation opportunities, and the location signal represents the location associated with the presentation opportunities. The plurality of signals can further include keywords or contextual information associated with the content presentation opportunity. The plurality of signals can further include one or more demographic signals. Providing information can include providing information for a buying opportunity in the exchange system that uses the proposed campaign. Providing information can include providing information for a new campaign for use in the exchange system that is similar to the content presentation opportunity of the reservation system. The new campaign can be based at least in part on the proposed campaign. The proposed campaign can include a monetization type selected from impression, interaction or conversion, and wherein the relative cost is based on predicted occurrences of monetization events after impressions of content from the proposed campaign.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: identify an example of a content presentation opportunity from a publisher, the content presentation opportunity being characterized as being associated with a reservation system in which opportunities are booked in advance by an entity for presentation of their respective content; characterize the content presentation opportunity including creating a signature defined by a plurality of signals, wherein creating the signature includes defining a value for each element of the signature, wherein an element corresponds to one or more of the plurality of signals, and wherein the value for a respective element is based at least in part on a value for a respective signal as defined by the content presentation opportunity; provide, for presentation to a user, at least a portion of the signature; query the user for an indication of a relative importance of elements included in the signature; receive the indication of the relative importance; evaluate the signature in a context of an exchange system including creating a proposed campaign that includes selection criteria that are based at least in part on the signature and the received indication; and provide, for presentation to the user, information related to the proposed campaign.

Anopportunity characterization engine 122, for example, can characterize the content presentation opportunity to create a signature defined by a plurality of signals. Apresentation interface engine 123, for example, can provide at least a portion of the signature for presentation to an entity, query the entity for an indication of a relative importance of elements included in the signature, receive the indication, and provide information related to a proposed campaign that is created using the content presentation opportunity and the identified relative importance of elements. Asignature evaluation engine 124, for example, can evaluate the signature in a context of an exchange system including creating a proposed campaign that includes selection criteria that are based, at least in part, on the signature and the received indication. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 can, for example, access the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 can be data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a webpage title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the webpage, and the Universal Resource Locator (URL) of the webpage. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other webpages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. In some implementations, content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation). - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.

FIG. 2A shows anexample system 200 for providing content. In some implementations, thesystem 200 can be used, e.g., to identify and characterize a content presentation opportunity 202 (e.g., a reservation 131) for presentation to auser 210 in a user interface 212. For example, presenting information associated with thecontent presentation opportunity 202 can include presenting specific elements in a signature associated with thecontent presentation opportunity 202. Theuser 210 can identify the relative importance of the elements, e.g., from which thecontent management system 110 can produce a proposed campaign. In some implementations, theuser 210 can elect to activate the proposed campaign, and an actual campaign can be created for inclusion into an inventory of campaigns of the exchange system. - At stage 1, for example, the
opportunity identification engine 121 can identify an example of acontent presentation opportunity 202 from a publisher, such as a direct purchase reservation from thepublisher 109 or a prior reservation associated with an entity. The content presentation opportunity can be characterized, for example, as being associated with a reservation system in which opportunities are booked in advance by an entity for presentation of their respective content. The identifiedcontent presentation opportunity 202 can be a specific one of thereservations 131, such as a reservation for content items (e.g., advertisements) associated with content sponsors 108. Thecontent presentation opportunity 202, for example, can be a reservation placed in the past by an entity to provide a set number of impressions, and providing content at each presentation. The reservation, for example, can have an associated budget, designated number of impressions, time constraints, designated source(s) of inventory, designated audience, associated keywords, specified geography, and other characteristics. - At
stage 2, for example, theopportunity characterization engine 122 can characterize thecontent presentation opportunity 202 to create asignature 204 defined by a plurality of signals. The signals, for example, can correspond to aspects of the reservation that identify how and when impressions of content are to be provided, as specified in the reservation. For example, the signals can include volume signals, cost signals, and/or location signals. Volume signals, for example, can represent a number of presentation opportunities in the content presentation opportunity. Cost signals, for example, can represent costs associated with the presentation opportunities. Location signals, for example, can represent the geographic locations (e.g., countries, regions or other locations) associated with the presentation opportunities. Other example types of signals include time (e.g., associated with the reservation), budget, size of the ad unit, site (if available), view ability rate (% seen), verification signals (e.g., indicating brand safety, such as not appearing on porn sites), interests (e.g., interest user list targeting or list membership), demographics (e.g., gross ratings points or panel-corrected demographics of the item) and reach (e.g., number of users viewing the content). In some implementations, reach information can be calculated using historical information, e.g., to create metrics such as gross ratings points that are derived from pure cookie reach and/or unique device reach. In some implementations, reach information can be used to predict a projected reach of a campaign, e.g., that has similar characteristics as thepresentation opportunity 202. - To create the
signature 204, for example, theopportunity characterization engine 122 can define a value for each element of the signature. Each element, for example, can correspond to one or more of the plurality of signals, and the value for a respective element can be based, at least in part, on a value for a respective signal as defined by thecontent presentation opportunity 202. In some implementations, the plurality of signals can further include keywords (including negative keywords) or contextual information associated with the content presentation opportunity. In some implementations, the signals can be associated with categories for the presentation opportunity, and the elements can correspond to specific instances of aspects in the signal with which values can be associated. For example, thecontent presentation opportunity 202 can be a reservation for reserving impressions of a boot advertisement. Thesignature 204 in this example can include signals related to the presentation of the impressions, including statistics associated with the reservation and the types of users who were presented with the associated content. For example, values for elements of the signature can include information for the volume and cost of impressions, content selection parameters (e.g., inventory sources, brand-related filters and keywords), and audience reach (e.g., demographics, interests, geography, and unique first party total audience reached). - At
stage 3, for example, thepresentation interface engine 123 can provide at least aportion 208 of thesignature 204, e.g., for presentation to auser 210 on auser device 106 a. For example, thepresentation interface engine 123 can, when presenting the signature, use elements from some or all of thesignals 206. In some implementations, information associated with theportion 208 can be presented in a user interface 212 which can display, to theuser 210, elements from thesignals 206 that are included in theportion 208. In some implementations, the user interface 212 can be similar to auser interface 230 described in detail with respect toFIG. 2B . - At stage 4, for example, the
presentation interface engine 123 can query (214) theuser 210 for an indication of a relative importance of elements included in the signature. For example, based on receipt of thequery 214, the user interface 212 can include messages, controls and/or other components that allow theuser 210 to select, rank and/or score elements based on their importance, e.g., in a campaign that can be created from the elements. Theuser 210 can indicate, using the controls, that elements in the signature related to potential audience reach, for example, are more important than, for example, a specific volume. - At
stage 5, for example, thepresentation interface engine 123 can receive theindication 216 of the relative importance of elements included in the signature. For example, the user's indication can include a list of the elements that the user identified as important. In some implementations scores and/or rankings can be included with the list. The receivedindication 216 can also identify, for example, the elements of thecontent presentation opportunity 202 that theuser 210 indicates are not important. - At
stage 6, for example, thesignature evaluation engine 124 can evaluate thesignature 204 in a context of an exchange system, including creating a proposedcampaign 218 that includes selection criteria that are based, at least in part, on thesignature 204 and the receivedindication 216. For example, thesignature evaluation engine 124 can base the created proposedcampaign 218 on thesignature 204. Thesignature evaluation engine 124 can adjust the proposedcampaign 218 usinguser 210 inputs specified in the user interface 212 that indicate the relative importance of the elements. - At
stage 7, for example, thepresentation interface engine 123 can provide, for presentation to the user,information 220 related to the proposedcampaign 218. For example, the provided information can be displayed in the user interface 212 and can include elements identified by theuser 210 as being important. In some implementations, theinformation 220 related to the proposedcampaign 218 can be presented in theuser interface 230 described with reference toFIG. 2B . - In some implementations, the
user 210 can elect to activate the proposedcampaign 218. For example, thepresentation interface engine 123 can receive an indication from theuser 210 to activate the proposedcampaign 218. Based on this input, for example, thecontent management system 110 can activate the proposedcampaign 218, including creating an actual campaign for inclusion in an inventory of the exchange system, e.g., thecampaigns 132. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can report, to theuser 210, activity associated with the actual campaign that occurs over time. -
FIG. 2B is a diagram of anexample user interface 230 showing proposed campaign information. For example, the campaign information can include or represent a synthetic line item that is based on elements from thesignature 204 of the identifiedcontent presentation opportunity 202. The information can be used by theuser 210, for example, to identify content selection parameters in a campaign for presentation of content items (e.g., advertisements). In some implementations, the campaign can be identified by aheader 231. - In some implementations, the
user interface 230 includeselements 232, e.g., that provide information associated with thesignals 206 related to at least volume and cost. For example,current flight information 232 a can include information associated with the identifiedcontent presentation opportunity 202. The information can include, for example, a timeframe associated with the associated reservation. -
Current volume information 232 b, for example, can identify a current reach and a current volume associated with the reservation. The current reach, for example, can identify a number of users who have generated cookies, e.g., by interacting with the associated content item. The current volume, for example, can identify an actual number of users to which impressions of the content have been provided. -
Auction information 232 c, for example, can identify up-to-date auction information associated with the identifiedcontent presentation opportunity 202. For example, theauction information 232 c can include an estimated cost per one thousand impressions, a graph indicating, and a bid win rate percentage. Other information can be provided. - Projected
volume information 232 d, for example, can identify a proposed volume and an estimated spend associated with the campaign. The proposed volume, for example, can identify a proposed number of impressions. The estimated spend, for example, can identify a total monetary amount that is estimated to be spent during the proposed campaign. In some implementations, other projected values can be used, e.g., an estimated reach associated with the exchange/auction format, calculations or estimated gross rating points, target rating points, and/or other calculated or projected values associated with reach and/or demographics. - Projected
cost information 232 e, for example, can identify current and projected amounts spent. For example, the projectedcost information 232 e can include a budget amount and an additional amount. A sum of the two amounts, for example, can equal the estimated spend amount included in the projectedvolume information 232 d. - In some implementations, the
user interface 230 includescontent selection elements 234. For example, theselection elements 234 can identify one or more sources used in the identifiedcontent presentation opportunity 202 and that can also be used in the proposed campaign. For example, theuser 210 can be presented with content selection signals 234 that are identified from thecontent presentation opportunity 202, and the user can select the specific elements to use in the campaign. -
Inventory sources 234 a, for example, can identify content sources. The sources can include, for example, various sources of content, advertisement exchanges, and/or other sources. -
Verification elements 234 b (e.g., brand safety) can indicate specific audiences, sites, or groups of sites on which content items are appearing, or should not appear. -
Keyword elements 234 c, for example, can identify specific lists of keywords. In some implementations, lists of negative keywords can also be used. -
Location elements 234 d (e.g., geography-based) can identify one or more countries. For example, individual countries can be designated (e.g., checked or unchecked) to permit (or prevent) the presentation of the campaign in those countries. -
Controls 236, for example, can be used to select or to identify the relative importance of elements from thecontent presentation opportunity 202 that are used in the proposedcampaign 218. For example, the user may specify thatinventory sources 234 a andkeyword elements 234 c are of greater importance, and thatlocation elements 234 d are of a lesser importance. In some implementations, the user can assign scores, rankings or weights to different elements in order to indicate their relative importance. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for providing information for a campaign created from a content presentation opportunity. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can perform stages of theprocess 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2B are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 300. - An example of a content presentation opportunity from a publisher is identified (302). In some implementations, the content presentation opportunity is characterized as being associated with a reservation system in which opportunities are booked in advance by an entity for presentation of their respective content. For example the
opportunity identification engine 121 can identify a particular one of thereservations 131 for presentation to theuser 210, e.g., for developing a proposed campaign (e.g., an advertisement campaign). - In some implementations, the content presentation opportunity can be a prior direct purchase reservation from the publisher or a prior reservation associated with the user. For example, the
content presentation opportunity 202 can be a reservation related to the Example Boots Company for which the elements associated withsignals 206 of thesignature 204 can be presented in theuser interface 230. - The content presentation opportunity is characterized, including creating a signature defined by a plurality of signals (304). Creating the signature includes defining a value for each element of the signature, wherein an element corresponds to one or more of the plurality of signals, and wherein the value for a respective element is based at least in part on a value for a respective signal as defined by the content presentation opportunity. As an example, the
opportunity characterization engine 122 can characterize thecontent presentation opportunity 202 to create asignature 204 defined by a plurality ofsignals 206. The signals, for example, can include volume signal, cost signal, location signals, and/or other signals as described above. In some implementations, to create thesignature 204, theopportunity characterization engine 122 can, for example, analyze parameters in thecontent presentation opportunity 202, such as parameters defined for a reservation. In some implementations, theopportunity characterization engine 122 can also analyze results associated with thecontent presentation opportunity 202, such as information about user interaction, budget spent or other information. Thecontent presentation opportunity 202 can be characterized based on the analysis. The analysis, for example, can include determining certain values for elements in thesignals 206 associated with thecontent presentation opportunity 202. For example, for a reservation, the values can quantify and qualify volume (e.g., impressions), costs (e.g., spend, budget), and audience reach (e.g., including location). The purpose of this information is to allow theuser 210 to evaluate aspects of the reservation for potential use in creating a new campaign. For example, the information can be used to create and present information for a potential new campaign in theuser interface 230, described with respect toFIG. 2B . - In some implementations, the plurality of signals can include volume, cost and/or location signals, wherein the volume signals represent a number of presentation opportunities in the content presentation opportunity, the cost signals represent the cost for the presentation opportunities, and the location signals represent locations associated with the presentation opportunities. For example, volume-related
signals 206 can be associated withcurrent volume information 232 b and projectedvolume information 232 d presented as elements in theuser interface 230. As another example, cost-relatedsignals 206 can be associated withauction information 232 c and projectedcost information 232 e. Location-relatedsignals 206, for example, can be associated withlocation elements 234 d. Other types of signals are possible, including, keywords or contextual information signals associated with thecontent presentation opportunity 202, e.g., presented askeyword elements 234 c. In some implementations, the plurality of signals can further include one or more demographic signals, e.g., age, gender or other demographic parameters. - At least a portion of the signature is provided for presentation to a user (306). For example, the
presentation interface engine 123 can provide theportion 208 of thesignature 204 for presentation to theuser 210 on theuser device 106 a. In this example, theportion 208 can include some or all of thesignals 206. In some implementations, elements from the signals can be presented in theuser interface 230 described in detail with respect toFIG. 2B . - The user is queried for an indication of a relative importance of elements included in the signature (308). For example, the
presentation interface engine 123 can provide thequery 214 to theuser device 106 a requesting that theuser 210 is to provide an indication of the relative importance of elements included in the signature. In some implementations, theuser 210 can respond to the query using controls on theuser interface 230. - In some implementations, querying the user for an indication of relative importance can include querying the user for an indication of which elements in the signature should be included in the proposed campaign, receiving the indication for which elements to include and creating the proposed campaign. For example, using the
user interface 230, theuser 210 can identify which elements (e.g., from amongelements 232 and 234) are important, including an indication of each of the elements' relative importance. - The indication of the relative importance is received (310). As an example, the
presentation interface engine 123 can receive theindication 216 from theuser device 106 a. In some implementations, theindication 216 can be received as a result ofuser 210 input on theuser interface 230. The receivedindication 216 can identify the elements of thecontent presentation opportunity 202 that theuser 210 indicates are important, e.g., and should be used in creating a proposed campaign. - In some implementations, receiving the indication of relative importance can include receiving an indication of an element to exclude from the proposed campaign and excluding the element from the proposed campaign. For example, the
indication 216 can also identify the elements of thecontent presentation opportunity 202 that theuser 210 indicates are not important, e.g., should not be used in creating a proposed campaign. - The signature is evaluated in a context of an exchange system, including creating a proposed campaign that includes selection criteria that are based, at least in part, on the signature and the received indication (312).
- In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include processing the signature, including predicting a volume of traffic for the proposed campaign and a relative impact for inclusion of individual elements of the signature in the proposed campaign as selection criteria, wherein presenting at least a portion of the signature further includes providing relative impact information for one or more elements in the signature. For example, thesignature evaluation engine 124 can predict volume-related information, such as information associated with projectedvolume information 232 d included in theuser interface 230. In some implementations, thesignature evaluation engine 124 can generate detailed information, for example, that identifies each element's relative contribution (e.g., an estimated absolute or percentage contribution) associated with each of the elements as they pertain to the projected volume. - In some implementations, the relative impact can be a relative cost for inclusion of the element in the proposed campaign. For example, the
signature evaluation engine 124 can generate detailed information that identifies costs associated with each of the elements as they pertain to the projected volume, e.g., assuming that the elements are included in the proposed campaign. - Information related to the proposed campaign is provided for presentation to the user (314). As an example, the
presentation interface engine 123 can provideinformation 220 associated with the proposedcampaign 218 to theuser device 106 a, e.g., for presentation in theuser interface 230. - In some implementations, providing information related to the proposed campaign can include providing information for a buying opportunity in the exchange system that uses the proposed campaign. For example, the
information 220 provided by thepresentation interface engine 123 can include information presentable to the user for offering and accepting a buy opportunity, e.g., in the form of the proposedcampaign 218. In some implementations, the information provided can include information for a new campaign for use in the exchange system that is similar to the content presentation opportunity of the reservation system. For example, the new campaign can be based, at least in part, on the proposed campaign. In some implementations, the user can make changes to elements associated with the proposedcampaign 218, e.g., iteratively and including re-calculated buying opportunities. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include a mechanism for activating the proposed campaign. For example, after theuser 210 is prompted with an option for activation (e.g., in the user interface 230), thepresentation interface engine 123 can receive an indication from the user to activate the proposed campaign. In this example, thecontent management system 110 can activate the proposedcampaign 218, including creating an actual campaign for inclusion in inventory of the exchange system. In some implementations, subsequent to activation of the campaign, results of the campaign can be provided for presentation to the user, e.g., by reporting activity of the actual campaign over time to the user. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram ofexample computing devices Computing device 400 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 400 is further intended to represent any other typically non-mobile devices, such as televisions or other electronic devices with one or more processers embedded therein or attached thereto.Computing device 450 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be examples only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 400 includes aprocessor 402,memory 404, astorage device 406, a high-speed controller 408 connecting tomemory 404 and high-speed expansion ports 410, and a low-speed controller 412 connecting to low-speed bus 414 andstorage device 406. Each of thecomponents processor 402 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 400, including instructions stored in thememory 404 or on thestorage device 406 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 416 coupled to high-speed controller 408. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 404 stores information within thecomputing device 400. In one implementation, thememory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 400. In one implementation, thestorage device 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 406 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 404, thestorage device 406, or memory onprocessor 402. - The high-
speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 400, while the low-speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations.
