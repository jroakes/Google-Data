Definitions
- the invention relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to receivers and receiver functionality in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems.
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- Existing OFDM systems require a method to detect initial transmissions by transmitters that are either not stationary or operating in cells with a large cell radius. After the initial detection, multiple transformations are applied to the received signal to estimate a timing offset.
- the multiple transformations in these OFDM systems co-relates a timing offset of the transformed received signal in the time domain with a tone index. This transformation and correlation in the timing domain can result in a coarse synchronization of the receiver for the received signal. The timing offset may then be periodically checked.

Abstract
Description

where,
s 128(offset,σ)(t) ={s 144(offset,σ)(t+CP) . . . s 144(offset,σ)(t+CP+N−1)}
s 144(offset,σ)(t) ={s (t+(σ−1)(N+CP)+offset) . . . s (t+σ(N+CP−1)+offset)}
offset=0 . . . (N+CP−1); sample−spaced search offsets
v=1 . . . N (N=128 tones);
σ=1 . . . . Nsym (Nsym=5 symbols);
c=1 . . . CP (CP=16 samples); and
As a result, a set of N tones {tilde over (s)}(offset,σ,ν) per offset, per symbol is yielded. Further, six receivers can share 128 tones and one tone group can be kept reserved. Each tone group forms a signature (i) and each receiver can utilize 16 tones (k) per signature. Therefore, the set of 128 tones are reduced and unmapped to five sets of 16 tones using the following unmapping function:
{tilde over (s)} (i,offset,σ,k)=UNMAP({tilde over (s)} (offset,σ,ν) ,i) (2)
where, UNMAP is a function used for unmapping the 128 tones to 5 sets of 16 tones. Further, if the received samples have a substantially perfect alignment and the FFT is performed on an offset-by-offset basis, a non-coherent demodulation is carried out using equation (3):
s(t−t d)={tilde over (s)}(f)e −jωt
The phaser corresponding to the ranging tone may depend on the frequency associated with the corresponding ranging tone index.
where, T(i,k) is a particular tone frequency normalized from 0 to 127, N is equal to 128 tones and τ is equal to −td normalized again to the FFT unit steps. The vectors in the timing offset are per tone and are rotated through the range of τ. A non-coherent demodulation is then carried out using equation (6):
The search “offset” can be related to τ and μ by:
τ=−mod(offset,Q)−1 (7)
μ=offset+τ+2 (8)
The sample selection and FFT can be redefined using the terms τ and μ.
s 144(μ,σ)(t) =s (t+(σ−1)(N+CP)+(μ−1)Q) . . . s (t+σ(N+CP−1)+μQ) (9)
s 128(μ,σ)(t) =s 144(μ,σ)(t+CP) . . . s 144(μ,σ)(t+CP+N−1) (10)
{tilde over (s)} (μ,σ,ν) =ℑ└s 128(μ,σ)(t)┘ (11)
{tilde over (s)} (i,μ,σ,k)=UNMAP({tilde over (s)} (μ,σ,ν) ,i) (12)
The maximum detection metric is found and the values of μmax and τmax are recorded.

The post FFT tones are re-demodulated and the coherent correction vectors are applied to the FFT tones. The real components of the vectors of the coherent correction are summed to produce a coherent detection metric. The demodulation calculation is carried out as follows:
In an embodiment of the invention, the offsets that are represented by μmax and τmax, +/−2 offsets have to be re-demodulated. This reduces the MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) during the second pass.
The maximum metric is found and the values of μmax and τmax recorded.
