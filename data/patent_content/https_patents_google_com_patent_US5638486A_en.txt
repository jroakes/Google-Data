Definitions
- This invention relates generally to speech-recognition systems and, in particular, to a method for identifying continuous speech.
- Applications for an automated speech-recognition device include a database query technique using voice commands, voice input for quality control in a manufacturing process, a voice-dial cellular phone which would allow a driver to focus on the road while dialing, and a voice-operated prosthetic device for the physically disabled.
- Dynamic time-warping is a technique which uses an optimization principle to minimize the errors between an unknown spoken word and a stored template of a known word. Reported data shows that the DTW technique is very robust and produces good recognition. However, the DTW technique is computationally intensive. Therefore, it is currently impractical to implement the DTW technique for real-world applications.
- the hidden-Markov modeling technique uses stochastic models for known words and compares the probability that the unknown word was generated by each model.
- the HMM technique will check the sequence (or state) of the word, and find the model that provides the best match.
- the HMM technique has been successfully used in many commercial applications; however, the technique has many drawbacks. These drawbacks include an inability to differentiate acoustically similar words, a susceptibility to noise, and computational intensiveness.
- a time-delay neural network is a type of neural network which addresses the temporal effects of speech by adopting limited neuron connections.
- a TDNN shows slightly better result than the HMM method.
- a TDNN suffers from two serious drawbacks.
- the training time for a TDNN is very lengthy, on the order of several weeks.
- the training algorithm for a TDNN often converges to a local minimum, which is not the globally optimum solution.

- Continuously spoken speech or continuous speech, takes place when a person speaking into the microphone does not un-naturally pause between each spoken sound. Rather, the person speaking only pauses when the natural form of speech dictates a pause, such as at the end of a sentence. For this reason, continuous speech can be thought of as "natural" speech which occurs in an ordinary conversation.

- Axis 160 indicates time and axis 162 indicates the magnitude of the classifier outputs.
- the voting window is defined by a starting time, which is depicted by dotted line 157; an ending time, which is depicted by dotted line 158; and a predetermined windowing interval, or duration, which is depicted by arrow 159.
- the voting window includes outputs of the first, second, and third classifiers which occur at specific time intervals t 5 -t 10 .
- FIG. 7 shows a voting window which includes a sequence of three outputs from six different classifiers, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that a voting window may include a sequence having more or less than three outputs from any number of classifiers.
- FIG. 8 conceptually illustrates an example of two voting windows.

- Voting window 174 shows an example of assigning weight values to the positions in the rank order. At each interval, the first position is assigned a weight value of three, the second position is assigned a weight value of two, the third position is assigned a weight value of one, and all other positions are assigned a weight value of zero.
- Voting window 176 shows another example of assigning weight values to the positions in the rank order. At each interval, the first three positions in a rank order are assigned the magnitudes of their corresponding classifier outputs, while the remaining positions are assigned a value of zero.
- the winning classifier of voting windows 170, 172, 174, and 176 is C3, since it generates the greatest voting sum within the duration of each voting window.
- the reason for representing a classifier output as non-parametric values, i.e., zero, one, two, three, for example, as depicted by voting window 174, is to prevent a "shouting classifier" from skewing the determination of a winning classifier.
- a shouting classifier is a classifier which, for one reason or another, generates a disproportionately large output relative to the other classifiers.
- the magnitudes of the classifier outputs are not converted to non-parametric values, one and zero as an example, a classifier which shouts at only one time interval within the voting window could be erroneously identified as the winning classifier. This could negatively affect the overall performance of the speech-recognition system.

- box 212 another voting window is defined which includes a different subset of discriminant function outputs and corresponds to a different predetermined windowing interval. Upon exiting box 212, the method returns to box 204.
- FIG. 11 shows a block diagram of a system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is used in a speech recognition of the type generally described with reference to FIG. 2 and implements the methods described in conjunction with FIG. 5.
- a plurality of classifiers each generate, over time, a sequence of individual outputs 220 in the form of output signals which are received by receiving means 222.
- Defining means 224 defines a voting window which has a duration and includes a subsequence of outputs from each of the plurality of classifiers, wherein each of the subsequence of outputs corresponds to an interval of time.
