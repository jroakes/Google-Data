- the method includes sending the media file to the first computing device from the server system such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user if the determination indicates that the media file is not stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device.
- the method also includes sending, from the server system to the first computing device or the second computing device, an instruction that causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user if the determination indicates that the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features.
- the method may include determining whether the user of the first computing device and a user of the second computing device have both opted into a service that provides for the sending of requested media items between devices on local networks when available rather than sending the requested media items from the server system.
- the method may include determining that the second computing device has sent an initial portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network but is unable to send a remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network and, in response to determining that the second computing device is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network, sending, from the server system, the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device.
- the second computing device may be unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network because the second computing device is disconnected from the local network.
- the first computing device may have sent the request for the media item across a cellular network that is not a part of the local network.
- the local network may be a non-cellular, wireless local area network.
- the local network may be an isolated local network.
- the first computing device may have sent the request to the server system across the local network and one or more intermediary networks connecting the local network to a network that includes the server system.
- a system in another aspect, includes a first computing device, a second computing device, a local network, and a server system.
- the first computing device is configured to send a request to a server system for a media file.

- the server system is configured to receive the request from the first computing device; determine that the media file is stored on the second computing device; determine that the second computing device is able to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network; and in response to determining that the media file is stored on the second computing device and that the second computing device is able to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network, send, to the first computing device or the second computing device, an instruction that causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features.
- the media file may be stored at the server system as part of a media library associated with a user of the first computing device.
- the first computing device may send the request in response to the user selecting the media file for output by the first computing device.
- the server system may be further configured to determine whether the user of the first computing device and a user of the second computing device have both opted into a service that provides for the sending of requested media items between devices on local networks when available rather than sending the requested media items from the server system.
- the server system may be further configured to determine that the second computing device has sent an initial portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network but is unable to send a remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network; and, in response to determining that the second computing device is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network, send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device.
- the second computing device may be unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network because the second computing device is disconnected from the local network.

- sending media files to a first device from a second device over a local network may result in media file transfers that do not utilize access to the Internet or Internet Service Provider networks.
- sending media files to a first device from a second device over a local network may result in media file transfers at higher speed, of shorter time, and/or of higher quality than transfers sent from the media server.
- if a media file is available for streaming from a computing device on a local network it may be less costly to stream the media file from the local network than from the cellular network if the user pays for the data provided by the cellular network on a usage basis. Additionally, cellular network bandwidth may be conserved.
- sending media files to a first device from a second device over a local network can result in media file transfers when a fault with a media server or peer device prevents the media server or peer device from sending the media file.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a system in which a media file may be served from a peer on a common internet-connected network.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a system in which a media file may be served from a peer on an isolated network.

- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- a media storage service may be provided in which users upload their media collections or media library to a media server system that is accessible over one or more connected networks, such as the Internet.
- a user may download or stream media files from his media library on the media server system to a user device in the possession of the user, such as a mobile device, and some or all of the media library may be stored on the user device.
- User's of the media storage service can opt into or subscribe to a peer- to-peer music sharing service.
- a user agrees to allow songs stored locally on his computing device to be streamed to other computing devices and for songs stored on other computing devices to be streamed to his computing device. This occurs when the computing devices are each connected to a local network (e.g., a WiFi or Bluetooth network).
- a local network e.g., a WiFi or Bluetooth network
- a user device can request a media file from a remote media server by sending the request across a cellular or other network connection to the media server.
- the media server can identify that the requesting device (e.g., a first computing device) and a source device (e.g., a second computing device) are able to communicate over a local network and are both associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service.
- the media server can send instructions to the requesting device or the source device that cause the source device to serve the media to the requesting device over the local network.
- the media may be transmitted in encrypted form over the local network between the two devices.
- two users in a coffee shop are connected to a free available WiFi local network.
- Bob wants to listen to a song he owns or has rights to that is not stored locally on his cell phone.
- the selected song is stored and available for streaming on Sally's laptop.
- Both Bob and Sally are connected to the local network and both are subscribers to the peer-to-peer media sharing service.
- the server receives the request from Bob's cell phone for the song, identifies that Bob and Sally are on the same local network (e.g., uses network address or GPS coordinates), determines that they are both subscribers to the music sharing service and instructs Sally's device to begin streaming the requested song to Bob's device.
- the server can find another source of the song for Bob (e.g., use the server copy of the song or identify another subscriber user on the local network) to provide seamless streaming of the song to Bob's cell phone.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a system 100 in which a media file may be served from a peer on a common internet-connected network.
- the system includes a first user computing device 102 and a second user computing device 104 that are connected to a local network 106 (e.g., a network where the data is routed entirely on a private backbone or, in some cases, where data is routed over a public backbone using encrypted protocols like virtual private networks (VPN)).
- the user devices 102 and 104 may be any appropriate computing device that can receive user input; store or output media files; and communicate through a network.
- Example devices include, but are not limited to, desktop computers, laptop computers, and cellular telephones.
- the user devices 102 and 104 can be connected to the local network 106 though, for example, a wireless connection such as IEEE 802.1 1x (which may be referred to as WiFi) or Bluetooth, or a wired connection, such as Ethernet, or universal serial bus (USB).
- a router 108 can connect the local network 106, and by extension user devices 102 and 104, to the Internet 1 10, and by extension to Internet connected devices such as a media server system 1 12 that includes one or more media servers 1 18 and one or more peer matchers 120.
- the user device 102 can include a media player 1 14 to request and play media files.
- the media player 1 14 can generate a request for a media file 1 16, for example in response to user input requesting that a particular media file or type of media file be output (that is, played) by the device 102.
- the request for media file 1 16 can be sent by the user device 102, through the local network 106, router 108, and Internet 1 10, to the media server 1 18.
- the media server 1 18 employs the peer matcher 120 to search for a peer to the user device 102 that can send the requested media file to the device 102 across a local network.
- the peer matcher 120 can identify suitable peers based on one or more factors factors including, but not limited to, geographic location, network compatibility, and storage of a requested media file. In this example, the peer matcher 120 may identify the user device 104 as one such peer.
- the media server 1 18 sends instructions to the user device 104, through the Internet 1 10, the router 108, and the local network 106, that cause the user device 104 to contact user device 102 across the local network 106 and transmit the requested media file to user device 102 over the local network 106.
- the media server 1 18 can send instructions to the user device 102 (these instructions not shown) that cause the user device 102 to contact the user device 104 and retrieve the requested media file from user device 104 across the local network.
- the media server 1 18 sends the media file 122 to the media player 1 14.
- the user device 104 can retrieve the media file from a media library 126 and send the media file to the user device 102 through the local network 106.
- the media player 1 14 can begin playing the media file.
- the media file 122 can be sent in blocks or an ordered stream, and the media player 1 14 can begin playing the media file 122 as the user device 102 receives the media file 122.
- the media server 1 18 can monitor the transfer of the media file 122 from the user device 104 to the user device 102. If a termination of the transfer is observed or expected (for example, because user device 104 disconnects from local network 106), the media server can send the full or remaining untransferred portions of the media file 122 to the user device 102, or locate another device on local network 106 that is storing the media file and cause the other device to send the remaining portion to the user device 102. In some implementations, such as when the media player 1 14 is streaming media for immediate consumption, the media player 1 14 can play and then discard the media file 122.
- the media server 1 18 may first determine whether the users of user device 102 and user device 104 have opted into the service before sending the instructions that cause the requested media file to be sent from user device 104 to user device 102. The media server may make this determination by, in response to receiving the request from the media file from user device 102, that the user associated with the user device 102 has opted into the service, and then cause the peer matcher 120 to limit the search for peer devices to those that have opted into the service. Alternatively, the media server 1 18 may cause the peer matcher 120 to determine the possible peers, and then eliminate those that are not associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service.
- a first user in a coffee shop is using a mobile phone 102 to run a music application that plays music from the user's library stored on a centralized server 1 12.
- the mobile phone 102 is connected to an internet connected Wi-Fi network 106 provided by the coffee shop.
- the user has opted into a media sharing service through the music application to permit streaming of music from local networked sources, where available.
- the user creates a playlist of songs in the user's library by selecting a genre of music in the music applications interface, "American Folk" for example.
- the music application generates a request for a playlist of music 1 16 which is associated with the "American Folk" genre, and sends the request to a
- the centralized server 1 12 that manages the user's library.
- the centralized server 1 12 generates a stream of songs 122 from the user's library that are associated with the "American Folk" genre and sends the stream to the user's mobile phone.
- the centralized server 1 12 also inspects a database table of known devices that are associated with users that have opted into the same media sharing service; that are known to have stored a particular music file that is also in the user's library and associated with the "American Folk" genre; and that are on the same local network as the user's mobile phone. Devices on the same local network can be identified, for example, based on both devices' internal and external IP address
- a laptop 104 used by another user in the coffee shop. Instructions 124 are sent to the laptop 104 with information about the media stream (IP address, media file identifiers, etc.). Personal information about the user of the mobile phone (user name, device type, etc.) need not be included, for example to protect the privacy of both users. Additionally, no notifications need be shown to the user of either device.
- one or both devices can display a message with anonymous data.
- a system alert on the laptop can have the text "Providing a media stream to 1 user" and an option to cancel the stream.
- a message in the music application of the mobile phone can show that music is being sent from an unnamed local network source and that audio quality will be improved compared to a stream from the centralized server 1 12 that must pass through the Internet.
- the laptop 104 can create a list of music files identified in the instructions 124 and available in a local music library 126; and can provide a stream of the files 122 to the mobile phone in place of the stream 122 provided by the centralized server.
- the centralized server 1 12 may leave the
- the centralized server 1 12 can resume providing the media stream 122.
- a user is using a tablet computing device 102 to access home movies that have been stored on a remote, internet connected media server 1 12.
- the original copies of the home movies are also stored on the user's network attached storage (“NAS") device 104.
- the tablet 102 is connected to the user's home network 106 by an 802.1 1 data connection, and the NAS 104 is connected to the user's home network 106 by an Ethernet connection.
- the user of the tablet device 102 uses a web browser 1 14 to access the user's personal library listing on the media server 1 12 and selects a video to watch.
- the media server 1 12 determines that the tablet 102 is on the same network as the NAS 104, which contains the original copy of the home movie that the user requested. As such, the media server 1 12 generates a web page with an embedded object to play the movie.
- the embedded object contains code with instructions 124 to attempt to retrieve the media file 122 from the NAS 104 if possible, or from the media server 1 12 if the NAS 104 is unavailable or unable to provide the media file 122.
- serving the home movie from the NAS 104 may provide the tablet 102 with a higher quality version of the media file, for example if the media file is compressed by the media server 1 12. Additionally, this may reduce the usage of the user's internet connection, which may have bandwidth caps, network latency, or usage charges.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a system 200 in which a media file may be served from a peer on an isolated network.
- the system includes a first user computing device 202 and a second user computing device 204.
- the user devices 202 and 204 may be any appropriate computing device that can receive user input; store or output media files; and communicate through a network.
- Example devices include, but are not limited to, desktop computers, laptop computers, and cellular telephones.
- the user devices 202 and 204 can set up and communicate though, for example, a wireless connection such as IEEE 802.1 1 x (which may be referred to as WiFi) or Bluetooth, or a wired connection, such as Ethernet, or universal serial bus (USB).
- IEEE 802.1 1 x which may be referred to as WiFi
- Bluetooth a wired connection
- Ethernet such as Ethernet, or universal serial bus (USB).
- USB universal serial bus
- the user devices 202 and 204 can be connected to internet service provider (ISP) networks 208 and 210, respectively, and by extension internet connected devices such as a media server system 212 that includes one or more media servers 1 18 and one or more peer matchers 120.
- ISP internet service provider
- the ISP network 208 and 210 may be the same ISP network, and one or both networks may be a cellular data network.
- the user device 202 can include a media player 214 to request and play media files.
- the media player 214 can generate a request for a media file 216, for example in response to user input requesting that a particular media file or type of media file be output (that is, played) by the device 102.
- the request for media file 216 can be sent by the user device 202, through the ISP network 208, to the media server 218.
- the media server 218 employs the peer matcher 220 to search for a peer to the user device 202 that can send the requested media file to the device 202 across a local isolated network.
- the peer matcher 220 may identify the user device 204 as one such peer.
- the user devices 202 and 204 may be geographically close to each other and able to set up and communicate on local network 206.
- An isolated network may be a network on which two or more user devices can communicate but which is not connected to the Internet or other networks. Some configurations of a Bluetooth or ad-hoc Wi-Fi network may be considered isolated networks.
- the local network 206 may exist at the time the request for media file 216 is sent, or it may be set up in response to determining that a peer is close to the user device 202.
- the media server 218 sends instructions to the user device 204, through the ISP network 210, that cause the user device 204 to contact user device 202 across the local network 206. If the local network 206 is not set up when the instructions to serve the media file 224 are created, instructions for the creation of the local network 206 can be included. Alternatively, the media server 218 can send instructions to the user device 202 (these instructions not shown) that cause the user device 202 to contact the user device 204 and retrieve the requested media file from the user device 204 across the local network 206. In some implementations, when no peer is identified, the media server 218 sends the media file 222 to the media player 214.
- the user device 204 can retrieve the media file from a media library 226 and send the media file to the user device 202 through the local network 206.
- the media player 214 can begin playing the media file.
- the media file 222 can be sent in blocks or an ordered stream, and the media player 214 can play a portion of the media file 222 as the user device 202 receives the media file 222.
- the media server 218 can monitor the transfer of the media file 222 from the user device 204 to the user device 202. If a termination of the transfer is observed or expected (for example, because user device 204 disconnects from isolated network 106), the media server can send the full or remaining untransferred portions of the media file 222 to the user device 202, or locate another device on local network 206 that is storing the media file and cause the other device to send the remaining portion to the user device 102.
- the media server 218 may first determine whether the users of user device 202 and user device 204 have opted into the service before sending the instructions that cause the requested media file to be sent from user device 204 to user device 202. The media server may make this determination by, in response to receiving the request for the media file from user device 202, that the user associated with the user device 202 has opted into the service, and then cause the peer matcher 220 to limit the search for peer devices to those that have opted into the service. Alternatively, the media server 218 may cause the peer matcher 220 to determine the possible peers, and then eliminate those that are not associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service.
- a first user of a user device 202 here, a mobile telephone connected to a cellular data network 208, is purchasing an audio file of a song for download and playback on the user's mobile telephone.
- the user is at a populated bus stop, surrounded by other users of other computing devices that are connected to the same or other data networks.
- the user loads a shopping application, browses a catalog of recording artists, and selects a song to purchases.
- the financial aspects of the purchase request are sent to a financial transaction server (not shown here), and the file specifications are sent to a media server 218 over the cellular network.
- a peer matcher 220 searches for computing devices that are near the user's mobile telephone, that have the purchases song stored, and that have communication capabilities that are compatible with the user's mobile telephone. Communication capabilities can include a list of network protocols across which a device can communicate and the distance for which those protocols apply.
- the peer matcher can identify a second mobile phone 204 that can communicate through a Bluetooth network and that is a meter away from the user's mobile telephone, which can also communicate through a Bluetooth network.
- the media server 218 can send instructions 224 over the cellular network to the second mobile phone 204 to create a Bluetooth network 206 between the two devices 202 and 204, and to transfer the media file 222 to the user's mobile phone.
- the user's mobile phone can receive the media file 222 from the other mobile device 204 across the Bluetooth network 206, and alert the media server 218 over the cellular network when the media file 222 is
- the media file 222 can be verified before or during this alert, for example with a hash value generated from the media file 222. If the media file 222 fails verification one or more times, the media server 218 can send instructions to one or both mobile telephones to sever the Bluetooth connection and the media server 218 can send the song file to the user's mobile telephone through the cellular data network. Similarly, the media server 218 can send the song to the device 202 through the cellular network if the other device 204 disconnects from the Bluetooth network 206.
- a first user of a user device 202 here, a laptop computer, is connected to the ISP network 208, here a cellular data network, and is listening to music in the user's library, which has been stored on a media server system 212.
- the user is at a park and other computing devices are nearby.
- the user selects a song title to play in a media library application, e.g., media player 214.

- the peer matcher 220 identifies the laptop computer and sets communication parameters for a peer search.
- the peer matcher 220 has previously determined that the laptop computer can communicate through Bluetooth at a first distance and ad-hoc Wi-Fi at a second distance.
- the location of the laptop computer is determined, by either the laptop computer or the peer matcher 220, based on cell triangulation information provided by the cellular network 208.
- a Global Positioning System unit may be included in the laptop to provide geographic location information for the laptop.
- the peer matcher 220 searches for peer devices that can communicate through Bluetooth within the first distance of the laptop device or that can communicate through ad-hoc Wi-Fi within the second distance.
- a second user device 204 here a mobile phone, is located within the first distance, and the peer matcher 220 verifies that the mobile phone can communicate through Bluetooth and stores the requested media file.
- Instructions to serve the media file 224 are generated with information about the requested media file and the laptop and sent to the mobile phone from the media server system 212 over the cellular network.
- the mobile phone sets up an isolated network 206, e.g., a Bluetooth network, and offers a music file (media file 222) to the laptop computer.
- the laptop computer Upon completion of the transfer, the laptop computer sends a message to the media server system 212 over the cellular network with an alert about the completed transfer.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing an example of a process 300 for responding to a request for a media file.
- the process 300 can be performed by, for example, systems such as the media server 1 18 and the peer matcher 120 and for clarity of presentation, the description that follows uses the system 100 as the basis of an example describing the process. However, another system, or combination of systems, may be used to perform the process 300.
- a media library that includes at least one media file and that is associated with a user is stored at a server system (302).
- a collection of media files can be stored to computer readable medium by the media server 1 18.
- the media server 1 18 can create an index of the media library files, referencing the media files by metadata such as artist, title, genre, rating, etc.
- a request is received at the server system from a requesting device for a media file, the requesting device sending the request in response to the user selecting the media file for output by the requesting computer device (304).
- the user device 102 can request a particular media file or provide criteria for a class of media files to be output to the user of the user device 102 and, in response, the user device 102 can send a request for the media file to the media server 1 18.
- the request can be part of a financial transaction, such as a purchase or rental, or a non-financial request, such as for ad supported or free media.
- the request can be transmitted from the user device 102 to the media server 1 18 through an internet connected local network or, for example, through a cellular network connection.
- the server system determines whether the media file is stored on another device that is able to send the media file to the requesting device across a local network (306).
- the peer matcher 120 can perform a search for devices that can communicate through a local network with the requesting device. In some instances, this includes searching for devices that are already connected to the local network with the requesting device. Alternatively, or additionally, this may include searching for devices that are not currently connected with the requesting device, but that could communicate if a local network was created.
- the peer matcher 120 can determine that the user device 104 may be able to communicate with the user device 102 on an internet connected network, on an isolated network, or on a network created by the user device 102 or 104.
- the peer matcher 120 can use the geographic locations of devices to determine if devices can communicate through a local network. In some examples, the peer matcher 120 can use the internal and external network addresses of user devices to determine if the user devices can communicate through a local network.
- the user device 104 can be identified as a source device, and the media library 126 can be searched.
- the media file is served by the server system to the requesting device so that the requesting device can output the media file to a user (308).
- the media server 1 18 can identify the media file in the media library and serve the file to the user device 102 through the internet connection.
- a source device If a source device is found that is able to send the media file to the requesting device across a local network, one or more commands are sent by the server to cause the source device to serve the media file to the requesting device so that the requesting device can output the media file to a user (310). Some or all of these commands can be sent to the source device, the requesting device, or both. For example, instructions can be sent to one or both user devices 102 and 104 to initiate a network connection with the other device if one such network does not exist. Instructions can be sent to one or both user devices 102 and 104 to initiate a transfer of the media file from the user device 104 to the user device 102.
- the file transfer between the source device and the requesting device is monitored to determine whether a service interruption occurs (312). That the source computing device sends at least an initial portion of the media file to the requesting computer device across the local network, but in some instances is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file across the local network.
- the media server 1 18 can remain in communication with one or both user devices 102 and 104 to monitor the status of the file transfer. Alternatively, or in addition one or both user devices 102 and 104 can report a successful or failed file transfer.
- the remaining portion of the file is served by the server to the requesting device (314). For example, if the first half of the media file is received by the user device 102 when the user device 104 is turned off or disconnected from the local network, the media server 1 18 can serve the second half of the media file to the user device 102.
- the media file is buffered and output to the user while it is being transferred. The file transfers from the user device 104 and then from the media server 1 18 can both be placed in the buffer, and the media can be output to the user without interruption.
- the server instead of serving the remaining portion of the file, can identify a second source device and send a command to the second source device (or requesting device) to cause the second source device to serve the media file to the requesting device.
