- GUI graphical user interface
- the GUI 100 includes a text entry field 102 which accepts queries from users when a search button 104 is selected, for instance.
- Queries can be text (e.g., “car”) or speech that specifies general or specific topics or other information.
- queries can comprise images or videos.
- a submitted query is transmitted to a search engine which identifies resources (e.g., images) that are responsive to the query in an index of resources of the world wide web or other corpus and then transmits search results 112 a - g to the web browser for presentation in region 112 of the GUI 100 ( FIG. 1B ).
- resources e.g., images
- a resource is any data that can be provided over a network and that is associated with a resource address such as a URL, for instance.
- Resources include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, electronic books, audio content, images, videos, electronic games, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- Images can be stored in a number of formats including, for instance, raster bitmap, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), raw image formats, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), vector format, and others.

- a resource may be stored at the location in a portion of a file that holds other content, in a single file dedicated to the resource in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- a resource may, but need not, correspond to a file.
- Search results 112 can be ranked according to traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources in view of a given query, for example.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or other provided information may be determined by any appropriate scoring technique.
- Each search result 112 a - g is a scaled-down (“thumbnail”) or full size version of an image that is responsive to the query 102 .
- a user can select a search result (e.g., thumbnail 112 a ) with a mouse click, a finger gesture on a touch-sensitive surface, a speech command to a microphone, or by way of another input device, for example, in order to view the image identified by the search result.
- selection of a search result will cause a set of images related to the selected search result to be displayed.
- GUI 114 FIG.
- a set of related queries can be presented in region 118 of the web page 114 .
- a “co-clicked image” is an image search result responsive to a query that is selected by a user within some amount of time (e.g., below a threshold such as, for instance 10 minutes) before or after selection of another image search result (or “reference image”) for the same query.
- User 1 submits query Q 1 at time T1 (e.g., by selecting the search button 104 on GUI 100 ) and then selects Q 1 image search result I 1 at time T2 (e.g., by selecting an image search result in GUI 100 ).
- User 1 selects Q 1 image search result I 2 at time T3, and Q 1 image search result I 3 at time T4.
- Each selection of an image result can be recorded as a tuple as illustrated in TABLES 2A or 2B above depending on whether a co-clicked image is assumed to occur after selection of a reference image (TABLE 2A) or before selection of a reference image (TABLE 2B).
- Each tuple includes a query, the reference image, the co-clicked image, and the time difference between selection of the reference image and selection of the co-clicked image.
- time differences are shown as multiples of a delta amount A. In some implementations, time differences are maintained as seconds or minutes. Other time representations are possible.
- tuple (Q 1 , I 1 , I 2 , 1 ⁇ ) for User 1 indicates that image results I 1 and I 2 were responsive to query Q 1 and that co-clicked image I 2 was selected 1 ⁇ after reference image I 1 .
- Tuple (Q 3 , I 1 , I 3 , 4 ⁇ ) for User 2 indicates that image results I 1 and I 3 were responsive to query Q 3 and that co-clicked image I 3 was selected 3 ⁇ 's after reference image I 1 .
- the time that a user views a selected image search result before returning to the search results list is recorded and only those selected image search results having viewing times greater than an adjustable threshold (e.g., 20 seconds) are counted as image selections for purposes of recording tuples.
- an adjustable threshold e.g. 20 seconds
- the recorded tuples can then be analyzed to determine the number of each unique image result pairs (or “frequency”), regardless of query and user.
- the image result pair I 1 , I 2 occurs three times in TABLE 2A: (Q 1 , I 1 , I 2 , 1 ⁇ ), (Q 3 , I 1 , I 2 , 2 ⁇ ), (Q 4 , I 1 , I 2 , 1 ⁇ ).
- the tuple is not counted in the number of unique image pairs.
- the image pairs in TABLE 3 assumes that the threshold amount of time is 2 ⁇ , which is why tuples (Q 3 , I 1 , I 3 , 4 ⁇ ) and (Q 4 , I 1 , I 4 , 3 ⁇ ) are not counted. If a given unique pair has a count that is above a threshold number (e.g., 100), then the co-clicked image in that pair is considered related to the reference image of the pair.
- the threshold can be decreased for a unique pair if the unique pair contains a new image in order to help promote fresh related images.
- each pair can contribute to the count of the other.
- tuples that are older than an adjustable age e.g., 3 months
- Queries associated with the unique image pairs are considered related image queries. For pair (I 2 , I 3 ), the related queries (from TABLE 2A) are Q 1 , Q 3 and Q 4 .
- a system described below with reference to FIG. 3 maintains information regarding user interaction with image search results.

The number of unique image pairs does not include image pairs that were presented in search results before a particular date. Each first image is viewed at least a threshold amount of time. The first image is determined to be pornographic and the second images are identified as being pornographic responsive to the determining.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. When a user selects an image result responsive to a query, images related to the selected image can be shown. The related images can be from the same site or domain as the selected image result or from different sites/domains if the different sites/domains are semantically related. Queries derived from the related images can also be presented. Related images can be used to suggest images and for pornographic image detection.

FIG. 1A illustrates an image search user interface as displayed in an example graphical user interface (GUI) 100 as presented in a web browser or other software application. The GUI 100 includes atext entry field 102 which accepts queries from users when asearch button 104 is selected, for instance. Queries can be text (e.g., “car”) or speech that specifies general or specific topics or other information. Alternatively, queries can comprise images or videos. A submitted query is transmitted to a search engine which identifies resources (e.g., images) that are responsive to the query in an index of resources of the world wide web or other corpus and then transmitssearch results 112 a-g to the web browser for presentation inregion 112 of the GUI 100 (FIG. 1B ). - As used herein, a resource is any data that can be provided over a network and that is associated with a resource address such as a URL, for instance. Resources include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, electronic books, audio content, images, videos, electronic games, and feed sources, to name just a few. Images can be stored in a number of formats including, for instance, raster bitmap, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), raw image formats, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), vector format, and others.
- The resources themselves can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., JavaScript scripts). Moreover, a resource may be stored at the location in a portion of a file that holds other content, in a single file dedicated to the resource in question, or in multiple coordinated files. A resource may, but need not, correspond to a file.
-
Search results 112 can be ranked according to traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources in view of a given query, for example. The relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or other provided information may be determined by any appropriate scoring technique. - Each
search result 112 a-g is a scaled-down (“thumbnail”) or full size version of an image that is responsive to thequery 102. A user can select a search result (e.g.,thumbnail 112 a) with a mouse click, a finger gesture on a touch-sensitive surface, a speech command to a microphone, or by way of another input device, for example, in order to view the image identified by the search result. In some implementations, selection of a search result will cause a set of images related to the selected search result to be displayed. By way of illustration, GUI 114 (FIG. 2 ) presents the user's selectedimage result 112 a along with a set of thumbnail icons ofrelated images 116 a-c inregion 116 of theGUI 114. In further implementations, a set of related queries can be presented inregion 118 of theweb page 114. The following sections describe how related images and their associated queries can be identified. -
TABLE 1 User Activity T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 User 1 Q1 I1 I2 I3 Q2 I4 I5 User 2 Q3 I1 I2 I3 User 3 Q4 I1 I2 I3 I4 - A “co-clicked image” is an image search result responsive to a query that is selected by a user within some amount of time (e.g., below a threshold such as, for instance 10 minutes) before or after selection of another image search result (or “reference image”) for the same query. By way of illustration, and with reference to TABLE 1 above, User 1 submits query Q1 at time T1 (e.g., by selecting the
search button 104 on GUI 100) and then selects Q1 image search result I1 at time T2 (e.g., by selecting an image search result in GUI 100). User 1 then selects Q1 image search result I2 at time T3, and Q1 image search result I3 at time T4. At time T5 User 1 submits query Q2 and then selects Q2 image search results I4 and I5 at times T6 and T7, respectively.User 2 submits query Q3 at time T2 and then selects Q3 image search results I1 and I2 at times T3 and T5, respectively. Finally, User 3 submits query Q4 at time T1 and then selects images responsive to Q4: image I1 at time T2, image I2 at time T3, image I3 at time T4, and image I4 at time T5. Note that the queries and image results in TABLE 1 can be duplicative as can the images. However, a reference image and a co-clicked image cannot be identical. In some implementations, two images are identical if they have the same resource address. In further implementations, two images are identical if their image content is identical or substantially identical (within some threshold). -
TABLE 2A Reference/Co-clicked Image Tuples (assumes a co-clicked image is selected after the reference image) USER 1 USER 2USER 3 (Q1, I1, I2, 1Δ) (Q3, I1, I2, 2Δ) (Q4, I1, I2, 1Δ) (Q1, I1, I3, 2Δ) (Q3, I1, I3, 4Δ) (Q4, I1, I3, 2Δ) (Q1, I2, I3, 1Δ) (Q3, I2, I3, 2Δ) (Q4, I1, I4, 3Δ) (Q2, I4, I5, 1Δ) (Q4, I2, I3, 1Δ) (Q4, I2, I4, 2Δ) (Q4, I3, I4, 1Δ) -
TABLE 2B Reference/Co-clicked Image Tuples (assumes a co- clicked image is selected before a reference image) USER 1 USER 2USER 3 (Q2, I5, I4, 1Δ) (Q3, I3, I2, 2Δ) (Q4, I4, I3, 1Δ) (Q1, I3, I2, 1Δ) (Q3, I3, I1, 4Δ) (Q4, I4, I2, 2Δ) (Q1, I3, I1, 2Δ) (Q3, I2, I1, 2Δ) (Q4, I3, I2, 1Δ) (Q1, I2, I1, 1Δ) (Q4, I4, I1, 3Δ) (Q4, I3, I1, 2Δ) (Q4, I2, I1, 1Δ) - Each selection of an image result can be recorded as a tuple as illustrated in TABLES 2A or 2B above depending on whether a co-clicked image is assumed to occur after selection of a reference image (TABLE 2A) or before selection of a reference image (TABLE 2B). Each tuple includes a query, the reference image, the co-clicked image, and the time difference between selection of the reference image and selection of the co-clicked image. For ease of illustration, time differences are shown as multiples of a delta amount A. In some implementations, time differences are maintained as seconds or minutes. Other time representations are possible. For instance, and with reference to TABLE 2A, tuple (Q1, I1, I2, 1Δ) for User 1 indicates that image results I1 and I2 were responsive to query Q1 and that co-clicked image I2 was selected 1Δ after reference image I1. Tuple (Q3, I1, I3, 4Δ) for
User 2 indicates that image results I1 and I3 were responsive to query Q3 and that co-clicked image I3 was selected 3Δ's after reference image I1. In some implementations, the time that a user views a selected image search result before returning to the search results list is recorded and only those selected image search results having viewing times greater than an adjustable threshold (e.g., 20 seconds) are counted as image selections for purposes of recording tuples. The idea being that the longer a user views an image result, the more relevant the result probably is for the query. -
TABLE 3 Unique Image Pairs UNIQUE PAIR COUNT I1, I2 3 I1, I3 2 I2, I3 3 I2, I4 1 I3, I4 1 I4, I5 1 - The recorded tuples can then be analyzed to determine the number of each unique image result pairs (or “frequency”), regardless of query and user. For example, the image result pair I1, I2 occurs three times in TABLE 2A: (Q1, I1, I2, 1Δ), (Q3, I1, I2, 2Δ), (Q4, I1, I2, 1Δ). In some implementations, if the time period between image result selections is above a threshold amount of time, the tuple is not counted in the number of unique image pairs. The image pairs in TABLE 3 assumes that the threshold amount of time is 2Δ, which is why tuples (Q3, I1, I3, 4Δ) and (Q4, I1, I4, 3Δ) are not counted. If a given unique pair has a count that is above a threshold number (e.g., 100), then the co-clicked image in that pair is considered related to the reference image of the pair. The threshold can be decreased for a unique pair if the unique pair contains a new image in order to help promote fresh related images. In further implementations, if two unique image pairs (Q1343, Iw, Ix, Δ) and (Q442, Iy, Iz, Δ) each have an image in the same position and the images (e.g., Iy and Iw) have different resource addresses but have identical content, then each pair can contribute to the count of the other. In yet further implementations, tuples that are older than an adjustable age (e.g., 3 months) are not considered for purposes of determine unique image result pairs. Queries associated with the unique image pairs are considered related image queries. For pair (I2, I3), the related queries (from TABLE 2A) are Q1, Q3 and Q4.
- In further implementations, if a reference image is deemed to be pornographic, images related to it can be considered pornographic.
- In various implementations, a system described below with reference to
FIG. 3 , maintains information regarding user interaction with image search results. When a user selects an image search result, the selection can be logged with the time of the selection, the amount of time the user viewed the image, the resource address of the image, and an identifier of the user such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer or a cookie value, for example. The information in TABLES 1-3 can be derived from this log, for example. -
FIG. 3 illustrates anexample search system 300 for identifying related images as can be implemented in an Internet, intranet, or other client/server environment. Thesystem 300 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components and techniques described herein can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in thesystem 300. Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums. - A user 302 (302 a, 302 b, 302 c) interacts with the
system 300 through a client device 304 (304 a, 304 b, 304 c) or other device. For example, the client device 304 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). The client device 304 generally includes a random access memory (RAM) 306 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and aprocessor 308. Theprocessor 308 is structured to process instructions on the client device 304. Theprocessor 308 is a single or multi-threaded processor having one or more processor cores, for example. Theprocessor 308 is structured to process instructions stored in the RAM 306 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 304) to display graphical information for a user interface. - The
RAM 306 on the client device 304 includes atracker software program 360 for keeping track of image result selections on the client device 304. Thetracker 360 can send the tracked data as a client-side signal 368 a into the network 312 (e.g., the Internet or other network). The data is forwarded to ananalysis system 364 as a server-side signal 368 b. Theanalysis system 364 generally includes a RAM 367 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and aprocessor 366. Theprocessor 366 is structured to process instructions on theanalysis system 364. Theprocessor 366 is a single or multi-threaded processor having one or more processor cores, for example. TheRAM 367 includes ananalyzer software program 362 for analyzing the trackingdata 368 b in order to calculate the numbers of unique image pairs. The trackingdata 368 b can be stored in one or more tracking logs 369 which are used to record the collected information for multiple users. In various implementations, the recorded information includes log entries that indicate the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the client 304 which transmitted the information, the time of selection of an image search result, the amount of time the user viewed the image, and the resource address of the image. Other data for log entries is possible. - A
user 302 a connects to thesearch engine 330 within aserver system 314 to submit aquery 315. When theuser 302 a submits thequery 315 through an input device attached to aclient device 304 a, a client-side query signal 310 a is sent into thenetwork 312 and is forwarded to theserver system 314 as a server-side input signal 310 b.Server system 314 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations. Aserver device 314 includes amemory device 316, which can include thesearch engine 330 loaded therein. Aprocessor 318 is structured to process instructions within thedevice 314. These instructions can implement one or more components of thesearch engine 330. Theprocessor 318 can be a single or multi-threaded processor and can include multiple processing cores. Theprocessor 318 can process instructions stored in thememory 316 related to thesearch engine 330 and can send information to the client devices 304 a-c, through thenetwork 312, to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 304 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser). - The server-
side input signal 310 b is received by thesearch engine 330. Thesearch engine 330 uses the information within the user query 315 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant resources (e.g., images). Thesearch engine 330 can include anindexing engine 320 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., resources on the Internet) to index the resources found in that corpus, and the index information for the resources in the corpus can be stored in anindex database 322. Thisindex database 322 can be accessed to identify resources related to theuser query 315. Thesearch engine 330 includes aranking engine 352 to rank the resources related to theuser query 315 using a scoring or ranking function. The ranking of the resources can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources in view of a given query, for example. The relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. - The
search engine 330 forwards the ranked result list within a server-sidesearch output signal 328 a through thenetwork 312. Exiting thenetwork 312, a client-side search results signal 328 b is received by theclient device 304 a where the results are stored within theRAM 306 and/or used by theprocessor 308 to display the results on an output device for theuser 302 a. Theserver system 314 may also maintain one or more user search histories based on the queries theserver system 314 receives from a user, and from results that a user selected after a search was performed. - In some implementations, when a user selects a search result (e.g., 112 g in
FIG. 1B ), a client-side result selection signal 329 a identifying the selected search result is sent into thenetwork 312 and is forwarded to theserver system 314 as a server-side input signal 310 b. Thesignal 310 b is provided to arelated image engine 356 which in response identifies images and/or queries related to the selected search result. In some implementations, the related image engine obtains the related images from theanalyzer 362. In further implementations, theanalyzer 362 is incorporated into therelated image engine 356. Thesearch engine 330 forwards the related images and/or queries within a server-sidesearch output signal 328 a through thenetwork 312. Exiting thenetwork 312, a client-side search related images signal 329 b is received by theclient device 304 a where the results are stored within theRAM 306 and/or used by theprocessor 308 to display the results on an output device for theuser 302 a (e.g., as shown inFIG. 2 ). - The components shown in
FIG. 3 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations. For example, theanalyzer 362 and therelated image engine 356 can be combined into a single component on theanalysis system 364 or theserver system 314. Therelated image engine 356 and theranking engine 352 can also be merged, and in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of resource results after a query. Moreover, a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system. -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of anexample technique 400 for providing related images. The technique determines a number of occurrences of unique image pairs wherein each image pair corresponds to a first image and a second image (step 402). See TABLE 3 above, for example. The first image and the second image in the pair were represented in search results responsive queries submitted by a number of users and the first image was selected by users before the second image. TABLE 1 illustrates user query submission and image result selection. In some implementations, the first image selected is viewed for a threshold amount of time. In other implementations, the time between selection of the first image and the second image is within an threshold amount of time. Data indicative of user selection of an image search result (e.g., 112 a fromFIG. 1B ) is received (step 404). In some implementations, the data is received by theanalysis system 364 ofFIG. 3 . One or more of the unique image pairs are selected whose first image matches the selected image and having a number of occurrences that satisfies a threshold (406). TABLE 3 lists example unique image pairs and their numbers of occurrences, for example. The second images from one or more of the selected unique image pairs are then provided (e.g., by the related image engine 356) in response to the user-selection of the image (step 408). In some implementations, the second images are provided in order of the frequency counts of their image pairs (see, e.g., TABLE 3). -
FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an example system configured to provide related images. The system generally consists of aserver 502. Theserver 502 is optionally connected to one or more user orclient computers 590 through anetwork 580. Theserver 502 consists of one or more data processing apparatus. While only one data processing apparatus is shown inFIG. 5 , multiple data processing apparatus can be used. Theserver 502 includes various modules, e.g. executable software programs, including ananalyzer 504 for analyzing user image search result selection data in order to determine related images. Arelated image engine 506 is configured to provide related images in response to user selection of an image search result. Aranking engine 508 ranks resources responsive to a query which were identified using one or more indexes maintained by theindexing engine 510. - Each module runs as part of the operating system on the
server 502, runs as an application on theserver 502, or runs as part of the operating system and part of an application on theserver 502, for instance. Although several software modules are illustrated, there may be fewer or more software modules. Moreover, the software modules can be distributed on one or more data processing apparatus connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums. - The
server 502 also includes hardware or firmware devices including one ormore processors 512, one or moreadditional devices 514, a computerreadable medium 516, acommunication interface 518, and one or moreuser interface devices 520. Eachprocessor 512 is capable of processing instructions for execution within theserver 502. In some implementations, theprocessor 512 is a single or multi-threaded processor. Eachprocessor 512 is capable of processing instructions stored on the computerreadable medium 516 or on a storage device such as one of theadditional devices 514. Theserver 502 uses itscommunication interface 518 to communicate with one ormore computers 590, for example, over anetwork 580. Examples ofuser interface devices 520 include a display, a camera, a speaker, a microphone, a tactile feedback device, a keyboard, and a mouse. Theserver 502 can store instructions that implement operations associated with the modules described above, for example, on the computerreadable medium 516 or one or moreadditional devices 514, for example, one or more of a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
- The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by a data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
- The term “data processing apparatus” encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or multiple ones, or combinations, of the foregoing. The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment can realize various different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
