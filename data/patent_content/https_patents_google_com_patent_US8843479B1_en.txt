Details of these parameters are discussed in further detail below and in association with FIGS. 4 and 5 .
- each of the documents may be scored based on the analysis performed in the Block 330 .
- the score of each document may be expressed in terms of a numerical score. For example, the score may be between “0” and “1” expressed in terms of a decimal number such as 0.51, 0.98, and 0.32.
- the documents which are scored are identified in the Block 320 .
- the score is calculated by adding up the scores attributed by the parameter analyzed in the Block 330 . In one embodiment, these scores may be stored within the database (not shown).
- the score of the document may be compared against a threshold score.
- This threshold score may be set at any determined value.
- the threshold score may be based on the subject matter of the query. For example, a query related to a popular subject matter such as “cars” may have a higher threshold score than a query related to a less popular subject matter such as “geese migration patterns”.

- the score of the qualified document is less than the threshold score, the corresponding document is excluded from the selected group in Block 370 .
- a list of documents within the selected group may be displayed to the user who requested the query.
- This list of documents may be ordered according to the score of each document. For example, the list of documents may be displayed with the highest scored document first and followed by each successively scored document. The actual score may be shown next to each document within the list.
- the qualified documents identified by the Block 320 but not included within the selected group may also be displayed.
- the flow diagram in FIG. 4 illustrates one embodiment of analyzing parameters of a document to determine the value of the document. In one embodiment, these parameters are utilized within the Block 330 ( FIG. 3 ).
- the importance of the source of the document is analyzed.
- the sources may be ranked in the order of their importance. For example, with a document relating to a news story, sources such as CNN, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times may be included with a top tier source category; sources such as the XYZ News and All News Times may be included in a second tier source category; and sources such as local news organizations may be included in, a third tier source category.
- the importance of the sources may depend on the subject matter of the particular document and may change with each unique query. For example, with a query and associated documents relating to a local news story, the local news organizations where the event which is identified in the query is geographically located may be included within the top tier source category. These local news organizations would typically be included within the third tier source category for a national event/story which is not tied to the geographical area of the local news organization. However, due at least in part to the local nature of the event related to the query, these local news organizations may be elevated to the top tier source category for this particular query based on their geography.
- the importance of the sources may also change over a period of time for the same subject matter.
- the ranking of the sources based on importance may be a continual process that is periodically updated.
- the importance of a source may be computed based on the number of views or hits received by the source.
- the importance of a source may be computed based on the circulation statistics of the source.
- the freshness of the document is computed.
- the freshness of the document may be quantified by calculating the difference between the time of publication of the document and the time of the event which is the subject of the document. For example, a time stamp which is assigned to the document may serve as the time of publication.
- the freshness of the document may be measured by obtaining the earliest time of publication among multiple documents.
- documents with similar time lags may be grouped together within the same category. For example, documents with publication times within one (1) day of the event may be considered recent. However, documents relating to very time-sensitive topics such as stock prices may be considered recent only if publication times are within five (5) minutes of the event.
- the originality of the document is analyzed. If multiple documents have similar text, an original document may be determined by referring to the time of publication. A time stamp associated with the document may serve as the time of publication. In one example, the document which was published first may be considered the original document.
- the quality of the source of the document is analyzed.
- the sources may be scored in the order of their quality. There are multiple ways to determine the quality of the source. For example, the quality of the source may be measured by awards received by the particular source. In another example, the quality of the source may be ranked by a third party.
- a source term vector describes the type of documents published by the source.
- the source term vector may, be utilized to determine the expertise of the source with respect to the query.
- the source term vector may also include a weighted set of terms. For example, if the query has the word “49er”, the sources “ESPN” and “San Francisco Chronicle” may have a high score in the source term vector by the topical and regional focus, respectively.
- the source term vector for a particular source may change over a period of time and may be updated periodically.
- the flow diagram in FIG. 5A illustrates one embodiment of analyzing parameters of documents within a cluster and computing a cluster score for the documents within the corresponding cluster.
- These parameters shown in FIG. 5A relate to characteristics of a cluster associated with the document.
- the cluster contains a plurality of documents which share a common theme.
- a cluster may include documents which are related to Porsche cars.
- the parameters which relate to the cluster also play a role in scoring individual documents which are contained within the cluster.
- a cluster score may be assigned to the documents within the cluster based on, in part, the parameters described within FIG. 5A .
- the cluster score may be related, in part, to a centroid corresponding to the cluster.
- the following parameters may contribute to the cluster score and may be utilized within the Block 330 ( FIG. 3 ).
- the diversity of the sources contributing documents within the cluster is analyzed.
- the number of sources within a cluster is a parameter which may affect the importance, of the cluster and the cluster score. For example, when a large number of sources contribute documents within the cluster, the cluster is typically a popular and/or an important topic.
- the cluster score assigned to the document within the cluster is also based on the diversity of sources contributing documents within the cluster.
- the international diversity of the sources which contribute a document within the cluster may also influence the cluster score. For example, if there are sources from multiple countries for the documents within the cluster, a higher cluster score (based on the diversity of sources) may be assigned compared to a different cluster having documents authored by sources from a single country.
- the importance of the country may also influence the cluster score when multiple clusters have sources from a similar number of countries contributing documents within their respective clusters.
- Block 520 the importance of the sources contributing documents within the cluster is analyzed. Various techniques for measuring the importance of a source are explained in association with the Block 410 in FIG. 4 .
- the recency of coverage within the cluster is analyzed.
- the most recent document published within the cluster may indicate the relevancy of the cluster.
- a time stamp of a document may establish the time of publication. For, example, a document within a cluster which has its most recent document published two (2) minutes ago may be assigned a higher cluster score with respect to recency within the cluster compared to a document within a different cluster which has its most recent document published more than two (2) years ago.
- the recency of coverage may be computed for the cluster by using a weighted sum over the original documents within the cluster.
- a weighting scheme is utilized where a higher weight is given for fresher and more recent document.
- each document within a cluster may be sorted and assigned a bin that corresponds with the age of the document.
- Each bin is configured to accept documents within a time range and corresponds with a specific weighting factor.
- the specific weighting factor corresponds with the time range of the documents within the bin. In one embodiment, the weighting factor increases as the time range corresponds with more recent documents.
- FIG. 5B illustrates the use of bins relative to the weighted sum in computing the recency of coverage.
- Bins 560 , 565 , 570 , 575 , and 580 are shown for exemplary purposes. Additional or fewer bins may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention.
- the bin 560 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged less than 60 minutes.
- the documents within the bin 560 are assigned a weighting factor of 24.
- the bin 565 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 60 minutes and less than 2 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 565 are assigned a weighting factor of 20.
- the bin 570 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 2 hours and less than 4 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 570 are assigned a weighting factor of 15.
- the bin 575 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 4 hours and less than 24 hours. In, this example, the documents within the bin 575 are assigned a weighting factor of 3.
- the bin 580 may have a time range which includes documents that have aged more than 24 hours. In this example, the documents within the bin 580 are assigned a weighting factor of ⁇ 1.
- the cluster score may be calculated, in part, by multiplying the number of documents within each bin with the corresponding weighting factor and summing the results from each of these multiplications.
- a cluster contains documents with the following distribution of documents: bin 560 contains 2 documents, bin 565 contains 0 documents, bin 570 contains 1 document, bin 575 contains 5 documents, and bin 580 contains 10 documents.
- a sample calculation for a cluster score is shown in Equation 1.
- sample cluster score 3 ⁇ 24+0*20+1*15+5*3+10* ⁇ 1 Equation 1
- the diversity of documents within the cluster is analyzed.
- the overall number of documents within the cluster may be identified.
- duplicate documents may also be identified.
- the original documents may be weighted more heavily with a higher score compared to the duplicate documents.
- a cluster has a cluster score based on the diversity of documents within the cluster.
- a document within the cluster is also assigned the cluster score, because the cluster score has an impact on the overall score of the document.
- the expertise of the cluster with respect to the query is analyzed.
- the centroid may uniquely describe the topic of the cluster and may be utilized to determine the expertise of the cluster with respect to the query.
- the centroid may be computed by averaging individual term vectors from the documents contained within the cluster published by the source.
- the term vectors may include a weighted set of terms.

Details of these factors are discussed in further detail below in association with FIG. 7 .
- the selected sources may be considered premier sources which are trusted and may be referred to as “golden sources”.
- content from documents from the selected sources are analyzed. For example, documents from the selected sources are identified, and the content from these documents is analyzed.
- a topic or subject matter may be extrapolated from the analysis of the content from each of these documents originating from the selected sources.
- Each document may contains a document vector which describes the topic or subject matter of the document.
- the document vector may also contain a key term which characterizes the topic of the document.
- subject clusters are defined.
- the subject clusters may be defined based, at least in part, on the topics found in the Block 630 .
- the subject clusters may be defined by the topics found within the documents published by the selected sources.
- a subject cluster for a particular topic may be formed when a predetermined threshold is achieved.
- the predetermined threshold may be defined to include X number of documents which belong to the particular topic for the subject cluster.

- identifying selected sources may be utilized within the Block 620 ( FIG. 6 ). These selected sources may also be referred to as “golden sources”.
- original documents which are published by the source are detected.
- duplicate documents which are published by the source may be removed. For example, duplicate documents which are published more than once by the source may be removed so that only the original document remains. Duplicate documents may be found by comparing the text of the documents published by the source. If the text of both documents are a close match, then one of the documents may be considered a duplicate.
- non-original documents which are published by the source may also be removed.
- non-original documents may be found by comparing the text of the document published by the source and the text of another document published by a different source.
