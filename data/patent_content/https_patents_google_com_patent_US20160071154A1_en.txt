The contextual content may include a targeted advertisement, a targeted search result, or other type of contextual content.
Description
- The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/650,765, filed Dec. 31, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
- 1. Technical Field
- This application relates to identifying a location using three-dimensional positional information and, in particular, to a three-dimensional taxonomy server that identifies the location based on a three-dimensional position of a client device.
- 2. Related Art
- A client device, such as a cellular phone, personal display assistant, or other client device, may be able to identify its geographic location. For example, the client device may include a global positioning system (“GPS”) module that provides two-dimensional positional information, such as latitude and longitude, of the client device. The client device may, in turn, provide this information to a server or other host device for identifying the location of the client device.
- The server or other host device may use the two-dimensional positional information to generate context data for consumption by the client device. The context data may take the form of an on-line advertisement, targeted search result, or other type of contextual data. However, with the increased popularity of client devices and the increased distribution of GPS modules, client devices are appearing in areas where identifying the location of the client device can be problematic, such as in multi-story buildings or densely populated areas. In these problematic situations, identifying the location of the client device based on the two-dimensional positional information is insufficient.
- A system for identifying a location based on a three-dimensional position of a client device comprises a memory storage device that includes a three-dimensional taxonomy database. The three-dimensional database has a plurality of three-dimensional taxonomy records such that each three-dimensional taxonomy record specifies a corresponding location. Moreover, a selected one of the plurality of three-dimensional taxonomy records includes a three-dimensional taxonomy record identifier that identifies the at least one three-dimensional taxonomy record and three-dimensional geographic location information that identifies a geographic position of the location corresponding to the at least one three-dimensional taxonomy record.
- The system also includes a processor operative to receive three-dimensional positional information from a client device that identifies a three-dimensional position of the client device, extract elevation information from the three-dimensional positional information that identifies the elevation of the client device, and identify the selected three-dimensional taxonomy record based on mapping the elevation information of the client device to the three-dimensional geographic location information of the selected three-dimensional taxonomy record. Furthermore, the processor may be further operative to output the three-dimensional taxonomy record identifier of the selected three-dimensional taxonomy record. Alternatively, or in addition, the processor may be further operative to output a data stream representative of a renderable display indicative of the location based on the extracted three-dimensional taxonomy record identifier.
- In addition, in one implementation, the three-dimensional geographic location information may include global positioning system coordinates and at least one global positioning system coordinate of the global positioning system coordinates may be a coordinate indicative of elevation above sea level. Moreover, the processor may be further operative to translate the elevation information to translated elevation information comprising an elevation value indicative of the client device's elevation above sea level and map the elevation information to the three-dimensional geographic location information of the selected three-dimensional taxonomy record by mapping the translated elevation information to the at least one global positioning system coordinate.
- In another implementation, the location identified by the three-dimensional taxonomy record may be a first location the three-dimensional geographic location information may comprise relative height information that identifies the height of the location relative to a second location. In this alternative implementation, the processor may be further operative to translate the elevation information to translated elevation information comprising a relative elevation value indicative of the client device's elevation relative to the second location, and map the elevation information to the three-dimensional geographic information of the selected three-dimensional taxonomy record by mapping the translated elevation information to the relative height information.
- Moreover, in the preceding alternative implementation, the second location may be a building comprising a plurality of floors and the relative elevation value may indicate that the first location is located on a selected floor of the plurality of floors. In addition, the translated elevation information may indicate that the client device is located on the selected floor of the building, and the at least one three-dimensional taxonomy record may be identified when the relative elevation value is mapped to the relative height information.

A selected one of the plurality of three-dimensional taxonomy records comprises a three-dimensional taxonomy record identifier that identifies the at least one three-dimensional taxonomy record, and three-dimensional geographic location information that identifies a geographic position of the location corresponding to the at least one three-dimensional taxonomy record.

For example, thenetwork 112 may employ transmission protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”), packet-switched protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (“IP”), wireless protocols, such as 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth, and WiMAX, voice communication protocols, such as the H.323 protocol, or any other protocol now known or later developed. - The client devices 104-110 are equipped to provide three-dimensional positional information to the three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102. In one implementation, theclient device 104 is equipped to receive GPS coordinates from one ormore GPS satellites 114. For example, theclient device 104 may receive GPS coordinates from four ormore GPS satellites 114. The client device may also receive GPS coordinates from an alternative number ofGPS satellites 114. The GPS coordinates may include a number of coordinates including a latitude coordinate, a longitude coordinate, an elevation coordinate or any other type of coordinate. The elevation coordinate may be based on a mathematical model representing the Earth's near-spherical surface. For example, the GPS module may determine the elevation coordinate based on a reference ellipsoid that approximates the Earth's surface. Alternatively, the GPS module may determine the elevation coordinate using orthometric height, which is generally considered the height above the geoid. The geoid may be determined by the Earth's gravity at the location of theclient device 104 and approximated by mean sea level. The elevation coordinate based on the reference ellipsoid may be the same, or different from, the elevation coordinate approximated by mean sea level. - Alternatively, the
client device 104 itself may determine the elevation coordinate or three-dimensional positional information. For example, theclient device 104 may calculate speed and direction of movement to determine three-dimensional position information. Theclient device 104 may include one or more gyroscopes, accelerometers, altimeters, barometers, or other sensing devices, and, based on the measurements from those devices, theclient device 104 may ascertain its own three-dimensional positional information. As one example, where theclient device 104 is located in an elevator and moves in an upward direction for thirty seconds at a determinable speed, theclient device 104 may be operative to calculate its elevation relative to its previous location, such as the ground floor of the elevator. Other mechanisms or devices for providing the elevation coordinate may also be in communication with theclient device 104. In another implementation, theclient device 106 is equipped to receive an IP address from a wired orwireless network 116, and theclient device 106 may provide the IP address to the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 as, or part of, the three-dimensional positional information. The IP address may be any type of network address, such as an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a combination thereof. As discussed later below, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may be configured to identify the location of theclient device 106 based on the provided IP address, for instance by reverse geocoding. - In yet a third implementation, the
client device 108 may be in communication with one or morecellular networks 118 and employ mobile positioning technology to provide the three-dimensional positional information to the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102. The mobile positioning technology may include measuring power levels and antenna patterns to determine the location of theclient device 108. - More particularly, the
client device 108 may employ, or rely on, one or more types of localization-based systems to assist three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 in determining the location of theclient device 108. Examples of a localization-based system include, but are not limited to, a network-based localization system, a handset-based localization system, or a combination of network-based and handset-based localization systems. In general, a network-based localization system focuses on using a telecommunication service provider's network infrastructure to identify the location of the handset. In contrast, a handset-based localization system focuses on software installed, or hardware located, on theclient device 108 to calculate the location of theclient device 108 through cell identification, signal strengths of the home and neighboring cells, and/or latitude and longitude coordinates acquired by GPS technology. The calculated location may then be sent to the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 as, or part of, the three-dimensional positional information. A hybrid-based localization system employs both network-based and handset-based techniques to calculate the location of theclient device 108, such as Assisted GPS. - In yet another implementation, a
client device 110 may receive the three-dimensional position information from auser 120. For example, theuser 120 may input the local address to theclient device 110 or theuser 120 may input latitudinal coordinates, longitudinal coordinates, and elevation to theclient device 110. In another example, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may employ a feedback loop to collect and refine three-dimensional positional information or three-dimensional geographic information for a location. One example of using a feedback loop to refine three-dimensional positional information or three-dimensional geographic information is discussed with reference toFIGS. 6-7 . In summary, theclient device 110 may receive user input from auser 120 to provide the three-dimensional positional information to the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102. - Moreover, any one or combination of the above techniques may be used to provide three-dimensional positional information of a client device to the three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102. For example, aclient device 104 may initially acquire GPS coordinates from one ormore GPS satellites 114 to form baseline or initial three-dimensional positional information. The baseline or initial three-dimensional positional information may then be supplemented, or augmented by, additional information acquired fromlocal networks 116,cellular networks 118, and/or auser 120. For example, theuser 120 may particularly define the elevation information of the three-dimensional positional information if the baseline or initial elevation information is incomplete, inaccurate, or missing. The user-provided elevation information may be absolute elevation information regarding theclient device 104, such as the number of feet above sea level, or may be relative elevation information, such as the floor of a building where theclient device 104 is located in a multi-story building. Other combinations of the techniques described above are also possible. -
FIG. 2 illustrates one example of the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 in communication with aclient device 218. Theclient device 218 may be the same, or different from, one or more of the client devices 104-110 shown inFIG. 1 . The three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 is operative to identify the location of theclient device 218 based on the three-dimensional positional information received from theclient device 218. In addition, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may be further operative to add, modify, or remove location information previously stored in the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102. - In one implementation, the three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 includes amemory storage device 202, aninput interface 206, aprocessor 208, and anoutput interface 210. Thememory storage device 202 may be any type of memory storage device, such as a hard drive or Random Access Memory (“RAM”), or any other computer-readable medium now known or later developed. Theinput interface 206 may be any type of input interface, such as a Universal Serial Bus (“USB”) interface, a serial interface, a parallel interface, a network interface (such as Ethernet), or any other type of input interface now known or later developed. Theoutput interface 210 may be any type of output interface, such as a USB interface, a serial interface, a parallel interface, a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (“HDMI”), a Digital Visual Interface (“DVI”), a network interface, an optical fiber interface (such as TOSLINK), or any other output interface now known or later developed. - The
processor 208 may be any type of processor, such as a hardware processor, a software processor, or a combination. Theprocessor 208 communicates inputs received from theinput interface 206 to thememory storage device 202. Similarly, theprocessor 208 communicates outputs from thememory storage device 202 to theoutput interface 210. In addition, theprocessor 208 may facilitate the manipulation of data provided to or received from one or more of the modules and database residing in thememory storage device 202. - In one implementation, the
memory storage device 202 includes apresentation access module 212, a three-dimensional taxonomy database 214, and atranslation module 216. Thepresentation access module 212, the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214, and/or thetranslation module 216 may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof. As examples of software, thepresentation access module 212, the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214, and/or thetranslation module 216 may be implemented in a computer programming language, such as C, C++, C#, Java or other computer programming language now known or later developed. As examples of hardware, one or more of thepresentation access module 212, the three-dimensional database 214, and/ortranslation module 216 may be implemented as a separate processor or as a separate computer in communication with the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102. - The
presentation module 212 facilitates the input and output of data to the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214. In one implementation, thepresentation module 212 receives three-dimensional positional information from theclient device 218 that identifies the three-dimensional position of the client device. As discussed above, thepresentation access module 212 may receive the three-dimensional positional information via theprocessor 208 through theinput interface 206. The three-dimensional positional information from theclient device 218 may then be used as input to the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214 to determine the location of theclient device 218. Moreover, the three-dimensional positional information from theclient device 218 may be used to update or modify the information stored by the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214. - The three-
dimensional taxonomy database 214 is operative to store three-dimensional geographic location information about one or more locations. The three-dimensional geographic location information may describe the geographic location of a location, such as a business, retailer, point of interest, or other location. Similar to the three-dimensional positional information, the three-dimensional geographic location information may include global positioning system coordinates, one or more IP addresses, cellular network information, and/or previously-provided user input about a location. As discussed with reference toFIGS. 3A and 3B , the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214 may store the three-dimensional geographic location information in one or more three-dimensional taxonomy records. -
FIG. 3A shows one example of a three-dimensional taxonomy record 302 that specifies a corresponding location. The three-dimensional taxonomy record 302 may include one or more three-dimensional taxonomy record fields 304-316 for specifying the corresponding location. - In one implementation, the three-
dimensional taxonomy record 302 includes a three-dimensional taxonomyrecord identifier field 304, abusiness name field 306, anaddress information field 308, alatitude field 310, alongitude field 312, afloor field 314, and adetailed information field 316. - Alternative or additional three-dimensional taxonomy record fields may also be possible for a three-dimensional taxonomy record. For example,
FIG. 3B shows another example of a three-dimensional taxonomy record 318 that specifies a corresponding location. The three-dimensional taxonomy record 318 includes a three-dimensional taxonomy record identifier field 320, abusiness name field 322, anaddress information field 324, alatitude field 326, alongitude field 328, anelevation field 330, and adetailed information field 332. As another example,FIG. 3C shows a third example of a three-dimensional taxonomy record 334 that includes a three-dimensional taxonomy record identifier field 336, abusiness name field 338, anaddress information field 340, alatitude field 342, alongitude field 344, anIP address field 346, and adetailed information field 348. - Table 1 below explains the data stored by each of the three-dimensional taxonomy record fields 304-316 and/or three-dimensional taxonomy record fields 320-332.
-
TABLE 1 Three-dimensional Taxonomy Record Field Brief Explanation Record Identifier A unique alphanumeric identifier that identifies the three-dimensional taxonomy record. Business Name Identifies the business or point of interest name for the location corresponding to the three-dimensional taxonomy record. Address Information Identifies the address for the business or the point of interest. Latitude Identifies the latitude for the business or the point of interest. The specificity of the latitude may vary according to business or point of interest. Longitude Identifies the longitude for the business or the point of interest. The specificity of the longitude may vary according to the business or point of interest. Floor Identifies the floor of a building on which the business or point of interest resides. The floor three-dimensional taxonomy record field may be populated according to whether the business or point of interest resides on a floor of a building. Elevation Identifies the elevation of the business or point of interest. The elevation field may or not be populated. The elevation field may be approximate elevation, elevation above sea level, or any other type of elevation. As discussed previously, one or more mathematical techniques may be used to approximate the elevation of the location corresponding to the three-dimensional taxonomy record. IP Address Identifies the IP address of the business or point of interest. The IP address field may or not be populated. The IP address field may be a specific IP address for the business or point of interest, a general subnet address, or any other type of address. Detailed Information Populated with varying information, such as editorial commentary, user reviews, descriptive information, or other information. The detailed information three- dimensional taxonomy record field may also point to another record, table, or database for additional information regarding the location corresponding to the three-dimensional taxonomy record. - The first example of a three-
dimensional taxonomy record 302, the second example of a three-dimensional taxonomy record 318, and/or the third example of a three-dimensional taxonomy record 334 may be configured to store different components of three-dimensional geographic location information for a corresponding location. For example, the three-dimensional taxonomy record 302 is configured to store relative height information as part of the three-dimensional geographic location information. The relative height information may identify the height of the location identified by the three-dimensional taxonomy record 302 relative to a second location, such as a building. For example, the location may be a business operated on a selected floor of a multi-story or multi-floor building, such as the third floor of the building, and the relative height information may identify that the business is located on the third floor of the building. As briefly described in Table 1 above, the floor three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 314 is configured to store this relative height information. - In other implementation, the three-dimensional taxonomy may store a floor plan or floor map of the building in which the location is located. The floor plan or floor map may be stored in a separate field of the three-dimensional taxonomy record or as part of another field, such as the detailed information three-dimensional
taxonomy record field 316/332/348. The floor plan or floor map may be referenced in determining or ascertaining the floor on which the location is located. For example, an address may be used to identify the building in which the location is located, and then the floor plan or floor map may then be further referenced to more accurately determine the interior position of the location. - As a different example to storing relative height information, a three-dimensional taxonomy record may store absolute or approximated elevation. The three-
dimensional taxonomy record 318 is configured to store elevation information as part of the three-dimensional geographic location information. As previously discussed above, the elevation information may be based on a mathematical model representing the Earth's near-spherical surface. For example, the elevation information may be based on a reference ellipsoid that approximates the Earth's surface. Alternatively, the elevation information may be determined by the Earth's gravity at the geographic location of the business or point of interest, and approximated by mean sea level. The elevation information based on the reference ellipsoid may be the same, or different from, the elevation information approximated by mean sea level. - As yet another example to storing relative height information, a three-dimensional taxonomy record may store an IP address associated with the business or point of interest, such as an IP address assigned by an Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) or an IP address of the subnet on which the business or point of interest resides. The IP address may be any type of network address, such as an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a combination thereof. The three-
dimensional taxonomy record 334 is configured to store the IP address in the IP address three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 346 as part of the three-dimensional geographic location information. - Moreover, a three-dimensional taxonomy record may include relative information, approximated or absolute elevation information, or IP address information. For example, a three-dimensional taxonomy record may include any combination of the data fields shown in
FIGS. 3A-3C and, more particularly, any combination of the floor three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 314, elevation three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 330, and IP address three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 346. - Turning back to
FIG. 2 , the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 includes atranslation module 216 operative to translate elevation information received from theclient device 218 based on the data fields of the three-dimensional taxonomy records stored in the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214. For example, when three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 initially receives three-dimensional positional information from theclient device 218, theprocessor 208 may extract elevation information from the three-dimensional positional information. Depending on the components of the three-dimensional positional information transmitted by theclient device 218, the elevation information may include relative elevation information, approximated elevation information, one or more IP addresses, cellular network information, or any other components. - In one implementation, the
translation module 216 translates the approximated elevation information of theclient device 218 to a relative elevation value for the location of theclient device 218. For example, the latitude and longitude of theclient device 218 may correspond to one or more three-dimensional taxonomy records that indicate that theclient device 218 is located in a multi-story building. Based on the determination that theclient device 218 is located in a multi-story building, thetranslation module 216 may translate the elevation information by approximating the distances between businesses located in the multi-story building, and then converting the approximated elevation information to an elevation value indicative of the client device's elevation relative to the multi-story building. - Alternatively, the detailed information field of the three-dimensional taxonomy record corresponding to the longitude and latitude of the
client device 208 may indicate that the multi-story building uses a predetermined distance between floors. Based on the predetermined distance between floors, thetranslation module 216 may convert the approximated elevation information to relative elevation value indicative of the client device's 208 location within the multi-story building. - Accordingly, the translated elevation information may indicate that the
client device 218 is located on the fourth floor of the multi-story building. Theprocessor 208 may then use the translated elevation information to further identify a three-dimensional taxonomy record that corresponds to the location of theclient device 218. - In another implementation, the
translation module 216 translates the elevation information received from theclient device 218 to an elevation value stored in a three-dimensional taxonomy record. For example, the three-dimensional positional information may indicate that theclient device 218 is located at latitude and longitude corresponding to a multi-story building, but the three-dimensional geographic location information stored in the three-dimensional taxonomy record of the multi-story building indicates that a different mathematical model was used to determine the elevation of theclient device 218. Based on the differences between the mathematical model used to determine the elevation of the location and the mathematical model used to determine the elevation of theclient device 218, thetranslation module 216 then translates the elevation information of theclient device 218 to an elevation value commensurate with the mathematical model used to determine the elevation of the location. Based on the translated elevation value, theprocessor 208 may then identify the three-dimensional taxonomy record corresponding to three-dimensional positional information and the translated elevation information. - Following is a description of adding a new location to the three-
dimensional taxonomy database 214. While the description below describes adding a new location, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may further permit modifications to the three-dimensional taxonomy records. Modifications may include modifications to the three-dimensional taxonomy records or the data fields of the three-dimensional taxonomy records. Examples of modifications include additions, deletions, edits, revisions, removals, or any other type of modifications. - In one implementation, a user provides three-dimensional geographic location information to the three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 for a location via theclient device 218. For example, thepresentation access module 212 may output a display for receiving input from theclient device 218. The display may be a form formatted based on the Hypertext Extensible Markup Language (“HTML”) and may have one or more form fields for receiving input from the user of theclient device 218. The form fields may correspond to one or more of the three-dimensional taxonomy record fields for a three-dimensional taxonomy record. The user may input data, such as a name for the location/business/point of interest, an address, a longitude, a latitude, an elevation or relative elevation, or other data, into one or more of the form fields using theclient device 218. - Alternatively, the data for the three-dimensional taxonomy record may be automatically provided by the
client device 218. For example, when theclient device 218 communicates with the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102, theclient device 218 may automatically provide selected three-dimensional geographic location information, such as latitude, longitude, approximated elevation or relative elevation, an IP address, or other selected three-dimensional geographic location information. Moreover, the selected three-dimensional geographic location information may be provided along with user-provided three-dimensional geographic location information. - In yet another implementation, the
presentation access module 212 may output a graphical user interface displaying the environment near theclient device 218. The graphical user interface may be rendered as a two-dimensional environment, a three-dimensional environment, or a combination of two- and three-dimensions. - When representing the environment in two dimensions, the graphical user interface may include menu elements, such as buttons, drawing tools, clickable form fields, or other elements that assist the user in annotating or otherwise describing a location represented in the two-dimensional environment. For example, similar to the aforementioned form displayed as an HTML file, the graphical user interface may display predetermined elements that correspond to one or more of the three-dimensional taxonomy record fields. By selecting or manipulating the predetermined elements, the user or the
client device 218 may provide three-dimensional geographic location information about the location where theclient device 218 is located. In one scenario, this may be done via an augmented reality application. - Furthermore, when representing the environment in three dimensions, and in addition to displaying features shown in the two-dimensional graphical user interface, the graphical user interface may display a graphical environment that approximates the environment where the
client device 218 is located. Moreover, the three-dimensional graphical user interface may represent the user or theclient device 218 with an avatar, that is, a three-dimensional representation, within the three-dimensional environment. The graphical user interface may permit the user or theclient device 218 to manipulate the avatar so as to move the avatar about the three-dimensional environment. Using the avatar, the user or theclient device 218 may then annotate or manipulate images shown in the three-dimensional environment to populate one or more three-dimensional taxonomy record fields for a three-dimensional taxonomy record. - Although the graphical user interface may display a two- or three-dimensional environment of where the
client device 218 is located, the graphical user interface may also allow the user or theclient device 218 to display a different environment other than where theclient device 218 is located. Hence, the user or theclient device 218 may modify or add a three-dimensional taxonomy record for a location other than the location of the user or theclient device 218. - Moreover, while the description above references the
presentation access module 212 as displaying the HTML file and/or the two-dimensional/three-dimensional environment, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may operate in conjunction with another server or computer that outputs the display to the user orclient device 218. For example, thepresentation access module 212 may facilitate access to the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214 between the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 and the other server or computer. Hence, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may be able to operate in unison with different types of servers and/or computers that are operative to display different types of graphical user interfaces to the user or theclient device 218. - Turning next to
FIG. 4 is an illustration of one example of a three-dimensionalgeographic advertising system 402 in communication with theclient device 218. The three-dimensionalgeographic advertising system 402 includes the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 and anadvertising server 404. The three-dimensionalgeographic advertising system 402 is operative to deliver a targeted advertisement to theclient device 218 based on the three-dimensional positional information transmitted by theclient device 218. - To deliver targeted advertisements to the
client device 218, in one implementation, theadvertising server 404 may include, or be in communication an advertiser/keyword database 406 and a keyword/advertisement database 408. - In one implementation, the advertiser/
keyword database 406 associates keywords with advertisers. For example, the advertiser/keyword database 406 may include one or more advertiser records that associate a particular advertiser, or type of advertiser, with one or more keywords. An advertiser record may identify the particular advertiser “Kentucky Fried Chicken” and associate this particular advertiser with the keywords “chicken,” “fast food,” “restaurant,” or any other keyword. Alternatively, an advertiser record may identify a “fast food restaurant” as a type of advertiser and associate the “fast food restaurant” with the keywords “chicken,” “burger,” “fast food,” “restaurant,” or any other keyword. The advertiser/keyword database 406 may also include a combination of advertiser-specific advertiser records and advertiser-type advertiser records. - In one implementation, the keyword/
advertisement database 408 associates keywords with advertisements. The keyword/advertisement database 408 may include one or more advertisement records that associate one or more keywords with the advertisements. Each of the keywords associated with the advertisement may be selected based on their commonality with the advertisement. For example, the keyword/advertisement database 408 may include an advertisement record for a restaurant advertisement associated with the keywords “restaurant,” “eatery,” “chicken,” “burger,” or any other keyword. As another example, the keyword/advertisement database 408 may include an advertisement record for a razor advertisement associated with the keywords “razor,” “shaving,” “facial hair,” or any other keyword. Alternative or additional types of advertisement records are also possible. - The advertisement referenced, or stored, by advertisement record may be any type of advertisement, such as a textual advertisement, a graphical advertisement, or a combination thereof. A textual advertisement may include only text, a graphical advertisement may include only graphics, and a textual-graphical advertisement may include both graphics and text. The
advertising server 404 may be configured to deliver the advertisement referenced, or stored, by the advertisement record as the targeted advertisement to theclient device 218. -
FIG. 5 illustrates one example of message flow 502 for the three-dimensionalgeographic advertising system 402. Aclient device 218 may transmit a search query and the search query, or a portion thereof, may be transmitted to the advertising server 404 (504). Theadvertising server 404 may parse the search query to identify three-dimensional positional information embedded within, or transmitted with, the search query. Alternatively, theadvertising server 404 may transmit a request for the three-dimensional positional information to theclient device 218 in response to receiving the search query or other query. - The three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 may then receive the three-dimensional positional information from theclient device 218 via the advertising server 404 (506). When the three-dimensional positional information is received, theprocessor 208, thepresentation access module 212, or other component of the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may extract elevation information from the three-dimensional positional information. Depending on the elevation information extracted from the three-dimensional positional information, thetranslation module 216 may translate the elevation information (508). For example, thetranslation module 216 may translate the elevation information to an elevation value indicative of the client device's 218 elevation above sea level, such as an elevation value of 1,000 feet above sea level. Alternatively, thetranslation module 216 may translate the elevation information to a relative elevation value indicative of the client device's 218 elevation relative to a building, such as a relative elevation value of being on the seventh floor of a building having twenty-one floors. - After performing a translation, the
translation module 216 may then transmit the translated elevation to theprocessor 208, or other component, for selecting a three-dimensional taxonomy record from the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214. Theprocessor 208, or other component, may identify a three-dimensional taxonomy record corresponding to the location of theclient device 218 based on mapping the elevation information of theclient device 218 to the three-dimensional geographic location information of a three-dimensional taxonomy record (510). For example, theprocessor 208 may map the three-dimensional positional information, including the elevation information whether translated or not, to one or more fields of a three-dimensional taxonomy record. - Mapping the three-dimensional positional information may include comparing values of the three-dimensional positional information, include the elevation information or translated elevation information, with values stored by one or more fields of a three-dimensional taxonomy record. In one implementation, the three-dimensional positional information is mapped to the latitude three-dimensional
taxonomy record field 310, the longitude three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 312, and the floor three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 314. Other mappings involving other fields, such as the elevation three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 330, the IP address three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 346, the address information three-dimensionaltaxonomy record field 308/324/340 are also possible. - In mapping the three-dimensional positional information, the three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 may employ a margin of error to account for slight differences between the three-dimensional positional information and the values stored by one or more fields of a three-dimensional taxonomy record. Alternatively, a field of a three-dimensional taxonomy record may include a range of values, and the three-dimensional taxonomy record may be selected when the three-dimensional positional information is contained within the range of the values stored in the three-dimensional taxonomy record field. - When the three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 has identified a three-dimensional taxonomy record having values equal to, similar to, or enclosing the three-dimensional positional information, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may extract therecord identifier 304/320/336 of the three-dimensional taxonomy record (512). Therecord identifier 304/320/336 may then be transmitted to the advertising server 404 (514). - The
advertising server 404 may then deliver a targeted advertisement to theclient device 218 based on the receivedrecord identifier 304/320/336. Theadvertising server 404 may first use therecord identifier 304/320/336 to select an advertiser record from the advertiser/keyword database 406 (516). For example, an advertiser record may have an advertiser record field containing a value similar, or equal, to therecord identifier 304/320/336. From the advertiser record, theadvertising server 404 may extract one or more keywords associated with the advertiser identified by therecord identifier 304/320/336. - After extracting one or more keywords from the selected advertiser record, these keywords may be passed to the keyword/
advertisement database 408 to select one or more advertisements from the keyword/advertisement database 408 (518). Theadvertising server 404 may identify one or more advertising records as being associated with the selected keywords (520). - The advertisements associated with the advertising records may be selected as targeted advertisements for delivery to the client device 218 (522). Alternatively, the
advertising server 404 may use a refinement scheme to further identify an advertisement to deliver as a targeted advertisement. In one implementation, an advertiser may influence when a targeted advertisement is displayed. For example, where an advertiser has paid to be considered as a higher priority, theadvertising server 404 may select the advertisement of the paying advertiser as the targeted advertisement. In another example, an advertiser may arrange to have an advertisement displayed as a targeted advertisement for a particular floor or range of floors. For example, an advertisement stored on theadvertising server 404 may indicate that it should be displayed when theclient device 218 is on the fourth floor or when theclient device 218 is on the first through fifth floors. - In another implementation, the
advertising server 404 may select an advertisement in accordance with the direction of movement of theclient device 218. For example, theclient device 218 may relay whether it is moving in an upwardly or downwardly direction, such as when theclient device 218 is in an elevator. Based on the upward or downward direction of theclient device 218, theadvertising server 404 may select an advertisement associated with a location or business on a floor that is on a floor higher or lower than theclient device 218, depending on the upward or downward direction of theclient device 218. Other refinement schemes are also possible. - Turning next to
FIG. 6 is an illustration of one example of a three-dimensional geographicbusiness search system 602 in communication with theclient device 218. The three-dimensional geographicbusiness search system 602 includes the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 and abusiness search server 604. The three-dimensional geographicbusiness search system 602 is operative to deliver a targeted search result including at least one business to theclient device 218 based on the three-dimensional positional information transmitted by theclient device 218. - To deliver a targeted search result to the
client device 218, in one implementation, thebusiness search server 604 may include, or be in communication a business/keyword database 608 and aresult ranking organizer 610. - In one implementation, the business/
keyword database 608 associates keywords with businesses. For example, the business/keyword database 608 may include one or more business records that associate a particular business, or type of business, with one or more keywords. An business record may identify the particular business “Kentucky Fried Chicken” and associate this particular business with the keywords “chicken,” “fast food,” “restaurant,” or any other keyword. Alternatively, a business record may identify a “fast food restaurant” as a type of business and associate the “fast food restaurant” with the keywords “chicken,” “burger,” “fast food,” “restaurant,” or any other keyword. The business/keyword database 608 may also include a combination of business-specific business records and business-type business records. - In one implementation, the
result ranking organizer 610 facilitates the organization and ranking of search results. Theresult ranking organizer 610 may include a mechanism for ranking a set of search results based on a previously determined set of criteria, such as a proximity to a location, whether one of the businesses listed within the search results has paid for a higher position in the search results, whether a business is more relevant to the initial search query that generated the set of search results, or other criteria. -
FIG. 7 illustrates one example of message flow 702 for the three-dimensional geographicbusiness search system 602. Aclient device 218 may transmit a search query and the search query, or a portion thereof, may be transmitted to the business search server 604 (704). Thebusiness search server 604 may parse the search query to identify three-dimensional positional information embedded within, or transmitted with, the search query. Alternatively, theadvertising server 604 may transmit a request for the three-dimensional positional information to theclient device 218 in response to receiving the search query or other query. - The
business search server 604 may then extract one or more keywords from the search query to pass to the business/keyword database 608 (706). After extracting one or more keywords from the search query, these keywords may be passed to the business/keyword database 608 to select one or more business from the business/keyword database 608. Thebusiness search server 604 may identify one or more business records as being associated with the extracted keywords (708). - The three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 may then receive the three-dimensional positional information from theclient device 218 via the business search server 604 (710). As previously discussed with reference toFIG. 5 , when the three-dimensional positional information is received, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may extract elevation information from the three-dimensional positional information. (712). Depending on the elevation information extracted from the three-dimensional positional information, thetranslation module 216 may translate the elevation information. - After obtaining translated elevation information (if applicable), the
translation module 216 may then transmit the translated elevation to theprocessor 208, or other component, for selecting one or more three-dimensional taxonomy records from the three-dimensional taxonomy database 214 (714). - In selecting the one or more three-dimensional taxonomy records from the three-
dimensional taxonomy database 214, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may use a range of values from the three-dimensional positional information. The three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may be configured with one or more range values, such as a latitude range value, a longitude range value, an elevation range value, or other range values. The range values indicate the margin of error to use in selecting one or more three-dimensional taxonomy records. For example, an elevation range value of “15 feet” may indicate that the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 is to select three-dimensional taxonomy records whose elevation values fall within a range of +/−15 feet of the elevation information from the three-dimensional positional information. Hence, the range values facilitate the selection of three-dimensional taxonomy records corresponding to locations that are in proximity to the location of theclient device 218. - After selecting the three-dimensional taxonomy records corresponding to locations in proximity to the location of the
client device 218, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may then refine the list of selected three-dimensional taxonomy records based on the business previously selected from the business/keyword database 608. For example, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may select three-dimensional taxonomy records whose corresponding locations are analogous, or similar, to the businesses selected from the business/keyword database 608. Alternatively, the three-dimensional taxonomy server 102 may use the businesses selected from the business/keyword database 608 in conjunction with the three-dimensional positional information to select the three-dimensional taxonomy records from the three-dimensionaltaxonomy record database 214. - The three-
dimensional taxonomy server 102 then communicates the selected three-dimensional taxonomy records to the result ranking organizer 610 (716). Theresult ranking organizer 610 then engages in a ranking of the locations corresponding to the three-dimensional taxonomy records. As previously discussed, theresult ranking organizer 610 may be configured with a set of criteria for ranking the locations. In one implementation, the locations are ranked according to proximity of the location of theclient device 218. A proximity-based criterion may include proximity based on distance, wherein the distance is measured from the point of theclient device 218 to the location. Distance-based proximity may or may not account for convenience. A distance-based proximity that accounts for convenience may include applying a weighting factor to the distance of a location that is located on the same floor as theclient device 218. With the weighting factor, a first location located on the same floor of theclient device 218 may rank higher than a second location that is on a floor above theclient device 218, even if the distance between theclient device 218 and the second location is less than the distance between theclient device 218 and the first location. Similarly, with reference to the aforementioned example, a distance-based proximity criterion that does not account for convenience may indicate that the second location is, in fact, closer to theclient device 218 than the first location. - Other types of ranking criterion are also possible. For example, in another implementation, the
result ranking organizer 610 ranks the locations according to whether a business has paid to be ranked higher than other businesses. In yet a further implementation, the locations are ranked according to whether the location is related to the keywords from the initial search query transmitted by theclient device 218. - Moreover, the
result ranking organizer 610 may employ multiple criteria to rank the list of locations. For example theresult ranking organizer 610 may first rank the locations according to proximity to the location of theclient device 218, and then a further ranking according to whether a location is related to, or relevant for, the keywords of the initial query. Other types of ranking criteria are also possible. Theresult ranking organizer 610 then transmits the ranked list of locations to theclient device 218 via the business search server 604 (718). In transmitting the ranked list of locations, thebusiness search server 604 may incorporate the ranked list of locations into a search result transmitted to theclient device 218 in response to the initial search query from theclient device 218. In an alternative implementation, the ranked list of locations is transmitted as the search result to theclient device 218. Other schemes for transmitting the ranked list of locations to theclient device 218 are also possible. - In providing a search result of ranked or unranked locations, the
business search server 604 may employ a feedback loop to further refine the search results transmitted to theclient device 218. For example, thebusiness search server 604 may transmit a request for the user or theclient device 218 to input a floor number on each search result page. The request transmitted to theclient device 218 may include an interface having a selectable element associated with one or more floor numbers, such as one or more drop-down boxes or one or more radio buttons, along with a textual, graphical, or similar statement that reads “To provide a better search result, we want to know which floor you are currently on.” The user or theclient device 218 may then use one or more selectable elements to select the floor on which the user orclient device 218 is located. Other forms of feedback loops, such as click-monitoring, e.g., detecting which search result is selected more frequently, or requests for additional searches, are also possible. - The systems, components, and logic described above may be implemented in many different ways, including a combination of hardware and software, or as software for installation on any desired operating system including Linux, UNIX, or Windows. The functionality may be implemented in a single system or functionally partitioned across multiple systems. As another example, the components, systems, and logic may be implemented as computer-executable instructions or as data structures in memory and may be stored on, distributed across, or read from many different types of machine-readable media. The machine-readable media may include RAM, ROM, hard disks, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, flash memory or other machine-readable medium. The components, systems and logic may also be encoded in a signal, such as a signal received from a network or partitioned into sections and received in multiple packets communicated across a network.
- The systems may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware. The systems may be implemented in a computer programming language, such as C# or Java, or in a query language, such as the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (“SPARQL”). The systems may also use one or more metadata data models, such as the Resource Description Framework (“RDF”).
- Furthermore, the systems may be implemented with additional, different, or fewer components. As one example, a processor or any other logic or component may be implemented with a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), program instructions, discrete analog or digital logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. As another example, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The systems may be distributed among multiple components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems.
- Logic, such as programs or circuitry, may be combined or split among multiple programs, distributed across several memories and processors, and may be implemented in or as a function library, such as a dynamic link library (DLL) or other shared library. The DLL, for example, may store code that implements functionality for a specific module as noted above. As another example, the DLL may itself provide all or some of the functionality of the system.
- Interfaces between the systems and the logic and modules within systems may be implemented in numerous ways. For example, interfaces between systems may be Web Services, Simple Object Access Protocol, or Enterprise Service Bus interfaces. Other examples of interfaces include message passing, such as publish/subscribe messaging, shared memory, and remote procedure calls.
- Although aspects of the invention herein have been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, while certain operations and functions are shown in a specific order, they may be performed in a different order unless it is expressly stated otherwise.
