Description
Description of the division
The present application belongs to the divisional application of Chinese patent application No.201680024522.2 whose application date is 2016, 7 and 13.
Background
The present disclosure relates to telecommunications services. Telecommunications takes a variety of forms, such as, for example, signal exchange via physical media (e.g., telephone cables), and signal exchange via electromagnetic waves. Telecommunications is related to at least two entities and is ubiquitous in the age of mobile telephone devices that allow voice communication between two or more entities. The inconvenience of mobile voice communications occurs when a conversation is terminated because the participants in the conversation encounter unreliable signal quality. In conventional systems, a user with a problem with the connection must redial the other party. The moment that results in low signal integrity of the disconnection may last only a few seconds, but the effort of re-dialing and successfully re-connecting the other party may take a few minutes, especially when the other party is also re-dialing.

Detailed Description
The present disclosure relates to maintaining a communication session that has been disconnected. This feature is particularly important because, for example, in mobile telephone communications, a user in motion is expected to have less than ideal network coverage throughout the length of a telephone conversation. In one example, a user may talk while driving to work and, along the way, the user may pass through areas of varying quality of network coverage, which may cause the talk to be disconnected. In another scenario, the user may be driving through a tunnel, resulting in the call being disconnected. In another scenario, the user may be engaged in a video call on his computer, while the call is disconnected. Thus, methods and services to maintain a call are valuable.
According to various embodiments, the communication session may be a telephone call over the PSTN (public switched telephone network), a cellular telephone call, a voice call over IP (internet protocol), and/or a voice and video call over IP, etc. According to various embodiments, when a first user and a second user conduct a communication session over a network, the first user may disconnect from the communication session. A system and method for maintaining a communication session still connected at a server side when a first user is disconnected for whatever reason is described herein. When a first user disconnects, a server managing the communication session maintains a connection with a second user until the first user is available, rather than terminating the communication session.
Examples of networks include mobile or cellular networks using multiple coding schemes, such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), and the like. The network is not limited to just a cellular network but includes any network that supports voice or video communications. In addition, the network may include a plurality of network types and connectivity types between the first user and the second user. In some embodiments, the server includes at least one computing device that supports and services voice and/or video communications between the first user and the second user.
In some embodiments, the communication session may be a teleconference between the first user and a plurality of other users. In one example, the conference call is still continuing when the first user leaves the coverage area or drops from the communication session, allowing the first user to reconnect when the first user reenters the coverage area.
In some embodiments, the first user may be moving through multiple network coverage areas, with the areas being signal-free between these different coverage areas. The server detects movement from one coverage area to another, the server then maintains a connection with the second user and provides the first user with the ability to automatically reconnect to the existing connection. In some embodiments, the first user may dial a particular telephone number to reconnect the communication session. In some embodiments, the particular telephone number is associated with a user account or communication service, and in the event of a disconnect, a password or code is required to join the active communication session when the particular telephone number is called. In some embodiments, the first user is able to reconnect via a software service provided by the server when initially connected to the communication session. In some embodiments, the first user can be reconnected through text messaging, email, or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), as described in more detail herein.
In some embodiments, the server determines, via the user history movement pattern, that the first user may lose connection at some future time. By anticipating connectivity issues for the first user, the server maintains connectivity with the second user after the first user disconnects. Once the first user regains better reception, the first user may reconnect to the existing communication session with the second user. In some embodiments, the server decides to disconnect the first user from the communication session first because the server detects that the first user is on a mobile device that is about to run out of power. The server then searches for another device associated with the first user that is in proximity to the first user and reconnects the other device to the active communication session. In some embodiments, the other device is selected from a list of devices associated with the profile of the first user. The other device may be a mobile phone, a smart phone, a landline, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile computer, a desktop computer, or any other device capable of voice or video communication over a network.
In some embodiments, the server determines through the user movement pattern that the first user will lose connection with the communication session. The server plays the audio message or sends a text or email message to the first user, thereby providing an alternative route that would avoid the first user losing connection.
In some embodiments, the second user hangs up when the first user disconnects. When the second user hangs up, the communication session is terminated and the server does not attempt to reconnect to the first user.
In some embodiments, the second user is provided with the option of leaving a message for the first user when the first user is disconnected. If the second user chooses to take the choice and leaves a message for the first user, the server does not attempt to reconnect to the first user. The message of the second user is made available in the mailbox of the first user. Examples of mailboxes for the first user include a voice mail system. The transcribed voice message may also be sent to the email address of the first user, or the transcribed message may be sent to the first user by a Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) or a Short Message Service (SMS) or the like.
In some embodiments, when the first user disconnects from the communication session, the server provides a message to the second user informing the second user that the first user is in an uncovered area. The message may be an audio message that is one of a voice message, music, beep, a string of beeps, or other type of sound. The message may be text-based, i.e., an email, a multimedia message, or a text message, among others. The second user may then choose to wait to join the first user to the active connection, leave a message for the first user, or hang up. The server maintains the connection with the second user until the first user is reconnected, the communication session is idle for a predetermined timeout period, or the second user hangs up.

The software modules are provided as contained in memory 304, but in some embodiments are contained in storage device 308 or a combination of memory 304 and storage device 308. In certain embodiments, the various components (including the one or more processors 302, the memory 304, the one or more network interfaces 306, the one or more storage devices 308, the media manager 310, the connection service router 312, the data organizer 314, and the database editor 316) are physically, communicatively, and/or operatively interconnected for inter-component communication.
The one or more processors 302, similar to the one or more processors 202 in the client device 104, are configured to implement functions and/or process instructions to be executed within the server 102. For example, the one or more processors 302 execute instructions stored in memory 304 or instructions stored on storage device 308. Memory 304, which may be a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, is configured to store information within server 102 during operation. In some embodiments, memory 304 includes temporary memory, which is an area for information that need not be maintained when server 102 is shut down. Examples of such temporary memory include volatile memory such as Random Access Memory (RAM), dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). Memory 304 also maintains program instructions to be executed by the one or more processors 302.
Server 102 communicates with external devices via one or more networks (depicted as network 108 and SIP network 112 in fig. 1) using one or more network interfaces 306. Such networks may also include one or more wireless networks, wired networks, fiber optic networks, and other types of networks with which the server 102 may establish communications with external devices. The one or more network interfaces 306 may be a network interface card, such as an ethernet card, an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, or any other type of device that can send and receive information.
The storage devices 308 in the server 102 may also include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media. Storage device 308 is typically configured to store larger amounts of information than memory 304. The storage device 308 may be further configured to store information for long periods of time. In some examples, the storage device 304 includes a non-volatile storage element. Non-limiting examples of non-volatile storage elements include magnetic hard disks, optical disks, floppy disks, flash memory, resistive memory, or various forms of electrically programmable memory (EPROM) or Electrically Erasable Programmable (EEPROM) memory.
Server 102 further includes instructions implementing a media manager 310, which media manager 310 is configured to provide media services to client device 104 or participant device 106. The media manager 310 manages the provision of SMS, MMS and email messages in association with alerting the external device to information about the call status. For example, when the client device 104 drops from the communication session, the media manager 310 provides a prompt to the participant device 106 requesting a voice or video message. The media manager 310 also provides media services in the event that the client device 104 receives guidance to stay within an area to avoid losing a connection with a communication session. In some embodiments, the media manager 310 facilitates communication between the client device 104 and the participant device 106. For example, the media manager 310 filters, compresses, and encrypts voice or video data destined for various external devices. In some embodiments, when the participant device 106 chooses to leave a voice message, the media manager 310 is further configured to transcribe, package, and then send the voice message to the email address. The transcribed voice message may be an email attachment or an email body. In certain aspects where the transcribed voice message is an email body, an attachment to the voice message may be included in the email. In some embodiments, an SMS or MMS formatted message may be composed, rather than an email, and sent to at least one client device 104. The manner in which the voice message is delivered to the disconnected user may be configured in the preference settings of the user's profile.
The connection service router 312 is configured to manage connections between the client device 104 and the participant device 106. When the client device 104 sends communication signals to one or more servers 102 to initiate a communication session with the participant device 106, the connectivity service router 312 is configured to route the client device 104 to the appropriate participant device 106 based on the received communication signals. In some embodiments, connection service router 312 is further configured to prepare and provide software services for automatically connecting client device 104 in the event that client device 104 is dropped from a communication session. For example, client device 104-1 is a smart phone that is in a communication session with participant device 106. The connection service router 312 may provide or initiate a software service running on the client device 104-1 or the default second client device 104-3 that causes one of the devices to send communication signals to the one or more servers 102 if the client 104-1 is disconnected from the communication session. In certain aspects of the present disclosure, the connectivity service router 312 is further configured for preparing different identifiers or numbers for the communication session between the client device 104 and the participant device 106. The connection service router 312 then provides the different number or identifier to the media manager 310 for packaging and transmission to the client device 104.
The data organizer 314 configures the one or more servers 102 to organize the devices and network parameters sent by the plurality of client devices 104 from the plurality of networks 108 (see fig. 1). The client device 104 is configured to upload the collected location information (when device and network parameters are collected), as well as the actual parameters collected, to the server 102. The data organizer 314 may associate the received location information with the reported parameters, thereby associating the location information from the client device 104 with corresponding device and network parameters. The data organizer 314 further associates a timestamp with the received location information and the collected parameters. In some embodiments, the timestamp is received from the client device 104; however, in other embodiments, the timestamp is generated by the server 102. The data organizer 314 is further configured to aggregate all received device and network parameters for each location and each timestamp.
The database editor 316 configures the server 102 to establish database entries for each client device 104 associated with a user account during a particular time window. Database entries are stored in database 110. In some embodiments, for each particular time window, in the event that the client device 104 drops from the communication session, the database editor 316 may specify a default second client device to connect to. The default second client device is determined by analyzing the parameters collected by the data organizer 314. In some embodiments, the default second client device is determined by selecting the device closest to the client device 104. In some embodiments, the capabilities of the device are considered. For example, if a video communication session is being conducted with client device 104-1, a default second client device may be selected as client device 104-2 having the capability to provide and maintain a video call. In some embodiments, performance characteristics of the second device are considered. For example, the network interface 206 of one device may have a faster speed than another device.
Fig. 4 provides steps for establishing a communication session performed by one or more servers 102 in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Steps 402 and 404 indicate that a voice or video communication session may be requested from the client device 104 or the participant device 106, respectively. In certain aspects of the present disclosure, one or more servers 102 obtain a request from a client device 104 to establish a communication session in step 402. In some embodiments, one or more servers 102 may provide reconnection services to client device 104, as described in step 406. Some examples of reconnection services include: a software service on the client device 104 is started, the software service comprising: credentials and procedures that automatically dial or attempt to reconnect to the communication session when the connection is broken; SMS, email or MMS containing different numbers that can be called by the user in case of disconnection; SMS, email, MMS, or voice media containing a PIN, password, or password associated with a communication session. In step 408, the one or more servers 102 connect the client device 104 to the participant device 106 and establish the communication session. After step 408, the client device 104 and the participant device 106 may exchange information over a communication session. In step 410, one or more servers monitor a communication session between the client device and the participant device. One or more servers 102 collect information about the call.
Fig. 5 provides an example of how one or more servers 102 collect and package information regarding certain embodiments of the present disclosure. In step 502, one or more servers 102 receive location information from a client device 104. In some embodiments, one or more servers 102 receive a plurality of location information from a plurality of client devices 104 not involved in the communication session. In some embodiments, the server uses location information from a plurality of client devices not involved in the communication session to edit the ranking used to select client devices 104 to connect in the event of a disconnect from an already connected client device 104. For example, if client device 104-1 is engaged in a communication session with participant device 106, one or more servers 102 may receive location data from client devices 104-2 through 104-9. Additionally, the one or more servers 102 may determine that the client device 104-5 is the device closest to the client device 104-1 based on the locations of the client devices 104-1 through 104-9. In step 502, location information may be obtained from database 110 for client devices that are not currently active on the network. For example, client device 104-9 is designated as a landline phone with a particular permanent location.
In step 504, one or more servers receive network performance parameters from a plurality of client devices 104. In some embodiments, one or more servers receive network performance parameters from intermediary devices, nodes, and machines between the client device 104 and the one or more servers 102. For example, one or more servers receive coverage data from a set of base stations or other servers and databases associated with the cellular connection. In step 506, one or more servers receive the client device 104 parameters. In some embodiments, the client device parameters include battery life, signal strength, data speed, processor speed, and the like. In step 508, the timestamp is associated with the location information, the received network performance parameters, and the received client device parameters. The time stamp indicates the time when the data (including location information and parameters) was collected by the client device 104 or received by the one or more servers 102. If the time stamp represents the time at which the data was collected by the client device, the time stamp is applied by the client device 104 and sent to the one or more servers 102 along with the data. If the time stamp represents the time at which the data was received by the one or more servers 102, the time stamp is applied by the one or more servers 102 upon receipt of the data.
In step 510, the one or more servers 102 aggregate the performance parameters and the device parameters based on the location information and the time stamp. Aggregating information from multiple client devices 104 provides performance and associated network parameters that may be categorized based on the location where they are collected and the time during which they are collected/uploaded by the client devices 104 or received by one or more servers 102. In step 512, the one or more servers 102 analyze the aggregated parameters and build or update database 110 entries for users associated with the client devices 104. In some embodiments, updating or changing database 110 may also change one or more parameters in a user profile associated with the user.
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by a server or a cluster of servers to reconnect a second device with a communication session according to some example embodiments. Once the participant device 106 and the client device 104 are in a communication session, one or more servers 102 monitor the communication session between the two devices in step 410. In step 602, one or more servers 102 determine whether client device 104 has been dropped from the communication session. In the event that the client device 104 suddenly drops from the communication session, in step 604, the one or more servers 102 maintain a connection with the participant device 106 and prevent the participant device 106 from disconnecting. The maintained connection is an active communication channel that exists between the client device 104 and the participant device 106. In certain embodiments, in step 606, one or more servers 102 play the media message to the participant device 106. In some instances, the media message may be in the form of text or an email. The media message may inform the participant device 106 that the client device 104 is disconnected. The media message may also provide a timeout to the participant device 106, which is a waiting period for the client device 104 to have to reconnect before terminating the communication session. The media message may also provide a prompt to the participant device 106 to leave a message for the client device 104. In some embodiments, the timing of the prompt may come at the end of the timeout. In some embodiments, the participant device 106 chooses to leave a message and terminates the communication session after leaving the message.
After playing the media to the participant device 106, the one or more servers 102 determine the cause of the disconnection of the client device 104 in step 608. In some embodiments, this determination is based on information contained in database 110. For example, the information in database 110 may include collected parameters including data indicating low battery, low signal strength, etc. of client device 104. In step 610, the one or more servers 102 retrieve the most current location of the client device 104. In step 612, the one or more servers determine a second device in proximity to the client device 104 using the location and information retrieved from the user profile. For example, the client device 104-1 is dropped from the communication session with the participant device 106, and the one or more servers 102 identify the client device 104-3 as the most suitable device to connect to the communication session. In another example, one or more servers 102 consider the cause of the client device 104-1 disconnecting. For example, after the client device 104-1 is dropped from the communication session on the network 108-1 with the participant device 106, the one or more servers 102 identify that the client device 104-1 is in an area of poor signal strength before being dropped from the communication session. Thus, the one or more servers 102 determine that the reason for the dropped call is lack of network coverage and identify the client device 104-3 as the most suitable device to connect to the communication session based on the type of network available in the last location of the client device 104-1. Client device 104-3 on network 108-2 may then be selected to join the communication session. In steps 614 and 616, the one or more servers 102 establish a connection with the second device and connect the second device to the communication session with the participant device 106.
In certain embodiments, in step 614, one or more servers 102 dial the second device in order to establish a connection with the second device. In some embodiments, the user dials the number of the second device to connect to one or more servers 102. In some embodiments, the determination of whether one or more servers 102 initiate a connection with the second device or whether the second device initiates a connection with one or more servers 102 is provided in a user profile associated with a different client device 104.
In some embodiments, the nature of the client device 104 dictates the method of connection of one or more servers 102. For example, if the client device 104-3 is an office landline phone and the last location of the client device 104-1 before disconnection is near an office building, one or more servers 102 may attempt to reconnect to the office number of the user device 104-3. The similar situation applies to a home landline phone if the last location of the client device 104-1 is at home. In some embodiments, if the client device 104-3 is an office computer or a home computer, one or more servers 102 may attempt a voice or video communication session with either computer depending on the last known location of the client device 104-1. Computers may need to have wired or wireless network connectivity and programs supporting voice and/or video communications over such networks. In some instances, the computer is equipped with a program that supports text-to-speech and speech-to-text, which enables text input from the client device 104-3 to the participant device 106 as an audio message and enables an audio message from the participant device 106 to reach the client device 104-3 as a text message. The term "computer" encompasses the case where the client device 104-3 is a mobile device (e.g., a tablet or laptop computer having wireless or wired connectivity).
Fig. 7 provides a flowchart of steps performed by a server or server cluster to reconnect a second device or client device with a participant device in certain embodiments of the disclosure. In step 410, while one or more servers 102 monitor the communication session between the client device 104 and the participant device 106, the one or more servers 102 may use the aggregated data collected in step 702 to determine that the client device 104 may lose connectivity while monitoring the communication session. The determination or prediction that the client device 104 may lose connectivity may be based on historical data. For example, a user using a client device 104 typically has a non-uniform reception in an area while taking a bus, a user typically loses reception within his work elevator, a user typically has a non-uniform reception in some portion of the home, etc. By using location-based data to provide context, the server may collect information over time regarding the user's movement patterns and where voice call breaks typically occur. In addition, the server may use information about mobile network congestion or registered poor network coverage in the area the user is entering in order to determine the probability that the client device 104 loses connection.
In certain embodiments, in step 704, one or more servers 102 will provide alerts to both client device 104 and participant device 106. The alert may take the form of an audio voice message or an audio signal (including a beep or a string of beeps). In some embodiments, the alert is provided only to the client device 104. For example, in the case of a mobile phone where the client device 104 is non-stationary, the alert provided may be an indication shown to the user of the client device 104 to keep the client device 104 within an appropriate signal strength region. In this example, if the user follows these indications, the client device 104 does not enter an area where the signal strength is low, and therefore, disconnection is avoided. In some embodiments, the alert provides an estimated time for the communication session prior to being interrupted by the disconnection, wherein the estimated time is based on a distance between the client device 104 and the region of low signal strength, and a velocity of the client device 104 calculated from its location history. For example, client device 104 may receive a notification for 30 seconds before the connection is broken. With advanced alerting, parties to a communication session will have time to decide whether to end the session or to hold the session until the party to be disconnected is reconnected. In some embodiments, the alert is a voice message that requires the user to plug the client device 104 in with power because the battery charge is low on the mobile device.
In step 602, one or more servers 102 determine whether client device 104 has been dropped from the communication session. As shown in fig. 6, steps 604, 606, 610 and 612 are performed. In the event that the client device 104 drops from the communication session, the one or more servers 102 maintain a connection with the participant device 106 and, in some embodiments, play media to the participant device 106. The one or more servers 102 then retrieve the most up-to-date data and information for the client device 104 from the database 110 including the user profile and select a second device to connect to the communication session.
In step 706, the one or more servers provide the dial signal to the client device 104 and the second device. For example, if client device 104-1 is dropped from the communication session and client device 104-3 is selected as the second device, one or more servers 102 may attempt to send a dial signal to both client device 104-1 and client device 104-3. Depending on which device, client device 104-1 or client device 104-3, attempts to connect to one or more servers 102, one or more servers 102 will receive the communication signals. In some embodiments, one or more servers 102 receive communication signals from both devices and select only one of the devices. In some embodiments, client device 104-3 is not available and one or more servers 102 receive only communication signals from client device 104-1. In step 710, one or more servers establish a communication session between the participant device 106 and the selected device.
Fig. 8 provides an alternative to fig. 6-7 according to some embodiments. Fig. 8 shares steps 410, 602, 604, 606, 608 and 610 with fig. 6. After retrieving the most recent location of the client device 104 in step 610, the one or more servers 102 determine that the client device 104 is available over the alternative network and send a dial signal to the client device 104 over the alternative network in step 802. For example, client device 104-1 is dropped from a communication session with participant device 106 through a network 108-2 connection with one or more servers 102. One or more servers 102 determine and locate client device 104-1 over network 108-1 and send dial signals to client device 104-1 using network 108-1. In step 810, the one or more servers then establish a connection with the client device 104-1 over the network 108-1 and then join the client device 104-1 in a communication session with the participant device 106. In some embodiments, client device 104-1 is communicating over a cellular voice network and becomes disconnected. Through WiFi connectivity, one or more servers 102 find client devices 104-1 and attempt to connect to client devices 104-1 through a WiFi network. In some embodiments, the client device 104-1 is capable of connecting to a variety of cellular networks operated by different cellular network operators. When the client device 104-1 loses connectivity over the first operator's cellular network, one or more servers 102 connect to the client device 104-1 over the second operator's cellular network. In some embodiments, where one or more servers 102 are connected to a client device 104-1 over different networks, the client device 104-1 functions as a second device (provided in fig. 6-7) or as a selected device. In fig. 8, the disconnected client device 104 eventually becomes the selected device or second device after one or more servers 102 find the client device 104 on the alternative network.
Fig. 9 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by the client device 104 to collect data and send the data to the one or more servers 102, in accordance with some embodiments. To ease the information gathering burden on one or more servers 102, client devices 104 may collect client device and network parameters. In step 902, the client device 104 communicates with the network 108. In step 904, the client device 104 measures a network quality parameter from the network 108. The network quality parameter may comprise only one parameter or a large number of parameters. For example, the network quality parameter may include at least one of bit error rate, signal strength, such as a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), network delay, and network throughput.
In step 906, the client device 104 measures a device parameter. In step 908, the client device 104 provides the two parameters to a storage device on the client device 104. In step 910, the client device 104 collects network identification information and, in step 912, appends the network identification information to the parameter data collected in steps 904 and 906. In step 914, the client device 104 appends the location information to the collected parameter data. In step 918, the client device 104 sends the collected parameter data to one or more servers 102.
