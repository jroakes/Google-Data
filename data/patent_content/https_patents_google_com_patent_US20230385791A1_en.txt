Description
- This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/345,062, filed May 24, 2022. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/345,062 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- The present disclosure relates generally to providing a software packet for generating an embedded non-fungible token purchase interface. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating a software packet that includes a purchase link for embedding a purchasing interface in webpages of various types.
- With people being online for a large portion of their life and the need for a new iteration of the world wide web based on blockchain (referred to as web3) growing stronger, digital assets are becoming the future of the capital markets. Traditional non-fungible token marketplaces can fail to provide information that can be utilized by consumers for informed purchasing. Similarly, looking at the blockchain data can provide little insight into the marketability of a particular non-fungible token. Additionally, users with limited knowledge of the field of non-fungible tokens may have difficulty finding and researching non-fungible tokens to purchase. User preferences including taste, marketability, and source can be hard to decipher. Moreover, marketplaces can struggle to preview non-image digital assets that are provided for sale.
- Additionally, non-fungible token marketplaces can be heavily regulated, and the marketplaces may receive a percentage of sales that will not go to the owner at the time of sale. However, the marketplace can control how the digital asset is viewed and what information is provided on the purchase page. The preview and other information may not provide the information needed for proper informed purchasing.

The application programming interface can add the transaction data to a blockchain. In some implementations, the application programming interface can generate and provide proof of work of a transaction to a blockchain.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein can allow for the purchasing of a non-fungible token from any form of webpage without navigating to a new webpage. For example, a user can embed the software packet into a blog webpage, a business webpage, or any webpage to generate an embedded widget with one-click purchase capability.
- A non-fungible token (NFT) can be a certificate of authenticity of a digital asset. Non-fungible tokens can be non-interchangeable thus making their worth dependent on the price anyone is willing to pay. Non-fungible tokens can be minted on blockchains. Non-fungible tokens can enable new and more decentralized actors to use programmability to create new value exchanges that transform industry structures. Additionally, in some implementations, non-fungible tokens can be minted (or recorded) on a blockchain to ensure scarcity and authenticity of the ownership of a digital asset.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods disclosed herein can embed selling and buying options of digital assets across different products that attract internet visitors based on their experience or necessity rather than visiting a marketplace. The systems and methods disclosed herein can include a portal where users can view their digital assets. Additionally and/or alternatively, the users can sell and buy the digital assets on different platforms/experiences like blogs, photo sharing apps, search results, etc.
- The systems and methods can utilize an experience based world wide web where any user over the internet can one-click purchase a digital asset while browsing a webpage. All digital assets, if tagged and announced as a digital asset for sale by the original content creator, may be available for a one-click purchase to everyone on the internet.
- A content creator can have a one-click purchase link generated. The creator can then embed that link while publishing a blog or a website along with the content. Such publication can allow for a search engine to surface non-fungible tokens associated with the content creator in response to a search of the content creator's name or works. Additionally and/or alternatively, the purchase link can be surfaced in response to the search.
- An ecosystem of products like blogs, search engines that index data optimized for search engines by content creators, and online advertisement agencies, can benefit from the embedded purchase interfaces for non-fungible tokens. Every content creator can create a unique one-click purchase, which can be embedded in all ecosystems of products in which the content can be published for users' consumption.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized to provide blogs as an experience, search results as an experience, website real estate as a digital asset, online video sharing platform as an experience, and/or social media platform as an experience.
- For example, an author can write a blog about the author's travel experience and can embed images or documents (which can be digital assets) the author owned and created. If the author has a link to buy digital assets along with every digital asset the author created, then the users visiting the blog can buy those digital assets in one-click.
- Users looking for an image can search a search engine and can find a lot of images. The users can then filter images with a special search filter like “images with NFTs available.” All images that are published over the internet can be announced as “NFT available” with a special SEO tag that can be read by searching engines while indexing those images.
- Website owners can place advertisements wherever they want and work with digital advertising agencies to place advertisements in the areas. In some implementations, real estate of websites can be sold as NFTs for users to buy them in one-click using the one-click URL created.
- On video sharing platforms, any user can choose to sell the video as a NFT while uploading that video or update published videos with one-click purchase URLs generated. Additionally and/or alternatively, any comments or discussions on any experiences can be sold as NFTs with one-click purchase URLs generated.
- Having authenticated digital assets, for example images, as profile photos can be a great way to verify user profiles. The profile images can create a community. For example, if all assets are created from a movie fan blog, then they can be part of a community, and this can lead to more loyalty to the brand from which these digital assets may be purchased from.
- The systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, the system and methods can provide systems and methods for facilitating the generation of a purchase link for embedding in a webpage. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can facilitate the generation and use of a software packet that can be embedded into the code of a webpage to generate an interactive purchase interface in a webpage of various types.
- Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is the ability to leverage callout data embedded in a webpage to discover non-fungible tokens and surface the purchase link in the generated search results. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can determine a search result has callout data. The determination can cause the search engine to extract the purchase link to generate an interactive search element that can be provided and interacted with in the search results page.
- Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is the ability to leverage a generated software packet to embed a purchase element in a content creator's webpage. The content creator's webpage can provide information on the creator and the asset for sale.
- Another example of technical effect and benefit relates to improved computational efficiency and improvements in the functioning of a computing system. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage callout data to surface the purchase links for the non-fungible tokens can greatly reduce the computational power to crawl each webpage to extract data that may or may not be related to a non-fungible token. Additionally, the systems and methods disclosed herein can reduce the computational power utilized by a user when attempting to obtain data on a digital asset and then purchase the digital asset.

Theexample blockchain 50 can include a plurality of blocks that can be utilized to store data with one or more cryptographic features. Theblockchain 50 can be stored on a decentralized computing system comprising a plurality of computing devices. Theblockchain 50 can be a public blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that is open without access restrictions such that anyone with an internet access can send transactions or validate transactions as part of the decentralized, distributed system), a private blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that provides access based on permissions set by network administrators), or a hybrid blockchain (e.g., a blockchain with a combination of blocks with no restrictions and blocks with restrictions). Theblockchain 50 can include proof of work features that can include one or more cryptographic forms of proof.

The previous hash can include a hash value of the block immediately preceding the particular block. The previous hash can be utilized to ensure the downstream ground truth stays unchanged unless proper validation occurs. The data can include transaction data (e.g., a transaction ledger), a timestamp, a value associated with a cryptocurrency value, a non-fungible token (e.g., a non-fungible token including a script that references a digital asset, nonce data, and/or general blockchain data. Nonce (i.e., a number only used once) can be a number added to a block in a blockchain that can meet a difficulty level restriction when a block is rehashed. The nonce can be a number that blockchain miners are solving for, in order to receive an incentive (e.g., cryptocurrency).
- The
blockchain 50 can include one or more security protocols and/or features. Theblockchain 50 can include a cryptographic system. For example, theblockchain 50 can validate theblockchain 50 is valid by ensuring the stored previous hash stored in the block matches the hash value of the previous block from the last block back to the first block (e.g., the genesis block). In some implementations, theblockchain 50 can include proof of work validation that can rely on verifying proof of computation before implementing a change to the stored data (e.g., the stored ledger). Proof of work validation can take seconds, minutes, and/or hours based in part on the number of blocks in theblockchain 50. Additionally and/or alternatively, the blockchain can be implemented on a distributed, decentralized computing system. In some implementations, each computing device in the distributed, decentralized computing system can store a portion of (e.g., a block of the plurality of blocks) or all of the blocks in the blockchain Therefore, the system can verify data by ensuring the data is uniform across most, if not all, of the distributed system. Each node of the distributed system can be checked for tampering before adding new data. - The data can include data associated with a cryptocurrency value (e.g., a ledger associated with a specific cryptocurrency value), data associated with a digital asset (e.g., a non-fungible token minted on the
blockchain 50 that can include a script associated with the digital asset), data associated with a smart contract (e.g., a smart contract that includes conditions that automatically initiates an action in response to a criteria being met), and/or timestamp data (e.g., timestamp data for block creation, minting, a transaction, etc.). - In particular,

Thefirst block 10 may include a first previous hash 14 (e.g., if thefirst block 10 has a block before it in theblockchain 50, then the hash of the previous block can be stored on the first block 10). Additionally and/or alternatively, thefirst block 10 can includedata 16 andnonce 18. - The
second block 20 can follow thefirst block 10. Thesecond block 20 can include a respective second hash 22 (e.g., a hash value associated with the second block 20). Thesecond block 20 may include a second previous hash 24 (e.g., the secondprevious hash 24 can be the same as, or reference, the first hash 12). Additionally and/or alternatively, thesecond block 20 can includedata 26 andnonce 28. - The
third block 30 can follow thesecond block 20. Thethird block 30 can include a respective third hash 32 (e.g., a hash value associated with the third block 30).
