Definitions
- Video compression systems employ block processing for most of the compression operations.
- a block is a group of neighboring pixels and may be treated as one coding unit in terms of the compression operations. Theoretically, a larger coding unit is preferred to take advantage of correlation among immediate neighboring pixels.
- Various video compression standards e.g., Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG)-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4, use block sizes of 4 ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, and 16 ⁇ 16 (referred to as a macroblock (MB)).
- MPEG Motion Picture Expert Group
- MPEG-4 use block sizes of 4 ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, and 16 ⁇ 16 (referred to as a macroblock (MB)).
- High efficiency video coding is also a block-based hybrid spatial and temporal predictive coding scheme.
- HEVC partitions an input picture into square blocks referred to as largest coding units (LCUs) as shown in FIG. 1 .
- LCU largest coding units
- the LCU can be as large as 128 ⁇ 128 pixels.
- Each LCU can be partitioned into smaller square blocks called coding units (CUs).
- FIG. 2 shows an example of an LCU partition of CUs.
- An LCU 100 is first partitioned into four CUs 102 .
- Each CU 102 may also be further split into four smaller CUs 102 that are a quarter of the size of the CU 102 .
- CUs 102 - 1 , 102 - 3 , and 102 - 4 are a quarter of the size of LCU 100 . Further, a CU 102 - 2 has been split into four CUs 102 - 5 , 102 - 6 , 102 - 7 , and 102 - 8 .
- Each CU 102 may include one or more prediction units (PUs).
- FIG. 3 shows an example of a CU partition of PUs.
- the PUs may be used to perform spatial prediction or temporal prediction.
- a CU can be either spatially or temporally predictive coded. If a CU is coded in intra mode, each PU of the CU can have its own spatial prediction direction. If a CU is coded in inter mode, each PU of the CU can have its own motion vector(s) and associated reference picture(s).
- motion vectors are predictively coded.
- a motion vector predictor MVP is derived from motion vectors of spatially neighboring or temporally co-located PUs of the current PU. The difference between the current motion vector and the MVP is then determined and coded. This reduces overhead as only the difference is sent instead of information for the current motion vector.
- Advanced motion vector prediction proposes to select the best MVP for a current motion vector from a candidate set of MVPs.
- the candidate set of MVPs for the current motion vector of the current PU is composed of motion vectors of spatial neighboring and co-located PUs.
- the candidate set of MVPs may be reduced by removing duplicated MVP candidates.
- An index indicating the selected MVP candidate, mvpIdx, may be transmitted in the bitstream to indicate the selected MVP.
- the current PU may have two motion vectors, a motion vector MV 0 for a reference list 0 and a motion vector MV 1 for a reference list 1 .
- the corresponding reference pictures pointed to by the two motion vectors MV 0 and MV 1 are indexed by reference list 0 and reference list 1 , respectively.
- two MVP candidate sets are first formed. One candidate set is for the list 0 motion vector and the other candidate set is for the list 1 motion vector.
- the same procedure described above applies to find the best MVPs for motion vectors MV 0 and MV 1 .
- two searches of two candidate lists are performed.
- the determination of two MVPs for two lists increases the computational process.
- Two MVP indices may also be then transmitted in the bitstream, which increases overhead.
- a motion vector predictor (MVP) of a current PU is derived from motion vectors (MV) of the current PU's spatial and temporal (collocated) neighboring blocks.
- FIGS. 13A and 13B show two examples where in (a), a CU contains only one PU of the same size, and in (b), a CU has two non-square PUs (PU 0 and PU 1 ).
- the spatial neighboring blocks for a current PU may or may not be in the same CU where the current PU block resides.
- FIG. 13A all the spatial neighboring blocks (shown with diagonal lines) of a current PU are outside of the current CU.
- FIG. 13B the spatial neighboring blocks for PU 0 are all outside in the current CU.
- the left spatial neighboring block for PU 1 is PU 0 , which is inside the same current CU.
- FIGS. 14A and 14B show two examples where a CU includes two PUs.
- the right PU (PU 1 ) will use the left PU (PU 0 ) as one of the left spatial neighbors and in FIG. 14B , the bottom PU (PU 1 ) will use the top PU (PU 0 ) as one of the above spatial neighbors.
- the two PUs within a CU cannot be parallel processed; i.e., PU 1 has to wait for PU 0 to finish motion vector derivation before PU 1 can start its own MVP derivation.
- the index number for the left spatial neighbor is always smaller than that for the above spatial neighbor no matter what kind of PU partition is. This may result in a poor coding performance for some specific PU partitions.

- Particular embodiments derive a second motion vector predictor from another motion vector or another motion vector predictor.
- MVP manager 406 first obtains a first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 for motion vector MV 0 . This may be calculated as described above by determining motion vectors for neighboring PUs and co-located PUs. It should be noted that the discussion will describe first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 as being first obtained, but second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 may be first obtained.
- MVP manager 406 calculates a second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 from either motion vector MV 0 or first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 .
- scaling is used to calculate second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 . The scaling may be based on different characteristics, such as temporal distance or picture order count (POC).
- POC picture order count
- MVP manager 406 determines the MVP candidate set for motion vector MV 0 .
- the MVP candidate set may be determined using motion vectors for neighboring PUs and co-located PUs. MVP manager 406 then selects the best MVP candidate, first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 and corresponding index mvpIdx_list 0 , for motion vector MV 0 from the MVP candidate set.
- the reference for current motion vector MV 0 is used to identify which neighbor (spatial or temporal neighbor) PU is selected as first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 .
- first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 is also scaled if reference list 0 of motion vector MV 0 is different with mvpIdx_list 0 so that first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 points to the same reference picture as motion vector MV 0 does.
- First motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 below will be supposed that it is already scaled. Once the neighbor PU is selected, the reference for the neighbor PU is also known. Therefore, the mvpIdx_list 0 is derived from the information of current PU.
- MVP manager 406 then calculates the second MVP candidate, second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 , for motion vector MV 1 from either motion vector MV 0 or the first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 .
- the calculation is performed instead of selecting from a candidate set.
- MVP manager 406 - 1 uses temporal distance to calculate the second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 for motion vector MV 1 .

- MVP_list1 (sign)(TR2/TR1)*MV0 where if motion vector MV 0 and motion vector MV 1 both point to the past or the future, the sign is positive (+) or otherwise, the sign is negative ( ⁇ ). The reason the sign is used is because motion vectors MV 0 and MV 1 may be pointing in opposite directions and thus a negative sign needs to be applied to the scaling.
- FIG. 5 shows an example where both motion vectors MV 0 and MV 1 point to past reference pictures according to one embodiment.
- a current picture 502 includes the PU being encoded. Current picture 502 is shown along with first reference picture 504 - 1 and second reference picture 504 - 2 . Reference pictures 504 - 1 and 504 - 2 are in the past (have a lower display order) as compared to current picture 502 .

Then, MVP manager 406 - 1 may calculate the second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 . For example, MVP manager 406 - 1 may use the methods described above to calculate the second motion vector predictor MVP_list 1 . Encoder 402 then determines the differences between the first motion vector MV 0 and the first motion vector predictor MVP_list 0 and the second motion vector MV 1 and the second motion vector predictor MVP_list.

- a spatial prediction block 1240 may receive decoded spatial prediction directions per PU, such as horizontal, vertical, 45-degree diagonal, 135-degree diagonal, DC (flat averaging), and planar. The spatial prediction directions are used to determine the prediction PU, x′.
- a temporal prediction block 1206 performs temporal prediction through a motion estimation operation.
- a decoded motion vector is used to determine the prediction PU, x′. Interpolation may be used in the motion estimation operation.
- MVP manager 406 processes these two PUs in parallel.
- the right PU in FIG. 14A or the bottom PU in FIG. 14B were not parallel processed because they have to use the left or the above PU in the same CU as one of spatial neighbors.
- Particular embodiments only use PUs in spatial neighboring CUs as spatial candidates for a current PU. This way, MVP manager 406 parallel processes PUs in the same CU.
- FIGS. 15A and 15B depict an example of blocks to use as candidates according to one embodiment.
- a block A 0 instead of block A 1 (i.e., PU 0 ), is used as the left spatial block for the right PU (i.e., PU 1 ).
- Blocks A 2 and A 3 are still treated as the left-bottom and the left-above blocks for the right PU (PU 1 ).
- FIG. 15A a block A 0 , instead of block A 1 (i.e., PU 0 ) is used as the left spatial block for the right PU (i.e., PU 1 ).
- Blocks A 2 and A 3 are still treated as the left-bottom and the left-above blocks for the right PU (PU 1 ).
- FIG. 15A a block A 0 , instead of block A 1 (i.e., PU 0 ) is used as the left spatial block for the right PU (i.e., PU 1 ).
- block B 0 instead of block B 1 (i.e., PU 0 ), is used as the above spatial block for the bottom PU (i.e., PU 1 ), and blocks B 2 and B 3 are treated as the above-right and the above-left blocks for the bottom PU (PU 1 ).
- PU 0 is not used as a spatial neighboring block in the processing of PU 1 to find an MVP.
- MVP manager 406 treats the left neighbor in the example of FIG. 14A and the above neighbor in the example of FIG. 14B as not available. Thus, these two neighbors are not used in the MVP calculation and PU 0 and PU 1 can be parallel processed.
- particular embodiments may modify indexing of spatial and temporal neighbors. More specifically, if there is only one PU within one CU, the current indexing is kept unchanged, where the index for the left neighbor block is smaller than that for the above neighbor block.
- the index for the left and the above block may be swapped.
- the swapping may depend on different factors, such as on PU partition types.
- FIGS. 15A and 15B show different partition types according to one embodiment. In FIG.
- the index for the left neighboring block i.e., A 0
- the index for the above neighboring block may be assigned a smaller number than that for the above neighboring block (i.e., A 3 )
- the index for the above neighboring block i.e., A 3
- the index for the above neighboring block i.e., A 0
- the index for the above neighboring block may be assigned a smaller number than that for the left neighboring block (i.e., A 0 ).
- the index for the above neighboring block i.e., B 0
- the index for the left neighboring block may be assigned a smaller number than that for the left neighboring block (i.e., B 3 )
- the index for the left neighboring block i.e., B 3
- the index for the left neighboring block may be assigned a smaller number than that for the above neighboring block (i.e., B 0 ).
- Particular embodiments may be implemented in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, system, or machine.
- the computer-readable storage medium contains instructions for controlling a computer system to perform a method described by particular embodiments.
- the instructions when executed by one or more computer processors, may be operable to perform that which is described in particular embodiments.
Abstract
Description
MVP_list1=(sign)(TR2/TR1)*MV0
where if motion vector MV0 and motion vector MV1 both point to the past or the future, the sign is positive (+) or otherwise, the sign is negative (−). The reason the sign is used is because motion vectors MV0 and MV1 may be pointing in opposite directions and thus a negative sign needs to be applied to the scaling.
MVP_list1=(TR2/TR1)*MV0=(8/4)*MV0=MV0<<1
In this case, the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 is calculated based on the temporal distance ratio of 8/4*motion vector MV0. The scaling of motion vector MV0 is used such that the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 is shown as pointing to reference picture 504-2. The difference between motion vector MV1 and the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 can then be calculated and coded.
MVP_list1=−(TR2/TR1)*MV0=−(8/4)*MV0=−(MV0<<1)
In this case, the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 is equal to the negative of the scaling of motion vector MV0. This is because motion vector MV1 points to a future reference picture and not a past reference picture. As shown, the scaling of motion vector MV0 is used such that the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 points to reference picture 504-2. In using first motion vector MV0 to calculate the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1, computational complexity is reduced.
MVP_list1=(sign)(TR2/TR1)*MVP_list0
where TR1 is the temporal distance between the current picture and the reference picture pointed to by motion vector MV0 (in one example, first motion vector predictor MVP_list0 has been normalized by using the reference index of motion vector MV0. In other words, motion vector MV0 and first motion vector predictor MVP_list0 point to the same reference picture) and TR2 is the temporal distance between the current picture and the reference picture pointed to by motion vector MV 1. The sign is positive if the first motion vector predictor MVP_list0 and motion vector MV1 point to the past or the future. Otherwise, the sign is negative. In using first motion
MVP_list1=MVP0
MVP_list1=MVP_list0
diff_poc_curr_list0=poc_curr−poc_ref_list0
where diff_poc_curr_list0 is the difference between the current POC and the POC of the first reference picture in
diff_poc_curr_list1=poc_curr−poc_ref_list1
where diff_poc_curr_list1 is the difference between the POC of the current picture and the POC of the second reference picture list 1.
MVP_list1=(diff_poc_curr_list1/diff_poc_curr_list0)*MV0
MVP_list1=((8−0)/(8−4))MV0=MV0<<1
The scaling of motion vector MV0 is used such that the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 is shown as pointing to reference picture 504-2. The difference between motion vector MV1 and the second motion vector predictor MVP_list1 can then be calculated and coded.
MVP_list1=((8−16)/8−4))MV0=−(MV0<<1)
As shown in
MVP0_PU1=(TR0_PU1/TR0_PU0)*MVP0_PU0
Similarly, the second motion vector predictor MVP1_PU1 for PU1 is calculated from MVP1_PU0. A specific example is as follows:
MVP1_PU1=(TR1_PU1/TR1_PU0)*MVP1_PU0
In on embodiment, the above two equations, TR0_PU0 is the difference between a current picture POC and a reference picture POC pointed to by motion vector MV0_PU0, TR0_PU1 is the difference between the current picture POC and the reference picture POC pointed to by motion vector MV0_PU1, TR1_PU0 is the difference between the current picture POC and the reference picture POC pointed to by MV1_PU0, and TR1_PU1 is the difference between the current picture POC and the reference picture POC pointed to by motion vector MV1_PU1. Other temporal differences may also be used.
MVP0_PU1=(TR0_PU1/TR0_PU0)*MVP0_PU0
MVP1_PU1=(TR1_PU1/TR0_PU0)*MVP0_PU0
