- Reed-Solomon decoders are known.
- the literature shows the concept of soft-decision receivers, in particular erasure Reed-Solomon decoders.
- Various algorithms for erasure decoding are also known.
- erasure decoding is a process of decoding that uses in addition to a received code word certain channel quality information corresponding to the symbols of the code word.
