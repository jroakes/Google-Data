Abstract
A method (700) and an apparatus (200) which mitigate spurious transmissions are disclosed. An offset local oscillator signal (266) is generated at a frequency that is offset from a nominal transmit channel carrier frequency by a spurious mitigation offset (203). An information signal (206) is generated that comprises a series of modulation symbols and has a transmission bandwidth (212) at baseband. A configured offset information signal (226) is generated from the information signal, wherein the spectrum of the configured offset information signal is offset from DC by a channel configuration offset (218) and is further offset by a negative of the spurious mitigation offset (202). The offset local oscillator signal and the configured offset information signal are combined by using a mixing technique. The spurious mitigation offset is zero when a spurious condition does not exist and is non-zero when the spurious condition exists.

Fig. 1 comprises the block diagram of the equipment 100 of reflector according to some embodiment.Equipment 100 comprises one or more processors 105, and each processor can comprise the subfunction such as CPU, cache memory, instruction decoder etc.Processor execution of program instructions, described program command is arranged in processor with the form of programmable read only memory, or can be arranged in the memory 110 that processor 105 is bi-directionally coupled to.Processor can comprise input/output interface circuit, and can be coupled to independent input/output interface circuit 115.Processor 105 is further coupled at least radio transmission function, although in many examples, processor 105 is coupled to radio reception emission function 120, and radio reception emission function 120 itself is coupled to wireless aerial 125.In certain embodiments, processor 105 can be coupled to and be received emission function 120 by input/output function 115.Except the circuit for radio function uniqueness, reception/emission function 120 can comprise one or more processors and memory.Equipment 100 can be the personal communication devices such as mobile phone, panel computer or personal computer, or can be the transmitting set of any other type of operating in radio net.In certain embodiments, equipment 100 is LTE(Long Term Evolutions) UE(is at 3GPP(3
rdfor affiliate) subscriber equipment that operates in network).
With reference to figure 2, according to some embodiment, show the block diagram of part of reflector 200 of the receiver/transmitter 120 of Fig. 1.Reflector 200 uses direct conversion transmitter technology.Reflector 200 comprises offset functions 201, baseband modulator 205 and emitter element 250.Emitter element 250 is coupled to wireless aerial 125(Fig. 1).Some aspects of offset functions 201 and baseband modulator 205 and emitter element 250 can comprise some the performed functions of one or more processors that are stored in the instruction being programmed in equipment 100 by execution, and other functions can be for carrying out the specially designed circuit of function known in the art simultaneously.Offset functions 201 generates deviation frequency values, and this deviation frequency value can be positive number or negative and be reciprocal values in the negative output of offset functions 201 in the pulse output of offset functions 201.Baseband modulator 205 comprises the subcarrier mapping function 210 of accepting data input signal 206, and data input signal 206 can comprise with for example information of the form of parallel binary data word.Subcarrier mapping function 210 becomes information signal 211 by the data-mapping in data input signal 206, and information signal 211 comprises a string modulation symbol and have transmission bandwidth 212 in base band, as by a dotted line as shown in the spectrogram being associated with information signal 211.Can computation bandwidth according to the characteristic of data input signal 206 by fourier transform technique well known in the art, use energy cut-off with by the interrupted spectra being calculated to equating or about equal finite bandwidth of will launching after filtering.In certain embodiments, transmission bandwidth 212 is less than the wherein defined bandwidth of the channel of equipment transmitting information.When each equipment does not need all bandwidth of channel and meets other criterions, the method allows two or more transmitters to have the possibility of simultaneously launching information.
The signal generating by digital mixer 225 (or the signal producing by being coupled to the CP function of the IFF function of correction in above-described alternate embodiment) is called as the offset information signal 226 of configuration, and comprise signal, this signal has the in-phase component vI(t in base band) and orthogonal signalling vQ(t), and there is the baseband frequency spectrum shown in the spectrogram being associated with signal 226 representing by a dotted line when clutter is alleviated shifted signal 203 non-zero.In this spectrogram, the amplitude that clutter is alleviated skew 227 is the poor of the lower limb of transmission bandwidth of information signal 216 of configuration and the lower limb of the offset information signal 226 of configuration.Two kinds of signals are depicted as to crosshatch.Each component of signal 226 is coupled to corresponding of Liang Ge branch of quadrature transmitter 225.Described branch has the feature of quadrature transmitter, and wherein each comprises baseband filter 255, amplifier 260 and frequency mixer 275.
By they being moved away to the receive frequency of the equipment that can attempt reception desired signal in receive frequency range, this unique technique is alleviated the clutter frequency of the signal of transmitting under many situations, and does not need to reduce transmitting power.The in the situation that of can use the skew of different transmission bandwidths and channel configuration when transmitter time, this technology is only when this skew is confirmed as when essential just using clutter alleviation to be offset.The parameter of the specific receive frequency range of use such as specific transmission bandwidth, specific channel configuration skew and transmitter, the determining when use of working as clutter skew alleviation is essential, and also can use the specific admissible clutter energy in the receive frequency range of another channel, and the particular transmission power being used by transmitter.
With reference to figure 3, according to equipment 100 be wherein LTE 3GPP system with 13 in some embodiment of communication equipment of operation, show the spectrogram 300 of the RF channel 305 in 3GPP system.In the system of the type, these bands are comprised of one or more RF channels, but are that wherein this band only comprises the special case of a channel with 13.Equipment 100(is also referred to as the user's set in 3GPP standard) by being assigned to the sign of sequence of Resource Block (RB) of transmitting session (message) or the part (RF transmission frequency) that its part is assigned with this band.Each Resource Block has bandwidth, and each bandwidth is identical and be approximately 1/50 of channel width, by each Resource Block being identified from the index of 0 to RB quantity in band, deducts 1, is 49 in this case.In Fig. 3, for the clear Resource Block that is less than 50 that illustrates.When equipment 100 indications in this system are ready to launch message, according to the bandwidth that is considered to be applicable to type of message and message priority except other factors, by fixed network, to equipment 100, distribute sequentially at least one set of Resource Block.Because the quantity of (activity) Resource Block (it defines transmission bandwidth 310) distributing may be less than all Resource Block substantially, so will be appreciated that, allocation activities Resource Block, and result is advisably can distribute other Resource Block to used by other equipment simultaneously.Use the index of first resource piece and the quantity of piece, can identify the set of the sequentially piece in LTE 3GPP system.These parameters and tape identification have defined RF transmission frequency, and RF transmission frequency can be specified by low RF frequency 315 and high RF frequency 320.The index of low-limit frequency RB provides the information identical with Resource Block scope with the quantity of RB sequentially, and Resource Block scope is expressed as low RB index and high RB index.The total available bandwidth of RB in band is transmission bandwidth configuration 325.The frequency range of the whole Resource Block set in RF channel, at the upper and lower end of RF channel 305, than the bandwidth of channel 310 few the bandwidth of guard band.By transmission bandwidth 212(Fig. 2), channel configuration skew 218 and specified local oscillator tranmitting frequency, for the system that is not LTE 3GPP, conventionally can define RF transmission frequency.The sequence that is dispensed to the Resource Block of particular device 100 can be along with the time changes during a communication session.Will be below this is explained in more detail.
Will be appreciated that when equipment is assigned with piece in a small amount and larger transmitting power, the energy density of transmission is by than larger with many of equal transmit power.Will be further understood that, by the Nonlinear Processing generation clutter Energy Transfer (clutter) of mixing.Conventionally, the clutter that is called as anti-intermodulation (CIM) clutter is at f

min fact will there is Fig. 2 by transmission bandwidth 212() and channel configuration skew 218(Fig. 2) determined frequency range.
As the example with 13 embodiment for LTE3GPP, f
lO782MHz.Fig. 4 illustrate according to the CIM that frequently limits up and down and be associated of some LTE3GPP embodiment each Resource Block when not having clutter to alleviate skew for equipment 100 and for the table 400 of picture noise frequency.The row of table 400 are from left to right: Resource Block index, f
mlower limb (MHz), f
mtop edge (MHz), anti-intermodulation (CIM) lower limb (MHz), anti-intermodulation (CIM) top edge (MHz), IIIM lower limb (MHz) and IIIM top edge (MHz).In table, can find out, for example sequentially piece 40-44 has the lower frequency of 2.7MHz and the upper frequency of 3.6MHz in base band.Therefore, the minimum anti-intermodulation clutter frequency generating by these Resource Block is at (782-3*3.6) MHz or 771.2MHz, and the highest anti-intermodulation clutter frequency is at (782-3*2.7) MHz or 773.9MHz.Existence has the public safety band of the receive frequency range of 769-775MHz.Therefore, will be appreciated that the anti-intermodulation clutter for this set of Resource Block is the frequency in this public safety band.All CIM frequencies in the public safety receive frequency range generating at any one place of RB0-49 are shown in Figure 4 with black matrix.
Public safety band is strict with the quantity of the clutter energy that allows to generate in this receiving belt, and when using little Resource Block scope, for LTE3GPP with 13, the specification of Resource Block 43-49 do not allow equipment that their transmitting power is reduced and allows the so much of other Resource Block scopes.This restriction defines the clutter alleviation that can realize by the transmitting power minimizing in RB scope 43-49 and measures.In the energy density of not considering the CIM clutter by LTE 3GPP equipment transmitting, whether surpass in the method for simplifying of strict interference demand of public safety band, when LTE 3GPP is with 13 when transmitting, the clutter of+1.7MHz is alleviated skew 203(Fig. 2) be coupled to summation function 264, cause being offset the frequency that local oscillator signal 266 has 783.7MHz.The negative clutter of-1.7MHz is alleviated skew 202(Fig. 2) be coupled to digital mixer 225, digital mixer 225 generates the offset information signal 226 of configuration, and the offset information signal 226 of configuration is from modulating frequency f
mdeduct 1.7MHz clutter and alleviated skew.The RF transmission frequency of the clutter generating by Resource Block 37-49 when using this clutter to alleviate skew is displaced to 782.32-775.30MHz, and it is outside the public safety band of 769-775MHz.By observation CIM frequency for Resource Block 37-49 in Fig. 5, can find out this point, if show+1.7MHZ of Fig. 5 clutter is alleviated skew 203, be used to all LTE3GGPP with 13 Resource Block, CIM and IIIM disturb for LTE3GGPP with 13 Resource Block the table 500 of the frequency having.The row of table 500 are from left to right: Resource Block index, f

oFFSETlower limb (MHz), f
m-f
oFFSETtop edge (MHz), anti-intermodulation (CIM) lower limb (MHz), anti-intermodulation (CIM) top edge (MHz), IIIM lower limb (MHz) and IIIM top edge (MHz).
Will be appreciated that, skew for Resource Block in Fig. 5 removes the CIM clutter of the Resource Block generating by RB scope 37-49 from the first of public safety band, but the IIIM clutter generating by RB scope 7-18 is incorporated in the second portion of public safety scope.This is acceptable, for example, because for the transmission of the Resource Block more among a small circle (to three) in use RB scope 7-18, the through-put power of jamming equipment 100 is allowed to reduce significantly more than in RB scope 37-49.Because the relatively high power of the low RB scope for 13 reduces limit, together with can reducing with the power of any transmission of 13 with LTE3GPP for the constant offset of Fig. 5, be applied in, fully to alleviate the clutter that communication was generated using with 13.
Table 400 and 500 is only for being with for 13 of LTE3GPP system, the example how clutter is alleviated.Will be appreciated that, generally, for all 3GPP bands, or in other radio communications systems, can build one or more tables, described table is accepted RF transmission frequency for conduct input, and generate one or more clutters and alleviate skew as output, each skew, for a part for RF transmission frequency, wherein, receives the frequency range of the equipment for operating in another communication system for the skew clutter of specific.The clutter of considering (that is, listed those in a table or a plurality of table) needn't be confined to CIM and IIIM clutter, but can comprise, calculates or suspects the clutter having for any type that allows the energy that limits above of other communication systems.These one or more tables can replace with the one or more formula that depend on RF transmission frequency.
It should be noted in the discussion above that when carrying out the selection that clutter alleviates skew, should further consider when candidate's clutter and alleviate and be offset while being access in that the band that CIM and picture noise are displaced to or channel make clutter be no more than the admissible level of the band that they are displaced to.The consideration of the clutter the accepted energy trace of the receive channel that use can affect for clutter and the hint that is offset the receive frequency that the clutter that moves affects by use, and their acceptable carrier energy restrictions, generally by determining that for the manual analysis that generates clutter clutter is alleviated, be offset, and do not have to use the clutter when system to alleviate skew.Therefore, the grid of reference equipment preparation that is as the criterion is penetrated the distribution that the equipment 100 of information carries out, and pre-determines clutter and alleviates skew.
In order to reduce clutter condition, determine situation about occurring, at certain distance to a declared goal of range transmission equipment, the allowed energy level that the spectral density of the clutter of transmitting and frequency range can occur with them is compared.When transmitting power reduces (for particular transmission bandwidth), spectral density will reduce certainly, and when transmitted bandwidth reduces (for particular transmission power), spectral density will increase.For example, when dividing, be used in current information signal (message) (BW
cURRENT) transmitted bandwidth be less than predetermined threshold transmitted bandwidth (BW
tHRESHOLD) time, clutter condition can be confirmed as existing, and regardless of the transmitted power level distributing.Under the transmitted bandwidth of these distribution, the clutter energy level in influenced receiving belt is assumed to be the enable level higher than all assignable transmitted power levels, and therefore clutter condition is confirmed as existing.When transmitted bandwidth is equal to or greater than BW
tHRESHOLDtime, only when the transmitting power of distributing is greater than 23dbm – 10log(BW
tHRESHOLD/ BW
cURRENT) time, clutter condition is just confirmed as existing.
At some embodiment for LTE3GPP system, determine that clutter condition exists the situation of (being below expressed as " enabling anti-IM avoids ") to be:
I. network signals AdditionalSpectrumEmission value (1..32) in the SystemInformationBlockType2 corresponding with NS_# or MobilityControlInfo.For being with 13, only, when NS_#=NS_07, just need anti-IM to avoid.Except NS_# criterion, need ALWAYS_OFF and ALWAYS_ON pattern, always to operate (and distributing and Pout criterion regardless of RB below) with normal mode or anti-IM avoidance pattern respectively.Should, for each EF band, implement trans-IM_MODE key element able to programme.Definition and probable value for trans-IM_MODE are:
Ii. the RB(L_CRB distributing) number adds that RB_Start is greater than low threshold value and is less than or equal to high threshold.For each RF band, these threshold values should be programmable.Anti-IM avoids the condition that should be activated:
o（RB_start+L_CRB）>CIM_LOW_Threshold
And
o（RB_start+L_CRB）≤CIM_HIGH_Threshold
The definition of CIM_LOW_Threshold and CIM_HIGH_Threshold is:
Iii. the number RB(L_CRB distributing) is lower than threshold value (CIM_L_CRB_Threshold).For each RF band, CIM_L_CRB_Threshold value should be programmable.The condition that anti-IM avoidance pattern should be activated is
oL_CRB<CIM_L_CRB_Threshold
CIM_L_CRB_Threshold is defined as:
Iv power output (Pout) is higher than threshold value (CIM_Pout_Threshold).This Pout threshold value depends on distributes RB(L_CRB) number.According to following formula, can calculate this threshold value:
