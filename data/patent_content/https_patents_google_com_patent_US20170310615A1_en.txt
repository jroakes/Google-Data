The system analyzes the plurality of social network content items associated with the user to determine an element of the plurality of social network content items for use in creating a personalized input prompt to encourage the user to interact with a social network. The system generates one or more personalized descriptors based on the element of the plurality of social network content items. The system transmits the one or more personalized descriptors to a client device for presentation by a client application.
Description
- Social networking sites have the basic unit of the user profile, the online representation of each user. The attributes of the user profile differ depending on use cases and goals of the site, but most profiles serve to create an online identity of a real-world person. The more attributes a profile has, the better the in-product experience is for the user. Concretely, a more completely filled out profile enables other users to discover the profile more easily and the site to customize the product experience algorithmically based on the user's stated interests or interests learned by the social networking site based on user activity.
- It can be difficult to obtain profile attributes for some users. For example, some users, after initially filling out their profiles, do not regularly post status updates on the social networking site, comment on other user's posts, or otherwise actively engage with the site. This may occur for many reasons. For instance, a user may not understand how to use the product or platform, the user may not find content on the site interesting, or the user may have writer's block and not know what content to post. As a result, such users have a poor user experience and eventually stop using the site.
- Several social networking sites directly prompt users to till out key attributes missing from their profiles. For example, a site may prompt users to upload a profile image. Similarly, a site may display a “percentage complete” rating to each user.
- According to one embodiment of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system receives a plurality of social network content items associated with a user. The system stores the plurality of social network content items using one or more data stores. The system analyzes the plurality of social network content items associated with the user to determine an element of the plurality of social network content items for use in creating a personalized input prompt to encourage the user to interact with a social network. The system generates one or more personalized descriptors based on the element of the plurality of social network content items. The system transmits the one or more personalized descriptors to a client device for presentation by a client application.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include generating, by one or more processors, a social network interface for presentation to a user through a client application running on a client device, the social network interface including an input prompt; receiving one or more personalized descriptors, wherein the one or more personalized descriptors are based on social network content items associated with the user; generating, by the one or more processors, a personalized input prompt using the one or more personalized descriptors for presentation as part of the social network interface; and presenting the social network interface including the personalized input prompt to the user.
- Other implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance the system may further: in response to the presentation of the personalized input prompt, receive an input representing a social network content item to be posted to the social network; update a social network profile associated with the user based on the input; generate the one or more personalized descriptors by combining the element of the plurality of social network content items with additional information; access a data structure including a corpus of semantically interrelated data; retrieve data related to the element of the plurality of social network content items; generate one or more personalized descriptors based on the data related to the element of the plurality of social network content items; and repeatedly generate one or more additional personalized descriptors based one or more additional elements of the plurality of social network content items and transmit the one or more additional personalized descriptors to a client device for presentation by the client application.
- This disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to the same or similar elements.

personalized descriptor engine 220 includes software and/or logic executable by theprocessor 202 to generate personalized descriptors for use by the social network application 104 in creating a personalized input prompt. Thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 may use elements of social network objects related to the user to generate personalized input prompts to encourage the user to engage in more activities related to the social network. Social network objects may include, for example, a user's profile, pictures, posts, replies to posts, tags, news articles, personal messages, etc. - In some implementations, the
personalized descriptor engine 220 may analyze, for example, the interests listed in a user's profile and generate personalized descriptors based on the user's interests. The personal descriptors may then be used to create the personalized input prompt. For example, if a user's profile contains the statement “I love to ski,” the personalized descriptor engine may generate a personalized descriptor “skiing” that can be used in creating the personalized input prompt “Share what you love about skiing.” - In some implementations the
personalized descriptor engine 220 may usesemantic database 212 to generate intelligent personalized prompts based on sematic relationships between an element of a social network object related to the user and data stored in thesemantic database 212. For example, if the user's profile contains an attribute relating to an education in meteorology, the system could prompt the user with the personalized input prompt “Share your thoughts on Hurricane Irene.” In this manner, thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 is better able to identify interests that are both accurate and at the right level of granularity, e.g. identifying “meteorology” rather than the too generic “science,” a common failure of pure inference systems. - In additional implementations, assuming a user opts-in, the
personalized descriptor engine 220 may analyze data from other entities in thesystem 100 to generate personalized descriptors for use in creating the personalized input prompts. For example, thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 may analyze email, instant messages, flog posts, SMS or MMS messages, or other data related to the user. -

network interface engine 304 can receive information from other components of theclient device 110 or other entities of thesystem 100 viacontroller 302 for use in generating a social network interface for presentation to a user 114. For example, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 may receive interface instructions formatted using a markup language (e g., HTML, XML, etc.), style sheets (e.g., CSS, XSL, etc.), graphics, and/or scripts (e.g., JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.), and the socialnetwork interface engine 304 may interpret the interface instructions and render an interactive social network interface for display onclient device 110 based thereon. In sonic implementations, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 may determine the formatting and look and feel of the social network interfaces independently. For instance, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 may receive a structured dataset (e.g., JSON, XML, etc.) including social network information (e.g., a personalized descriptor) for display and may determine formatting and/or look and feel of the social network interfaces client-side. - The social
network interface engine 304 can also receive a user action on a visible user interface element from thecontroller 302. The term user action used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning including, but not limited to any action performed by the user 114 using the social network interface provided to the user 114, for example, a status message post, a reply to a message, an indication of approval of a video, a request to mute a post, a request for reporting an e-mail as spam, etc. - In one example, the user action received by the social
network interface engine 304 is a status message post. In this example, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 processes the user action by modifying the interactive social network interface to incorporate the status message posted by the user. - The social
network interface engine 304 can process the user actions by using a Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM may define a logical structure for the social network interface. The DOM can he a cross-platform and language independent convention for accessing and interacting with the interactive elements of the social network interface. In these examples, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 uses the DOM, for example, for identifying the interactive interface element corresponding to the user action and converting it into a non-visible UI element. - The social
network interface engine 304 can receive user inputs from thecontroller 302. The term user input used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning including, but not limited to an input submitted by the user 114 with reference to the display of the social network interface, i.e. the portion of the social network interface that is visible on the display. The user input includes scrolling the display of the social network interface, hiding the display of the social network interface (for example, minimizing a browser window i.e., a visual area displaying the social network interface), initiating a new social network interface (for example, initiating a new browser window for displaying a new social network interface, initiating a new tab in the browser window displaying the social network interface, switching to another tab in the browser window displaying the social network interface, etc.), refreshing the display of the social network interface, etc. Theuser interface engine 204 updates the graphical data in response to the received user input and sends a message to the on-page detector 206. The social network interfaces are explained below in further detail with reference toFIGS. 7-8 . -

As described above, social network content items may include, for example, a user's profile, pictures, posts, replies to posts, tags, news articles, personal messages, etc. - At 404, the
social network server 102 stores the plurality of social network content items in one or more data stores. At 406, thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 analyzes the plurality of social network content items associated with the user to determine an element of the plurality of social network content items for use in creating a personalized input prompt to encourage the user to interact with the social network. Additionally, assuming the user opts in, in some implementations thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 may analyze data from outside sources to provide determine an element of content items located outside of the social network for use in creating the personalized input prompt. For example, the personalized descriptor engine may analyze email, instant messages, SMS or MMS messages, other application data, calendar items, photos, etc. associated with the user. - At 408, the
personalized descriptor engine 220 generates one or more personalized descriptors based on the element of the plurality of social network content items. The personalized descriptor may include, for example, a text string, an image, an object, etc. In one implementation, to generate the one or more personalized descriptors, thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 combines the element of the plurality of social network content items with additional information. For example, the element may be “skiing” as used in the examples above. Thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 may combine the element “skiing” with a pre-determined string “Share what you love about . . . ” to create the personalized input prompt “Share what you love about skiing.” - At 410, the
social network server 102 transmits the one or more personalized descriptors to aclient device 110 for presentation to a user 114 by aclient application 112. Thesocial network server 102 may transmit the one or more personalized descriptors as a structured dataset (e.g., JSON, XML, etc.). In one implementation, the structured dataset may include the entire personalized input prompt. In another implementation, the structured dataset may include only the selected element and the client application combines the element with other appropriate elements of the markup language for rendering the personalized input prompt in the social network interface. - The
process 400 may be repeated to generate one or more additional personalized descriptors based on one or more additional elements of the plurality of social network content items and transmitting the one or more additional personalized descriptors to the client device for presentation by the client application. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart depicting anexample method 500 for presenting a personalized input prompt based on data semantically related to elements of social network objects associated with a user. The method begins at 502 where thesocial network server 102 receives a plurality of social network content items associated with a user. At 504, thesocial network server 102 stores the plurality of social network content items in one or more data. stores. At 506, thepersonalized descriptor engine 220 analyzes the plurality of social network content items associated with the user to determine an element of the plurality of social network content items for use in creating a personalized input prompt to encourage the user to interact with the social network. - At 508, the
personalized descriptor engine 220 accesses a data structure including a corpus of semantically interrelated data and retrieves data related to the element of the plurality of social network content items. For example, as described above, the element “meteorology” may be used to retrieve various relevant topics from the data structure. Using the relevant topics, the personalized descriptor engine, at 510, generates one or more personalized descriptors based on the data related to the element of the plurality of social network content items. At 510, thesocial network server 102 transmits the one or more personalized descriptors to aclient device 110 for presentation to a user 114 by aclient application 112. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart depicting anexample method 600 for presenting a personalized input prompt for display to a user on a client device. At 602, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 generates a social network interface for presentation to a user through aclient application 112 running on aclient device 110. In various implementations, the social network interface may include an input prompt to receive a post by a user. The socialnetwork interface engine 304 may receive interface instructions formatted using a markup language (e.g., HTML, XML etc.), style sheets (e.g., CSS, XSL, etc.), graphics, and/or scripts (e.g, JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.) from thesocial network server 102, and the socialnetwork interface engine 304 may interpret the interface instructions and render an interactive social network interface for display onclient device 110. - At 604, in addition to, or included with, the interface instructions, the social
network interface engine 304 receives one or more personalized descriptors. As described above in various implementations, the one or more personalized descriptors may be based on social network or other content associated with the user. In one implementation, the socialnetwork interface engine 304 generates the social network interface including a personalized input prompt for presentation at 608 to the user. In another implementation, for example, if the social network interface engine has already generated the social network interface, the social network interface may be updated to include the personalized input prompt. -
