Definitions
- the present invention relates in general to graphical user interface operation and, in particular, to a system and method for navigating within a graphical user interface without using a pointing device.
- Web content retrieval and presentation applications typically in the form of Web browsers.
- the Web browsers send request messages for Web content to centralized Web servers, which function as data storage and retrieval repositories.
- the Web servers parse the request messages and return the requested Web content in response messages.
- a typical search query scenario begins with either a natural language question or individual keywords submitted to a search engine.
- the search engine executes a search against a data repository describing information characteristics of potentially retrievable Web content and identifies the candidate Web pages. Searches can often return thousands or even millions of results, so most search engines typically rank or score only a subset of the most promising results.
- the top Web pages are then presented to the user, usually in the form of Web content titles, hyperlinks, and other descriptive information, such as snippets of text taken from the Web pages.
- Web browsers must be capable of presenting Web content provided in multiple divergent formats, including plain and formatted text, images, audio, and video and received in stored, static or live, dynamic forms.
- Web browsers are typically implemented with a graphical user interface to enable flexible presentation of visual content and to provide intuitive user interfacing controls.
- Visual Web content is output within a display area defined on the graphical user interface while user inputs are generally input both within the display area and within specified user input regions.
- the user input regions non-exclusively include text boxes, radio buttons, pull down menus, and popup dialog boxes. User inputs can consist of typed text, clicks, or both.
- graphical user interfaces including Web browser graphical user interfaces, generally require a pointing device, such as a mouse, trackball, track pad, or arrow keys.
- Pointing devices operate either in combination with or as a replacement for a keyboard.
- the graphical user interface generates an arrow or similar graphical pointer or cursor, which is logically coupled to a pointing device.
- the graphical pointer has a fixed or dynamically defined shape.
- users move the pointing device, which the pointing device translates into linear movement of the graphical pointer.
- users toggle or “click” one or more buttons linked to the pointing device when the pointing device is proximal to the desired item.
- pointing devices suffer from several drawbacks.
- pointing devices must be physically available.
- older legacy computer systems may lack a pointing device, or may have an incompatible pointing device.
- the pointing device may be lost, missing or broken.
- the user may suffer physical handicaps, which preclude the use of a pointing device, or the user may simply prefer using a keyboard exclusively.
- pointing devices can encumber efficient input.
- Pointing devices are typically devices physically separate from the keyboard. Operating a pointing device requires a user to displace one or both hands from the keyboard, thereby requiring a new “home row” orientation upon the completion of pointing device operations.
- pointing devices require coordinated visual tracking of the graphical pointers, which can be difficult for some users to see if, for example, the user is far sighted or color blind.
- An embodiment provides a system and method for navigating within a graphical user interface without using a pointing device.
- a set of one or more keyboard shortcuts is defined, including at least one key.
- Each keyboard shortcut specifies an action effecting a graphical user interface, which is executed upon input of each key in the keyboard shortcut and at least one key corresponding to a semantically-meaningful hyperlink within Web content.
- the graphical user interface is navigated.
- the Web content is provided on a view within the graphical user interface and a graphical pointer indicating a location within the view is included.
- At least one key input by a user is intercepted and the intercepted key to one such keyboard shortcut is mapped.
- the action specified by the keyboard shortcut is executed and the view within the Web content is updated relative to the graphical pointer.
- a further embodiment provides providing keyboard-based graphical user interface navigation.
- a graphical user interface is provided, including an output area displaying Web content and a user input region receiving user keyboard inputs.
- a set of one or more keyboard shortcuts is defined, including at least one key available on a keyboard communicatively interfaced to the graphical user interface and at least one key corresponding to a semantically-meaningful hyperlink within the Web content.
- Each keyboard shortcut specifies an action effecting the graphical user interface, which is executed upon input of each key in the keyboard shortcut. Keyboard shortcuts received from a user to navigate within the output area of the graphical user interface are intercepted.
- the Web content is provided on a view within the output area of the graphical user interface.
- a graphical pointer navigable within the output area is maintained and a location within the view of the Web content is indicated. At least one key input by a user is intercepted and the intercepted key is mapped to one such keyboard shortcut. The action specified by the keyboard shortcut is executed and the view within the Web content is updated relative to the graphical pointer.

- a plurality of individual clients 12 are communicatively interfaced to a server 11 via an internetwork 13 , such as the Internet, or other form of communications network, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- the individual clients 12 are operated by users 19 who transact requests for Web content and other operations through their respective client 12 .
- each client 12 can be any form of computing platform connectable to a network, such as the internetwork 13 , and capable of interacting with application programs.
- a network such as the internetwork 13
- Exemplary examples of individual clients include, without limitation, personal computers, digital assistances, “smart” cellular telephones and pagers, lightweight clients, workstations, “dumb” terminals interfaced to an application server, and various arrangements and configurations thereof, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- the internetwork 13 includes various topologies, configurations, and arrangements of network interconnectivity components arranged to interoperatively couple with enterprise, wide area and local area networks and include, without limitation, conventionally wired, wireless, satellite, optical, and equivalent network technologies, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- each client 12 executes a Web browser 18 (“Web browser”), which implements a graphical user interface and through which search queries are sent to a Web server 20 executing on the server 11 , as further described below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- Web browser Web browser
- Each search query describes or identifies information, generally in the form of Web content, which is potentially retrievable via the Web server 20 .
- the search query provides characteristics, typically expressed as terms, such as keywords and the like, and attributes, such as language, character encoding and so forth, which enables a search engine 21 , also executing on the server 11 , to identify and send back Web pages.
- the terms and attributes are a form of metadata, which constitute data describing data. Other styles, forms or definitions of search queries, search query characteristics, and metadata are feasible, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- the Web pages are sent back to the Web browser 18 for presentation, usually in the form of Web content titles, hyperlinks, and other descriptive information, such as snippets of text taken from the Web pages.
- the user can view or access the Web pages on the graphical user interface and can input selections and responses in the form of typed text, clicks, or both.
- the server 11 maintains an attached storage device 15 in which Web content 22 is maintained.
- the Web content 22 could also be maintained remotely on other Web servers (not shown) interconnected either directly or indirectly via the internetwork 13 and which are preferably accessible by each client 12 .
- the search engine 21 firmly identified as the Web content 22 best matching the search query terms provide high-quality webpages, such as described in S. Brin and L. Page, “the anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual search engine” (1998) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, issued Sep. 4, 2001 to Page, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.
- the search engine 21 operates on information characteristics describing potentially retrievable Web content, as further described below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- Note the functionality provided by the server 11 including the Web server 20 and search engine 21 , to be provided by a loosely- or tightly-coupled distributed or parallelized computing configuration, in addition to a uniprocessing environment.
- the individual computer systems include general purpose, programmed digital computing devices consisting of a central processing unit (processors 13 and 16 , respectively), random access memory (memories 14 and 17 , respectively), non-volatile secondary storage 15 , such as a hard drive or CD ROM drive, network or wireless interfaces, and peripheral devices, including user interfacing means, such as a keyboard and display.
- Program code including software programs, and data is loaded into the RAM for execution and processing by the CPU and results are generated for display, output, transmittal, or storage.
- the Web browser 18 is an HTTP-compatible Web browser, such as the Internet Explorer, licensed by Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.; Navigator, licensed by Netscape Corporation, Mountain View, Calif.; or a Mozilla or JavaScript enabled browser, as are known in the art.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a computer system 30 for use in the system 10 of FIG. 1 .
- the computer system 30 includes a processor 31 and visual display 32 , such as a computer monitor or liquid crystal diode (LCD) display, as are known in the art.
- the computer system 30 executes a Web browser 18 (shown in FIG. 1 ), which implements a graphical user interface 37 .
- the graphical user interface 37 is navigated and operated by using keyboard shortcuts, which are intercepted and executed by the Web browser 18 , or equivalent component, as further described below with reference to FIGS. 3A-H .
- Visual Web content is output within a display area defined on the graphical user interface 37 while user inputs are generally input both within the display area and within specified user input regions.
- Textual user inputs are received via a keyboard 33 .
- Linear, non-textual inputs are received via an optional pointing device 34 , such as a mouse, trackball, track pad, or arrow keys.
- voice- and sound-based inputs are received via a microphone 35 .
- Visual outputs are displayed via the graphical user interface 37 on the visual display 32 , while audio outputs are played on the speakers 36 .
- Other forms of computer components including processor 31 , visual display 32 , and input and output devices could be used, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- FIGS. 3A-H are functional block diagrams showing keyboard layouts for navigating within a graphical user interface 37 .
- each keyboard layout defines a set of keyboard shortcuts for the keyboard 33 , which can be used to navigate and operate within the graphical user interface 37 without using a pointing device 34 .
- Each keyboard shortcut specifics an action affecting the graphical user interface 37 , which is executed by the Web browser 18 , upon input of each key in the keyboard shortcut.
- a pointing device 34 could be used in conjunction with the keyboard 33 , but the pointing device 34 is not mandatory.
- the keyboard shortcuts are generated for selected hyperlinks within each Web page.
- semantically-meaningful hyperlinks are selected, rather than selecting each hyperlink in spatial or source order. Intervening hyperlinks may therefore be skipped.
- the selection of semantically-meaningful hyperlinks is based on an evaluation of each Web page using semantic analysis methodologies, as is known in the art. For instance, in a Web page providing a listing of search results, a hyperlink corresponding to each successive search result may be selected. Similarly, in a Web page providing a listing or clusters of information, for example, a list of projects, a hyperlink corresponding to each successive listing or cluster, such as, successive projects, may be selected.
- the Web browser 18 During execution, the Web browser 18 provides Web content in a view on the graphical user interface 37 , including a graphical pointer indicating a location within the view.
- the Web browser 18 intercepts input keys received via the keyboard 33 and maps recognized input keys to a keyboard shortcut.
- Each keyboard shortcut is executed and causes view in the graphical user interface 37 to be updated, as further described below with reference to FIG. 13 . Updating of the graphical user interface 37 includes automatically scrolling the view in the Web browser to the selection.
- the keyboard layouts are logically organized to provide navigational and non-navigational functionality.
- a keyboard layout 41 consisting of a navigation group for navigating a selection within a Web page is shown.
- four keys are used to navigate a selection within the Web page: the ‘J’ key moves the selection left, the ‘L’ key moves the selection right, the ‘I’ key moves the selection up, and the ‘K’ key moves the selection down.
- the view of the Web page is updated relative to the graphical pointer by jumping or scrolling the Web page in the direction indicated by the key selected.
- Other keyboard shortcut layouts for navigating a selection within a Web page could be used, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- movement navigated to a selection within a Web page is accompanied by variable speed scrolling.
- the Web browser initially scrolls the Web page quickly and then scrolls the Web page slowly into the final scroll position.
- the Web browser provides the appearance of “slow-in,” “slow-out” scrolling.
- repeatedly striking either the ‘I’ key or ‘K’ key for example, also scrolls the Web page until the end of the Web page is reached.
- striking either the ‘I’ key or ‘K’ key will cause the Web browser to fetch the next page of search results, thereby enabling the user to continue scanning search results without having to use a pointing device.
- Other forms of scrolling including variable and fixed speeds and combinations of jumping and scrolling are possible, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- a keyboard layout 42 consisting of a retrieval group for accessing or visiting a particular webpages shown to a way of example, the ‘enter’ key is used to access or visit a particular webpage. Typing the enter key causes the Web browser 18 to retrieve the webpage identified by the selection, such as via the navigational keyboard shortcuts 41 , described below with reference to FIG. 3A .
- Other key road layouts for accessing or visiting a particular webpage could be used, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- a keyboard layout 43 consisting of a caching group for accessing cached or similar Web pages is shown. Note the cached or similar Web pages must be supported and provided by the search engine 21 .

- FIG. 12 is a flow diagram showing a method 130 for navigating within a graphical user interface 37 without using a pointing device 34 , in accordance with the present invention.
- the method 130 is described as a sequence of process operations or steps, which can be executed, for instance, by the Web browser 18 of FIG. 1 , or equivalent component.
- the method continuously processes input keys in an iterative processing loop (blocks 131 - 139 ) as follows.
- Web content is provided (block 132 ) as a Web page in a view on the graphical user interface 37 , including a graphical pointer indicating a location within the view.
- Keyboard shortcuts are then defined for the Web content (block 133 ).
- the keyboard shortcuts are generated for selected hyperlinks within each Web page.
- semantically-meaningful hyperlinks are selected, rather than selecting each hyperlink in spatial or source order. Intervening hyperlinks are skipped.
- the selection of semantically-meaningful hyperlinks is based on an evaluation of each Web page using semantic analysis methodologies, as is known in the art.
- an input key is received on the keyboard 33 (block 134 ). If the input key is recognized as a keyboard shortcut (block 135 ), the input key is mapped to the applicable keyboard shortcut (block 136 ). The keyboard shortcut is then executed and the graphical user interface 37 is updated (block 137 ). The view of the Web page is updated relative to the graphical pointer by jumping, scrolling, retrieving, or displaying the Web page as indicated by the key selected. If another key is typed for the current Web page (block 138 ), processing continues with that input key (block 134 ). Otherwise, processing continues with the next Web page (block 139 ), after which the method terminates.
- the Web browser 18 intercepts each input key and executes an appropriate action. For example, keyboard shortcuts that access or visit another Web page cause the Web browser 18 to generate Web content requests, which are sent to the Web server 20 . Similarly, keyboard shortcuts that move the selection cause the Web browser 18 to highlight another selected Web page within the current Web page. Other forms of keyboard shortcut execution and graphical user interface updating could also be used, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
- variable speed scrolling movement navigated to a selection within a Web page is accompanied by variable speed scrolling.
- the Web browser initially scrolls the Web page quickly and then scrolls the Web page slowly into the final scroll position.
- the Web browser provides the appearance of “slow-in,” “slow-out” scrolling.
- repeatedly striking either the ‘I’ key or ‘K’ key for example, also scrolls the Web page until the end of the Web page is reached.
- striking either the ‘I’ key or ‘K’ key will cause the Web browser to fetch the next page of search results, thereby enabling the user to continue scanning search results without having to use a pointing device.
- Other forms of updating and scrolling including variable and fixed speed scrolling and combinations of jumping and scrolling are possible, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.
