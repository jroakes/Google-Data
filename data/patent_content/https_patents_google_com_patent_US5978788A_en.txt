Definitions
- the present invention is related to co-pending patent application Ser. No. 08/726,889, entitled “Adaptive Similarity Searching in Sequence Databases,” by Castelli et al., filed Oct. 4, 1996, IBM Docket No. YO996211.
- This co-pending application and the present invention are commonly assigned to the International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y.
- the present invention is related to an improved data processing system.
- a more particular aspect of the present invention is related to the application of decision support techniques such as online analytical processing (OLAP) to databases.
- OLAP online analytical processing
- Decision support is rapidly becoming a key technology for business success.
- Decision support allows a business to deduce useful informnation, usually referred to as a data warehouse, from an operational database. While the operational database maintains state information, the data warehouse typically maintains historical information. Users of data warehouses are generally more interested in identifying trends rather than looking at individual records in isolation. Decision support queries are thus more computationally intensive and make heavy use of aggregation. This can result in long completion delays and unacceptable productivity constraints.
- Some known techniques used to reduce delays are to pre-compute frequently asked queries, or to use sampling techniques, or both.
- OLAP online analytical processing
- Some known techniques used to reduce delays are to pre-compute frequently asked queries, or to use sampling techniques, or both.
- OLAP online analytical processing
- users typically view the historical data from data warehouses as multidimensional data cubes.
- Each cell (or lattice point) in the cube is a view consisting of an aggregation of interests, such as total sales.
- aggregation queries for data warehouse applications include those already defined in the standard Structured Query Language (SQL), such as the following five aggregate functions:
- rank(expression) returns the expression's rank in the set of all values of this domain of the table. If there are N values in the column, the rank is N if the expression is the highest value, and the rank is 1 if the expression is the lowest value;
- N -- tile(expression, n) the range of the expression is computed and divided into n intervals of approximately equal population. The function returns the number of intervals holding the value of the expression.
- Ratio -- to -- Total(expression) sums the expression and then divides the expression by the total sum.
- Red Brick Systems also offers three cumulative aggregate functions:
- Cumulative(expression) cumulative sums of values in an ordered list
- Running -- sum(expression,n) sums the most recent n values in an ordered list
- Running -- average(expression,n) averages the most recent n values in an ordered list.
- the aggregation concept is generalized to N-dimensional data cubes and the SQL query syntax is extended to support histograms, decorations, and CUBE operators. Creating the cubes requires generating the power set (set of all subsets) of the aggregation columns. If there are N attributes in the select list, there will be 2 N-1 super-aggregate values.
- the main techniques for computing the CUBE include:
- the system and method should provide the flexibility to deliver results in a progressive fashion and/or enable the trade of accuracy for speed when responding to queries.
- the present invention addresses such a need.
- the present invention is directed to an improved apparatus and method for approximating the data stored in a database.
- the present invention has features for flexibly generating multiple projections and/or representations from the database such that OLAP queries for the original databases (such as aggregation and histogram operations) can be applied to the approximated (often smaller) version of the database (called data cubes).
- the database can be converted into an initial data cube, such as a FACT table using well-known techniques.
- the present invention also has features which optimize the mapping of non-numerical or numerical attributes to other numerical attributes such that the error incurred on applying queries to the data cube is minimized.
- a computerized method for generating multi-representations of a data cube includes the steps of splitting the data cube, which includes a plurality of lattice points, into a plurality of dimensions; generating multi-resolutions and/or multi-projections of the data cube, in response to the splitting step; and reconstructing the data cube from the multi-resolutions and/or multi-projections.
- the reconstructed data cube including the multi-projections can be stored for later synthesis.
- the reconstructed data cube in response a query on the reconstructed data cube at a selected resolution, can be synthesized at the selected resolution.
- multi-resolutions of the data cube can be synthesized from the multi-projections and stored.
- the reconstructed data cube can be directly queried at a selected resolution.
- results can be delivered to users in a progressive fashion.
- results can be delivered in stages, providing approximate results at first and more accurate results later, as needed.
- the present invention has still other features which preserve the relative spatial integrity of the lattice points by defining boundaries of approximations so that the boundaries are preserved when approximated versions of the databases are generated.

- FIG. 1 depicts an example of a client/server architecture having features of the present invention.
- the server (106) includes a conventional database management system (DBMS) (104) and direct access storage device (DASD) (105).
- DBMS database management system
- DASD direct access storage device
- a query is typically prepared on the client (101) machine and submitted to the server (106) through the network (102).
- the query typically interacts with the database management system (104) for retrieving data from or updating data in a database stored in the DASD (105).
- the database can store the point-of-sale transactions of a supermarket.
- Decision support types of applications typically seek to discover knowledge or patterns from the stored data.
- an online analytical processing (OLAP) engine (103) may be used to intercept queries that are OLAP related to facilitate their processing (details of the OLAP engine will be described below).
- OLAP engine and logic may alternatively reside on a server dedicated to OLAP tasks. In general, it is preferable to couple the OLAP engine close to the DBMS and DASD to maximize available pipe bandwidth.
- FIG. 2 depicts an example of a process for generating a FACT table from the database.
- the FACT table can be used to assist with decision support queries.
- the attributes of a database can include non-numeric values such as names or sparse numeric values such as department codes.
- a mapping table also called a dimension table
- the dimension table is used to translate the original database into a pre-FACT table.
- the original database relation table (401) and the pre-FACT table have a one-to-one correspondence between their entries.
- the pre-FACT table is synthesized into a FACT table (402).
- the range of the integer values v of the attributes a in a FACT table (a1, a2, a3) is [v11, . . . , v12], [v21, . . . , v22], [v31, . . . , v32], then there are a total of (v12-v11)(v22-v21)(v31-v32) entries in the FACT table.
- the generation of the FACT table is essential for synthesizing the data cubes to be used for OLAP operations. This is because, as will be discussed with reference to FIG. 4, there could be entries in the FACT table that do not exist in the original database.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example of a conventional method for processing decision-support types of queries.
- queries can be categorized as aggregation or histogram types of operations and usually include constraints on the range of values of each attribute in the FACT table.
- the queries are applied to the CUBE.
- the translation of queries for a FACT table into queries for a CUBE is straightforward, as they have a one-to-one mapping.
- it is determined if precomputed results exist for the query.
- step 304 if the query can be addressed by the precomputed entries, then the precomputed results are returned to the client directly.
- the operators will then be applied to the CUBE (or the FACT table) and the results are returned, in step 304.
- FIG. 4 shows a FACT table (402) and associated relational table (401).
- the relational table (401) may contain 4-dimensional earth temperature data.
- the first four (left-hand) columns contain information on several time and space coordinates t, x, y, and z, while the remaining columns contain measurements at that point, such as temperature, and/or pressure, (shown for illustration only) and/or wind velocity, humidity, ozone density, etc.
- the measured values are usually aggregated over time (t), or space (x,y,z).
- the attributes of the relational table are identified as Time, latitude(LAT), longitude(LON), and Altitude.
- the values for the attribute time is mapped to a value in an interval between 0.0 and 101.0, the latitude is mapped to a value in an interval between 0 and 180, and the longitude is mapped to a value in an interval between 0 and 90.
- the mapping is one-to-one and reversible.
- additional empty entries might have to be created.
- not all the time values between 0.0 and 101.0 necessarily have corresponding attribute values in the relational table.
- not all the values in the valid ranges of latitude, longitude or altitude necessarily have valid entries in the original table.
- the FACT table can be much larger than the original table.
- FIG. 5 depicts an example of a mult-resolution technique having features of present invention for producing multiple representations for approximation of a data cube.
- a data cube includes a plurality of lattice points which can be considered as N tuples, each of which has the format: (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x I , y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y J ) where x i , which is in the range [a i , b i ], can assume d i distinct values. It is assumed that non-numerical values or sparse numerical values have been converted to this format already via the dimension table (or mapping table) described earlier.
- step 501 the FACT table is decomposed into J tables, such that the tuples of the j-th table have the format: (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x I , y j ) where 1 ⁇ J.
- step 502 transformation techniques (such as wavelet transformations) can be applied to the J tables to produce multi-projection and multi-resolution representations of the original table.
- step 502 transformation techniques (such as wavelet transformations) can be applied to the J tables to produce multi-projection and multi-resolution representations of the original table.
- the data cube is reconstructed from the J tables.
- these (linear and separable) functions can be independently applied to each individual dimension of the data cube.
- a separable filter function f[i] is applied along each dimension of the table followed by a decimation (or down sampling) along that dimension. This ensures that the transformation does not contaminate the information in the original data.
- the total number of dimensions of the table is preserved.
- the resulting representation has d i F for the i-th dimension. Note that d i F ⁇ d i I .
- a lower resolution level (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) is generated from the decimated version of the filtered table.
- the lower resolution representation of the original database is generated by the application of the linear function before a uniform sampling (or decimation) is applied. Otherwise, aliasing will occur when sampling is applied directly to the table. Aliasing is a well-known phenomenon when the sampling frequency is less than twice the frequency of the data. As a result, a filtering operation is usually necessary to reduce the frequency component of the data. This procedure can be applied to other dimensions independently, until a resolution level (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1) is reached. Still lower resolution representations of the original table can be generated by applying the same procedure recursively for each resolution level.
- the data cube is reconstructed from the J tables: (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x I , y 1 F , y 2 F , . . . , y J F ).
- each individual dimension of the data cube can be compressed, thereby reducing the total amount of space required.
- the relative spatial integrity of the lattice points in the reconstructed data cube can be preserved by enforcing semantic boundaries when the approximated versions of the database are generated.
- step 503 two storage options for the projections generated from the wavelet transformation are considered.
- step 504 only the projections generated from the wavelet transformation are stored.
- One advantage here is the total amount of storage needed is identical to that needed for the original database.
- One drawback is that each resolution of the database must be synthesized during query time.
- step 505 a more storage intensive but faster approach is to store multiple resolutions synthesized from the multiple projections.
- the total amount of storage required for storing these representations is increased, the computation speed is much faster.
- FIG. 6 depicts an example of the decomposition (step 501) and projection (step 502) of a two-dimensional FACT table.
- step 601 the process begins with the two-dimensional FACT table depicted.
- a simple averaging and difference operation is assumed for the filtering operation.
- the averaging operation produces a low-pass version of the table while the difference operation produces a high-pass version of the table.
- step 602 the table is passed through the averaging/difference filter, and the original FACT table is partitioned into four quadrants, representing the follow-pass, low/high-pass, high/low-pass, and high/high-pass versions of the original table.
- the low/low-pass version of the table can be generated by applying averaging along both dimensions of the FACT table.
- This procedure can be applied recursively in any of the quadrants.
- the operation is applied in the avg/avg quadrant.
- the avg/avg quadrant is thus decomposed into four quadrants (a/a1 . . . a/a4).
- the upper left quadrant (a/a1) can then be further divided by applying the same procedure. This procedure can continue as long as each quadrant has at least four lattice points.
- OLAP operations can be applied to the approximated version of the cube as well as the original cube. Examples of the application of aggregation and histogram operations to the approximated versions of the data cube will be described with reference to FIG. 7.
- aggregation operations usually involve the specification of a range: u 1 ⁇ x 1 ⁇ v 1 , . . . , u J ⁇ x J ⁇ v J .
- Different levels of accuracy can be obtained when the range-based aggregation is applied at different resolution levels.
- x i is no longer contiguous. For example, if x i assumes all values between 1 and 16 at the highest resolution, it will assume only the values 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 at a lower resolution level, and only 1, 5, 9, 13 at the next lower level, and so on.
- the larger the range specified for x i the lower the resolution that can be used for computing the aggregation such as AVG().
- the lowest resolution needed to compute AVG() is the fourth level, as the range boundary coincides with the decimation boundary.
- the lowest resolution that can be used for the range query 2 ⁇ x i ⁇ 10 is level 3.
- an interpolation error is introduced by using the value at 1 and 9 to predict the actual value between 2 and 10.
- a range-based histogram estimation is subject to more stringent conditions since a sufficient number of samples are needed in order to produce a meaningful histogram. For example, a 10 percent quantile requires at least 10 samples, while a 1 percent quantile requires at least 100 samples. This would impose an upper bound on the highest level (or lowest resolution) that the OLAP transaction can utilize.
- FIG. 7 depicts an example of a flow chart for flexibly applying OLAP queries to approximated versions of the data cube.
- an appropriate resolution level is selected. This can be determined by a number of factors such as a confidence level at each resolution and/or an error tolerance. For example, if a user (or application) can tolerate a larger error, a lower resolution version of the cube can be selected, resulting in faster performance. On the other hand, if the larger error cannot be tolerated, a higher resolution of the data cube (or even the original cube) can be selected.
- the new boundaries of the range queries are computed against the selected resolution level.
- the operators may then be applied to the data cube in the same way as the operators were applied to the original data cube.
- generating approximated versions of the data cubes can be done in conjunction with other performace optimization techniques, such as precomputation of aggregations and commonly used queries.
- FIG. 8a depicts an example of a flow chart for generating a mapping table which minimizes the bandwidth in FACT table.
- This method may be used to reduce errors (which may result from the use of only a low pass version of the original FACT table) by altering the low pass version's sequence such that the bandwidth is minimized.
- the FACT table sequence can be generated by mapping the categorical or numeric data into other numeric data via a hash table.
- a hash table can be chosen such that the high frequency component of the data is minimized.
- the mapping should be guided by the principle that data with similar values should be placed close to each other.
- a more rigorous approach is to select a to reasonable mapping of the categorical/non-numeric data.
- the mapping preferably should map entries having similar values to spatially adjacent points.
- the projection is computed.
- the approximated version of the data cube is synthesized.
- a set of queries are applied and an error between the approximated version and the original version is computed.
- the mapping is permuted and the process continues at step 802.
- the loop formed by steps 802-806 is repeated until in step 805, no permutations can generate better approximations.
- the mapping is accepted. Note that this is a greedy heuristic algorithm to discover the best mapping algorithm. In general, this algorithm does not guarantee that the mapping obtained is optimal.
- FIG. 8b depicts another example of a flow chart for generating a mapping table which minimizes the bandwidth in FACT table.
- simulated annealing is used to ensure that this procedure is not trapped in a local optimum.
- the technique of simulated annealing is well-known in computer-aided design (CAD) for the placement and routing of the physical layout of integrated circuits.
- Simulated annealing provides a schedule for adjusting a control parameter which is analogous to lowering the temperature in a physical annealing process.
- the schedule starts at a very high temperature. At this temperature, any permutation is possible regardless of its impact on the accuracy of the results.
- step 821 a random dimension table is selected.
- step 822 using this dimension table, the data cube is generated and the accuracy of a data warehouse query is compared with a previous multi-resolution representation of the data cube.
- step 823 if the accuracy is not improved, a probability of accepting the permutation as a function of the temperature is computed. When the temperature is high, the probability of accepting the permutation is also high.
- step 824 a random number between 0 and 1 is generated. If the random number is less than the probability, the permutation is accepted. Otherwise, it will be rejected and a new permutation will be generated, in step 825. After step 825, the process continues at step 822. If in step 824, the permutation is accepted, or in step 822, the accuracy is improved, the process continues at step 826. In step 826, the temperature is lowered. As the temperature gradually decreases, the allowable possible permutations also decrease.
- step 827 if the temperature is not equal to unity, a new permutation is generated, and the process continues at step 822. In step 827, if the temperature equals unity, (the simulated annealing results are identical to the heuristic algorithm of FIG. 8a) the process ends, in step 829.
- FIG. 9 depicts an example of a method for enforcing the preservation of a semantic boundary (this method can be used as an alternative to step 502 in FIG. 5).
- a virtual boundary can be defined along specified semantic boundaries such that the transformation process will only occur within those boundaries.
- the attributes to be projected are identified.
- the virtual boundaries to be preserved are identified.
- the transformation process is then applied to data within the virtual boundaries. Note that the process of generating the data cube is identical to the previous case, except that the wavelet transformation process begins at one boundary and ends at another boundary. Previously, the wavelet transformation started at a first entry in the data cube and ended at a last entry of the cube. Note that the compression gained by going to a lower resolution is reduced due to the enforcement of the boundaries.
