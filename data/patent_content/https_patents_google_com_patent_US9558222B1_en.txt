Definitions
- This disclosure relates to blending populations of dissimilar media items using normalization into a single search result selection list.
- Consumers of media content often select content from an ordered list of search results generated from a search engine query or algorithmically generated browse-able lists.
- Content options are often ranked in an order according to relevancy and/or popularity of an item queried. For instance, a user may desire to download a weather app, whereby the list of “top weather apps” is ranked by popularity to viewers based on commonly employed popularity factors (e.g. greatest aggregate number of clicks, number of downloads, number of views, etc.).
- a list generated from a popularity factor such as greatest number of downloads typically generates a list of apps that users can view for free.
- free content results may be unrepresentative of the breadth and quality of total available content.
- paid-for content is often drowned out in results that are a function of greatest number of views, but still may be considered preferable for user consumption due to premium features offered with the paid-for content.
- Results biased toward media items belonging to a single population group e.g. such as most viewed media items
- a system including a memory having stored thereon computer executable components, and a processor configured to execute the following computer executable components stored in the memory: an analysis component that analyzes respective media content items belonging to respective parent populations based at least in part on user browsing information; a scoring component that assigns a score to the respective media content items based at least in part on median value of a distribution of media content items corresponding to respective parent populations; a ranking component that ranks the respective media content items based at least in part on the score; and an ordering component that orders the respective media content items based at least in part on the ranking.
- the system can further include a presentation component that generates a display of the ordered media content items.
- the media content items are at least one of movie items, audio items, image items, downloadable applications, or other downloadable software or media.
- the movie items belong to respective parent populations comprising at least one of free movies or paid-for movies.
- the system can include an advertisement component that applies an advertisement to a section of the search result list.
- a method includes using a processor to execute computer executable instructions stored in a memory to perform the following acts: analyzing respective media content items belonging to respective parent populations based at least in part on user browsing information; assigning a score to the respective media content items based at least in part on a median value of a distribution of media content items corresponding to the respective parent populations; ranking the respective media content items based at least in part on the score; and ordering the respective media content items based at least in part on the ranking.

- FIG. 11 is a block diagram representing an exemplary non-limiting networked environment in which the various embodiments can be implemented.
- FIG. 12 is a block diagram representing an exemplary non-limiting computing system or operating environment in which the various embodiments may be implemented.
- the subject matter disclosed in this disclosure relates to a system for blending dissimilar, ordered populations of content into a single selection.
- a ordered list of content such as a list of downloadable apps, movies or music
- the ordering of the list usually reflects the greatest popularity among users (e.g. media items that receive the most user interest are listed first).
- Relevance-based and popularity-based results are generated in accordance with one or more algorithms employed by search engines. Ranking algorithms are efficient at evaluating popularity of a media item and can affix weights to various relevancy parameters or popularity parameters to determine popularity of respective media items.
- a media item that is free, or low cost may secure a greater weight than a higher priced media item.
- Typical ranking algorithms will order items receiving more aggregate downloads or views (typically free or low cost items) higher than those items receiving less aggregate views (typically higher-priced media items) which can disadvantage one population over another due to a limiting rank metric (e.g. ranking greater aggregate viewed media items over lower aggregate viewed media items).
- a user “view” means consumption of a content item (e.g. media content or otherwise), a click (e.g. clicking play on a streaming movie), a download (e.g. downloading an application), installation (e.g. installing an application).
- popularity based search results (for purposes of this disclosure search results also includes results displayed in a browse-able list) provide some utility to users, such popularity based search algorithms tend to skew search results towards a small fraction of media items based on generic popularity parameters leading to a sub-par user experience. Additionally, such popularity based search results can leave vendors of media content at a disadvantage due to infrequent and inadequate display of the vendor's media content to users. In an instance, popularity based search rankings typically display free media content items at a significantly higher magnitude than paid-for media content (e.g. media content which a user purchases to consume) which consequently subjects users to select from a less variegated and more homogenous set of search result options.
- paid-for media content e.g. media content which a user purchases to consume
- Free and cost effective media items often receive more views and greater user traffic over paid-for content due to low barriers to user consumption, greater availability, and unawareness of other media content options for consumption.
- the free media content has a greater probability of securing higher rank than paid-for content, appear with greater frequency and in greater number in search result lists.
- a user may not prefer to consume free media content he/she may consume such media content due to unawareness of alternative media content availability and lack of exposure to other options (e.g. paid-for media content).
- a user searching for a downloadable weather app will likely be shown search results of only free weather apps (for purposes of this disclosure, an app also includes any download-able or installable software, movie, music track or other media item) rather than options to view weather apps for purchase due to the higher number of views of free weather apps.
- free weather apps may feature poor quality, missing features, or other such undesirable qualities which are absent in paid-for weather apps.
- a search engine or browse-able list that ranks results as a function of aggregate number of views can present a user with a skewed list of results less indicative of a user's consumption preference.
- a common solution to this problem is to display multiple lists to a user, such as “top paid apps” and “top free apps”.
- the user can instead choose from a single list of ranked results including both free and paid-for media content options that may be more relevant to a user's media content preference.
- the blending algorithm described here can incorporate any number of such populations into a single list, including for example: free items; paid items; low-cost items or items part of a paid-for subscription.
- a user may prefer to choose from a list of results that reflect popular media content as per ranking of search results based on measurement criteria aside from number of views a media item received such as for example: number of times a media item has been linked to, mentioned or shared; veracity/authority of a media item (e.g. a news source that exudes characteristics such as trustworthiness, reputation, reliability, etc.); class or type of media content result (e.g. video, images, audio, news etc.), features included in the result (e.g. better picture resolution, bonus content, faster streaming, etc.) and other such criteria to better reflect the user's preference of search results.
- a single blended list can generate at least the following advantages: greater diversity of options displayed to users, increased range of vendors gaining exposure to users, superior user experience, and saving a user time when performing search queries.
- blended ranking system 100 that facilitates authorizing or restricting access to tagged segments of media content as a function of set permissions.
- aspects of the systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable component embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines.

- analysis component 110 can be configured to analyze respective media content items 170 belonging to respective parent populations based at least in part on user browsing information.
- a parent population is a set of media content items 170 wherein the media content items 170 share a similar property, value, measurement or feature. For instance, some audio music tracks are offered to users for free download and other audio music tracks are offered to users for purchase. Free audio music tracks may serve as one population of media content items 170 and audio music tracks for purchase may serve as another population of media content items 170 . Furthermore, a population may be separated into subpopulations wherein larger populations may be further distinguished through properties, values, measurements, or features. In an aspect, a parent population can comprise media content items 170 belonging to more than one subpopulation.
- a population of free movies may include subpopulations of free comedy movies, free drama movies, free action movies, free suspense movies, and so on.
- Media content items 170 may belong to multiple populations or subpopulations due to diversity of features, values, aspects, types and characteristics of such media content items 170 .
- a country music video for example can belong to a population of video content items or a population of music content items respectively. Accordingly, the country music video can also belong to a sub-population known as music videos which may be a part of a population of video content items and a population of music content items.
- a population can include a group of media content items 170 that share similar features including, but not limited to, the following: whether a media content item 170 is offered for free or paid-for by a user, the type of media content item (video, audio, image), the media content item genre (e.g. action, drama, comedy, suspense, thriller, . . . ), the topic relating to the media content item (news, weather, sports, finance, . . . ), content consumer demographics, user search history, user preference, user rating, non-user rating, user popularity, number of views, frequency of views, frequency of downloads, or number of sources linking to the media content items.
- a user preference may include information relating to media content items 170 such as historical views, user context, user location, user queries, etc.
- the user preference can be derived from any suitable number of traceable acts or data sources such as bookmarks, user queries, content published by user, user comments on content, user creation of content (e.g., uploading a video to a video distribution site), user created value-add content to existing content.
- popularity of media content items 170 can be assessed from media content sources, platforms and types that can indicate user popularity of media content items including, but not limited to; communication content technologies, published media content, problem processing content applications, news content, gossip content, research content, digital media content technologies, question-answer databases, digital video content, blogged content, podcast content, content forums, or review-website content.
- blended ranking system 100 can employ analysis component 110 to analyze media content items 170 belonging to respective parent populations based at least in part on user browsing information.
- the user browsing information includes information related to an interactive search activity conducted by one or more users.
- browsing information can be information related to a search query. For instance, a user performing a search for tennis shoes may input the words “tennis” and “shoes” into a search engine in order to browse a set of search results, the words “tennis” and “shoes” may be browser information.
- metadata, browser history data, download history, cache, passwords, saved form data, communication data, social networking data, e-mail data, published media content data, and other such user created content or data can be user browsing information.
- analysis component 110 can analyze social network generated tags related to the respective media content items 170 .
- a social network generated tag is an index to social network information such as a video, link, image, and other such information items.
- the analysis component 110 can make use of social network generated tags and social networking information from social constructs such as social networks. Users often interact with and participate in a social network which refers to a computer network that connects entities, such as people or organizations, by a set of social relationships, such as friendship, co-workers, college affiliates, etc. Also, in an aspect social networks can refer to a computer application or data connecting such entities by such social relationships. Analysis component 110 can make use of such social network information including social network generated tags to for purposes of aggregating and gathering a greater amount of relevant and popular media content items suitable to a particular user.
- a social network can include an interconnection of two or more social circles and/or connections between two or more nodes.
- a social circle for a given user can be derived for example from the user's contact list, based upon other users with whom the user has exchanged email or text messages, or with whom the user is associated in a social network service.
- the interconnections of social networks can be based on one or more specific interdependency factors between users.
- Analysis component 110 can analyze interdependency factors to the respective media content items 170 , whereby interdependency factors can be friendships, common interests, hobbies, career commonalities, kinship, financial exchange, likes, dislikes, romantic relationships, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, religious beliefs, knowledge, demographics, geographic location or other such ties or associations between users.
- social constructs that include one or more social circles and one or more social networks can facilitate the user sharing content with other users with a preference to consume particular content.
- analysis component 110 can analyze social circles, interdependency factors, and social network generated tags relating to media content items 170 .
- analysis component 110 can analyze social network generated tags that include for example social networking information such as user groups, user like's, user subscriptions, social network posts, number of viewings, number of click through of media content item 170 to determine popularity or likely user interest to share a segment of media content with a specific content consumer. Such information can be used to factor into the likelihood that a media content item 170 is popular or relevant to the user's search query.
- social networking information such as user groups, user like's, user subscriptions, social network posts, number of viewings, number of click through of media content item 170 to determine popularity or likely user interest to share a segment of media content with a specific content consumer.
- Such information can be used to factor into the likelihood that a media content item 170 is popular or relevant to the user's search query.
- analysis component 110 analyzes respective media content items 170 belonging to respective parent populations based at least in part on user browsing information.
- a parent population contains a variety of statistical information associated with the population such as the collection of media content items 170 that comprise the parent population, the organization of the data within the population, and the interpretation of such data.
- a parent population is comprised of a set of media content items 170 and associated data
- a search query can display search results chosen from one or more parent populations of media content items 170 .
- each parent population is described by a normal distribution of data samples (e.g. data associated with individual media content items 170 ).
- the standard deviation is a common measure of the distribution of data samples within a dataset (e.g. a set of data associated with a group of media content items 170 ) and the normal distribution is a significant probability distribution.
- a bell-shaped curve depicts probability density of one or more variables.
- one standard deviation from the mean of a data set including data samples accounts for an identified percentage (e.g. 70%) of data values.
- the standard deviation characterizes degree of variation of a data sample from the mean (e.g. expected value of a variable).
- analysis component 110 can analyze data samples related to respective parent populations that lie within one or more desired standard deviations of the mean of the respective parent populations.
- the analysis component 110 can further aggregate a group of data samples from various parent populations. For instance, a user may search for a 3-D action movie; accordingly, analysis component 110 can analyze action movies from parent populations such as free 3-D action movies, paid-for 3-D action movies, animated 3-D action movies, non-animated 3-D action movies, recent 3-D action movies, and older 3-D action movies.
- Each parent population can account for more than one variable, such that a population can comprise movies displayed in 3-D, such movies being released in the past 12 months, and such movie requiring user payment for viewing.
- analysis component 110 can analyze statistics associated with parent populations and subpopulations.
- the statistics may pertain to specific features of media content items 170 .
- analysis component 110 may analyze statistics for each variable or feature that characterizes the distribution of particular media content items 170 across one or more populations of media content items 170 .
- the set of statistics analyzed may be based on, for example, the mean, the median, the standard deviation, the quartiles, the sum, and other statistical metrics.
- the statistical metrics analyzed can also include statistics, such as the median value of a distribution of scored media content items, relating to a derived score that is associated with media content items 170 .
- a scoring component 120 assigns a score to the respective media content items 170 based at least in part on a median value of a distribution of media content items 170 corresponding to the respective parent populations.
- the score for each individual media item is normalized using the median value for the respective parent population.
- a set of statistics relating to parent populations of media content items 170 can be generated. The statistics, such as a median value or a normalization curve related to media content items of a respective parent population, can factor into the scoring of media content items 170 to support the likelihood a media content item 170 is related to the user search query.
- scoring component 120 can perform the action of receiving analyzed data samples or other such analyzed information relating to media content items 170 and assign a score to the media content items 170 .
- the assigned score can be based on any one or more scoring formulas that describe the quality, relevance, or other such scoring criteria of media content items 170 in relation to the user search query.
- the scoring can be based on any number of search result sets. Each search result set can be based on a separate variable.
- each search set can be based on each respective term in the search query.
- a user query for a “yoga meditation video” can generate three sets of search results; a result for “yoga”, a result for “meditation” and a result for “video” (also more than three sets of search results can be created, for instance, “meditation video” search result set or “yoga video” search result set, however, three sets are identified for purposes of the example).
- each set of search results can be scored based on the quality and relevance to the search query term.
- results for “yoga” can generate a list of yoga items such as vinyasa yoga, breathing yoga, hot yoga, bikram yoga, ashtanga yoga, meditation yoga and other such yoga items.
- Scoring component 120 can assign a score to each item, such that a higher score is associated with a higher quality media item.
- meditation yoga may receive a higher score than ashtanga yoga and a meditation yoga video item may receive a higher score than a meditation yoga tutorial or blog item.
- the search result score of the first set of media content items 170 can be based on a first scoring criteria.
- the search result score of the second set of media content items 170 can be based on a second scoring criteria that is the same or different from the first scoring criteria.
- the scores of the first set, second set, and N sets of media content items 170 can be aggregated and standardized according to a scoring formula or scoring algorithm in order to generate a single list of media content items 170 for purposes of ranking based on quality, relevance, blending variables, and other such criteria associated with the search results.
- a ranking component 130 ranks the respective media content items 170 based at least in part on the score.
- the single list of media content items 170 with associated scores assigned to each media content items 170 can be ranked according to various ranking factors.
- the ranking component 130 can be configured to rank a list of media content items 170 based at least in part on the score generated as per relevance, quality or other scored criteria related to the media content items 170 .
- the ranking can be based on a score that accounts for user interest in a media content item 170 .
- the user interest can be based on (e.g. via inference) browser information (e.g.
- ranking component 130 can rank the media content items based at least in part on one or more of critical rating (a rating generated by a computer, user, or group of users associated with a media content item), number of critical reviews (the aggregate quantity of reviews associated with a media content item), recency (the date a media content item was introduced on the internet), user interest, user preference, user traffic, popularity, or user demographics.
- the ranking component 130 can apply a priority scheme relating to relevance, quality, user interest or another score criteria associated with media content items 170 .
- the ranking component 130 can rank a user's interest in one media content item 170 as higher than another media content item 170 .

- the ordering component 140 may use a predetermined labeled class, genre, bucket, or category to associate a class, genre, or category with a media content item 170 .
- ordering component 140 may order the media content items 170 into a genre by associating a title, words from the title, or other meta-data words associated with a particular genre (i.e. action videos, country music audio items, etc.).
- the extracted words or identifiers may be associated with a class, genre, or category within a predetermined label.
- ordering component 140 can retrieve the associated class, genre, or category from the predetermined label by using extracted identifiers.
- any movie title with the words “ball,” “hoop,” and “shoot” in the title are ordered into a movie category labeled “sport movies” wherein such movie's with ball, hoop and shoot in the title may be retrieved as a search result from such ordered list.
- ordering component 140 can order media content items 170 based on external information such as users social network labels (e.g. predetermined classifications labels). For example, ordering component 140 can order media content items 170 based on text analysis (e.g. via analysis component 110 ) to determine classification labels to associate with user nodes in a generated social graph. Analysis component 110 in connection with ordering component 140 can analyze and order media content associated with user profiles, comments posted by a user (e.g. comments on a video posted to user social network account), descriptions of groups to which a user belongs, etc. In an aspect, ordering component 140 can order media content items 170 into predetermined classification labels based on keywords, which can be submitted by advertisers.

- statistical generator component 210 can generate a normal distribution of media content items 170 within a parent population. Furthermore, a standard distribution of the media content items 170 can be generated. A large standard deviation indicates that the media content items 170 are far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that the media content items 170 within that standard deviation are clustered closely around the mean. In general, the more media content items 170 that are sampled by statistical generator 210 in generating statistics, the greater likelihood a small standard deviation will be obtained and therefore a more reliable estimate of the mean of a random variable or feature analyzed.
- the distribution of media content items 170 that are comedy videos can be approximated by a normal distribution.

- Statistical generator 210 can generate a normal distribution of comedy videos and determine a standard deviation of specific video's that are romantic comedies. Those romantic comedies that lie within a standard deviation closer to the mean are likely to be a more reliable estimate of a video the user desires to view.
- statistical generator 210 can generate statistics based on various populations and analysis component 110 can analyze such results for purposes of procuring blended search results.
- statistical generator 210 can generate a normal distribution and standard deviation statistics for romantic comedies within a population of comedies that users can view for free and generate the statistics for romantic comedies within a population of comedies that users can view for a fee. The generation of statistics over many populations allows for a greater variety and range of search results therefore enhancing a user's search experience.
- blended ranking system 200 can make use of algorithms in connection with any one or more of statistical generator component 210 , analysis component 110 , scoring component 120 , ranking component 130 or ordering component 140 to facilitate a blended ranking of dissimilar populations.

Abstract
Description
f count=Free item popularity count list
p count=Paid item popularity count list=Paid item purchase count list
The popularity count data can be grouped (e.g. via ordering component 140) into various buckets sorted by powers of ten (e.g. 0-10, 10-100, 100-1000, etc.):
f i ={x}∀xεf count|10i-1 <x<10i
p i ={x}∀xεp count|10i-1 <x<10i
The counts for each group of free count data and paid-for count data can be Cf
Let Adiff=GMf−GMp, where GMf and GMp are respective geometric means of the most common bucket.
F b=0 if A diff>0 else A diff
P b =A diff if A diff>0 else 0
Further, the ranking score can be calculated for an individual free item or paid-for item respectively using the offset calculations in previous steps (e.g. normalization of each individual item, relative to its parent population):
S x
S x
In an aspect, blended ranking
