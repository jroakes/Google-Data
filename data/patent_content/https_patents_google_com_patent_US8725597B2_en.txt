CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
The present application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/914,000, filed Apr. 25, 2007 and entitled “Merchant Scoring and Transactional Database”, which is specifically incorporated by reference for all that it discloses and teaches.
BACKGROUND
Advances in online commerce technology have permitted merchants to launch online businesses relatively quickly and without a substantial investment. However, when a business is built in a market so rapidly, the merchant often does not have the opportunity to build a significant amount of brand recognition and trust with its customers. As such, consumers are wary of spending their dollars and entrusting their credit card information with merchants they do not know well.
There currently exist limited services to address certain aspects relating to secure transmission of data in merchant transactions. These services may involve site advisors, hacker testing, and secure sockets layer certificates (“SSL Certificates”), etc. Site advisors and hacker testing services audit websites for malicious code or the susceptibility for unauthorized access to the site (and customer data). SSL Certificates, one of the most commonly used services/products that has been designed to elicit trust from consumers, provide two methods for addressing consumers' confidence: (i) they enable encrypted communications with a website; and (ii) for Extended Validation (“EV”) and Operational Validation (“OV”) SSL Certificates, they identify the legal entity that controls a website (e.g., reducing the chance that a consumer establishes an encrypted connection with an unauthorized party).
Services involving site advisors, hacker testing, and SSL Certificates only help address data security, which is a small contribution to the consumers' lack of confidence in unknown e-commerce sites. For example, EV SSL Certificates-which is considered the highest and most secure form of SSL Certificates—expressly exclude assurances, representations or warranties about the behavior of the merchant and/or the quality of a consumer's experience with the merchant. In addition, an SSL Certificate does not provide any indications or assessments about what happens to a consumer's personal and/or financial information once the data is passed to the merchant's website.
In fact, a group of leading SSL Certificate issuers and providers of Internet browsers recently established the Certification Authority/Browser (CA/Browser) Forum, to develop standards and guidelines for EV SSL Certificates in order to improve the security of online transactions. The CA/Browser Forum, which is comprised of companies such as Microsoft Corporation and VeriSign, Inc., acknowledges the incomplete nature of these services in addressing a consumer's lack of confidence in e-commerce sites. The CA/Browser Forum Guidelines, promulgated by a number of leading issuers of EV SSL Certificates, states that:
-
- EV Certificates focus only on the identity of the Subject named in the Certificate, and not on the behavior of the Subject. As such, an EV Certificate is not intended to provide any assurances, or otherwise represent or warrant:
- (1) That the Subject named in the EV Certificate is actively engaged in doing business;
- (2) That the Subject named in the EV Certificate complies with applicable laws;
- (3) That the Subject named in the EV Certificate is trust worthy, honest, or reputable in its business dealings; or
- (4) That it is “safe” to do business with the Subject named in the EV Certificate.
- [See Section B(2)(c) (Excluded Purposes) of the CA/Browser Forum Guidelines for Extended Validation Certificates (Dated Oct. 20, 2006 as Version 1.0—Draft 11) (Emphasis added).]
SUMMARY
Implementations described and claimed herein address the foregoing problems by providing a system for predicting and reporting the likelihood that a merchant is reliable (e.g., trustworthy, honest, and reputable) in its business dealings. A merchant reliability metric in this technology is expected to translate into a positive or good consumer experience in most circumstances. In one implementation, the described technology collects data from a variety of data sources, including combinations of the merchant, third-parties, and/or customers who have transacted with the merchant. A scoring model is executed on this collected data to determine an independent and objective merchant reliability metric (e.g., a “web score” or “W Score”) that predicts the expected reliability of an online merchant within a range. The described technology may also track transactions of individual merchants, populating a transaction history database with information about each merchant for use in this collection and scoring process. The transaction history data and other data may be used not only to supplement the merchant reliability metric but may also be accessible to a prospective customer to build his or her confidence in and understanding of the merchant reliability metric and his or her trust of the merchant.
This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.
Other implementations are also described and recited herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The described technology addresses, among other things, a consumer's lack of trust or understanding of reliability in unknown or unfamiliar e-commerce sites that has thus far not been addressed by existing services. A merchant reliability metric is generated to predict the likelihood that a Web merchant is reliable (e.g., trustworthy, honest, and reputable) in its business dealings. These characteristics are expected to translate into a positive or good consumer experience in most circumstances. Data informing the merchant reliability metric is collected from a variety of sources, including without limitation a combination of one or more of (a) the merchant itself, (b) third-party data sources, and (c) customers who have transacted with the merchant. Such data is collected into a datastore that is accessible by a scoring model, which computes the merchant reliability metric. The described technology may also be applied to offline merchants if the appropriate data can be collected and the merchant reliability metric can be reported in a manner that is conspicuous to consumers of these offline merchants.
FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 providing a merchant reliability metric of a merchant running a scored website 102 to a consumer. In a typical scenario, a consumer may access one or more websites, including the scored website 102 and an unscored website 104, via a communications network 108, such as the Internet. The consumer may use a consumer computing system 106, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile computing/telephony device or media player, etc., to access the websites 102 or 104. Either website 102 or 104 may exhibit a variety of trust-related representations, including SSL certification badges, hacker safety badges, affiliation with a trusted retailer (e.g., www.bestbuy.com), etc. However, individually, such characteristics only provide limited identification of specific types of trust-related representations on a YES/NO basis, and none of them articulate a merchant reliability metric (e.g., a web score) predicting the expected reliability of an online merchant within a range of reliability. Furthermore, such characteristics are not personalized to the individual risk tolerance of a consumer, making it more difficult for the consumer to understand relative to his or her own expectations.
The presence of a merchant reliability metric for the merchant running the scored website 102 is indicated by a merchant reliability metric badge 110 displayed or being otherwise accessible via the scored website 102. The merchant reliability metric badge 110 in the illustrated implementation represents a hyperlink and/or a control that provides access to a summary display of the merchant reliability metric and/or information collected to compute or otherwise support the merchant reliability metric. For example, in one implementation, a user may hover the mouse pointer over the merchant reliability metric badge and a summary of the merchant reliability metric is displayed (e.g., the name of the merchant, its merchant reliability metric, its merchant identifier, etc.). In another implementation, a user may select the merchant reliability metric badge to navigate to a web page that provides a summary of the merchant reliability metric as well as access to more specific supporting information (see e.g., the web page 202 of FIG. 2). Other implementations are contemplated, including a control that generates a merchant reliability metric report with the computed merchant reliability metric and supporting information compiled therein.
To compute the merchant reliability metric, a scoring authority system 112 collects information from a variety of data sources, including without limitation a combination of one or more of (a) the merchant itself, (b) third-party data sources (e.g., website traffic statistics sources, public records sources, commercial reporting bureaus, etc.), and (c) customers who have transacted with the merchant. The collected information is stored in a data storage system 116 that is accessible by the scoring authority system 112. The scoring authority system 112 executes a scoring model (not shown) on this information to generate the merchant reliability metric within a range of trust. For example, on a scale of 0-100, the merchant reliability metric in FIG. 2 indicates a merchant reliability metric of 48.
Depending on the level of risk tolerance or aversion a consumer may have, the consumer may consider this merchant reliability metric relative to a higher reliability metric of another merchant in their shopping decision. In one implementation, a merchant reliability metric of 48 may indicate that the merchant is predicted to be less reliable than over 50% of the scored merchants, although other meanings of a merchant reliability metric may be employed.
In one implementation, the merchant reliability metric indicates that the merchant is predicted to be more or less reliable than other scored merchants, reliable in the sense that the merchant is expected to (i) deliver the product (ii) in either good or excellent condition (iii) in a timely manner while (iv) keeping its customers' personal and financial information secure; the merchant (v) is more likely to honor obligations for customer service and support (e.g., return policies, refunds, etc.); etc. In various implementations, reliability is a likelihood that one or more of these results will occur with the merchant, based on a scoring of certain defined merchant reliability characteristics.
In addition to providing a merchant's reliability metric, the system also provides access to the background information used to generate the merchant's reliability metric. As such, if the consumer wishes to understand why a merchant's reliability metric is so low, the consumer can view a merchant reliability metric report or navigate into the various tabs available on a merchant reliability metric webpage. For example, the merchant reliability metric may be lower because of a high order return rate on specific sold products through the merchant's website. The more detailed supporting information can identify trends that the high return rate was limited to a specific product that the consumer is not interested in or that the return rate has decreased in recent months and the merchant reliability metric has therefore been improving. Importantly, the unscored website 104 does not indicate any predicted level of reliability for the associated merchant, so the consumer does not have the same opportunity to evaluate and/or investigate the likely reliability of the merchant.
An output of the system 100 is a merchant reliability metric and supporting information (both included in metric data 118) that a consumer can consider to determine whether to transact business with the associated merchant through the scored website 102. As described later, the merchant reliability metric can also be personalized for individual consumers, based on information provided by each consumer and/or upon other information available about each consumer. For example, a consumer who frequently returns merchandise from e-commerce orders may be less tolerant of a strict and limited return policy than another consumer. Therefore, such a consumer may weigh the return policy component of the merchant reliability metric more heavily than another consumer.
FIG. 2 illustrates an example web page 200 from a scored website and an associated merchant reliability metric display 202. The web page 200 is retrieved from the merchant's website and displayed to the consumer on the consumer's computing system. The web page 200 represents a web page from a typical e-commerce website that has been scored using a merchant reliability metric, as represented by the Merchant Score badge 204 displayed on the web page 200. In the illustrated example, a merchant identifier (“ID”) 206 is displayed just below the Merchant Score Badge 204.
In one implementation, by hovering or otherwise selecting the pointer (e.g., a mouse pointer) over the Merchant Score badge 204, a consumer may invoke the display of a merchant reliability metric summary (not shown), which may be displayed as an overlay on the web page 200. The merchant reliability metric summary indicates the computed merchant reliability metric (e.g., web score) to the user is associated with the displayed web page 200. Other information may also be indicated by the web page 200, including the name of the merchant and the merchant ID.
In another implementation, the Merchant Score badge 204 may be selected by the consumer to display the merchant reliability metric display 202. In the illustrated example, the merchant reliability metric display 202 is represented in a web page rendered in a window on the consumer computing system in which the merchant reliability metric (e.g., the web score) is displayed, along with the company name and merchant ID, in region 208. The web page also provides a graphical representation 210 of the merchant reliability metric.
Example tabs for accessing additional information relating to the merchant reliability metric are displayed above the graphical representation 210. Examples of the displays of the various categories associated with the tabs are provided later in this document. Generally, the information relating to and supporting the merchant reliability metric is accessible by the consumer via the tabs in the web page. For example, if the consumer found the merchant reliability metric to be lower than he or she wanted, the consumer could examine the information supporting the merchant reliability metric to gain an understanding of what kind of information reduced the merchant reliability metric for this merchant (e.g., no SSL certificate). If the consumer intended to order the product via telephone after shopping online, the lack of an SSL certificate may not be a concern. Another example control 212 represents a hyperlink to a report displaying some or all of the information relating to the merchant reliability metric.
FIG. 3 illustrates an example system 300 collecting source data upon which a merchant reliability metric may be based. A scoring authority 302 collects information from a variety of sources, including without limitation a combination of one or more of (a) the merchant itself, (b) third-party data sources 316, and (c) customers who have transacted with the merchant. Collectively, the third-party data sources 316 and the customers are considered non-merchant data sources. The information collected by the scoring authority 302 is specified in an inspection template that defines the reliability characteristics to be collected from each type of data source. Such data is collected into a merchant reliability datastore 304 that is accessible to a scoring model 306, which computes the merchant reliability metric (e.g., a web score). Such information may be collected via a communications network 308 or through other means (e.g., hard copying reports, phone calls, etc.).
In one implementation, the inspection template may also contain the point values associated with individual reliability characteristics, such that the inspection template both defines what data is collected from the merchant reliability datastore 304 and maps the data to point values. In another implementation, the inspection template merely identifies the data to be collected for individual reliability characteristics, and the scoring model does the mapping of characteristic data to point values.
In one implementation, the merchant provides information (e.g., merchant-provided information) used to compute the merchant reliability metric. See the communications 310, for example, flowing from the scored website 312 through the communications network 308 to the scoring authority 302. It should be understood, however, that the communication of merchant-provided information may flow via alternative paths, such as alternative electronic communication channels, telephone, mail or courier for entry into the scoring authority 302.
For example, when signing up with a scoring service to obtain a merchant reliability metric and a merchant reliability metric badge, the merchant may be asked to provide certain information in an online form. In addition, the merchant may be asked to submit signed and/or notarized affidavits relating to its policies, etc. (e.g., representing adherence to a written return policy). A merchant may also provide or demonstrate certain characteristics to an investigator sent by a scoring service or other entity to collect information used in computation of the merchant reliability metric. A binary parameter value may be assigned to the presence of certain merchant characteristics or the lack thereof, based on representations made by the merchant itself. In some cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the merchant merely provided information pertaining to a specific reliability characteristic. In other cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the provided information was independently verified. For example, investigators may evaluate the data against data obtained through other means, including on-site visits and cross-referencing with other reliability data. In yet other cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the provided information meets certain requirements (e.g., a written return policy allows at least a specified number of days for a customer to request a return). A variable parameter value may be assigned to the value of other merchant characteristics, such as a parameter value that represents a point within a value range or a certain level within a range of discrete levels.
Example reliability characteristics obtained from merchant-provided information are listed below, although it should be understood that other characteristics may also contribute to the merchant reliability metric. Some of these characteristics may be parameterized as a binary parameter value (e.g., does the merchant provide a URL to a written privacy policy and was a written privacy policy verified at the provided URL) and others may be parameterized by a variable parameter value (e.g., how long has the merchant been in business and how many contact points does a merchant provide for order assistance/technical assistance?). Also, the merchant-provided information may be compared against any corresponding third-party or transactional information, such that a match provides a positive contribution to the merchant reliability metric and a mismatch provides a negative contribution to the merchant reliability metric. Various combinations of these characteristics and others are contemplated.

The scoring authority may also collect reliability information from third-parties (“third party provided information”) to compute the merchant reliability metric. See the communications 314, for example, flowing from the third-party data source 316 through the communications network 308 to the scoring authority 302. It should be understood, however, that the communication of merchant-provided information may flow via alternative paths, such as alternative electronic communication channels, telephone, mail or courier for entry into the scoring authority 302.
For example, when signing up with a scoring service to obtain a merchant reliability metric and a merchant reliability metric badge, the merchant may be asked to provide authorization that allows the scoring authority 302 access to certain information collected and provided by third-parties, such as credit bureaus, criminal records databases, etc. In addition, the scoring authority 302 may also collect to reliability information from public record sources, such as certain government records, commercial databases, online information services, etc. As with merchant-provided information, a binary parameter value may be assigned to the presence of certain reliability characteristics or the lack thereof, based on the information obtained from third party sources. In some cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the information pertaining to a specific reliability characteristic existed in the collected information. In other cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the obtained information was independently verified from another source. In yet other cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the obtained information meets certain requirements (e.g., the merchant has a credit score above a specified threshold). A variable parameter value may be assigned to the value of other third-party characteristics, such as a parameter value that represents a point within a value range or a certain level within a range of discrete levels.
Example reliability characteristics obtained from third-party provided information are listed below, although it should be understood that other characteristics may also contribute to the merchant reliability metric. Some of these characteristics may be parameterized as a binary parameter value (e.g., does the merchant have any bankruptcy filings or judgments against it or are the merchant's SEC filings up to date?) and others may be parameterized by a variable parameter value (e.g., how many employees do state tax records indicate the merchant currently employs or what is the merchant's debt to credit ratio?). Also, the third-party information may be compared against any corresponding merchant-provided or transactional information, such that a match provides a positive contribution to the merchant reliability metric and a mismatch provides a negative contribution to the merchant reliability metric. Various combinations of these characteristics and others are contemplated.

The scoring authority may also collect reliability information from customers of the merchant (“transactional information”) to compute the merchant reliability metric. See the communications 314, for example, flowing from the transaction feedback source 320, such as individual customers, through the communications network 308 to the scoring authority 302. It should be understood, however, that the communication of merchant-provided information may flow via alternative paths, such as alternative electronic communication channels, telephone, mail or courier for entry into the scoring authority 302.
For example, the scoring authority 302 may provide an interface through which customers can submit feedback on their transactional experiences with the merchant. As with merchant-provided and third-party-provided information, a binary parameter value may be assigned to the presence of certain reliability characteristics or the lack thereof, based on the information obtained from the transaction feedback sources. In some cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the information pertaining to a specific reliability characteristic existed in the collected information. In other cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the obtained information was independently verified from another source. In yet other cases, the binary parameter value may indicate that the obtained information meets certain requirements (e.g., the merchant has a customer satisfaction level above a specified threshold). A variable parameter value may be assigned to the value of other transactional characteristics, such as a parameter value that represents a point within a value range or a certain level within a range of discrete levels.
Example reliability characteristics obtained from transactional information are listed below, although it should be understood that other characteristics may also contribute to the merchant reliability metric. Some of these characteristics may be parameterized as a binary parameter value (e.g., does the merchant contact information provided by the customer match the merchant contact information obtained from other sources or does the purchase involve a recurring charge to the customer?) and others may be parameterized by a variable parameter value (e.g., what was the dollar amount of the purchase or how many goods did the customer purchase?). Also, the transactional information may be compared against any corresponding merchant-provided or third-party information, such that a match provides a positive contribution to the merchant reliability metric and a mismatch provides a negative contribution to the merchant reliability metric. Various combinations of these characteristics and others are contemplated.
-
- What is the merchant contact information provided by the customer and does it match the contact information provided by the merchant or third parties?
- Did the customer purchase a good, a service, or both?
- What was the dollar amount of the purchase?
- Does the purchase involve a recurring charge to the customer?
- Did the customer purchase multiple goods in the transaction?
- How long is the term of the service purchased by the customer in the transaction?
- What was the location of the customer when he or she made the purchase?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the good or service (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the time it took to receive the good or service (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the accuracy of the amount he or she was charged for the good or service (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her belief that the amount charged by the merchant was authorized (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her belief that the date the charge was listed on his or her statement was the correct transaction date (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her belief that her or she was properly charged for the goods or services received (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- Was the good or service sent to the customer's correct delivery address?
- How would the customer rate his or her belief that the goods or services were in a condition that he or she found acceptable (as opposed to needing to be returned) (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the merchant's return policy, whether the customer returned the goods or services received (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- What was the fee for a return of a purchased good or service to the merchant?
- Was the return processed in a timely manner?
- Did the customer experience any unexpected or undisclosed charges?
- How many options did the customer have for contacting customer service?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the quality of the merchant's customer service (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the availability of the merchant's customer service, such as hours of service, etc. (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the helpfulness of the merchant's customer service (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
- How would the customer rate his or her satisfaction with the availability of live, real-time customer service (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 30)?
The data collected according to the inspection template for each merchant is mapped to a point value and stored in the merchant reliability datastore 304 for application in the scoring model 306, where the point values are aggregated into sub-scores that are combined (and possibly weighted) to yield the merchant reliability metric. Each data items in the scoring model may be weighted and may provide a positive, neutral, or negative contribution to the merchant reliability metric of a particular merchant.
A variety of scoring models may be implemented to provide a merchant reliability metric. An example scoring model is described below, with assorted variations provided throughout the description. In one implementation, the characteristic factors and weightings are defined to reward (with a higher metric) merchants that provide accurate information, have strong financial and security infrastructures, and can demonstrate a history of reliable behavior, and they are defined to penalize (with a lower metric) merchants that cannot meet these qualifications or do not meet them as well as others merchants. Naturally, most merchants will exhibit some positive characteristics and some negative characteristics, so that the resulting merchant reliability metrics tend to lie within the extremes of the reliability range.
The resulting merchant reliability metrics may also be computed within a predefined reliability range, such that the metric for one merchant is defined relative to that of all other scored merchants. In this scenario, the point values assigned to certain reliability characteristics are based on how well a reliability characteristic of the merchant compares to the same (or a related) reliability characteristic of another merchant. For example, the merchant may indicate that it believes it should be compared to www.bestbuy.com. However, in many or all characteristics, the merchant scores much lower than Best Buy. Accordingly, the resulting merchant reliability metric, sub-scores points, or weightings may be scaled down to indicate that, as compared to the merchants to which the merchant believes it is of equivalent reliability, the merchant's reliability characteristics do not demonstrate this. Therefore, the merchant's reliability score is reduced to indicate the risk.
The example scoring model employs a variety of reliability characteristics, as listed below, although other reliability characteristics may be defined in an inspection template for other implementations. Example weights for individual scoring items are provided as well, as a percentage contribution to the overall Merchant Reliability Metric (MRM).

Each sub-score of the scoring model is derived from available information, as defined in the inspection template. The inspection template defines the characteristics collected and the points allocated to a certain characteristic result. For example, if the merchant states that it adheres to a written privacy policy, its privacy policy characteristic sub-score within Merchant Information may be assigned 7 points. On the other hand, if the merchant does not provide a URL to a privacy policy that can be reviewed by users, 3 points may be deducted from that sub-score for a total of 4 sub-score points. Other methods of determining a total number of sub-score points for individual characteristics are described below.
In one implementation, with respect to the Merchant Credit File (MCF) sub-score, the scoring model assigns a numerical value (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) for certain information contained in a merchant's credit file, including the consumer credit score. When applied to a company, business credit reports the to tax ID numbers (e.g., Dunn & Bradstreet numbers, etc., which are example business credit reporting organizations) may be used. Optionally, the consumer credit reports for owners and/or managers may be used. For example, if a merchant has a low credit score, the scoring model may assign a low or negative value to the merchant's MCF sub-score to indicate a heightened level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In one example, the MCF sub-score may be selected from the following table:

An MCF sub-score illustrated above is an example of a variable parameter value, in that the point value assigned varies within a range with the value of the credit score. The MCF sub-score could also be augmented with a binary parameter value by adding a point value if the credit file indicate no current delinquent accounts.
An MCF sub-score may also be an average of points for multiple credit scores. For example, if the merchant has three owners, their individual credit scores may be averaged together to represent the credit score in the leftmost column above, so that the resulting point value reflects the contribution of credit scores from each owner. Alternatively, the point values associated with each owner's credit score may be averaged together to obtained the aggregated sub-score result.
In one implementation, with respect to a Shopping Cart Security (SCS) sub-score, the scoring model assigns a numerical value (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to the presence or absence of certain third-party trust seals that may appear on the merchant's website. Each seal indicates and/or certifies that a merchant has undergone some level of review/screening in order to be authorized to display the seal. If the merchant does not have a minimum level of third-party trust seals, the scoring model may assign a low or negative value to the merchant's SCS sub-score to indicate a heightened level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In one example, the SCS sub-score may be computed from the following table, which sums point values for those third-party trust seals that are present on the merchant's website:

In one implementation, with respect to an Internet Statistics (IS) sub-score, the scoring model assigns a numerical value (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to the traffic volume experienced by the merchant's website, the site ranking attained by the merchant's website, and the number of search engine links associated with the merchant's website. Each component may be weighted differently than another within the IS sub-score. These characteristics all represent a certain level of popularity of a website. The more popular a merchant's website is, the less likely the merchant's site will prove unreliable to a customer. If the merchant does not have a minimum level of internet traffic, site rankings, and/or search engine links, the scoring model may assign a low or negative value to the merchant's IS sub-score to indicate a heightened level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In one example, the IS sub-score may be computed from the following table, which sums point values for the components that pertain to the merchant's website:

In one implementation, with respect to an Merchant Information (MI) sub-score, the scoring model assigns a numerical value (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) presence of certain merchant-provided information as it relates to privacy policies, return policies, site terms and conditions, length of time in business, etc. If the merchant does not provide or demonstrate the existence of a minimum level of information, the scoring model may assign a low or negative value to the merchant's MI sub-score to indicate a heightened level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In one example, the MI sub-score may be computed from the following table, which sums point values for the components that pertain to the merchant's website:

A company running a scoring authority may employ independent or internal investigators to review affidavits, URLs, web pages, public records, etc. to confirm the merchant-provided information. The Written Privacy Policy and Written Terms and Conditions characteristics above are examples of characteristics for which verification enhances the positive or negative effect on the merchant's reliability score. For example, if the merchant indicates that it has a written privacy policy, three points are added to the Merchant Information sub-score. Further, if the presence of a written privacy policy is verified, then three more points are added to the Merchant Information sub-score.
In one implementation, with respect to a Public Records (PR) sub-score, the scoring model assigns a numerical value (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to the presence of certain information obtained from public records as it relates to individual or company bankruptcies, litigation, liens, judgments, state licenses, etc. Various items of information can contribute positively or negatively to the PR sub-score and therefore the merchant reliability metric. If the merchant has public record filings against them, such as tax liens or a bankruptcy, the scoring model may assign a low or negative value to the merchant's PR sub-score to indicate a heightened level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. If the merchant has state licensing filings, for example, the scoring model may assign a high or positive value to the merchant's PR sub-score to indicate a diminished level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In one example, the PR sub-score may be computed from the following table, which sums point values for the components that pertain to the merchant's website:

In one implementation, with respect to a Transactional Data (TD) sub-score, the scoring model assigns a numerical value (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to the ratings provided by customers about their shopping experience with the merchant and its website. Positive customer ratings predict a higher level of merchant reliability, including customer satisfaction with the transaction and its results (e.g., delivery of the product and/or service). Various items of information can contribute positively or negatively to the TD sub-score and therefore the merchant reliability metric. If the merchant has accumulated a certain degree of negative customer feedback, the scoring model may assign a low or negative value to the merchant's TD sub-score to indicate a heightened level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In contrast, if the merchant has accumulated a certain degree of positive customer feedback, for example, the scoring model may assign a high or positive value to the merchant's TD sub-score to indicate a diminished level of risk as it relates to merchant reliability, including characteristics such as merchant trust, information security, information use, and/or information privacy when purchasing goods and/or service from the merchant. In one example, the TD sub-score may be computed from the following table, which sums point values for the components that pertain to the merchant's website:

FIG. 4 illustrates example operations 400 for collecting source data upon which a web score may be based. A defining operation 402 defines an inspection template of reliability characteristics. Examples of the characteristics that may be listed in an inspection template are described in the description of FIG. 3, although other types of characteristics may be identified in the inspection template as well. The inspection template may also define where to obtain the data pertaining to each characteristic. For example, the inspection template may identify where in a sign up form a scoring authority may extract parameter data values pertaining to a merchant's address.
A collection operation 404 collects data parameter values about the merchant based on the inspection template. In one example, the scoring authority reads the inspection template to identify a location and/or a procedure for obtaining the data parameter value for each characteristic listed in the inspection template. The scoring authority then finds the location and/or executes the procedure to extract the data from the data repository or from other sources (e.g., a public records database, an online activity monitoring service, etc.).
A mapping operation 406 maps the collected data parameter values to point values and a combining operation 408 combines the point values into sub-score values, as described in the description of the example scoring model. Based on the sub-score values, a computation operation 410 computes a merchant reliability metric for the merchant. In some cases, each sub-score value may be weighted based on information defined a scoring model. A presentation operation 412 presents the merchant reliability metric to a potential customer of the merchant, such as by displaying a summary page or a detailed web page providing access to the metric and potentially the supporting data parameter values.
FIG. 5 illustrates an example system 500 providing a web score personalized based on consumer input. By annotating a scoring model 502 in a scoring authority 504 with a personal risk model 506, a consumer (who represents a potential customer of the merchant) can adjust weightings, point values, and/or the scale/range based on the consumer's personal preferences.
In one implementation, the scoring authority 504 has collected data parameter values for a plurality of merchant reliability characteristics and stored the data parameter values in a data repository 508 in association with a merchant identifier and/or an identifier of a scored website 512. In addition, the consumer system 510 has delivered (e.g., via a communication network 514) personal risk parameters 516 for the personal risk model 506, associated with a consumer identifier (e.g., username, etc.). When the consumer requests a merchant reliability metric for a specified merchant, the scoring authority 504 extracts the data parameter values associated with the merchant reliability characteristics for the merchant, adjust the weighting or values for certain merchant reliability characteristics according to the personal risk model 506, and computes a personalized merchant reliability metric, which is presented to the consumer in personalized metric data 518. In summary, the personal risk model 506 causes the merchant reliability score computed by the scoring authority 504 to be adjusted according the personal risk parameters 516 provided by the consumer.
In one example, the consumer is prompted to answer a series of questions regarding their risk tolerance with merchants (e.g., how risk averse are you, what level of confidence do you want with online transactions) and what types of information he or she views as more important to others in predicting the reliability of merchants (e.g., do you believe credit data should be weighted more than feedback of other customers of the merchant?). The former series of questions may adjust the scale or “grade” attributed to a merchant reliability metric, for example. Likewise, the latter series of questions may adjust the weighting attributed to individual merchant reliability characteristics or data sources of such characteristics (e.g., the merchant, third-parties, customers).
In another implementation, the consumer may be prompted to identify other websites he or she believes are safe. The resulting merchant reliability metrics may then be adjusted according to the differences between sub-score contributions of individual characteristics of the merchant of interest and the identified “safe” merchant. For example, the consumer may indicate that he or she believes that www.bestbuy.com is a safe site. If the merchant of interest scores well in many characteristics relative to those of Best Buy, then the merchant of interest's reliability score may be enhanced to be more comparable to that of Best Buy. Accordingly, the resulting merchant reliability metric, sub-scores points, or weightings may be scaled up to indicate that, as compared to Best Buy, the merchant of interest demonstrates reliability similar to that of Best Buy and so the consumer may choose to attribute a similar level of “safety” to the merchant.
FIG. 6 illustrates example operations 600 for providing a web score. A defining operation 602 defines an inspection template of reliability characteristics. Examples of the characteristics that may be listed in an inspection template are described in the description of FIG. 3, although other types of characteristics may be identified in the inspection template as well. The inspection template may also define where to obtain the data pertaining to each characteristic. For example, the inspection template may identify where in a sign up form a scoring authority may extract parameter data values pertaining to a merchant's address.
A collection operation 604 collects data parameter values about the merchant based on the inspection template. A receiving operation 606 receives one or more personal risk parameters from a potential customer. A computation operation 608 computes a merchant reliability metric for the merchant based on the personal risk parameters. In some cases, the personal risk parameters adjust weighting on data parameter values or sub-score values. In other cases, the personal risk parameter biases the computed merchant reliability metric according to the potential customer's risk parameters (e.g., multiplies the computed merchant reliability metric by 1.1 if the merchant's data parameter values are compatible the risk parameters). A presentation operation 610 presents the merchant reliability metric to a potential customer of the merchant, such as by displaying a summary page or a detailed web page providing access to the metric and potentially the supporting data parameter values.

FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary computer system 1500 for calculating the Web Score and implementing the transactional database as described herein. In one implementation, the computer system 1500 may be embodied by a desktop computer, laptop computer, or application server computer, although other implementations, for example, video game consoles, set top boxes, portable gaming systems, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones may incorporate the described technology. The computer system 1500 typically includes at least one processing unit 1502 and memory 1504. Depending upon the exact configuration and type of the computer system 1500, the memory 1504 may be volatile (e.g., RAM), non-volatile (e.g., ROM and flash memory), or some combination of both. The most basic configuration of the computer system 1500 need include only the processing unit 1502 and the memory 1504 as indicated by the dashed line 1506.
The computer system 1500 may further include additional devices for memory storage or retrieval. These devices may be removable storage devices 1508 or non-removable storage devices 1510, for example, magnetic disk drives, magnetic tape drives, and optical drives for memory storage and retrieval on magnetic and optical media. Storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile media, both removable and non-removable, and may be provided in any of a number of configurations, for example, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory, CD-ROM, DVD, or other optical storage medium, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk, or other magnetic storage device, or any other memory technology or medium that can be used to store data and can be accessed by the processing unit 1502. Information, for example, relating to merchants, scoring elements, and transactions may be stored on the storage media using any method or technology for storage of data, for example, computer readable instructions, data structures, and program modules.
The computer system 1500 may also have one or more communication interfaces 1512 that allow the system 1500 to communicate with other devices. The communication interface 1512 may be connected with a network. The network may be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephony network, a cable network, an optical network, the Internet, a direct wired connection, a wireless network, e.g., radio frequency, infrared, microwave, or acoustic, or other networks enabling the transfer of data between devices. Data is generally transmitted to and from the communication interface 1512 over the network via a modulated data signal, e.g., a carrier wave or other transport medium. A modulated data signal is an electromagnetic signal with characteristics that can be set or changed in such a manner as to encode data within the signal.
In some implementations, articles of manufacture, for example, a web score generating tool, are provided as computer program products. One implementation of a computer program product provides a computer program storage medium readable by the computer system 1500 and encoding a computer program. Another implementation of a computer program product may be provided in a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave by the computer system 1500 and encoding the computer program.
The computer system 1500 may further have a variety of input devices 1514 and output devices 1516. Exemplary input devices 1514 may include a keyboard, a mouse, a tablet, a touch screen device, a scanner, a visual input device, and a microphone or other sound input device. Exemplary output devices 1516 may include a display monitor, a printer, and speakers. Such input devices 1514 and output devices 1516 may be integrated with the computer system 1500 or they may be connected to the computer system 1500 via wires or wirelessly, e.g., via a Bluetooth protocol. These integrated or peripheral input and output devices are generally well known and are not further discussed herein.
In an example implementation, a scoring model module, a security authority module and other modules may be embodied by instructions stored in memory 1504 and/or storage devices 1508 or 1510 and processed by the processing unit 1502. Merchant-provided information, third-party-provided information, transactional information, merchant reliability metrics, and other data may be stored in memory 1504 and/or storage devices 1508 or 1510 as persistent datastores.
The implementations described herein can be implemented as logical steps in one or more computer systems. The logical operations of the present invention can be implemented (1) as a sequence of processor-implemented steps executing in one or more computer systems and (2) as interconnected machine or circuit modules within one or more computer systems.
