Definitions
- This invention relates generally to storage and retrieval of mixed graphic and text documents in document image databases, and more particularly to a method for indexing into graphical regions in documents based on text and graphical content in a query.
- the weight of an indexing feature reflects the descriptive nature of the feature and is computed from the feature frequency and the document frequency. This method is representative of approaches that also perform indexing based on content in image databases. M. Rothchild, "Dyslexic Digital Digger", B. Forbes, October 1994, pp.101-102; Pentland et al.,"Photobook: tools for content-based manipulation of image databases", IS&T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging: Conference 2185, Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases, pp.
- indexing can be done on only simple cues such as color (as in Swain, "Interactive indexing into image databases", IS&T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging: Conference 1908, Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases, pp. 95-103, February, 1993) and not specific objects so that the indexing can yield a number of false positives.
- This present invention presents a method for indexing into a database of graphical documents for graphical objects based on queries.
- the graphical documents are assumed to depict objects (possibly interconnected by connection lines), and annotated by text labels with the help of labeling lines.
- the graphical documents may be accompanied by some tabular information.
- an automated indexing system for use with a computer implemented data base management system, for indexing documents including graphics with related text in a manner allowing querying, including:
- the automatic method of indexing graphical documents that is presented in this invention differs from prior approaches in several respects. First, it requires no prior segmentation of a graphical document into individual graphical objects, each associated with a detectable word label. The word labels are associated with nearby labeling lines and connected regions pointed to by the combination are recorded. On being given the query, these stored representations of the graphical documents are analyzed for query-specific information. Using the text information in the query, the relevant documents containing the queried object are selected. The text information is also used to approximately locate the region containing the queried object in cases where the objects in the graphical data are annotated by text labels. These regions are then grouped into subregions likely to contain single objects.
- FIG. 1 is an illustrative document containing graphics, text and tabular information.

- FIG. 3 schematically illustrates the indexing system in accordance with the present invention
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating the primary operation of the invention
- FIG. 5 is a functional block diagram illustrating the database creation function
- FIGS. 6, 7 and 8 illustrate a the image processing required for images to be processes in accordance with the invention
- FIGS. 9A, 9B, and 9C illustrate lead line distinctions necessary for understanding lead line processing
- FIGS. 10, 11, 12 and 13 illustrate identification and isolation of image information in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 14 illustrates a user interface that might be used in association with the indexing system.
- FIG. 2 shows a computer workstation 100, connected via a network connection 102 to a text and graphics document storage device 104.
- the databases could be installed on the workstation's own storage device, perhaps on an external drive or the like.
- the processing steps that will be described herein may take place either on the workstation, or at a server or processor associated with storage device 104.
- the computer workstation may be associated with a printing system 106 for reproduction of documents in hard copy.
- the computer workstation may also be associated with a scanning system 108.
- the combined text and graphics document image of FIG. 1 will be referenced.
- Such documents will typically be high resolution bitmapped images, perhaps scanned from hard copy originals, or electronically generated by well known CAD/CAM programs and/or systems.
- the documents may be stored in some other document description format, but converted for use in this system at a time prior to the processing that will be described here.
- the objects depicted in the graphical data could be 2-D patterns or 3-D objects.
- a query is a request for reproduction of image information. While the discussion herein will be described in terms of a display arrangement, reproduction of any kind is contemplated, including printing hard copy, or storage of the query results in electronic media.
- the form of the query is primarily a text description of the object which can also be accompanied by a geometrical description about the appearance of the object.
- the queried object need not be labeled in the graphical data, and if labeled, need not have the same text label as in the text query.
- an indirect text query henceforth
- the association between the two is assumed to be made available through Table A accompanying the graphical document, such as the one in FIG. 1, referred to as the reference table.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an overview of the indexing process. Indexing of graphical documents is achieved by using information in a query 120 by an indexing system 122 to select relevant graphical documents from a graphical document database 124, and to isolate retrieved documents 126. For this, the graphical documents are analyzed to extract some general information likely to be used by several queries and stored in the database. Specifically, the graphical data is analyzed to extract the curves and junctions, lines, such as lines belonging to object contours, lines that interpret objects, i.e., that label objects, and lines that interconnect or show containment relationships (see FIG. 1 for an illustration). Since the types of these lines are not clearly deducible, it is difficult to group such lines into single object containing regions as is required for automatic indexing.
- the indexing method consists of essentially two stages, namely, the database creation stage, and the indexing stage which involves text-based approximate region isolation, and geometry-based query identification.
- the database creation stage shown best in FIG. 5 graphical data from graphical document image D is analyzed to extract some general representations that are likely to be used by most queries. If the graphical data is accompanied by a reference table (for example, Table A), the table is analyzed and linked to these representations. If no reference table exists, then all the annotating words are detected in the graphical data and stored in an annotating word table.
- a reference table for example, Table A
- the indexing method works as shown in the flow chart in FIG. 4.
- a table parsing indexing process 162 searches these tables to determine relevant documents.
- the detected table mapping resulting therefrom is also stored to document database 124. Otherwise, the annotating tables are searched.
- a region pointed by the annotating text is then localized in each of the selected documents.
- a region likely to contain a single object is then isolated within these regions. If no geometric information is available, then these regions are the result of the indexing operation and are displayed.
- geometric information is available, either in the query, or can be retrieved from a geometric database based on the query, then it is used to recognize the object in the selected regions. In that case, only those regions that contain a match with the geometric description of the queried object are given as the result of indexing.
- FIG. 5 Some general representation of the graphical documents that will be used by most queries are created and stored. These representations are used in combination with information in the query during indexing for object localization.
- the representations developed during database creation stage are indicated in FIG. 5. They extract the following information from the line drawing: a) Low level information about curves and junctions or connected regions; b) Lines that annotate objects in graphics (called labeling line; c) Word labels that annotate objects in graphics; d) The association of annotating word labels and labeling lines, e) Approximate regions pointed by the annotating words and lines.
- a word detection process is used to generate a word location table mapping for storage at document database 124.
- An annotation detection process operates on document D, for detection of word lines, generating a word line mapping for storage at document database 124.
- a connected region detection process operates on document D, for detection of connected regions (approximate object regions), generating an approximate region mapping for storage at document database 124.
- the original graphical line drawing documents are assumed to be of high resolution electronic form (if they are in paper form, they are scanned using a conventional 400 dpi scanner).
- the first step is to thin the line drawing using a line thinning process to compactly represent the document as a binary image.
- Each gray pixel (a pixel defined at more than 2 levels) in the thinned image is redefined as either "ON" (has a value 1) or "OFF" (has a value 0).
- Line thinning processes are well known, as described for example in Pavlidis, Algorithms for Graphics and Image Processing. Rockville: Computer Science Press, 1982, incorporated herein by reference.
- junctions are pixels with more than two on-pixels as neighbors.
- a data structure called the union-find data structure was used to implement Steps 1 and 2 so that these steps could be performed in time linear in the size of the image.
- the other steps similarly are also linear time operations.
- Step 2 A single point on the curve is chosen within each zero-crossing segment determined in Step 1. This point is chosen to be maximally away from the end points of the zero crossing segment.
- Step-2 The points chosen in Step-2 are joined to form the curvature approximation.
- FIG. 6 shows a scanned high resolution line drawing image.
- FIG. 7 shows the results of thinning.
- FIG. 8 shows the curve representation of the image. As can be seen, the information in the line drawing image is fairly well-preserved in these representations.
- labeling lines could be of several types. Three such types can be detected in the method used to create the image.
- the labeling lines are either straight lines or curves with few straight segments. They often form a T junction with the contour of the object being labeled as shown in FIG. 9A. Sometimes, they are drawn so as to not overlap with the object contour, so that they are shown as passing through as in FIG. 9B. Finally, the lines that label parts may pass through several other objects before ending in the actual object being labeled as shown in FIG. 9C. In all the three cases, however, they must be relatively near an annotating text While this distance may be variable, our embodiment used 10 pixels as a threshold.
- labeling lines be either straight lines or curves consisting of at most three lines. They require one end of the curve to be open (i.e. not near any junction), and the other end of the curve to either (1) end in a T junction, or (2) be open but have the curve pass through a gap near the end. A curve is said to pass through a gap if the join of the end points of two other curves intersects within the curve. Due to noise in imaging, curves that fall short of forming a T junction within a few pixels are also allowed.
- any OCR process may be used. This detects all word labels, including those that annotate graphical objects. This can be seen in FIG. 11 which shows the result of word block detection in the line drawing of FIG. 8.
- the detection of the text within the word boxes can be done using any existing OCR software. We chose a version of Xerox Corporation's TEXTBRIDGE software in our implementation.
- the detected words in the word boxes are recorded in a table called the word location table and are used to select the relevant document during indexing.
- a bi-partite graph is a graph whose nodes can be partitioned into two subsets such that the edges go only across the subsets.
- Each edge between the nodes is labeled with the nearest distance between the word label location and the candidate labeling line. This distance is chosen to be the smallest of the distances between the four corners of the rectangular bounding box of the word label and the open end of the labeling line.
- the "best" matching was determined to be the one which paired the nearest set of nodes. This is determined by the following process:
- the set of labeling lines and their associated word labels retained using the above process are stored in the database as one of the representations of the line drawing. In such representations, the detected text in the retained word labels are also noted.
- the retained associations for the image of FIG. 8 are shown in FIG. 12.
- connected regions of curves are first obtained.
- the connected regions of curves are determined using a connected component process that is similar to the process described in the Low level line processing section. First, all the curves are kept in separate regions. Then regions of curves meeting at a junction are all merged into a single region. This proceeds until no more regions can be merged (when all junctions are examined).
- Such connected regions need not always contain a single object as in FIG. 13 which shows some connected regions in the line drawing of FIG. 8.
- the connected regions are associated with the appropriate labeling lines, whenever they exist. Such labeling lines would either intersect or cross a gap in a contour of the connected region.
- a reference table listing the association of queried text to annotated text is provided.
- This table if already available in electronic form, can be easily indexed using the text query by conventional string matching techniques. But if the tables are in paper form, they need to be scanned in and a recognition of the table has to be done.
- the following section describes the method used to recognize the reference table during database creation. These tables are then linked to the annotating word table of the associated line drawing and stored in the database.
- the objects in the graphical data may not be queried using the same annotating text that is associated with the objects in the graphical data. This could happen, for example, in the domain of technical manual documents, because the same object may occur in several subassemblies, and may be annotated by different label numbers in each such subassembly drawing.
- a reference table usually accompanies the line drawing as shown in FIG. 1.
- the reference table links the annotating label of the object to its other descriptions, e.g. the name of the object, than can be used in the query for indexing.
- a table recognition process was designed to interpret the reference table to handle such applications.
- the basic idea is to detect words in the reference table using standard OCR software and parse them as words in rows and columns using the syntax of the table. Since the syntax is assumed to be a context free grammar, any standard parsing process for such grammars can be used. The context free grammar and the parsing process we used are now described.
- the unenclosed variables denote terminals.
- the * symbol indicates zero or more occurrences of the variable while the symbol + indicates one or more occurrences of the variable.
- the table is a sequence of rows of two types.
- the first type of row consists of three columns, with the first column giving the text label of the graphical object (a machine part) in the graphical data, and the second column and third column indicating the part number and part name description of the object respectively. If there is no part number, the second column may indicate a "- - - ".
- the description of the object could span more than one row (as for BOTTOM TRANSPORT ASSEMBLY, in FIG. 1). This is captured by a second type of row (row2) that has blanks in the first two columns and the part description in the third column.
- the part description could be the continuation of the part name from the previous row (e.g. GEAR HOUSING DRIVE PULLEY may be split up as GEAR HOUSING on the first row followed by DRIVE PULLEY on the second row), or it could be additional description referring to the containing item (such as (P/O item 1)).
- the parsing process parses the detected words in the reference table using the above grammar by grouping them to correspond to the entities (terminals and non-terminals) in the grammar.
- the interpreted table is then stored in the database.
- the line drawing at the end of database creation stage is stored in the form of the following representations: (1) Connected regions pointed by labeling lines and annotated text. (2) Annotating word table. (3) Reference table linked to annotating word table whenever it exists. It can be shown that the process used for creating these representations are fast, and mostly linear in the size of the image.
- the text information in the query is used to select the relevant document containing the queried object as well as an approximate region containing the queried object as follows.
- the associated annotating word or reference tables with the documents are indexed and those with a match are recorded.
- the associated line drawing representations are then chosen as relevant graphical documents.
- the indexing into the table is done using a string matching process that operates on the individual columns of the table and requires an exact length matching string (i.e. beginning and ending with the words in the query) to be found. This process allows for some common errors in character recognition, such as the fact that an i or l could be confused with a 1, an O with a 0, etc. This is done by grouping the characters that can be confused into confusion equivalence classes.
- the matching process then allows a match only when the mismatch with the query string is due to elements belonging to confusion equivalence classes.
- the exact matching length constraint ensures that two queries such as "drive belt” and "drive belt assembly" will find matches in different entries.
- the annotating word table if a match for the text query is found in a column in the table, the associated representation depicting the connected region pointed by the annotating word can be retrieved. If a reference table is used, then if a match is found in the table, then the annotating word for the query is recovered from the corresponding column in the reference table (as determined from the table syntax). Using this annotating word, the associated line drawing representation can be recovered by indexing into the annotating word table.
- FIGS. 8 and 13 shows the isolation of such connected regions for the query "bearing block" whose annotating text label is detected to be "13" using the reference table and the line drawing depicted in FIG. 1. As can be seen, all the regions containing the queried object are approximately localized during this operation.
- the text information can only approximately localize a region containing the queried object. As shown in FIG. 13, such regions may contain contours of other objects besides the queried object, and in some worst cases could potentially span the entire line drawing. Further restriction of the region containing the object needs to be done for indexing. For this we used a method for performing single object region isolation within connected regions.
- the initial connected region obtained by using text for indexing contains lines that belong to object contours (called object lines) and lines that interconnect objects (called interpretation lines).
- object lines lines that belong to object contours
- interpretation lines lines that interconnect objects
- the mechanism for isolating a region containing a single object exploits the observation that unlike the interpretation lines, the object lines have a valid 3 D interpretation as bounding contours of surfaces of a 3 D object, to derive a way to distinguish between these lines. It assumes that the objects in line drawings are tri-hedral or curved with at most three surfaces meeting at junctions. For such objects, object lines can either be labeled as convex (+), concave (-), or boundary (>, ⁇ ) lines.
- a new line label called the i-label is introduced and a new set of junctions is derived that captures the intersection of interpretation lines with object surfaces and contours (in their 2 D projection).
- the junctions in the line drawing are then extracted and the new junction constraints are propagated using a relaxation process to consistently label all the lines.
- the regions belonging to objects are obtained by discarding all the lines with the i-label that are not part of a consistent global interpretation, and grouping the remaining object lines into connected components or regions. Unlike existing grouping methods, this method is guaranteed to be reliable, i.e., the region isolated comes from single objects.
- the process can also handle the labeling of curved objects by using the curvature-based approximation previously described.
- This method of region isolation can also be applied to noisy line drawings that show broken contours, and can reliably isolate regions containing a single object.
- the result of single object region isolation described above can be taken as the result of indexing. If a geometric description of the queried object is available, however, it can be used to identify the object in the region.
- an object can be identified using either geometric or qualitative methods, and we chose the former. In geometric methods, the object is described geometrically as a set of features, such as points (corners) or lines. Then, a match is found between such features on the model and the image. The match establishes a pose for the object in the image coordinates. This can be used to project the model into the image and the correctness of the pose can be confirmed by a detailed examination of the image area accounted by the projected model.
- a 3 D model (2 D objects can be similarly handled) of the queried object must be supplied. This is usually available as CAD data. Curves and lines are detected on the model using the previously described process. Corners are then extracted at points in curves where the angle of turn is beyond a certain threshold (15 degrees). Corners and lines serve as features for matching the object model. Such features are similarly identified in the isolated image region.
- a geometric model-based object recognition method was used to recognize the presence of the queried object in the graphical data.
- this method states that four sets of matching features between the model object and the image determine the pose of the object up to an affine transform.
- the four matching features were searched using an interpretation tree as described in E. Grimson and T. Lozano-Perez, "Localizing overlapping parts by searching the interpretation tree" in IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. and Machine Intell., vol. 9, no.4, July 1987.
- This process essentially examines 4 tuples of matching features and removes those that do not satisfy some unary and binary constraints. A bound on the allowed variation in the angle of the corner was used as a unary constraint, while the orientation of the corner bisectors was used as a binary constraint.
- the pose was verified using a Hausdorff distance-based metric. The object was verified when a suitable pose could be found so that the model contours projected using the computed pose matched to the image region contours. If a match is found, then the region of match with the projected model is given as the result of indexing.
- the verification process uses a distance measure called the Hausdorff distance, between the projected model and image points. Unlike other methods that use the Hausdorff distance, the verification process merely checks to see if it exceeds a chosen verification threshold, thus enabling fast verification. See, D. P. Huttenlocher et al. Comparing images using the hausdorff distance. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 9:850-863, September 1993.
- the Hausdorff distance between a set of points is defined as follows:
- the Hausdorff distance serves as a measure of mismatch between the projected model (set A) and underlying image features (set B).
- the computation of the Hausdorff distance can be expensive as all pairs of features have to be examined.
- Such a determination can, however, be made without computing the Hausdorff distance completely.
- the new verification method therefore, exploits the observation that if no image point is found within a circle of radius d around a projected model point, then the directed Hausdorff distance will also exceed d.
- the verification process checks for model to image and vice versa to account for occlusion and scene clutter. That is, it looks at the projected model and image points in the rasterized arrays and checks to see if no image point is found within the d radius circle of the projected model point, and conversely, no projected model point is found within d radius circle of an image point.
- the indexing is implemented through a user interface shown in FIG. 14. For this, the user selects a part for querying by clicking on a part list button 390 which give a listing of parts in a listing window 392. When a part name is chosen, the relevant geometric description is reverted from the part database and shown in the part description window 394. When the indexing operation is invoked using the indexing button 396, the first four images containing the object are retrieved from the database and shown in four windows 400, 402, 404, 406. The system can locate objects even if they are in different poses, a point that makes this indexing system different from others.
- the method can isolate graphical object-containing regions using information in the query. It can handle graphical data depicting annotated graphical objects.
- the annotation is assumed to be done via a combination of text labels and labeling line pointing to the object region.
- the graphic lines in the data are assumed to consist of lines belonging to object contours and lines for interconnecting, and interpreting objects. It can handle both direct and indirect textual queries about graphical objects. In the case of indirect textual queries, a reference table associating the query names to annotating labels is assumed to be provided.
- the indexing operation uses the text part of the query to quickly and roughly localize the region containing the object, while geometric information is used to further localize and confirm the presence of the object.
- the indexing method can also be used for indexing un-annotated objects in graphical data.
- the method for single object-containing region isolation described can be used on all the connected regions in the line drawing to generate candidate regions for any query. This may, however, considerably affect the speed of indexing. In fact, the performance of indexing is affected by the amount of information present in the query and the graphical data. Thus the search for the query is faster if it is annotated by text labels. If only text information is present in the query, then the indexing method selects single object-containing region pointed to by the annotating text label. If only geometric information is present or the part is not annotated in a drawing, then the indexing method examines all single object-containing regions for object recognition.
