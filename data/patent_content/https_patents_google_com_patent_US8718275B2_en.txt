Definitions
- the present disclosure generally relates to methods and devices for use in communications networks. More precisely, it relates to a method and a device for estimating the delay of a signal travelling between two points in a communications network.
- the invention can in particular be used in applications for estimating or mitigating echo in communication equipment.
- the delay is the time elapsed between the appearance of, say, a characteristic signal feature at the reference point and its reappearance at the reception point.
- the delay may be the sum of the propagation time in various conducting materials, processing time in decoders and encoders, particularly conversions between analog and digital format, waiting time during routing in packet-switched networks, and possibly propagation time in air if the signal is transmitted in acoustic form in some segment of the path.
- Accurate estimates of the delay of an acoustic or electric signal travelling through a system are valuable in a number of applications, for instance, in echo cancellation and echo suppression in communications equipment, de-reverberation, echo localization, alignment of audio files for the purpose of fingerprinting, and the alignment of audio signals in recording studios.
- echo suppression and/or echo cancellation as used in telephony.
- a far-end party and a near-end party communicate using a telecommunications network.
- the near-end party would like to receive only the speech signal spoken by the far-end speaker.
- the near-end party may additionally receive the (distorted and delayed) speech signal spoken by him or herself.
- This signal component in the signal travelling towards the near-end party is referred to as the echo signal.
- the feedback path is acoustic and consists of acoustic speakers at the far-end and microphones that acquire the echo signal.
- the feedback path is electronic and results from imperfect transmission-line terminations.
- the echo signal must be decreased or eliminated. This is normally done by digital computing means using adaptive filtering (echo cancellation) and/or by gain control (echo suppression).
- the adaptive filter of echo cancellation is optimized to remove the signal component that correlates with the signal travelling towards the far-end party by subtracting it from the signal travelling towards the near-end party. Finding the relative delay (the bulk delay) of the signal travelling to the far end and the echo signal is implicit in this optimization and is generally based on correlation, albeit sometimes in a broad sense. An initial estimate of the bulk delay is commonly used to reduce the required number of the correlation computations for echo cancellation.
- Echo suppression In the case of echo suppression, heuristic rules are generally used to suppress the signal travelling towards the near end whenever it mostly consists of the signal spoken by the near-end party. Echo suppression requires knowledge of the relative delay between the signal travelling to the far end and the echo signal. An estimate of the relative delay is usually computed by means of cross correlation.
- a first drawback is that the cross correlation method has high computational complexity for long sequences when a large search range of possible delays is used.
- a second drawback is that the performance of cross-correlation based methods generally deteriorates when the relation between the echo signal and the signal travelling to the far-end cannot be described accurately by a linear filtering operation. That is, performance is reduced when the feedback path introduces nonlinear distortions.
- a third drawback applies to systems with time-varying delay where it is difficult to balance previously determined (old) information and new information about the delay. Usage of a long but finite evaluation interval imposes large storage and computational requirements. Alternatively, an implicit exponential decay of older data must be used, such as by iterative multiplication by a factor less than unity, which generally performs less well.
- Alternative delay estimation methods can be used to reduce the search range in echo cancellation and as a first or final estimate of the delay for echo suppression.
- An object of the present invention is to wholly or partly overcome the above disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art and to provide improved methods and devices for delay estimation. Another objective is to provide low sensitivity to nonlinear distortions in the feedback path. It is desirable to obtain estimates having relatively high accuracy at a relatively low computational effort.
- aspects of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for finding an estimate of the delay of a signal between two points separate in space.
- its formulation is based on the concept of joint probability of values of measurements of the signal at the reference point and of the signal at the reception point, as a function of the time delay between the measurements.
- the measurements can be of any suitable quantity, such as momentary or average energy content.
- Existing methods for delay estimation generally use averages of cross-correlations or averages of differences between measurements to evaluate the delay.
- aspects of the present invention are based on counting co-occurrences of value ranges in the two sets of measurements, which forms a discrete approximation to the joint probability for data with stable statistics. It is well-known to persons skilled in the art that the joint probability provides more information about the relation between two variables than the average cross-correlation or the average difference. Thus, usage of the joint probability facilitates a better estimate of the delay.
- the measurements are quantized into a simplified, for example binary, form by comparison with a threshold adapted to a typical magnitude of the quantity as evaluated at the reference and the reception point.
- the method may apply different thresholds at the two points for values of a given quantity.
- two binary sequences are obtained consisting of one-bit-quantized (i.e., Boolean) values of the quantity as evaluated at the reference point and the reception point.
- a binary 1 denotes strong audio activity, such as a speaker speaking
- a binary 0 denotes weak audio activity, such as silence or near silence.
- (0,0),(0,1),(1,0), and (1,1) there are four possible co-occurrences of the quantized values: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0), and (1,1) (1)
- (0,1) denotes 0 (low value) at the reference point and 1 (high value) at the reception point. Therefore, (0,0) denotes weak audio activity at both reference point and at the reception point, while (1,1) denotes strong audio activity at both reference point and at the reception point.
- Similar pairs can be formed from simultaneous measurements at the reception point and the reference point or from time-shifted measurements.
- the thresholds are selected in a natural manner.
- a signal propagates between the reference point and the reception point without delay.
- the combination of strong audio activity at the reception point and weak audio activity at the reference point, corresponding to the pair (1,0) should not be possible in a pair, as the high value measured at the reference point should have given rise to a high value at the reception point too.
- the delay is D, a non-zero number
- the pair (1,0) may occur in pairs of simultaneously measured values.
- the pair (1,0) has a higher probability of occurrence.
- the delay D can be found counting the co-occurrences (1,0) for different back shifts and selecting the delay with the lowest count (relative frequency).
- the other co-occurrences can also be considered.
- the procedure can be generalized in that the relative frequencies are not determined, but a significance is assigned to all but the least probable co-occurrence(s) and stored in a table.
- significances for corresponding quantized values in the binary sequences when shifted back by one of the candidate delays are read from the table and summed.
- a candidate delay corresponding to the most probable true delay can be elected.
- the quantity that is evaluated from the signal may be a momentary value or an average over a time segment of finite length.
- the length is between 50 and 1000 milliseconds. In some embodiments, two or more of such time segments may overlap.
- a quantity that is simple to evaluate and leads to a distinctive indication of the delay already with a small number of measurements may be used:
- a non-zero significance will be associated with one or more of the four possible co-occurrences (see formula (1)) in such a way that the assigned significances reflect the degree of synchronicity of two parallel sequences of measurements of a signal.
- the significance scores may have a quite simple structure, signifying the least probable co-occurrence(s) with no (zero), or negative significance (i.e., no figures of merit), and/or signifying the most probable co-occurrence(s) with a positive constant, and/or signifying the co-occurrences with values approximately corresponding to the expected probabilities. In either case, the candidate delay with the highest (most) likelihood will be associated with the most (signed) significance average.
- more than one quantity can be evaluated from the signal. Since more information is thus available for a given number of time instants, an indication of the most likely candidate delay will then be obtained faster at the price of an increased computational load.
- signal powers for a windowed signal segment in a plurality of frequency bands are used as quantities. It is then advantageous to pass the signal through a filter bank, before evaluating the signal power.
- the filters may be digital, preferably applying some Fourier-transform method, or may be analog.
- the signal power of a windowed signal segment as a function of the frequency bands is referred to as a periodogram. If each component in a periodogram is then compared with a threshold, a binary vector is obtained having as many components as the periodogram. This means that if 32 bands are used, each periodogram, representing a short-time power spectrum of the signal, can be stored in a single 32-bit integer, so that the storage requirements are negligible.
- the values of the quantity may be quantized in more than two steps, so that multi-bit quantized values are obtained. If, for instance, the values are compared with three different thresholds, each value can be placed in one of four intervals, the transition points of which correspond to the thresholds. As is well-known, that interval of the four which contains the value can be characterized by a two-bit binary representation of its ordinal number.
- the number of thresholds used for reference values may be different than the number used for reception values.
- embodiments of the invention may equally well comprise a number of quantization levels that is not a power of 2. While preferably the number of thresholds is small, some application may benefit from using an increased number of thresholds at either the reference point, the reception point or both.
- the delay estimating device comprises at least one threshold circuit for quantizing the measured values of the at least one quantity, wherein the value of the threshold is variable and is provided by a specifying circuit.
- the threshold circuit is adapted to quantize values of the quantity or quantities (as measured at the reference point, the reception point or both) with respect to more than one threshold for each quantity.
- at least one of the reference point and the reception point is located in a communications network.
- the delay estimating device may be adapted to measure at least one quantity which is a momentary value or at least one quantity which is a time average over a finite time interval. Such time intervals may or may not overlap in time.

- FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram of one aspect of an apparatus for pre-processing signal data according to aspects of the invention.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of one aspect of a method for estimating a delay of a signal according to aspects of the invention.
- FIG. 5 illustrates one aspect of an algorithm for assessing synchronicity of the quantized values according to aspects of the invention.

- FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram of one aspect of echo canceller/suppressor according to an embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram of one aspect of a computing device according to an embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 1 shows the acoustic feedback loop commonly present in hands-free communication devices such as computers used for voice-over-IP speaker phones or hands-free telephones.
- the technical problem to be solved can be exemplified by the case of a telephone call involving one near-end party and one far-end party.
- the input signal 500 is the speech signal spoken by the near-end party. It arrives at the far-end in digital format, and can be in the form of a compressed bit stream.
- Decoder 211 contains a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter that converts the signal to a continuous-time analog signal. If the signal is compressed then decoder 211 uses a decoding algorithm to decompress the signal as well.
- D/A digital-to-analog
- Analog signal 501 is sent to one or more speakers 212 , which generate an acoustic signal 502 that is subjected to the room transfer function 213 .
- the modified acoustic signal 503 is acquired by the microphone 214 .
- Microphone 214 may additionally have the input 504 , spoken by the far-end party, and other far-end generated acoustic signals.
- the analog signal 505 that forms the output of the microphone is sent to encoder 215 that either performs an analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion or an analog-to-digital conversion followed by compression by means of any suitable algorithm.
- the resulting bit stream 510 is transmitted to the near-end party.
- signal 510 even when signal 504 is not active (is zero), signal 510 generally differs significantly in amplitude and spectral colouring from signal 500 , and is delayed. Without appropriate compensation, the near-end party will receive a delayed and distorted copy of the speech signal spoken by him or herself. This echo that the near-end party hears makes conversation difficult. To remove the problem, echo cancellation and/or suppression is used. The computational effort to perform echo cancellation and suppression is significantly reduced if the delay of signal 510 relative to signal 500 is known. Aspects of the present invention are adapted to estimate the delay between the signal 500 sent from the near end and the signal 510 received at the near end, using only signals 500 and 510 as input to the estimation procedure. Therefore, echo cancellation and suppression is also an important application of the present disclosure.
- a periodogram is computed for each signal and each time interval.
- the time integral is replaced by a summation and no integration in frequency is used; q then simply indexes the frequency bins.
- the thresholds can also be the average channel values, the median channel values or any other quantile value of the channels.
- the thresholds can for example be different quantile values of the channel.
- the matrices will not be a collection of binary vectors, but integer vectors.
- significances for each of the four possible co-occurrences are now assigned in accordance with their expected probabilities, which are known a priori by empirical studies or can be estimated with sufficient accuracy.
- the significances can be chosen as per the fourth column of Table 1, which will be further discussed below.
- the periodogram values X q,p and Y q,p represent, in general, different time intervals.
- a probability distribution can be defined. A strength of the method is that it works even when the statistics of the measurements are time-variant.
- the cross correlation is a function of the time shifts, the maximum of which occurs exactly when the time-shifted signals exhibit the largest degree of likeness.
- co-occurrences (1,1) and (0,0) correspond to a large contribution to the value of the cross correlation
- co-occurrences (0,1) and (1,0) do not.
- This simple search for likeness is not suitable in an arbitrary situation. For instance, when the feedback path is nonlinear, cross correlation performs poorly. Moreover, even when the delay varies somewhat over time, the present method will perform well, while cross correlation methods generally will fail due to the lack of a joint probability distribution that is stable in time.
- the binary matrices X and Y are required to have K+D M ⁇ D 1 and K columns, respectively, as indicated above. It is not essential that K time instants are used for calculating the average weighted significance S q (D m ) for all candidate delays. If in some embodiment it is desirable to use an equal number of columns in the matrices, the method may perform averaging over a smaller number of time instants for the larger candidate delays, so that no extra columns to the right need to be included in X.
- Each square element corresponds to a matrix entry and its colour illustrates its (Boolean) value.
- matrix X is matrix Y delayed (i.e., right-shifted) by 2 units plus some noise, and the method as disclosed by embodiments of the present invention is adapted to return 2 as an estimated delay in this case.
- the elliptic dots indicate that the sequences of arrows should go on up to the outermost columns, so as to make use of all available information. It is noted that the two rightmost columns in X are not used when the average weighted significances for candidate delay 2 are computed.
- a particular embodiment of the present invention does not compare consecutive pairs of time instants, but compares every other pair, every third pair, etc.
- matrices X and Y instead of having K+D m ⁇ D 1 and K columns, respectively, matrices X and Y then have KN+D m ⁇ D 1 and KN columns. This embodiment is advantageous in virtue of its reduced computational load.
- the binary vectors at the reference-point consists of almost all zeros, and it will likely be no audible echo at the reception-point. It is therefore intuitive to scale all Q quantities to lower the impact of erroneous combinations.
- Table 1 above shows two alternative sets of significances in addition to those discussed above, which penalizes the least probable event (1,0) only. As (1,0) is expected to have low probability for the correct delay it is penalized, proportionally to the number of times it occurs.
- the first alternative set of significances is simple in so far as the significances are integer numbers that reflect the unequal counts expected for (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1). Again, as (1,0) should not occur for the correct delay, it is assigned a negative significance.
- the co-occurrences (0,0) and (1,1) are weak indicators that the delay is correct and for this reason receive a positive significance. Co-occurrence (0,1) does not provide information about the correctness of the candidate delay and therefore is assigned a neutral (zero) significance. It is noted that for the first two significance sets, knowledge about the probability distribution of the co-occurrences is not required.
- the second alternative set of significances in Table 1 consists of the probabilities themselves.
- the algorithm (as disclosed in regards to Equations 1 through 9) will always produce a delay estimate ⁇ circumflex over (D) ⁇ m independent of the quality of the estimation. Therefore, in situations when there is a lack in strong co-occurrences, the differences between the overall significance for each candidate delay is small and the probability of the best candidate delay also representing the true delay is small. This can happen when there is noise as input or when there are long sections with near end speech or silences.
- One method to overcome this is by averaging over long enough time intervals (K) to be sure of capturing strong co-occurrence events. However, at the same time, this increases the complexity. Therefore, a second method to overcome this problem is to incorporate older delay estimates into the decision, since older delay estimates may have been stronger candidates at time evaluated and the true delay may not have been changed.
- a quality metric may be defined in order to be used for comparison between delay estimate candidates.
- the overall significance is used as a quality metric.
- This method provides a low complexity solution and using the overall significance as a quality metric is also very reasonable considering a high significance value indicates a strong match between the far end and the near end signals.
- Each feasible alternative is associated with a quality, which in this example is their overall significance adjusted to current decision index i.
- the quality of the estimate ⁇ circumflex over (D) ⁇ m is calculated in a first quality calculating section 620 (also referred to as a first quality calculating circuit 620 ). Also, in FIG. 6 , the quality of the estimate d i-1 is updated in a quality updating section 640 (also referred to as a quality updating circuit 640 ).
- Two signals 500 and 510 form the input. These two signals may correspond to the acoustic echo feedback path illustrated in FIG. 1 , or any other set of signals that form the input and the output of a physical system. More generally, they can be any two signals such that the second contains a delayed copy of the first.
- Each of the input signals 510 and 500 is separately pre-processed in pre-processors 110 and 111 (also referred to as evaluators, evaluation circuits, or evaluation sections), which have identical functionalities.
- pre-processors 110 and 111 also referred to as evaluators, evaluation circuits, or evaluation sections
- the output of each pre-processor is a sequence of vectors (or scalars).
- vector sequences 512 and 513 are sequences of periodograms for the input signals 510 and 500 , respectively.
- Pre-processor 111 functions similarly.
- the input signal 510 is first segmented into time segments that may overlap in a segmenter 311 .
- the successive segments created by segmenter 311 are separated in time by 10 ms and the segments have a length of 20 ms.
- a transformer 312 performs a windowing and Fourier-transform operation.
- the output of transformer 312 is a discrete, short-time complex spectrum.
- Periodogram computer 313 takes this complex spectrum and applies the absolute operator to each spectrum component and squares the results to render a periodogram 512 , which is a short-term power spectrum estimate.
- the periodogram is a vector property of the signal segment that is the output of segmenter 311 .
- the specifying circuit 112 stores what subset of channels is to be used for delay estimation. Thus, the specifying circuit 112 specifies the active channels. Specifying circuit 112 also stores the thresholds that are to be applied to the active channels. A first and second threshold circuit 130 and 131 determine for each active channel whether the value for the current segment is above or below the threshold. This operation is equivalent to one-bit quantization.
- Vector signals 514 and 515 are a time-sequence of bit vectors, in which each one-bit component expresses the value of an active part of the periodogram (representing a short-term power spectrum) relative to the thresholds set by specifier 112 .
- the use of the specifying circuit 112 , the first threshold circuit 130 , and/or the second threshold circuit 131 may be referred to as a quantizer (or a quantizing section, quantizing circuit, etc.)
- each of the vectors of vector signals 514 and 515 can be stored in a single digital integer number, reducing storage requirements on most computing devices significantly.
- This approach is particularly efficient if 32 or 64 channels are active, as the combined hardware and software on many computing devices are adapted to handle 32-bit integers and 64-bit integers.
- this method of using integers to denote the one-bit quantization index facilitates generalization for multiple thresholds.
- the output is then an index that requires for m thresholds log 2 (m+1) bits to be described.
- each vector has log 2 (m+1) bit planes that each can be described by an integer.
- a bit vector written in the form of a single integer one-bit quantization
- bit vectors are used without being stored as spectral integers.
- Buffer specifier 114 specifies the length of a first and second shift register 150 , 151 .
- the second shift register 151 can be shorter than the first shift register 150 .
- the buffer specifier specifies how many spectral integers are stored in shift registers 150 and 151 for each active channel. Whenever a new spectral integer is acquired, the least recent spectral integer is discarded. It is the age of the latest discarded spectral integer (the length of the shift register) that is specified by buffer specifier 114 .
- this age is the same for all channels in signal 514 and, separately, for all channels in signal 515 .
- the actual age used depends on the signal that the delay is estimated for. If the delay is constant, the accuracy of the delay estimate increases with the length of the buffer. If the delay is changing, then an age that is a good compromise for the rate of change of the delay must be selected. In this embodiment this is determined by a designer of the system, but automated procedures can also be used for this purpose. As seen above, the lengths of the buffers can be calculated on the basis of the largest candidate delay, the desired number of time instants to be compared and, when applicable, their consecutive spacing.
- a delay assessment circuit 118 which can be implemented in a number of different ways, is adapted to calculate the average significance for each candidate delay.
- the delay assessment circuit 118 receives the entire buffer content 516 , 517 from buffers 150 , 151 and makes computations according to equation (6). From the results of the computations, the assessment circuit 118 outputs a signal indicative of the estimated delay ( 518 ).
- the delay assessment circuit 118 may include an associating unit, a computing unit, and a selector.
- a delay estimate quality circuit 120 which can be implemented in numerous ways, is adapted to compare previous delay estimates ( 520 ) with the newly calculated one ( 518 ) as discussed in detail above. It should be noted that the comparing of the previous delay estimates ( 520 ) with the newly calculated one ( 518 ) to select a final delay estimate with the best/highest quality (as discussed above) may be implemented directly into the delay assessment circuit 118 , eliminating the need for the delay estimate quality circuit 120 . In other words, the delay estimate quality circuit 120 may be internal to the delay assessment circuit 118 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of a method 400 according to aspects of the invention for estimating the delay of a signal between a reference point and a reception point.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart depicting the steps of the method in the case of three quantities and five candidate delays.
- step 410 the three quantities are defined.
- step 412 each of the quantities is evaluated at the reference point and the reception point at a plurality of time instants.
- step 414 the values of the three quantities are quantized by comparison with thresholds.
- the thresholds are time-invariant in the sense that for each quantity, an equal threshold is used for all time instances.
- the most recent quantized values are stored.
- a significance is assigned to each of the possible ordered pairs of simultaneous quantized values; this is step 418 .
- step 420 a set of five candidate delays are defined.
- the scaling is defined and calculated for each candidate delay.
- an average weighted significance is computed for each candidate delay. The average is based on the three quantities and a plurality of pairs of quantized values.
- step 424 an estimate delay is elected from the set of candidate delays on the basis of the computed average weighted significances.
- the significance for the delay corresponding to the output of this procedure from last time is scaled by a pre-defined value, producing a new updated significance.
- step 428 the scaled value in 426 is compared with the corresponding significance of the elected candidate in 424 , and the final delay estimate is the one corresponding to the highest significance.
- step 430 both the delay and its significance are stored such that they may to be used next time in 426 . It is noted that step 418 may be performed at any instant after the step 410 of defining the quantities and before the step 422 of computing an average weighted significance.

Therefore, the details of the calculation and determination of the delay estimate and/or the final delay estimate in incorporated herewith.
- the delay estimator 750 receives an input signal from the microphone 720 (microphone 720 may be microphone 214 , and microphone 720 may also be referred to as the far-end party) and an input signal from the speaker 710 (speaker 710 may be speaker 212 , and speaker 710 may also be referred to as the near-end party). Based on the received input signals the delay estimator 750 generates and provides the delay estimate and/or the final delay estimate to an adaptive filter 730 .
- the adaptive filter 730 performs echo cancellation and/or an echo suppression and outputs a corrected signal (as referred to as an Echo removed signal) based on the output of the speaker 710 , the output of the microphone 720 , and the output of the delay estimator 750 .

Abstract
Description
(0,0),(0,1),(1,0), and (1,1) (1)
Here, (0,1) denotes 0 (low value) at the reference point and 1 (high value) at the reception point. Therefore, (0,0) denotes weak audio activity at both reference point and at the reception point, while (1,1) denotes strong audio activity at both reference point and at the reception point. Similar pairs can be formed from simultaneous measurements at the reception point and the reference point or from time-shifted measurements.

- a component in an encoded audio or video format, such as an MPEG format,
- a power of the signal in a predetermined frequency band,
- an absolute value of the signal,
- an amplitude of the signal,
- an amplitude of the time-domain signal envelope,
- an integral over time of the absolute value of the signal, or
- an integral over time of the absolute value of the time derivative of the signal.

and w(t) is a window, which advantageously can be chosen to be the Hann window. For discrete-time processing the time integral is replaced by a summation and no integration in frequency is used; q then simply indexes the frequency bins. Similarly, the periodogram of y(t) is
ηq,p=∫Fq|∫Tp e −j2πft y(t)w(t)dt| 2 df. (3)

S q(D m)=Σk=1 Kνk(X k+D
where the weights νk(x) can be a function of the binary vector at the reference-point to emphasize, for example, the signal power. The weights can also reflect the significance importance in time, by for example decrease with increasing k, or simply be a standard average for which νk=1/K.
S′ q(D m)=Σk=1 Kνk(X kN+D
where N is an integer defining the spacing of the pairs of time instants to be compared. Instead of having K+Dm−D1 and K columns, respectively, matrices X and Y then have KN+Dm−D1 and KN columns. This embodiment is advantageous in virtue of its reduced computational load.
v k(X k+D
hence a strong signal will get higher importance than a weak signal. We have here added coefficients a1, a2, . . . , aQ to preferably reflect the importance attributed to each of the quantities. This type of robustness can also be included in the significance itself by extending the 2-tuple formalism throughout the text to (Q+1)-tuples, hence dealing with 2 to the power of (Q+1) co-occurrence combinations. This would change equation (6) to
and equation (7) correspondingly.
S(D m)=Σq=1 Q c q ·S q(D m), (9)
where coefficients c1, c2, . . . , cQ preferably reflect the importance attributed to each of the quantities. For instance, if the quantities are audio energies in different frequency bands, a frequency band in the audible range should be given a greater importance, particularly if the energy content of the signal is expected to be relatively high in this frequency band. Similar effect may be achieved by summing the average weighted significances using equal coefficients in (8) provided the significances of relatively important quantities generally have larger magnitudes than those of relatively less important quantities.
