Abstract
Description
where {circumflex over (x)} denotes the nearest integer close to x, and the index m indicates where suppression should be performed. In most embodiments, two tones are selected for a self-quieter, due to the fact that the power of a self-quieter decreases quickly in the frequency domain such that its impact on neighbor tones of tone m is negligible. In some embodiments, a number of neighbor tones of tone m are also identified for amplitude estimation associated with the self-quieter. The tones used for this amplitude estimation should belong to the same user as that of tone m.
