Definitions
- This specification generally relates to search engines and, according to one particular implementation, to formatting search results that include images.
- a user can submit a search query to a search engine.
- the search query can include, for example, one or more keywords.
- the search engine can access an indexed cache to identify a set of resources which satisfy the search query.
- an identified resource can include a keyword that is included in the search query.
- the search engine can generate one or more search results pages which each include a set of search results, where each search result includes information associated with an identified resource, such as a title, a description, one or more URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and metadata.
- One or more of the search results pages can be provided to the user in response to the search query.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the action of iteratively re-sizing an image region of a search result based on the amount of text in an in-line text region, and based on the effect that re-sizing the image region has on the in-line text region.
- an image region width can be calculated based on the height of the text in the text region, the height of the image, and the aspect ratio of the image.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a process that includes determining an initial height and an initial width of an image that is associated with a search result, wherein the image is to be displayed in the search result in line with text associated with the search result, and wherein the search result includes an in-line image region for displaying the image in line with the text, and a text region for displaying the text, determining an initial height of the text region of the search result based at least on (i) the text associated with the search result, and (ii) an initial width of the text region, determining an initial width of the in-line image region of the search result based at least on (i) the initial height of the text region of the search result, (ii) the initial height of the image, and (iii) the initial width of the image, determining an adjusted height of the text region of the search result based at least on the initial width of the in-line image region of the search result, determining an adjusted width of the in-line image region of the search result
- the process includes determining that the initial width of the in-line image region exceeds a maximum in-line image region width, where the adjusted height of the text region is further based on the maximum in-line image region width; determining an adjusted width of the in-line image region includes determining that the initial width of the in-line image region is equal to or greater than the maximum in-line image region width, determining that the adjusted height of the text region of the search result is equal to or greater than the initial height of the text region of the search result, and outputting the maximum in-line image region width as the adjusted width of the in-line image region; determining an adjusted height and an adjusted width of the image includes determining that the adjusted height of the text region is outside of a predetermined range of the adjusted height of the image region, and outputting a default height and a default width as the adjusted height and the adjusted width of the image, respectively; determining an adjusted height and an adjusted width of the image includes determining that the adjusted height of the text
- FIGS. 1A-1D illustrate exemplary search results.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary system
- FIGS. 3-8 illustrate exemplary computer-implemented processes.
- a search result includes a text region for displaying text associated with the search result and an in-line image region for displaying an image, a video, a map, or other graphic object, or group thereof, associated with the search result in-line with the text.
- An estimation or determination can be made as to the height (e.g., number of lines) of the text, and a width of the in-line image region can be determined based on the determined text height. If a determination is made that the determined width of the in-line image region affects the text height estimate, the text height can be re-estimated, followed by a re-estimation of the in-line image width.
- iterations can occur until a predefined number of iterations is reached or until some other stopping condition is reached, such as the text height being within a predetermined range of the height of the in-line image region.
- a height and width of the image can be determined based on the width of the in-line image region, and the image can be output for display in the search result line with the text.
- FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary search result 100 .
- the search result 100 can be, for example, a search result provided by a search engine in response executing to a search query.
- the search result 100 includes a text region 102 for displaying text and other search result elements.
- the text region 102 can include a variety of types of search result elements, such as a title 108 and a description 110 .
- Other examples of search result elements include a review 112 , a rating 114 , hours information 116 , and other metadata 118 .
- the text region 102 can also include various user interface controls, such as links or buttons.
- the text region 102 can also include a URL of a resource represented by the search result, notes, site links (e.g., links associated with the resource, history (e.g., information indicating when a user last visited the resource), address information, and stock quote information, to name a few examples.
- site links e.g., links associated with the resource
- history e.g., information indicating when a user last visited the resource
- address information e.g., information indicating when a user last visited the resource
- stock quote information e.g., a few examples.
- FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary search result 100
- other types of regions that include both text and one or more image regions can be adjusted using the illustrated process.
- the illustrated process can be used to adjust the size of a panel, on a search results page or other page, that provides answers to questions.
- the description 110 can be derived, for example, from one or more meta elements in the resource, can be extracted from the resource, or can be derived from some other resource, such as a directory. If the description 110 is extracted from the resource, the description 110 can include one or more sections of content from the resource that include one or more keywords used in the search query.
- the description 110 can be referred to as a “snippet”. In some implementations, a snippet can refer to the set of all search result elements included in the text region 102 (e.g., the description 110 and other search result elements).
- the search result 100 includes an in-line image region 117 for displaying an image (e.g., an image 118 ) that is associated with the search result 100 .
- the in-line image region 117 can be to the right of the text region 102 , as shown, or can be to the left of the text region 102 . In either case, the text region 102 and the in-line image region 117 can be displayed in separate sections of the search result 100 , as illustrated by a border line 119 .
- the border line 119 is included here for illustration purposes and is not generally included or displayed in the search result 100 .
- Some or all of the search result elements included in the text region 102 can be of varying size (e.g., varying length).
- An initial height (e.g., number of lines) of the text region 102 can be determined, based, for example, on the content of the various search result elements included in the text region 102 and on an initial width of the text region 102 .
- the image 118 can be of various sizes, and can have various aspect ratios. The size (e.g., height and width) of the image 118 and/or the width of the text region 102 can be adjusted so as to avoid unsightly whitespace areas in the search result 100 .
- FIG. 1B illustrates an exemplary search result 120 which includes an undesired whitespace area 121 .
- the search result 120 includes an in-line image region 122 and a text region 123 .
- the in-line image region 122 includes an image 124 , where the image 124 is “tall” (e.g., narrow).
- the image 124 having a small width can result, for example, in the in-line image region 122 having a smaller width than the in-line image region 117 and the text region 123 having a larger width than the text region 102 .
- the width of the text region 123 can be “stretched”, or extended to the right, as compared to the text region 102 , as illustrated by a movement of a border 126 rightward from a border 128 (e.g., the border 128 corresponding to the border 119 of FIG. 1A ).
- the “stretching” of the text region 123 can result in the content of the text region 123 occupying less lines of text (e.g., as compared to the text region 102 ).
- the text region 123 occupying less lines of text can result in the creation of the undesired whitespace area 121 .
- the existence of the whitespace area 121 can be unsightly to a user.
- a search results page can include multiple search results, and multiple displayed search results can include a whitespace area such as the whitespace area 121 , resulting in an unsightly search results page which does not make efficient use of space.
- FIG. 1C illustrates an exemplary search result 140 which includes a whitespace area 141 .
- the search result 140 includes an in-line image region 142 and a text region 143 .
- the in-line image region 142 includes an image 144 , where the image 144 is relatively wide (e.g., as compared to the image 118 of FIG. 1A ).
- the image 144 having a wide width can result, for example, in the in-line image region 142 having a larger width than the in-line image region 117 and the text region 143 having a smaller width than the text region 102 .
- the width of the text region 143 can be “shrunk”, or “pushed” to the left, as compared to the text region 102 , as illustrated by a movement of a border 146 leftward from a border 148 (e.g., the border 148 corresponding to the border 119 of FIG. 1A ).
- the compacting of the text region 143 can result in the content of the text region 143 occupying more lines of text (e.g., as compared to the text region 102 ).
- the text region 143 occupying more lines of text can result in the creation of the undesired whitespace area 141 . Similar to the whitespace area 121 , the existence of the whitespace area 141 can be unsightly to a user and wasteful of space, if present in the search result 140 and in other similar search results on a search results page.
- FIG. 1D illustrates another exemplary search result 160 .
- the search result 160 includes an in-line image region 162 and a text region 163 . Similar to the in-line image region 142 , the in-line image region 162 includes a “wide” image 164 , which can result, for example, in the in-line image region 162 having a larger width than the in-line image region 117 and the text region 163 having a smaller width than the text region 102 .
- the width of the text region 163 can be “shrunk”, or “pushed” to the left, as compared to the text region 102 , as illustrated by a movement of a border 166 leftward from a border 168 (e.g., the border 168 corresponding to the border 119 of FIG. 1A ).
- the contents of the text region are cropped, as illustrated by partial text 169 .
- Such a cropping approach avoids an undesired whitespace area such as the whitespace area 141 of FIG. 1C , but has a disadvantage of the partial or complete removal of content from the search result 160 (e.g., search control elements such as the review 112 , the rating 114 , and the metadata 118 included in the search result 100 are not visible in the search result 160 ).
- a cropping approach can also be used to crop the image 164 to avoid whitespace areas, but such an approach has a disadvantage of removal of a portion of the image 164 .
- an approach can be used to align the bottom of the in-line image region 162 with the bottom of the text region 163 , while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image 164 and the width of the search result 160 , and without cropping or removal of content from the text region 163 or the image 164 .
- the additional images can be iteratively processed using the illustrated process, or the images can be clustered and processed as a single, aggregated image.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary system 200 .
- a search engine 202 provides a URL 204 of a search result to a set of search result element generators 206 .
- the search engine 202 can identify the search result in response to a search query.
- search result element generators 206 b - 206 e provide one or more search result elements 208 to a search result formatter 210 .
- a description generator 206 b can generate a description (e.g., the description 110 ) of the search result
- a link generator 206 c can generate one or more links to be included in the search result
- a review generator 206 d can generate review-related content (e.g., the review 112 ) to be included in the search result
- a metadata generator 206 e can generate one or more metadata items (e.g., the hours 116 , the metadata 118 ) to include in the search result.
- an image element generator 206 a generates an image element to be included in the search result and provides the image element to an image scaler 212 .
- the search result formatter 210 provides a number-of-lines estimate 214 to the image scaler 212 .
- the number-of-lines estimate 214 is an estimate of the number of lines that will be occupied by the search result elements 208 in a text region of the search result, based on default search result size parameters 216 , such as an initial width of the text region.
- the image scaler 212 scales the width of the image element based at least on the number-of-lines estimate 214 , the initial height of the image element, and the initial width of the image element. For example, if the number-of-lines estimate 214 is five lines, a corresponding pixel height of the text region can be determined to be, for example, eighty pixels (e.g., using an estimate of 16 pixels per line). The image scaler 212 can scale the height of the image element to be eighty pixels and can determine a scaled width of the image element while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image element.
- the scaled height and width of the image element are provided to the search result formatter 210 as an adjusted image size 218 .
- An adjusted width of the image element can result in an adjusted width of the text region (e.g., if the image element is wider, the amount of the search result width allocated to the text region can be reduced).
- the search result formatter 210 can provide an updated number-of-lines estimate (e.g., as the number-of-lines estimate 214 ) based on the adjusted text region width. For example, the search result formatter can determine that the search result elements 208 may occupy seven lines of text in a text region having the adjusted text region width.
- the image scaler 212 further scales the width of the image element based at least on the adjusted number-of-lines estimate, the adjusted height of the image element, and the adjusted width of the image element.
- the image scaler provides adjusted image size information to the search result formatter 210 .
- the search result formatter 210 provides a formatted search result 220 that includes a scaled image to the search engine 202 .
- the image may be cropped using an image cropper 222 .
- the search engine 202 can provide the formatted search result 220 to a user, such as in a search results page provided in response to a search query.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a computer-implemented process 300 for adjusting a content region.
- the content region may be, for example, a search result, a region of a search result page that includes answers or that summarizes subjects, topics, or entities, or a page or portion of a page that is generated by a search system and that provides an answer to a question.
- an initial height and an initial width of an image that is associated with a search result, or of a group of images are determined ( 302 ), where the image is to be displayed in the search result in line with text associated with the search result, and where the search result includes an in-line image region for displaying the image in line with the text, and a text region for displaying the text.
- the process 300 can iteratively evaluate or process each image, or the images can be grouped into a multi-image cluster that is evaluated as a whole.
- the text associated with the search result can include a title and a description of the search result.
- Other examples of textual elements include a review, a rating, hours information, a URL of a resource represented by the search result, notes, site links, history information indicating when a user last visited the resource, address information, and stock quote information.
- the text region can include elements other than text (e.g., user interface controls).
- the image associated with the search result can be, for example, an image included in or otherwise associated with the resource represented by the search result. As a more particular example, the image can be an image of an author of the resource.
- An initial height of the text region of the search result is determined based at least on (i) the text associated with the search result, and (ii) an initial width of the text region ( 304 ).
- the search result can have a predetermined width
- the initial width of the text region can be a predetermined portion of the search result width (with the remaining portion of the search result defining a default in-line image region width).
- the initial height of the text region can be determined, for example, by determining how many lines the text associated with the search result occupies if included in the text region having the predetermined initial text-region width.
- a number of pixels for the initial height of the text region can be determined by multiplying the determined number of lines by a predetermined number of pixels per line estimate. For example, a determined number of lines may be five, a predetermined number of pixels per line estimate may be ten, and the initial height of the text region can be determined to be fifty pixels.
- An initial width of the in-line image region of the search result is determined based at least on (i) the initial height of the text region of the search result, (ii) the initial height of the image, and (iii) the initial width of the image ( 306 ).
- the width of the in-line image region can be scaled based on the initial height of the text region, and the initial height and width of the image. For example, if the initial height of the text region is fifty pixels, the initial height of the image is one hundred pixels, and the initial width of the image is two hundred pixels, the initial width of the in-line image region can be determined to be (50/100*200) or a width of one hundred pixels.
- An adjusted height of the text region of the search result is determined based at least on the initial width of the in-line image region of the search result ( 308 ).
- the height of the text region can be adjusted, for example, based on the text region occupying more or less of the search result in consideration of how the initial width of the text region is affected by the determined initial width of the in-line region. For example, if the determined in-line image region width is less than the default in-line image region width, the text region may be “stretched” (e.g., occupy more of the search result width) and may therefore occupy less lines of text (e.g., resulting in an adjusted text region height that is less than the initial text region height).
- the text region may be “squished” (e.g., occupy less of the search result width) and may therefore occupy more lines of text (e.g., resulting in text wrapping which results in an adjusted text region height that is more than the initial text region height).
- a determination can be made that the initial width of the in-line image region exceeds a maximum in-line image region width.
- the adjusted height of the text region can be further based on the maximum in-line image region width.
- the initial width of the in-line image region can be set to the maximum in-line image region width.
- the adjusted height of the text region can be determined based on how many lines the text of the search result occupies in a text region that has a width determined based on the search result including an in-line image region having the maximum in-line image region width.
- An adjusted width of the in-line image region of the search result is determined based at least on the adjusted height of the text region of the search result ( 310 ).
- the width of the in-line image region can be scaled based on the adjusted height of the text region, and the initial height and width of the image.
- An adjusted height and an adjusted width of the image are determined based at least on the adjusted width of the in-line image region of the search result ( 312 ).
- the adjusted width of the image can be set to the adjusted width of the in-line image region and the adjusted height of the image can be scaled based on the adjusted width of the image.
- At least a portion of the image is scaled based at least on the adjusted height and the adjusted width of the image ( 314 ).
- the image is cropped based on the adjusted width of the in-line image region.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary computer-implemented process 400 for adjusting a search result.
- a size of an initial image 402 e.g., four hundred pixels wide by one hundred pixels high
- the image 402 is four times wider than it is tall.
- a search result formatter 406 determines that an initial height of a text region 408 of the search result 405 is five lines (or a corresponding eighty pixels) high, given an initial width of the text region 408 .
- the initial width of the text region 408 can be determined, for example, based on the overall width of the search result 405 and a default in-line image region width (e.g., a default in-line image region width of 80 pixels, as illustrated by a default image 410 ).
- the image scaler 404 scales the width of the in-line image region based on the text-region height of eighty pixels and on the size of the initial image 402 . For example, as illustrated in a scaled image 412 , given a scaled image height of eighty pixels, an initial image height of one hundred pixels, and an initial image width of four hundred pixels, the image scaler 404 can determine a scaled image width of three hundred twenty pixels.
- the image scaler 404 determines that the width of the scaled image 414 of three hundred twenty pixels is greater than a predetermined maximum image width of one hundred sixty pixels.
- the image scaler 404 scales the height of the image 402 based on a scaled image width equal to the maximum image width of one hundred sixty pixels. For example, given an initial image height of one hundred pixels, an initial image width of four hundred pixels, and a scaled image width of one hundred sixty pixels, the image scaler 404 can determine a scaled image height of forty pixels.
- a proposed image size of one hundred sixty pixels by forty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 406 , as illustrated by a scaled image 418 included in a search result 420 .
- the search result formatter 406 determines that an adjusted height of a text region 422 of the search result 420 is seven lines (or a corresponding one hundred twelve pixels), based on a text region width that results from the proposed image size.
- the adjusted text region height is provided to the image scaler 404 .
- the image scaler 404 determines that the adjusted text region height is outside of a predetermined range of the height of the image 418 .
- the image scaler 404 can compare a text height to image height ratio (e.g., one hundred twelve to forty, or a value of 2.8) to a threshold ratio (e.g., a threshold of 2.5).
- a threshold ratio e.g., a threshold of 2.5.
- the image scaler 404 can determine that the image 418 simply “won't fit”, or is too wide to be included in the search result 420 while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image 418 and having a height that is within a predefined range of the height of the text region 422 .
- a selected image size of a default image height (e.g., eighty pixels) and a default image width (e.g., eighty pixels) is provided to the search result formatter 406 , as illustrated by an image 424 included in a search result 426 .
- the image 424 may be a scaled image and/or a cropped image (e.g., the image scaler 404 may scale the image 402 to have the default image height and width, and/or the image 402 may be cropped to fit the default image height and width).
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary computer-implemented process 500 for adjusting a search result.
- a stage “0” the size of an image 502 (e.g., two hundred pixels wide by one hundred pixels high) associated with a search result is provided to an image scaler 504 .
- the image 502 is twice as wide as it is tall.
- a search result formatter 506 determines that an initial height of a text region 508 of the search result 505 is five lines (or a corresponding eighty pixels) high, given an initial width of the text region 508 .
- the image scaler 504 scales the width of an in-line image region based on the text-region height of eighty pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of eighty pixels, an initial image height of one hundred pixels, and an initial image width of two hundred pixels, the image scaler 504 can determine a scaled image width of one hundred sixty pixels.
- a proposed image size of one hundred sixty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 506 .
- the search result formatter 506 determines that an adjusted height of the text region 508 is six lines (or a corresponding ninety six pixels), as illustrated by a text region 513 and based on a text region width that results from the proposed image size.
- the adjusted text region height is provided to the image scaler 504 .
- the image scaler 504 scales the width of the image 502 based on the adjusted text-region height of ninety six pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of ninety six pixels, an initial image height of one hundred pixels, and an initial image width of two hundred pixels, the image scaler 504 can determine a scaled image width of one hundred ninety two pixels.
- the image scaler 504 determines that the width of the scaled image 516 of one hundred ninety two pixels is greater than a predetermined maximum image width of one hundred sixty pixels.
- the image scaler 504 scales the height of the image 502 based on the maximum image width of one hundred sixty pixels. For example, given the maximum image width of one hundred sixty pixels, an initial image height of one hundred pixels, and an initial image width of two hundred pixels, the image scaler 504 can determine a scaled image height of eighty pixels.
- the image scaler 504 determines that an 80 pixel image height is within a predetermined range (e.g., 82%, sixteen pixels) of a ninety six pixel text region height.
- a predetermined range e.g. 82%, sixteen pixels
- a selected image size of one hundred sixty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 506 , as illustrated by a scaled image 520 included in a search result 522 .
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary computer-implemented process 600 for adjusting a search result.
- a stage “0” the size of an image 602 (e.g., one hundred pixels wide by one hundred pixels high) associated with a search result is provided to an image scaler 604 .
- the image 602 is a square image.
- a search result formatter 606 determines that an initial height of a text region 608 of the search result 605 is five lines (or a corresponding eighty pixels) high, given an initial width of the text region 608 .
- the image scaler 604 scales the width of an in-line image region based on the text-region height of eighty pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of eighty pixels, an initial image height of one hundred pixels, and an initial image width of one hundred pixels, the image scaler 604 can determine a scaled image width of eighty pixels.
- a proposed image size of eighty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 606 .
- the search result formatter 606 determines that an adjusted height of the text region 608 is the same as the previously determined text region height (e.g., five lines, or eighty pixels), as illustrated by a text region 612 included in a search result 614 .
- the adjusted text region height is provided to the image scaler 604 .
- the image scaler 604 determines that the previously proposed image height of eighty pixels is equal to the adjusted text region height of eighty pixels.
- a selected image size of one eighty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 606 , as illustrated by a scaled image 616 included in a search result 618 .
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary computer-implemented process 700 for adjusting a search result.
- a stage “0” the size of an image 702 (e.g., one hundred pixels wide by two hundred pixels high) associated with a search result is provided to an image scaler 704 .
- the image 702 is twice as tall as it is wide.
- a search result formatter 706 determines that an initial height of a text region 708 of the search result 705 is five lines (or a corresponding eighty pixels) high, given an initial width of the text region 708 .
- the image scaler 704 scales the width of an in-line image region based on the text-region height of eighty pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of eighty pixels, an initial image height of two hundred pixels, and an initial image width of one hundred pixels, the image scaler 704 can determine a scaled image width of forty pixels.
- a proposed image size of forty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 706 .
- the search result formatter 706 determines that an adjusted height of the text region 708 is four lines (or a corresponding sixty four pixels), as illustrated by a text region 712 included in a search result 714 and based on a text region width that results from the proposed image size.
- the adjusted text region height is provided to the image scaler 704 .
- the image scaler 704 scales the width of the in-line image region based on the text-region height of sixty four pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of sixty four pixels, an initial image height of two hundred pixels, and an initial image width of one hundred pixels, the image scaler 704 can determine a scaled image width of thirty two pixels.
- a proposed image size of thirty two pixels by sixty four pixels is provided to the search result formatter 706 .
- the search result formatter 706 determines that an adjusted height of the text region 712 is the same as the previously determined text region height (e.g., four lines, or sixty four pixels), as illustrated by a text region 718 included in a search result 720 .
- the adjusted text region height is provided to the image scaler 604 .
- the image scaler 704 determines that the previously proposed image height of sixty four pixels is equal to the adjusted text region height of sixty four pixels.
- a selected image size of thirty two pixels by sixty four pixels is provided to the search result formatter 706 , as illustrated by a scaled image 722 included in a search result 724 .
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary computer-implemented process 800 for adjusting a search result.
- a stage “0” the size of an image 802 (e.g., one hundred pixels wide by four hundred pixels high) associated with a search result is provided to an image scaler 804 .
- the image 802 is four times as tall as it is wide.
- a search result formatter 806 determines that an initial height of a text region 808 of the search result 805 is five lines (or a corresponding eighty pixels) high, given an initial width of the text region 808 .
- the image scaler 804 scales the width of an in-line image region based on the text-region height of eighty pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of eighty pixels, an initial image height of four hundred pixels, and an initial image width of one hundred pixels, the image scaler 804 can determine a scaled image width of twenty pixels.
- a proposed image size of twenty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 806 .
- the search result formatter 806 determines that an adjusted height of the text region 808 is four lines (or a corresponding sixty four pixels), as illustrated by a text region 813 included in a search result 814 and based on a text region width that results from the proposed image size.
- the adjusted text region height is provided to the image scaler 804 .
- the image scaler 804 scales the width of the image 802 based on the adjusted text-region height of sixty four pixels. For example, given a scaled image height of sixty four pixels, an initial image height of four hundred pixels, and an initial image width of one hundred pixels, the image scaler 804 can determine a scaled image width of sixteen pixels.
- the image scaler 804 determines that a sixteen pixel image width is less than a minimum pixel width of twenty pixels. As a result of the determination, the image scaler 804 can select the previously proposed image size as a selected image size. A selected image size of twenty pixels by eighty pixels is provided to the search result formatter 806 , as illustrated by an image 818 included in a search result 820 .
