Definitions
- the present invention relates to a mobile image-based retrieval system, and more particularly, to a system including a mobile phone with a built-in camera for use in image-based searching.
- the present invention may be embodied in an image-based information retrieval system that includes a mobile telephone and a remote server.
- the mobile telephone has a built-in camera, a recognition engine for recognizing an object or feature in an image from the built-in camera, and a communication link for requesting information from the remote server related to a recognized object or feature.
- the object may be an advertising billboard and the related information may be a web page address.
- the object may be a car and the related information may be a car manual.
- the object may be a product and the related information may be a payment confirmation.
- the object may be a book and the related information may be an audio stream.
- the object feature may text and the related information may be a translation of the text or a web page address.
- the object feature may be an advertisement and the related information may be a web page address.
- the object feature may be a picture and the related information may be an audio stream.
- the present invention may be embodied an image-based information retrieval system that includes a mobile telephone and a remote server.
- the mobile telephone has a built-in camera and a communication link for transmitting an image from the built-in camera to the remote server.
- the remote server has an optical character recognition engine for generating a first confidence value based on an image from the mobile telephone, an object recognition engine for generating a second confidence value based on an image from the mobile telephone, a face recognition engine for generating a third confidence value based on an image from the mobile telephone, and an integrator module for receiving the first, second, and third confidence values and generating a recognition output.
- the object recognition engine may comprise a rigid texture object recognition engine, and/or an articulate object recognition engine.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a first embodiment of an image-based information retrieval system that includes a mobile telephone and a remote server with multiple recognition engines.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an image-based information retrieval system that includes a mobile telephone having a recognition engine for recognizing an object in an image from a built-in camera.
- this application addresses improvements to four aspects of an image-based search service: 1) improvement to the client side application that resides on the mobile handset; 2) server side innovations that make the image search faster and more focused on relevant parts of the image databases; 3) new applications; and 4) business models that are particularly suited for a commercial roll-out of an image-based search service.
- the simplest implementation of a search engine is one in which the recognition engine resides entirely on the server. However for a couple of reasons it might be more desirable to run part of the recognition on the phone. One reason is that this way the server has less computational load and the service can be run more economically. The second reason is that the feature vectors contain less data then the original image thus the data that needs to be send to the server can be reduced.
- the client side application would essentially acquire an image and send appropriate image representations to recognition servers. It then would receive the search results in an appropriate format.
- an application would be implemented in Java or BREW so that it is possible to download this application over the air instead of preloading it on the phone.
- the present invention may be embodied in an image-based information retrieval system 10 including a mobile telephone 12 and a remote server 14 .
- the mobile telephone has a built-in camera 16 , a recognition engine 32 for recognizing an object or feature in an image from the built-in camera, and a communication link 18 for requesting information from the remote server related to a recognized object or feature.
- an architecture may be used in which multiple recognition engines are applied to an incoming image. Each engine returns the recognition results with confidence values and an integrating module that outputs a final list of objects recognized.
- FIG. 1 shows an effective recognition server 14 ′ that is comprised of multiple specialized recognition engines that focus on recognizing certain object classes.
- the present invention may be embodied in an image-based information retrieval system that includes a mobile telephone 12 and a remote recognition server 14 ′.
- the mobile telephone has a built-in camera 16 and a communication link 18 for transmitting an image 20 from the built-in camera to the remote recognition server.
- the remote recognition server has an optical character recognition engine 22 for generating a first confidence value based on an image from the mobile telephone, an object recognition engine, 24 and/or 26 , for generating a second confidence value based on an image from the mobile telephone, a face recognition engine 28 for generating a third confidence value based on an image from the mobile telephone, and an integrator module 30 for receiving the first, second, and third confidence values and generating a recognition output.
- the recognition output may be an image description 32 .
- Objects change. Therefore it is important to regularly update the object representations. This can be achieved in two ways.
- One way is that the service providers regularly add current image material to refresh the object representations.
- the other way is to keep the images that user submit for query and upon recognition feed them into the engine that updates the object representations.
- the later method requires a confidence measure that estimates how reliable a recognition result is. This is necessary in order not to pollute the database.
- One is to use match scores, topological and other consistency checks that are intrinsic the object recognition methods described in the previous disclosure as well the one cited below.
- Another way is to rely on extrinsic quality measures such as to determine whether a search result was accepted by a user. This can with some reliability be inferred from whether he continued using the page to which the search result led and/or whether he did not do a similar query shortly after.
- One of the most important features of an image-based search service is that it is possible for a user, who is not a machine vision expert, to easily submit entries to the library of objects that can be recognized.
- a face recognition engine described in (U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,370 FACE RECOGNITION FROM VIDEO IMAGES) also allows to add new entries into the library using small sets of facial images. This system can be generalized to work with other object classes as well.
- Location information can also be used in obvious ways. Staying with the hotel example, one would arrange the search process such that only object representations of hotels are activated in the query of hotels that are close to the current location of the user.
- An efficient implementation of a search service requires that the image search is organized such that it scales logarithmically with the number of entries in the database. This can be achieved by conducting a coarse-to-fine simple to complex search strategy such as described in (Shape Indexing Using Approximate Nearest-Neighbour Search in High-Dimensional Spaces, Jeffrey S. Beis and David G. Lowe, CVPR 1997).
- the principal idea is to do the search in an iterative fashion starting with a reduced representation that contains only the most salient object characteristics. Only matches that result from this first pass are investigated closer by using a richer representation of the image and the object. Typically this search proceeds in a couple of rounds until a sufficiently good match using the most complete image and object representation is found.
- a specific application of the image-based search engine is recognition of words in a printed document.
- the optical character recognition sub-engine can recognize a word which then can be handed to an encyclopedia or dictionary.
- a dictionary look-up can translate the word before it is processed further.
- a sweet spot for a first commercial roll-out is mobile advertising.
- a user can send a picture of a product to a server that recognizes the product and associates the input with the user. As a result the sender could be entered into a sweepstake or he could receive a rebate. He could also be guided to a relevant webpage that will give him more product information or would allow him to order this or similar products.
- a very useful application of image-based search is in the print-to-internet space.
- a user By submitting a picture showing a portion of a printed page to a server a user can retrieve additional, real-time information about the text.
- the recognition servers so that each part of the printed material can be annotated. Since today's printing process in large parts starts from digital versions of the printed pages this image material is readily available. In fact it will allow using printed pages in whole new ways as now they could be viewed as mere pointers to more information that is available digitally.
- a special application is an ad-to-phone number feature that allows a user to quickly input a phone number into his phone by taking a picture of an ad.
- a similar mechanism would of useful for other contact information such as email, SMS or web addresses.
- Image recognition can also be beneficially integrated with a payment system.
- a customer When browsing merchandise a customer can take a picture of the merchandise itself, of an attached barcode, of a label or some other unique marker and send it to the server on which the recognition engine resides.
- the recognition results in an identifier of the merchandize that can be used in conjunction with user information, such as his credit card number to generate a payment.
- a record of the purchase transaction can be made available to a human or machine-based controller to check whether the merchandise was properly paid.
- a group of users in constant need for additional explanations are children.
- Numerous educational games can be based on the ability to recognize objects. For example one can train the recognition system to know all countries on a world map. Other useful examples would be numbers or letters, parts of the body etc. Essentially a child could read a picture book just by herself by clicking on the various pictures and listen to audio streams triggered by the outputs of the recognition engine.
- Object recognition on mobile phones can support a new form of games. For instance a treasure hunt game in which the player has to find a certain scene or object say the facade of a building. Once he takes the picture of the correct object he gets instructions how to continue.
- a treasure hunt game in which the player has to find a certain scene or object say the facade of a building. Once he takes the picture of the correct object he gets instructions how to continue.
- a user can also choose to use the object recognition system in order to annotate objects.
- a user can take a photo of an object and submit it to the database together with a textual annotation that he can retrieve later when taking a picture of the object.
- the search service is offered such that a distributed server network is provided to which images can be send the symbolic information describing the objects visible on the image is send back to the querying client.
- a fee may be charged per transaction, or alternatively, a fixed monthly fee may be charged for such a service.
- a fixed monthly fee may be charged for such a service.
- providers of new annotated images one can request a fee per entry into the database.
- recognition classes words/ads/travel guide/etc.
