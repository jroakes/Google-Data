Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for classifying a spike in a rate of occurrence of events. One of the methods includes receiving data identifying a spike at a particular time in a rate of occurrence of events relating to a particular search query, where an event relating to the particular search query is a receipt event of the particular search query or an indexing event of a resource that satisfies the particular search query, fitting the occurrences of the events in a time window to a reference distribution of occurrences of events to determine a goodness of fit value, wherein the reference distribution models a random occurrence of events relating to search queries, comparing the goodness of fit value to a primary threshold, and classifying the spike as a spurious spike if the goodness of fit value satisfies the predetermined threshold.
Description
- This specification relates to classifying a spike in a rate of occurrence of events. Search systems index resources, e.g., social network updates, microblog posts, blog posts, news feeds, user generated multimedia content, images, videos, and web pages, that are relevant to search queries, and present information about the indexed resources to a user in response to receipt of a particular search query.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving data identifying a spike at a particular time in a rate of occurrence of events relating to a particular search query, wherein an event relating to the particular search query is a receipt event of the particular search query or an indexing event of a resource that satisfies the particular search query, fitting the occurrences of the events in a time window to a reference distribution of occurrences of events to determine a goodness of fit value, wherein the reference distribution models a random occurrence of events relating to search queries, comparing the goodness of fit value to a primary threshold, and classifying the spike as a spurious spike if the goodness of fit value satisfies the predetermined threshold. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- The foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. The reference distribution is a Poisson distribution or a Gaussian distribution. The method of fitting the occurrences of the events includes applying a chi-square goodness of fit test for the reference distribution. The method further includes classifying the spike as a non-spurious spike if the goodness of fit value does not satisfy the primary threshold. If the goodness of fit value does not satisfy the primary threshold, the method further includes determining whether metadata associated with the events relating to the particular search query at the particular time satisfies a suspicious activity condition, and classifying the spike as a non-spurious spike if the metadata does not satisfy the suspicious activity condition. If the metadata satisfies the suspicious activity condition, the method further includes comparing the goodness of fit value to a different, less stringent threshold, and classifying the spike as a spurious spike if the goodness of fit value satisfies the less stringent threshold.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The proper classification of spikes improves the quality of search results that are returned to the user in response to a particular search query by suppressing those search results associated with resources that are likely to be spam. The system can detect trending or hot topics in real-time and use such information to provide content recommendations to a user, thereby improving the likelihood that the search results that are returned to the user in response to a particular search query will be of interest to the user. The techniques described in this specification can be used on financial data to identify trending real-time interest in particular stocks.

FIG. 1 shows anexample search system 100 that includes afront end module 102, araw count generator 104, aspike detection module 106, aspike classification module 108 and aspike processing module 110. - The
front end module 102 provides an interface through which a user operating a user device submitssearch queries 120 and receivessearch results 122 that satisfy thesearch queries 120. Thesearch results 122 identify resources, e.g., web pages, social network updates, microblog posts, blog posts, and user generated multimedia content, which have been indexed by thesearch system 100. - The
front end module 102 passes thesearch queries 120 to theraw count generator 104, which generates and maintainsevent data 114. Theevent data 114 is data about the rate of occurrence of events relating to aparticular search query 120. Such events include receipt events anddocument indexing events 126. Each event is associated with an event time. An event time associated with a receipt event can be the time at which a search query was received by thesearch system 100, for example, or the time the search query was submitted by a user, or the time a user selected a resource from a search engine results page for viewing. An event time associated with a document indexing event can be the time at which a resource that satisfies a particular search query was indexed by thesearch system 100, for example, or the time the resource was made publicly available. Theraw count generator 104 can be implemented to generateevent data 114 by first assigning each event relating to a particular search query to one of a set of bins defined by uniform time intervals according to its associated event time, then generating a raw count per bin. For example, theraw count generator 104 could assign each document indexing event of a resource that satisfies a search query of “San Francisco earthquake” to one of a set of bins defined by five minute intervals, then generate a raw count of the number of events that have been assigned to each bin. - The
spike detection module 106 processes theevent data 114 using conventional techniques to generate spike identification data 116. The spike identification data 116 identifies the spikes, relative to a historical baseline rate of events, that thespike detection module 106 finds in the rate of occurrence of events. The events can be, for example, events relating to a particular search query over a given time window. In some cases, the time window is a current time window, and the process is performed to identify spikes in current search query activity. The size of the time window can be a predetermined amount of time, e.g., two, five, ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty five, sixty, ninety, or one hundred twenty minutes. In other cases, the process is performed to identify spikes in historical data. Referring to the example above, thespike detection module 106 can analyze theevent data 114 for the search query of “San Francisco earthquake” and generate spike identification data 116 that identifies spikes in the number of events over a sixty minute time window. - The
spike classification module 108 processes theevent data 114 and the spike identification data 116 and classifies each spike in the spike identification data 116 as spurious or non-spurious. Thespike classification module 108 generates non-spuriousspike identification data 118 that identifies the non-spurious spikes. - The
spike processing module 110 processes the non-spuriousspike identification data 118 to generatesignals 128 for use by thesearch system 100. For example, thesignals 128 can indicate that a particular Internet domain, web site, search query, search topic, web page, image, video, or other resource or a particular author or entity has enjoyed a sudden increase or decrease in popularity, as reflected in search queries that have been submitted or resources that have been viewed. As a particular example, thesignals 128 can identify topics of current interest. In some implementations, thespike processing module 110 first identifies, from among the search queries associated with spikes in current search query activity, those search queries that deviated the most from their historic traffic pattern. Using a subsystem of thesearch system 100 that maps queries to topics, the identified search queries are mapped to topics. Finally, thespike processing module 110 provides a signal that identifies the topics to which the identified search queries are mapped as “topics of current interest.” -
FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating an example method for classifying a spike in a rate of occurrence of events relating to a particular search query that occur in a particular time window. For convenience, the method will be described in reference to a system that performs the method. The system can be, for example, thesearch system 100 described above with reference toFIG. 1 . - The
spike classification module 108 receives (202) spike identification data identifying a spike in a rate of occurrence of events relating to a particular search query that occur in a particular time window. - The
spike classification module 108 fits (204) the occurrences of the events in the time window to a reference distribution of occurrences of events to determine a goodness of fit value. The reference distribution models a random occurrence of events and is a statistical distribution, e.g., a Poisson distribution or a Gaussian distribution. Thespike classification module 108 is implemented to apply a chi-square goodness of fit test, a likelihood-ratio test, a G-test, or other suitable test depending on the reference distribution. Next, thespike classification module 108 compares (206) the goodness of fit (“GOF”) value to a predetermined primary threshold. If the GOF value satisfies the primary threshold, e.g., a chi-square statistic is less than the chi-square critical value at p=0.05 significance level, thespike classification module 108 classifies (208) the spike as a “spurious” spike. Otherwise, thespike classification module 108 classifies (210) the spike as “non-spurious.” - In some implementations of the
spike classification module 108, if the GOF value does not satisfy the primary threshold but satisfies a less stringent secondary threshold, e.g., a chi-square statistic which is less than the chi-squared critical value for p between 0.05 and 0.10, thespike classification module 108 examines metadata for the events associated with the spike to determine whether the metadata satisfies a suspicious activity condition. Examples of metadata that satisfies a suspicious activity condition include metadata identifying a single entity, e.g., IP address, email address, author, or username, as the source of a significant portion, e.g., more that 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%, of the events associated with the spike. If the metadata satisfies the “suspicious activity” condition, the spike is classified as a “spurious” spike; otherwise, if the metadata does not satisfy the condition, the spike is classified as a “non-spurious” spike. - In some implementations of the
spike classification module 108, if the GOF value does not meet the primary threshold, thespike classification module 108 first examines the metadata for the events associated with the spike to determine whether the metadata satisfies the suspicious activity condition. If the metadata does not satisfy the suspicious activity condition, thespike classification module 108 classifies the spike as “non-spurious.” Otherwise, thespike classification module 108 compares the GOF value to a different, less stringent threshold, and classifies the spike as “spurious” only if the GOF value satisfies the less stringent threshold. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
