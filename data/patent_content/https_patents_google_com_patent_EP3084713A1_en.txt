- FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a summary subsystem 120 of the store server 1 10 for supporting entity -based summaries according to one embodiment.
- the summary subsystem 120 has an analysis module 3 10, an entity extraction module 320, a summary generation module 330 and a presentation module 340.
- the summary subsystem 120 can have different and/or additional modules other than the ones described here, and that the functions may be distributed among the modules in a different manner.
- the analysis module 3 10 identifies an e-book to be summarized. In one embodiment, the analysis module 3 10 identifies an e-book to be summarized upon a user request for a summary sent to the store server 1 10.
- the user request includes an identification of the e-book, such as a volume ID, title or the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) number of the e-book.
- the user request may also include a start point and/or break point for the identified e-book.
- the analysis module 3 10 searches the literature corpus 130 of the server store 1 10 based on the identification of the requested e- book. In another embodiment, the analysis module 3 10 automatically identifies an e- book to be summarized upon the e-book being stored in the literature corpus 130.
- the analysis module 3 10 also determines the type of an e-book to be summarized.
- the analysis module 3 10 analyzes the metadata associated with the e-book to categorize the e-book into one or more type categories.
- the categories can be general or specific.
- an embodiment of the analysis module 310 may categorize an e-book as belonging to the general category of fiction or non-fiction.
- the analysis module 310 may then further categorize the e-book with specific categories within the general category (e.g., mystery, historical fiction, biography).
- the analysis module 310 may also determine the type of the e-book by analyzing the text of the e-book. For example, textual analysis of the book may be performed to determine whether it is fiction or non- fiction if no metadata for the book are available.
- the analysis module 310 identifies one or more external data sources for an e-book based on the type of the e-book.
- the identified external data sources are ones that are likely to have information that will inform the entity identification process for the e-book. For example, if the e-book is determined to be a non-fiction biography, the analysis module 310 may identify one or more external data sources, such as online encyclopedias, that are likely to contain information about the subject of the biography. Similarly, if the e-book is determined to be science fiction, the analysis module 310 may identify one or more external data sources that are likely to contain information about the entities referenced in the book, such as fan sites, movie information sites (in case there is a movie based on the book), etc.
- the analysis module 310 interacts with the entity extraction module 320 and the summary generation module 330 for further processing.
- the analysis module may provide the identity of the e-book, the type of e-book, the identified external data sources, and the start/break points to the entity extraction module 320 and the summary generation module 330.
- the entity extraction module 320 extracts one or more entities from the text of an e-book. In other words, the entity extraction module 320 identifies the entities that are referenced in the text of the e-book.
- the entity extraction module 320 may use one or more of a variety of techniques to extract the entities from the e-book text, including key phrase extraction, text mining, natural language processing, semantic analysis, etc.
- An embodiment of the entity extraction module 320 uses information from the identified external data sources to inform the entity extraction process.
- the information from an external data source may contain an implicit or explicit list of entities referenced in the e-book. Therefore, the entity extraction module 320 can use the external data source to guide and improve the entity extraction process performed on the e-book.
- the external data sources may include an online encyclopedia entry describing the life of the person.
- the online encyclopedia entry may include explicit lists of entities associated with the person, such as locations, dates, and other people who interacted with the person.
- the online encyclopedia entry may include headings, tags, links, and the like that implicitly identify entities associated with the person.
- the external data sources may include a link to an entry for the movie in a movie information database.
- the movie database entry may include an explicit list of characters in the movie (and hence likely in the e-book), links to other movies or books that are associated with the e-book, etc.
- the entity extraction module 320 may parse or otherwise interpret the external data sources in order to identify candidate entities in the e-book. The entity extraction module 320 may then examine the e-book text to identify references to these candidate entities, if any, in the e-book. In addition, the entity extraction module 320 may also discern other information about the entities, such as the relative importance of the entities, from the information in the external data sources.
- the entity extraction module 320 stores data describing the entities extracted from an e-book.
- the data may include the locations in the e-book where the entity is referenced, an indication of the type of entity (e.g., person or location), cross-references to other entities with which the first entity is associated, and locations of text or other information in the e-book that are particularly pertinent to the entity.
- the summary generation module 330 generates summaries for e-books stored in the literature corpus 130 using the extracted entities.
- the summary generation module 330 automatically and dynamically generates entity -based summaries based on the start and/or break points provided by the requesting user.
- the entity -based summaries describe the content of the e-book with respect to the individual entities referenced in the e-book in the text delineated by the start and break points. For example, if the received summary request identifies the start point as the beginning of the book and the break point as a location within the text of the book, the summary generation module 330 generates a summary of the e-book text from the start to the location identified by the break point.
- the generated summary is organized by entity, and describes entities referenced in the e-book between the start point and the break point, using information about the entities from the text between only those two points.
- the user can refresh his or her recollection of the content of the e-book between the start and break points by, e.g., reading about the characters and other entities described by the e- book between those points.
- an embodiment of the summary generation module 330 identifies e-book text between the start and break points associated with the entity. The summary generation module 330 then selects a subset of the identified text for inclusion in the summary. The summary generation module 330 perform an analysis of the identified text to assign a weight, or score, to individual text fragments (e.g., sentences, paragraphs) describing amounts of information contributed by the text fragments to the description of the entity, and to the entity's relationships with other entities in the e-book. For example, text fragments that are highly-descriptive, describe interactions with other entities, and the like, may be weighted more heavily than text fragments that lack these features. The summary generation module 330 selects the highest- weighted text fragments for an entity for inclusion in the summary of the entity.
- individual text fragments e.g., sentences, paragraphs
- the presentation module 340 presents the entity -based summaries of the e- books in response to requests received from the client devices 170.
- the user request includes an identification of a specific e-book and a start point and a break point of the identified e-book.
- the presentation module 340 provides this information to the summary generation module 330, and receives the requested summary in response thereto.
- the presentation module 340 then presents the summary to the requesting client device 170.
- the presentation module 340 presents the summary as a list of entities referenced in the e-book between the start and the break points. The user can browse through the list of the entities and select one or more of them.
- the presentation module 340 presents a summary of a selected entity based on information in the e-book found between the start and break points.
- the summary of the selected entity may include, for example, a description of the entity and how the entity interacts with other entities in the e-book, the locations in the e-book where the entity is referenced, an indication of the type of the entity (e.g. person or location), cross-references to other entities associated with the selected entity within the text between the start and break points and locations of text.
- the presentation module 340 may rank the entities in the list based on the importance of the entity to the e-book and/or to the range of pages between the start and break points. The ranking may be based, for example, on the frequency that the individual entities are mentioned in the portion of the e-book between the start and break points, importance information about the entities derived from the external data sources 160, and/or other signals of relative importance.
- FIG. 4 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a client device 170 for presenting an e-book and an entity -based summary of the e-book to a user according to one embodiment.
- the client device 170 shown includes a client interaction module 410, a display module 420 and local data storage 430.
- Other embodiments of client devices 170 include different and/or additional modules.
- the functions may be distributed among the modules in a different manner than described herein.
- the client interaction module 410 processes user requests made via user input into the client device 170.
- One type of the user requests is a request for a particular e-book.
- the client interaction module 410 Upon receiving a user request for an e-book, the client interaction module 410 searches for the requested e-book at the local data storage 430. If there is a copy of the e-book in the local data storage 430 (e.g., purchased from GOOGLE PLAY STORETM), the client interaction module 410 instructs the display module 420 to retrieve at least part of the requested e-book and present it to the user. Responsive to no copy of the requested e-book being stored in the local data storage 430, the client interaction module 410 may instruct the display module 420 to access a remote copy of the e-book stored in the literature corpus 130 via the network 150.
- the client interaction module 410 may instruct the display module 420 to access a remote copy of the e-book stored in the literature corpus 130 via the network 150
- the client interaction module 410 also receives user requests for entity- based summaries of e-books being displayed on the client devices 170 of the users. For example, the client interaction module 410 may detect when the user interacts with the user interface to request a summary of the e-book. The client interaction module 410 sends the user request with the specified start and break points to the store server 1 10. The client interaction module 410 may infer the start and break points from the user's previous interactions with the book. For example, the module 410 may infer that the start point is the beginning of the e-book and the break point is the farthest location read by the user in the e-book.
- the break point may be a location prior to the end of the e- book, and the range of the book defined by the start and break points is thus a subset of the text of the e-book.
- the start and break points may be explicitly specified by the user.
- the display module 420 receives the entity-based e-book summary from the store server 1 10 and displays, or otherwise presents, the e-book summary to the user of the client device 170.
- the display module 420 may also present the text of the e-book and/or other information associated with the e-book. For example, the display module 420 may display a summary of an entity referenced in the identified portion of the e-book while simultaneously displaying pages of e-book text on which the entity is referenced.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a process for providing entity-based summarization of an e-book according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 5 attributes the steps of the process to the summary subsystem 120. However, some or all of the steps may be performed by other entities. In addition, some embodiments may perform the steps in parallel, perform the steps in different orders, or perform different steps.
- the summary subsystem 120 identifies 510 an e-book to be summarized.
- the summary subsystem 120 may identify an e-book to be summarized upon receiving a user request for a summary.
- the summary subsystem 120 may also identify the e-book to be summarized upon occurrence of another event, such as the e-book being added to the literature corpus 130, or a summary process being initiated upon multiple e-books in the corpus.
- the summary subsystem 120 determines 520 the type of the e-book to be summarized. Based on the metadata associated with the e-book, the summary subsystem 120 categorizes the e-book into one or more general type categories, e.g., fiction or non- fiction. The summary subsystem 120 may further categorize the e-book with specific categories within the general category (e.g., mystery, historical fiction). Alternatively, the summary subsystem 120 determines the type of the e-book by analyzing the text of the e-book.
- general type categories e.g., fiction or non- fiction.
- the summary subsystem 120 may further categorize the e-book with specific categories within the general category (e.g., mystery, historical fiction).
- the summary subsystem 120 determines the type of the e-book by analyzing the text of the e-book.
- the summary subsystem 120 also identifies 530 one or more external data sources based on the type of the e-book.
- the identified external data sources are ones that are likely to have information that help the summary subsystem 120 to identify entities referenced in the e-book.
- the summary subsystem 120 identifies 540 entities referenced in the text of the e-book and extracts information about the entities.
- the summary subsystem 120 may use one or more of a variety of techniques to identify the entities in the e-book text, including using information from the identified external data sources 160 associated with the e-book.
- the summary subsystem 120 receives a user request for the summary of a portion of an e-book.
- the user request identifies a range of an e-book for which the summary is requested.
- the range is defined by start and break points, such as the beginning of the e-book and the farthest point to which the user has read.
- the summary subsystem 120 dynamically generates 560 an entity -based summary of the e-book for the range specified in the user request.
- the summary describes the identified entities referenced in the specified range of the e-book.
- the summary subsystem 120 presents 570 the entity-based summary to the requesting user.
- the user can use the entity-based summary to refresh his or her recollection of the content of the e-book without risk of discovering information about the portions of the book he or she has not read.
