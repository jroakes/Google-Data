Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to offer placement in response to a search query by determining if the search query is specific to a merchant and providing offers specific to that merchant which are thereby more relevant to the search query.
- many online and other offer distributors receive offers from merchant systems, manufacturer systems, and other advertisers to be displayed or provided to a user based on user search queries.
- the offer distribution system may provide advertisements and other offers that are related to that search query. For example, if a user searches for “shoes,” a search engine function of the offer distribution system may provide search results for “shoes.”
- the offer distribution system provides offers to the user that are related to shoes. For example, the offers may specify a merchant that sells shoes and/or a product that the merchant sells related to shoes.
- conventional systems cannot accurately identify whether a search query is specific to a particular merchant.
- An offer distribution system receives and stores one or more offers from multiple merchants.
- the system receives a query comprising one or more terms input by a user.
- the one or more terms comprise a name associated with a particular merchant.
- the system first identifies the name of a merchant as a potential merchant name in the terms of the search query. Then, the system identifies one or more of the stored offers that are associated with merchants other than the potential merchant name and compares the name of the potential merchant with the identified offers.
- the system determines that the name of the potential merchant is a name associated with the particular merchant. The system then communicates to the user one or more offers that are associated with the particular merchant and are responsive to the search query, while excluding offers from other merchants.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system to provide merchant specific offers in response to a query, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to provide merchant specific offers in response to a query, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to receive and store offers from merchants, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example offer database, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- an offer distribution system receives a search query from a user.
- the offer distribution system identifies one or more of the search terms as a potential merchant name.
- the offer distribution system identifies stored offers that are not associated with the potential merchant name.
- the offer distribution system compares the potential merchant name from the query to terms of the identified offers and determines if the potential merchant name matches terms in any of the identified offers. If the query term that is identified as a potential merchant name appears in a number of offers that is below a configurable threshold, then the offer distribution system determines that the query term identified as a potential merchant name is likely to be a name of an actual merchant. In this case, the offer distribution system selects only offers from the actual merchant to present to the user in response to the query.
- the offer distribution system distributes offers to user computing devices based on search queries provided by the user. For example, if a user searches for one or more products, the offer distribution system provides sponsored results and other offers to the user computing device for display to the user. Merchants may compensate the offer distribution system for presenting the offers, based on factors such as a number of offers displayed on user computing devices, number of instances that a user clicks on or otherwise selects a provided offer, number of actions taken by a user that are related to the offer, or any other suitable factor.
- the offers created or submitted by the merchant may provide information with the offer that identifies the conditions required to redeem the offer, such as a specific product that must be purchased.
- the offers may provide a merchant name, a product name, an expiration date, and other suitable information.
- a manufacturer may represent an entity that manufacturers a product or a group of products under a brand.
- a merchant may represent an entity that markets or sells one or more products or brands of products to consumers.
- a manufacturer may produce a particular brand of shoes, while a merchant markets one or more brands of shoes, such as in a physical store, an online market, or in any suitable manner.
- Manufacturers and merchants operate manufacturing computing systems and merchant computing systems, respectively, to interact with the offer distribution system.
- the offer distribution system receives offers from one or more merchants, manufacturers, or other product or service suppliers.
- the term “product” shall include products and/or services.
- the offer distribution system stores the received offers in a database or other suitable memory of the offer distribution system.
- the offer distribution system associates details of the stored offers with potential query terms, such as keywords or key phrases.
- the offer distribution system may note that the offer pertains to categories, such as a particular product (for example, “shoes”), a particular brand (for example, “Elite Brand”), a discount amount (for example, “20% off”), a particular merchant name (for example, “Runner's Mart”), or any other suitable categories.
- the offers may be sorted and stored based on the merchant that provided the offers or with the merchant at which the offer is redeemable.
- the offer distribution system receives a search query from a user computing device.
- the query may be related to a product, a brand, a merchant, a manufacturer, or any combination of these terms or other terms.
- the offer distribution system analyzes the search query and determines if the search query includes the name of a merchant. The determination may be based on a comparison of the search query terms with a database of known merchant names. For example, in a search query of “Runner's Mart shoes and hats,” the offer distribution system may determine that “Runner's Mart” is a potential merchant system name based on an appearance of the phrase “Runner's Mart” in a database of known merchant names. Any other manner of determining that a search query term is a potential merchant name may be employed.
- the database of known merchant names may be created and stored by the offer distribution system.
- the database may include a list of merchant names that are associated with merchants that have provided offers to the offer distribution system.
- the database may be populated with merchant names based on data received from a web search or other data gathering techniques.
- the database may be insufficient for accurately determining if a potential merchant name is the name of an actual merchant without further applying the methods described herein.
- the database may include a listing of a merchant name that is also a product or a brand name.
- the database may include a merchant name that is also a descriptive word or other generic term.
- the offer distribution system compares the search query with the stored offers in the database of the offer distribution system.
- the offer distribution system removes offers associated with the potential merchant system name before the comparison. That is, the offer distribution system only compares the search query terms to offers associated with other merchants and not the potential merchant name identified from the search query.
- the offer distribution system determines that the term from the search query is most likely a product name, a brand or manufacturer name, a descriptive word, or other related term other than a merchant name. If the potential merchant name does not appear in any of the offers of the comparison, or only appears in a limited number of offers, then the offer distribution system determines that the potential merchant name is an actual merchant name being identified by the user.
- the offer distribution system may identify “Elite Shoes” as a potential merchant name because “Elite Shoes” may be categorized as a potential merchant and as a potential brand in the offer database.
- the offer distribution system removes offers associated with the potential merchant category of “Elite Shoes” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the offers in the database results in many offers for Elite Shoes from multiple merchants that also sell Elite Shoes. Thus, the offer distribution system determines that Elite Shoes is not an actual merchant name identified by the user, but is likely to be a brand, product, or a generic term.
- the offer distribution system may also identify “Runner's Mart” as a potential merchant name because “Runner's Mart” may be categorized as a potential merchant in the offer database.
- the offer distribution system removes offers associated with the potential merchant category of “Runner's Mart” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the other offers in the database does not result in any offers with the terms “Runner's Mart” (or results in only a limited number of matches below a specified amount). In this case, the offer distribution system determines that Runner's Mart is an actual merchant name identified by the user because the name appears in only the merchant category associated with that merchant (or appears in only a limited number of matches below the specified amount).
- the offer distribution system may provide one or a set of offers to the user computing device, with the offers being only from the merchant that was determined to be in the query. If the user entered a query that provided a merchant name, the offer distribution system determines that the user is likely to visit a physical or virtual location of that merchant. Thus, offers directed to the identified merchant would be of benefit to the merchant and the user.
- the offer distribution system dynamically provides offers to users that are more relevant and pertinent.
- the systems and methods described herein may be employed to allow primarily or exclusively offers from a particular merchant included in a search query to be presented to a user.
- the invention improves the offer results that may accompany the search query results.
- the offers are improved for the user in that the user receives more relevant offers.
- the offers are improved for the merchant in that offers are presented to users who are likely to patronize the merchant.
- the offers are improved for other merchants not cited in the query because offers from the other merchants are not presented to users that are likely to patronize the queried merchant and not the other merchants.
- the methods and systems described herein permit offers to be presented to users that are relevant, cost effective, accurate, and useful.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system 100 to provide merchant specific offers in response to a query, in accordance with certain example embodiments.

- events are stored with the date range for a merchant offer ID, a merchant name, details of the offer, the date range for which the offer is active, keywords in the offer, and a merchant category code for the merchant.
- the method 205 returns to block 210 of FIG. 2 .
- the offer distribution system 140 receives a search query from a user input into the user computing device 110 .
- the query may be related to a product, a brand, a merchant name, a manufacturer of a product, or any combination of these terms or other terms.
- the query may be entered into a search engine or other “search” box on a search engine page, a shopping page, an offer distribution page, or any other search engine function displayed via the communication application 112 of the user computing device 110 .
- the search query may be transmitted to the offer distribution system 140 from the user computing device 110 via a connection over the network 105 , including via email, text, or any other suitable communication technology.
- the offer distribution system 140 identifies a name of a potential merchant from the search query.
- the offer distribution system 140 analyzes the search query and determines if the search query includes the potential name of a merchant. The determination may be based on a comparison of the search query terms with a database of known merchant names.
- the database of known merchant systems may be created and stored by the offer distribution system 140 .
- the database may include a list of merchant names that are associated with merchant systems that have provided offers to the offer distribution system.
- the database is insufficient for accurately determining if a potential merchant name is the name of an actual merchant without further applying the methods described herein.
- the database may include a listing of a merchant name that is also a product or a brand name.
- the database may include a merchant name that is also a descriptive word or other generic term.
- the offer distribution system 140 may determine that “Runner's Mart” is a potential merchant name based on an appearance of the phrase “Runner's Mart” in a database of known merchant systems. The offer distribution system 140 may compare the search query terms to known merchant names in the database and identify a match. If a match exists, then the query term is identified as a potential name of a merchant.
- the determination may be based on any other factors analyzed by the offer distribution system 140 .
- the offer distribution system 140 may perform a search of one or more websites on the Internet to determine that the search query includes the name of a merchant.
- the offer distribution system 140 may analyze the categories of the offer database to determine the names of merchants that provided offers to the offer distribution system 140 . That is, if one or more offers are provided to the offer distribution system 140 by a merchant, then the name of the entity that provided the one or more offers may be identified as a potential name of a merchant.
- the offer distribution system 140 compares terms of the search query with the stored offers in the database from merchants other than the potential merchant name.
- the offer distribution system 140 removes offers associated with the potential merchant name before the comparison.
- the offer distribution system 140 only compares the search query terms to offers associated with other merchants and not the potential merchant name identified in the search query.
- the offer distribution system 140 may sort the offers in the database based on the merchant system that provided the offers or based on the merchant system name identified in a list of categories of offers.
- the offer distribution system 140 may select any or all of the offers except for the offers associated with the potential merchant name.
- the offer distribution system 140 performs a comparison of the search query terms with terms or other details of the selected offers to identify offers that match one or more of the search query terms, such as the name of the potential merchant. The comparison may be made to the entirety of the contents of the selected offers, to the keywords identified in the selected offers, to the titles of the selected offers, to the merchant name of the selected offers, or to any subset of the data associated with the selected offers.
- the offer distribution system 140 may determine that “coffee” is a potential merchant name because a group of offers exists from a merchant system 130 associated with a merchant having the name “Coffee.” The offer distribution system 140 removes the offers related to the merchant with the name “Coffee” and compares the search query to the remaining offers in the database. The term “coffee” in the example appears many times in the comparison because many of the other offers include the word “coffee.”
- the offer distribution system 140 determines that the term is not a specific merchant name, and may determine that the term is likely a product name, a brand or manufacturer name, or a descriptive term.
- the offer distribution system 140 determines that the term is a name of a particular merchant. This process is discussed in more detail with reference to block 220 .
- the offer distribution system 140 determines if the potential merchant name is associated with a number of offers below a threshold.
- a threshold number of offers may be 0, 1, 10, or 100.
- the threshold may be dependent on the total number of offers identified. For example, if a large number of offers are available, such as 5,000, then the threshold may be set to a higher number, such as 20. A lower number of total offers, such as 100, may allow the threshold to be set to a low number, such as 0, or 1, or 2. In a comparison with a large number of offers, a merchant name is more likely to randomly appear a larger number of times than in a comparison to a small number of offers.
- the threshold may be set or revised based on a history of thresholds and the results each threshold produces.
- the threshold may be input into the offer distribution system 140 by the operator or other party, or the threshold may be produced by an algorithm or other software function that determines an appropriate threshold based on the search query, the name of the potential merchant, the number of available offers, and other suitable factors.
- the threshold is zero, if only one offer has a term that matches the potential name of the merchant, then the number of matches is not equal to or less than the threshold.
- a lower threshold results in a higher likelihood that the potential merchant name is a particular merchant name.
- the operator of the offer distribution system 140 may configure the threshold at a level to generate a desired level of precision in identifying particular merchant names.
- the operator may set a lower threshold to generate a higher precision in identifying particular merchant names.
- the operator may set a lower threshold to generate a relatively lower precision in identifying particular merchant names.
- the operator may set a threshold anywhere between the low and high thresholds to generate a corresponding desired level of precision.
- the offer distribution system 140 may identify “Elite” as a potential merchant name because “Elite” may be categorized as both a merchant and a brand in the offer database.
- the offer distribution system 140 removes offers associated with the merchant category of “Elite” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the other offers in the database results in many offers for Elite shoes from multiple merchants. Thus, the offer distribution system 140 determines that Elite is not an actual merchant system identified by the user, but is instead a likely brand or product. or descriptive term
- the offer distribution system may identify “Runner's Mart” as a potential merchant name because “Runner's Mart” may be categorized as a merchant name in the offer database.
- the offer distribution system 140 removes offers associated with the merchant category of “Runner's Mart” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the other offers in the database does not result in any offers matching Runner's Mart (or results in a match of a number of offers below the set threshold). Thus, the offer distribution system 140 determines that Runner's Mart is an actual merchant name identified by the user 101 .
- the method 200 proceeds to block 225 .
- the offer distribution system 140 proceeds with presentation of offers related to the query terms without regard to a particular merchant system name.
- the offer distribution system 140 may present the offers based on a ranking of the relatedness of each offer with the query search terms. For example, if a greater number of the query search terms are associated with offer 1 than with offer 2 , the offer distribution system 140 may rank offer 1 as being more related and present offer 1 as a higher ranked offer.
- the offers may be communicated by the offer distribution system 140 to the user computing device 110 for presentation to the user 101 via the user computing device 110 in any suitable manner.
- the offers may be a list of offers on a webpage showing the results of the search.
- the offers may be a pop-up advertisement or a banner advertisement.
- the offers may be emailed to the user computing device 110 , texted to the user computing device 110 , or transmitted in any suitable manner.
- the offers are associated with an offer account of the user 101 that is managed by the offer distribution system 140 , the merchant system 130 , or any other suitable offer management system.
- the offer distribution system 140 determines that the query term for the potential merchant name is related to a name of the particular merchant. In an example, if the offer distribution system 140 determines that the query phrase “Runner's Mart” is matched with a number of other offers equal to or below the threshold, then the offer distribution system 140 determines that the phrase “Runner's Mart” is likely to be a name of a merchant. Conversely, the query phrase “Elite” may be repeated in a number of offers from many different merchant systems or manufacturers that is greater than the threshold. In this case, the offer distribution system 140 determines that it is unlikely that “Elite” is a name of a merchant system 130 .
- the offer distribution system 140 upon determining that a name of a merchant is provided in the query, the offer distribution system 140 provides a set of offers to the user computing device 110 , where the offers are only from the merchant that was determined to be in the query. If the user 101 entered a query that provided a merchant name, the offer distribution system 140 determines that the user 101 would be likely to visit a physical or virtual location of that merchant system 130 . Thus, offers directed to the identified merchant would be of benefit to the merchant system 130 and to the user 101 .
- the offer distribution system 140 identifies other offers related to Runner's Mart. For example, in addition to an offer for Elite shoes at Runner's Mart, the offer module 146 may provide other offers from Runner's Mart to the user computing device 110 . For instance, other offers for other products related to Runner's Mart are provided. The other offers may be associated with Elite shoes, such as socks, or merely related to Runner's Mart.
- a user 101 that searches for a brand such as “Elite shoes” likely intends to purchase Elite shoes in the near future.
- This user 101 would likely enjoy offers from many merchant systems as the user decides where to shop for the shoes.
- a user 101 that searches for “Elite shoes at Runner's Mart” is likely intending to shop at Runner's Mart.
- the user 101 likely would only specify a particular merchant if the user 101 intended to patronize that particular merchant. If the user 101 is likely to shop at Runner's Mart, then it would be more productive for the offer distribution system 140 to provide offers related to Runner's Mart, even if those offers are not related to Elite shoes, than to provide offers for other merchant systems that are related to Elite shoes.
- the database 400 is compared to a search query for “Joe's Golf Johnson Irons putters.”
- the offer distribution system 140 determines from a comparison to a database of merchant systems that Joe's Golf is likely to be a merchant system 130 .
- the offer distribution system 140 removes offers related to Joe's Golf from the list of offers for the comparison.
- the search term Joe's Golf is compared to the remaining offers.
- the threshold number of matches is set at 1.
- the term “Joe's Golf” is determined, based on the comparison, not to match any terms in the list of offers.
- the term “Joe's Golf” is determined to be a name of a merchant system 130 . Therefore, Joe's Golf is determined to be the merchant system 130 that is associated with the search query of the user 101 .
- a similar process for the terms “Johnson Irons” and “putters” would determine that these terms are not the name of a merchant.
- the offer distribution system 140 presents the offers from the merchant that are related to the query terms to the user computing device 110 .
- the offer distribution system 140 may provide a set of offers to the user only from the merchant that was provided in the query.
- the offers may be presented to the user 101 on the user computing device 110 in any suitable manner.
- the offers may be a list of offers on a webpage showing the results of the search.
- the offers may be a pop-up advertisement or a banner advertisement.
- the offers may be emailed to the user computing device 110 , texted to the user computing device 110 , or transmitted in any suitable manner.
- the offers are associated with an offer account of the user 101 that is managed by the offer module 146 , the merchant system 130 , or any other suitable offer management system and accessed by the user 101 via the digital wallet application 111 .
- the offer distribution system 140 may present search results separate from the presentation of the offers. For example, while the offer distribution system 140 is performing the method 200 , the offer distribution system 140 may be concurrently performing a search function based on the search query.
- the offer distribution system 140 may provide a search results document for the query based on a search of the Internet, a designated search location, such as a shopping database, or any other search engine designation. For example, if a user 101 enters a search query for Elite shoes, the search results may present webpages related to Elite shoes, shoes, or other related items.
- the described method 200 results in significantly improved identification of merchant names in a search query.
- An identification of a merchant based on a simple comparison to a database or a search of the Internet results in an accurate identification of a particular merchant name in only approximately 13% of the attempts.
- an identification of a merchant based on the methods and systems described herein results in an accurate identification of a particular merchant name in over 90% of the attempts.
- the significantly improved accuracy of the results indicates the effectiveness of the methods and systems described herein in identifying a particular merchant system 130 from a search term included in a search query.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates to offer placement in response to a search query by determining if the search query is specific to a merchant and providing offers specific to that merchant which are thereby more relevant to the search query.
- In conventional systems, many online and other offer distributors receive offers from merchant systems, manufacturer systems, and other advertisers to be displayed or provided to a user based on user search queries. When a user searches for a product, the offer distribution system may provide advertisements and other offers that are related to that search query. For example, if a user searches for “shoes,” a search engine function of the offer distribution system may provide search results for “shoes.” In addition to the search results, the offer distribution system provides offers to the user that are related to shoes. For example, the offers may specify a merchant that sells shoes and/or a product that the merchant sells related to shoes. However, conventional systems cannot accurately identify whether a search query is specific to a particular merchant.
- Techniques herein provide computer-implemented methods to provide merchant-specific offers based on a search query. An offer distribution system receives and stores one or more offers from multiple merchants. The system receives a query comprising one or more terms input by a user. The one or more terms comprise a name associated with a particular merchant. To determine that the name is associated with the particular merchant, the system first identifies the name of a merchant as a potential merchant name in the terms of the search query. Then, the system identifies one or more of the stored offers that are associated with merchants other than the potential merchant name and compares the name of the potential merchant with the identified offers. If the name of the potential merchant does not match any terms in the offers associated with the other merchants (or matches terms in less than a configurable number of offers), then the system determines that the name of the potential merchant is a name associated with the particular merchant. The system then communicates to the user one or more offers that are associated with the particular merchant and are responsive to the search query, while excluding offers from other merchants.
- In certain other example aspects described herein, systems and computer program products to provide offers based on a search query are provided.
- These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system to provide merchant specific offers in response to a query, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to provide merchant specific offers in response to a query, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to receive and store offers from merchants, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example offer database, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - In an example embodiment, an offer distribution system receives a search query from a user. The offer distribution system identifies one or more of the search terms as a potential merchant name. The offer distribution system identifies stored offers that are not associated with the potential merchant name. The offer distribution system then compares the potential merchant name from the query to terms of the identified offers and determines if the potential merchant name matches terms in any of the identified offers. If the query term that is identified as a potential merchant name appears in a number of offers that is below a configurable threshold, then the offer distribution system determines that the query term identified as a potential merchant name is likely to be a name of an actual merchant. In this case, the offer distribution system selects only offers from the actual merchant to present to the user in response to the query.
- The offer distribution system distributes offers to user computing devices based on search queries provided by the user. For example, if a user searches for one or more products, the offer distribution system provides sponsored results and other offers to the user computing device for display to the user. Merchants may compensate the offer distribution system for presenting the offers, based on factors such as a number of offers displayed on user computing devices, number of instances that a user clicks on or otherwise selects a provided offer, number of actions taken by a user that are related to the offer, or any other suitable factor. The offers created or submitted by the merchant may provide information with the offer that identifies the conditions required to redeem the offer, such as a specific product that must be purchased. The offers may provide a merchant name, a product name, an expiration date, and other suitable information.
- In example embodiments, a manufacturer may represent an entity that manufacturers a product or a group of products under a brand. A merchant may represent an entity that markets or sells one or more products or brands of products to consumers. In an example, a manufacturer may produce a particular brand of shoes, while a merchant markets one or more brands of shoes, such as in a physical store, an online market, or in any suitable manner. Manufacturers and merchants operate manufacturing computing systems and merchant computing systems, respectively, to interact with the offer distribution system.
- In an example embodiment, the offer distribution system receives offers from one or more merchants, manufacturers, or other product or service suppliers. Throughout this specification, the term “product” shall include products and/or services. The offer distribution system stores the received offers in a database or other suitable memory of the offer distribution system. The offer distribution system associates details of the stored offers with potential query terms, such as keywords or key phrases. For example, the offer distribution system may note that the offer pertains to categories, such as a particular product (for example, “shoes”), a particular brand (for example, “Elite Brand”), a discount amount (for example, “20% off”), a particular merchant name (for example, “Runner's Mart”), or any other suitable categories. The offers may be sorted and stored based on the merchant that provided the offers or with the merchant at which the offer is redeemable.
- The offer distribution system receives a search query from a user computing device. The query may be related to a product, a brand, a merchant, a manufacturer, or any combination of these terms or other terms. The offer distribution system analyzes the search query and determines if the search query includes the name of a merchant. The determination may be based on a comparison of the search query terms with a database of known merchant names. For example, in a search query of “Runner's Mart shoes and hats,” the offer distribution system may determine that “Runner's Mart” is a potential merchant system name based on an appearance of the phrase “Runner's Mart” in a database of known merchant names. Any other manner of determining that a search query term is a potential merchant name may be employed.
- In an example embodiment, the database of known merchant names may be created and stored by the offer distribution system. The database may include a list of merchant names that are associated with merchants that have provided offers to the offer distribution system. Alternatively, the database may be populated with merchant names based on data received from a web search or other data gathering techniques. The database may be insufficient for accurately determining if a potential merchant name is the name of an actual merchant without further applying the methods described herein. For example, the database may include a listing of a merchant name that is also a product or a brand name. In another example, the database may include a merchant name that is also a descriptive word or other generic term.
- The offer distribution system compares the search query with the stored offers in the database of the offer distribution system. The offer distribution system removes offers associated with the potential merchant system name before the comparison. That is, the offer distribution system only compares the search query terms to offers associated with other merchants and not the potential merchant name identified from the search query.
- If the potential merchant name is included in the offers of the comparison, then the offer distribution system determines that the term from the search query is most likely a product name, a brand or manufacturer name, a descriptive word, or other related term other than a merchant name. If the potential merchant name does not appear in any of the offers of the comparison, or only appears in a limited number of offers, then the offer distribution system determines that the potential merchant name is an actual merchant name being identified by the user.
- For example, if a user provides a query with terms describing a brand such as “Elite Shoes,” then the offer distribution system may identify “Elite Shoes” as a potential merchant name because “Elite Shoes” may be categorized as a potential merchant and as a potential brand in the offer database. The offer distribution system removes offers associated with the potential merchant category of “Elite Shoes” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the offers in the database results in many offers for Elite Shoes from multiple merchants that also sell Elite Shoes. Thus, the offer distribution system determines that Elite Shoes is not an actual merchant name identified by the user, but is likely to be a brand, product, or a generic term.
- Alternatively, if a user provides a query with the terms “Elite Shoes from Runner's Mart,” then the offer distribution system may also identify “Runner's Mart” as a potential merchant name because “Runner's Mart” may be categorized as a potential merchant in the offer database. The offer distribution system removes offers associated with the potential merchant category of “Runner's Mart” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the other offers in the database does not result in any offers with the terms “Runner's Mart” (or results in only a limited number of matches below a specified amount). In this case, the offer distribution system determines that Runner's Mart is an actual merchant name identified by the user because the name appears in only the merchant category associated with that merchant (or appears in only a limited number of matches below the specified amount).
- Upon determining that a merchant name is provided in the query, the offer distribution system may provide one or a set of offers to the user computing device, with the offers being only from the merchant that was determined to be in the query. If the user entered a query that provided a merchant name, the offer distribution system determines that the user is likely to visit a physical or virtual location of that merchant. Thus, offers directed to the identified merchant would be of benefit to the merchant and the user.
- By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, the offer distribution system dynamically provides offers to users that are more relevant and pertinent. As such, the systems and methods described herein may be employed to allow primarily or exclusively offers from a particular merchant included in a search query to be presented to a user. For example, when a user inputs a query that includes a particular merchant name, the invention improves the offer results that may accompany the search query results. The offers are improved for the user in that the user receives more relevant offers. The offers are improved for the merchant in that offers are presented to users who are likely to patronize the merchant. The offers are improved for other merchants not cited in the query because offers from the other merchants are not presented to users that are likely to patronize the queried merchant and not the other merchants. Hence, the methods and systems described herein permit offers to be presented to users that are relevant, cost effective, accurate, and useful.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.

For example, auser computing device 110 embodied as a mobile phone or handheld computer may not include all of the components described above. - In example embodiments, the network computing devices and any other computing machines associated with the technology presented herein may be any type of computing machine such as, but not limited to, those discussed in more detail with respect to
FIG. 5 . Furthermore, any functions, applications, or modules associated with any of these computing machines, such as those described herein or any others (for example, scripts, web content, software, firmware, or hardware) associated with the technology presented herein may by any of the modules discussed in more detail with respect toFIG. 5 . The computing machines discussed herein may communicate with one another, as well as with other computing machines or communication systems over one or more networks, such asnetwork 105. Thenetwork 105 may include any type of data or communications network, including any of the network technology discussed with respect toFIG. 5 . - The example methods illustrated in
FIGS. 2-3 are described hereinafter with respect to the components of theexample operating environment 100. The example methods ofFIG. 2-3 may also be performed with other systems and in other environments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 200 to provide merchant specific offers in response to a query, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - With reference to
FIGS. 1 and 2 , inblock 205, theoffer distribution system 140 receives and stores offers from the merchant system 130 and other merchant systems. The details ofblock 205 are described in greater detail with respect tomethod 205 ofFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 205 to receive and store offers from merchant systems, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - In
block 305, theoffer distribution system 140 receives offers from the merchant system 130 and other merchant systems. The merchant system 130 may be a particular one of a plurality of merchant systems. For example, the merchant system 130 may be one of a group of merchant systems that provide offers to the offer distribution system. Other merchant systems may provide offers to theoffer distribution system 140 in addition to the particular merchant system 130. - The
offer distribution system 140 receives offers from the merchant system 130 and other merchant systems via connections over thenetwork 105, email, text, or via any suitable communication technology. In another example, theoffer distribution system 140 designs and produces the offers based on conditions, terms, requests, and other desires of the merchant system 130. In an example, the offer may be an email offer to auser 101. In another example, the offer is a location-based alert or an offer to a mobileuser computing device 110. In another example, the offer is an offer to be presented on a webpage, such as a pop-up advertisement or a banner advertisement. The offer may be presentable to auser computing device 110 in any suitable format. The offers may be any form of coupon, advertisement, rebate, or other suitable offer. - In operation, the
offer distribution system 140 distributes offers touser computing devices 110 based on search queries provided by theuser 101. For example, if auser 101 searches for one or more products, theoffer distribution system 140 provides sponsored results and other offers to theuser computing device 110 for display to theuser 101. The merchant systems may compensate theoffer distribution system 140 for displaying the offers based on factors such as a number of offers displayed onuser computing devices 110, a number of instances that auser 101 clicks on or otherwise selects a provided offer, a number of actions taken by auser 101 that are related to the offer, or any other suitable factor. The offers created or submitted by the merchant systems may provide information with the offer that identifies the conditions required to redeem the offer, such as a specific product that must be purchased. The offers may provide a merchant name, a product name, an expiration date, and other suitable information for each particular offer. - In
block 310, theoffer distribution system 140 stores the received offers in a database of thedata storage unit 147. The offers may be stored in categories related to the offers, such as by the name of the merchant associated with the merchant system 130 or other merchant systems, the type of discount or reward offered, the merchant category code of the merchant system 130, the type of product associated with the offer, the expiration date of the offer, or any other suitable category. - In
block 315, theoffer distribution system 140 associates offer details with potential query items, such as keywords. For example, a merchant associated with the merchant system 130, such as “Runner's Mart,” may provide an offer for a particular shoe brand. The offer may have details such as “20% off,” “Runner's Mart,” “Elite” brand, “Expiration—December 31,” and other details. Theoffer distribution system 140 may store the received offer in the database and associate categories with the database keywords, key phrases, merchant system names (such as “Runner's Mart”), shoe brand names (such as “Elite”), and other suitable details. - Offers may be categorized based on the merchant system 130 that provides the offers. For example, if Runner's Mart provides one or more offers to the
offer distribution system 140, then the one or more offers may be stored in a category associated with the Runner's Mart name. - An example illustration of an
example database 400 for storing offer details is shown inFIG. 4 . In the example database, events are stored with the date range for a merchant offer ID, a merchant name, details of the offer, the date range for which the offer is active, keywords in the offer, and a merchant category code for the merchant. - Returning to
FIG. 3 , fromblock 315, themethod 205 returns to block 210 ofFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 210, theoffer distribution system 140 receives a search query from a user input into theuser computing device 110. The query may be related to a product, a brand, a merchant name, a manufacturer of a product, or any combination of these terms or other terms. The query may be entered into a search engine or other “search” box on a search engine page, a shopping page, an offer distribution page, or any other search engine function displayed via thecommunication application 112 of theuser computing device 110. The search query may be transmitted to theoffer distribution system 140 from theuser computing device 110 via a connection over thenetwork 105, including via email, text, or any other suitable communication technology. - In
block 215, theoffer distribution system 140 identifies a name of a potential merchant from the search query. Theoffer distribution system 140 analyzes the search query and determines if the search query includes the potential name of a merchant. The determination may be based on a comparison of the search query terms with a database of known merchant names. - The database of known merchant systems may be created and stored by the
offer distribution system 140. The database may include a list of merchant names that are associated with merchant systems that have provided offers to the offer distribution system. The database is insufficient for accurately determining if a potential merchant name is the name of an actual merchant without further applying the methods described herein. For example, the database may include a listing of a merchant name that is also a product or a brand name. In another example, the database may include a merchant name that is also a descriptive word or other generic term. - For example, in a search query of “Runner's Mart shoes and hats,” the
offer distribution system 140 may determine that “Runner's Mart” is a potential merchant name based on an appearance of the phrase “Runner's Mart” in a database of known merchant systems. Theoffer distribution system 140 may compare the search query terms to known merchant names in the database and identify a match. If a match exists, then the query term is identified as a potential name of a merchant. - The determination may be based on any other factors analyzed by the
offer distribution system 140. For example, theoffer distribution system 140 may perform a search of one or more websites on the Internet to determine that the search query includes the name of a merchant. In another example, theoffer distribution system 140 may analyze the categories of the offer database to determine the names of merchants that provided offers to theoffer distribution system 140. That is, if one or more offers are provided to theoffer distribution system 140 by a merchant, then the name of the entity that provided the one or more offers may be identified as a potential name of a merchant. - In
block 218, theoffer distribution system 140 compares terms of the search query with the stored offers in the database from merchants other than the potential merchant name. Theoffer distribution system 140 removes offers associated with the potential merchant name before the comparison. - That is, the
offer distribution system 140 only compares the search query terms to offers associated with other merchants and not the potential merchant name identified in the search query. Theoffer distribution system 140 may sort the offers in the database based on the merchant system that provided the offers or based on the merchant system name identified in a list of categories of offers. Theoffer distribution system 140 may select any or all of the offers except for the offers associated with the potential merchant name. Theoffer distribution system 140 performs a comparison of the search query terms with terms or other details of the selected offers to identify offers that match one or more of the search query terms, such as the name of the potential merchant. The comparison may be made to the entirety of the contents of the selected offers, to the keywords identified in the selected offers, to the titles of the selected offers, to the merchant name of the selected offers, or to any subset of the data associated with the selected offers. - In an example, if a search query includes the term “coffee,” the
offer distribution system 140 may determine that “coffee” is a potential merchant name because a group of offers exists from a merchant system 130 associated with a merchant having the name “Coffee.” Theoffer distribution system 140 removes the offers related to the merchant with the name “Coffee” and compares the search query to the remaining offers in the database. The term “coffee” in the example appears many times in the comparison because many of the other offers include the word “coffee.” - If the potential merchant name is repeated in the offers in the comparison, then the
offer distribution system 140 determines that the term is not a specific merchant name, and may determine that the term is likely a product name, a brand or manufacturer name, or a descriptive term. - If the potential merchant name does not appear in any of the offers of the comparison, or only appears in a limited number of offers, then the
offer distribution system 140 determines that the term is a name of a particular merchant. This process is discussed in more detail with reference to block 220. - In
block 220, theoffer distribution system 140 determines if the potential merchant name is associated with a number of offers below a threshold. In an example, an operator or other party configures theoffer distribution system 140 with a threshold number of offers to use in the determination to determine if the potential merchant name is for a particular merchant. For example, the threshold for a number of offers may be 0, 1, 10, or 100. The threshold may be dependent on the total number of offers identified. For example, if a large number of offers are available, such as 5,000, then the threshold may be set to a higher number, such as 20. A lower number of total offers, such as 100, may allow the threshold to be set to a low number, such as 0, or 1, or 2. In a comparison with a large number of offers, a merchant name is more likely to randomly appear a larger number of times than in a comparison to a small number of offers. - The threshold may be set or revised based on a history of thresholds and the results each threshold produces. The threshold may be input into the
offer distribution system 140 by the operator or other party, or the threshold may be produced by an algorithm or other software function that determines an appropriate threshold based on the search query, the name of the potential merchant, the number of available offers, and other suitable factors. - In an example where the threshold is zero, if only one offer has a term that matches the potential name of the merchant, then the number of matches is not equal to or less than the threshold.
- A lower threshold results in a higher likelihood that the potential merchant name is a particular merchant name. Thus, the operator of the
offer distribution system 140 may configure the threshold at a level to generate a desired level of precision in identifying particular merchant names. The operator may set a lower threshold to generate a higher precision in identifying particular merchant names. Alternatively, the operator may set a lower threshold to generate a relatively lower precision in identifying particular merchant names. And, the operator may set a threshold anywhere between the low and high thresholds to generate a corresponding desired level of precision. - In an example, if a
user 101 provides a query with the terms “Elite shoes,” theoffer distribution system 140 may identify “Elite” as a potential merchant name because “Elite” may be categorized as both a merchant and a brand in the offer database. Theoffer distribution system 140 removes offers associated with the merchant category of “Elite” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the other offers in the database results in many offers for Elite shoes from multiple merchants. Thus, theoffer distribution system 140 determines that Elite is not an actual merchant system identified by the user, but is instead a likely brand or product. or descriptive term - Alternatively, if a
user 101 provides a query with the terms “Elite shoes from Runner's Mart,” then the offer distribution system may identify “Runner's Mart” as a potential merchant name because “Runner's Mart” may be categorized as a merchant name in the offer database. Theoffer distribution system 140 removes offers associated with the merchant category of “Runner's Mart” and compares the search query with other offers from the database. The comparison to the other offers in the database does not result in any offers matching Runner's Mart (or results in a match of a number of offers below the set threshold). Thus, theoffer distribution system 140 determines that Runner's Mart is an actual merchant name identified by theuser 101. - In
block 220, if the comparison does not result in a number of matches equal to or below the threshold, then themethod 200 proceeds to block 225. Inblock 225, theoffer distribution system 140 proceeds with presentation of offers related to the query terms without regard to a particular merchant system name. Theoffer distribution system 140 may present the offers based on a ranking of the relatedness of each offer with the query search terms. For example, if a greater number of the query search terms are associated with offer 1 than with offer 2, theoffer distribution system 140 may rank offer 1 as being more related and present offer 1 as a higher ranked offer. - The offers may be communicated by the
offer distribution system 140 to theuser computing device 110 for presentation to theuser 101 via theuser computing device 110 in any suitable manner. For example, the offers may be a list of offers on a webpage showing the results of the search. In another example, the offers may be a pop-up advertisement or a banner advertisement. In another example, the offers may be emailed to theuser computing device 110, texted to theuser computing device 110, or transmitted in any suitable manner. In another example, the offers are associated with an offer account of theuser 101 that is managed by theoffer distribution system 140, the merchant system 130, or any other suitable offer management system. - Returning to block 220, if the comparison results in a number of matches equal to or below the threshold, the
method 200 proceeds to block 230. - In
block 230, theoffer distribution system 140 determines that the query term for the potential merchant name is related to a name of the particular merchant. In an example, if theoffer distribution system 140 determines that the query phrase “Runner's Mart” is matched with a number of other offers equal to or below the threshold, then theoffer distribution system 140 determines that the phrase “Runner's Mart” is likely to be a name of a merchant. Conversely, the query phrase “Elite” may be repeated in a number of offers from many different merchant systems or manufacturers that is greater than the threshold. In this case, theoffer distribution system 140 determines that it is unlikely that “Elite” is a name of a merchant system 130. - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 235, upon determining that a name of a merchant is provided in the query, theoffer distribution system 140 provides a set of offers to theuser computing device 110, where the offers are only from the merchant that was determined to be in the query. If theuser 101 entered a query that provided a merchant name, theoffer distribution system 140 determines that theuser 101 would be likely to visit a physical or virtual location of that merchant system 130. Thus, offers directed to the identified merchant would be of benefit to the merchant system 130 and to theuser 101. - In an example, if Runner's Mart is determined to be a merchant name in the search query, then the
offer distribution system 140 identifies other offers related to Runner's Mart. For example, in addition to an offer for Elite shoes at Runner's Mart, the offer module 146 may provide other offers from Runner's Mart to theuser computing device 110. For instance, other offers for other products related to Runner's Mart are provided. The other offers may be associated with Elite shoes, such as socks, or merely related to Runner's Mart. - In the example, a
user 101 that searches for a brand, such as “Elite shoes” likely intends to purchase Elite shoes in the near future. Thisuser 101 would likely enjoy offers from many merchant systems as the user decides where to shop for the shoes. However, auser 101 that searches for “Elite shoes at Runner's Mart” is likely intending to shop at Runner's Mart. Theuser 101 likely would only specify a particular merchant if theuser 101 intended to patronize that particular merchant. If theuser 101 is likely to shop at Runner's Mart, then it would be more productive for theoffer distribution system 140 to provide offers related to Runner's Mart, even if those offers are not related to Elite shoes, than to provide offers for other merchant systems that are related to Elite shoes. - Returning to the
example database 400 ofFIG. 4 , thedatabase 400 is compared to a search query for “Joe's Golf Johnson Irons putters.” Theoffer distribution system 140 determines from a comparison to a database of merchant systems that Joe's Golf is likely to be a merchant system 130. Theoffer distribution system 140 removes offers related to Joe's Golf from the list of offers for the comparison. The search term Joe's Golf is compared to the remaining offers. In the example, the threshold number of matches is set at 1. The term “Joe's Golf” is determined, based on the comparison, not to match any terms in the list of offers. Thus, the term “Joe's Golf” is determined to be a name of a merchant system 130. Therefore, Joe's Golf is determined to be the merchant system 130 that is associated with the search query of theuser 101. A similar process for the terms “Johnson Irons” and “putters” would determine that these terms are not the name of a merchant. - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 240, theoffer distribution system 140 presents the offers from the merchant that are related to the query terms to theuser computing device 110. Upon determining that a merchant name is included in the query, theoffer distribution system 140 may provide a set of offers to the user only from the merchant that was provided in the query. The offers may be presented to theuser 101 on theuser computing device 110 in any suitable manner. For example, the offers may be a list of offers on a webpage showing the results of the search. In another example, the offers may be a pop-up advertisement or a banner advertisement. In another example, the offers may be emailed to theuser computing device 110, texted to theuser computing device 110, or transmitted in any suitable manner. In another example, the offers are associated with an offer account of theuser 101 that is managed by the offer module 146, the merchant system 130, or any other suitable offer management system and accessed by theuser 101 via thedigital wallet application 111. - In certain examples, the
offer distribution system 140 may present search results separate from the presentation of the offers. For example, while theoffer distribution system 140 is performing themethod 200, theoffer distribution system 140 may be concurrently performing a search function based on the search query. Theoffer distribution system 140 may provide a search results document for the query based on a search of the Internet, a designated search location, such as a shopping database, or any other search engine designation. For example, if auser 101 enters a search query for Elite shoes, the search results may present webpages related to Elite shoes, shoes, or other related items. - In practice, the described
method 200 results in significantly improved identification of merchant names in a search query. An identification of a merchant based on a simple comparison to a database or a search of the Internet results in an accurate identification of a particular merchant name in only approximately 13% of the attempts. Conversely, an identification of a merchant based on the methods and systems described herein results in an accurate identification of a particular merchant name in over 90% of the attempts. The significantly improved accuracy of the results indicates the effectiveness of the methods and systems described herein in identifying a particular merchant system 130 from a search term included in a search query. -
