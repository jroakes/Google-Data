- Four symbol time periods (401, 402, 403, 404) are shown with time period (401) occupied by a first signal having a first frequency (405), preferably +2400 Hz, representative of a first symbol.
- time period (402) is occupied by a second signal having a second frequency (407), preferably +800 Hz, representative of a second symbol.

- the output (202) with baseband signal (400) is coupled to a sampler (203) where the baseband signal, both the in phase (I) (413) or real and quadrature (Q) (415) or imaginary components is sampled or converted to a digital signal at the sampling rate of 20,000 times per second.
- Each sample of the I and Q component is converted by an analog to digital converter (not specifically shown) to a 16 bit digital word.
- 50 samples are taken during each symbol time period shown in FIG. 4, thus 50 digital words are generated, or 25 samples for each period in the alternative 1600 bps embodiment.
- the digital words as sampled digital data x i (n), x q (n), are coupled, at output (208), to a frequency acquisition, timing acquisition, and symbol detection (FATASD) block (FATASD) block 218, the output of which is coupled to a decoder 213 for producing a decoded data message at an output 215.

- This receiver is preferably implemented as a signal processor, such as general purpose DSP but may be fashioned from a dedicated integrated circuit or several such dedicated ICs arranged for, in order, acquiring the transmission frequency, acquiring the symbol timing, and detecting or determining symbols within the received signal.
- the input to the FATASD block or the signal samples are coupled to a frequency detector or acquisition block (205), a timing detector or acquisition block (206), and a symbol detector (209).
- the frequency detector (205) is arranged to process a first portion of the signal to provide a frequency error at output (207) as explained further below. This frequency error or reference is coupled to timing detector (206) and symbol detector (209).
- the timing detector (206) is responsive to the frequency error and arranged to process a second portion of the signal to provide a timing error or timing reference at output (212) as further explained below.
- This timing error or reference is coupled to symbol detector (209).
- the symbol detector 209 is responsive to the frequency error and the timing error and arranged to process a symbol portion of the signal to provide a series of detected symbols.
- the symbol detector (209) further comprises a signal processor (210) coupled to a maximum DTFT block 211 that operates preferably as a comparator, as well understood, to select the largest magnitude DTFT from among four DTFTs provided by the signal processor 210.
- the maximum DTFT block 211 provides a series of symbols, one for each symbol time period, or digital representations thereof to the decoder 213. It will be appreciated that, alternatively, the functions of the maximum DTFT block 211 can be performed by the signal processor 210 instead.
- the decoder 213 then decodes the symbols in accordance with whatever over the air protocol is used, as is well understood in the art, into a data or binary stream at the output 215. As the details of the over the air protocol and decoding are well understood in general and not further relevant to this disclosure no further space will be devoted to them.

In the preferred protocol this first portion or five symbols is silent carrier and does not have modulation. It is understood that any predetermined modulation pattern may be used for this first portion or frequency acquisition segment.
- timing acquisition segment 604 Following the frequency acquisition segment 602 is a timing acquisition segment 604 comprising preferably four alternating symbols of +2400 Hz, -2400 Hz, +2400, and -2400 Hz deviation.

Again any predetermined pattern of symbols may be used for the second portion or timing acquisition segment so long as the expected time for change is known.
- Frequency acquisition is the first step of the message recovery and timing detection is the second step. If frequency or timing acquisition or detection fails, no matter how sophisticated symbol recovery is, the whole packet fails. Therefore the frequency and timing detectors or acquisition should be designed to be very robust. For practical applications these acquisition functions should also require a reasonable processing power. The preferred acquisition techniques described herein below satisfies all these criteria.

- This frequency error in practical receiver, amounts to a frequency translation of the symbol frequencies, such as depicted in FIG. 4. Hypothetically, if the frequency error was 500 Hz, the symbols, depicted in FIG. 4 would be demodulated or recovered as a +2900 Hz, +1300 Hz, -1900 Hz, and -300 Hz signal in, respectively, symbol times (401 402, 403, 404).

- this acquisition phase is set to operate during a silent carrier portion of the signal and this range is +/-1000 Hz or a 1000 Hz possible frequency error.
- DTFTs are preferably calculated or determined as described below with reference to the symbol detector. In any event this frequency error is coupled to the timing detector (206) and the symbol detector (209) at output (207) and used as further explained below in the process of timing acquisition or detection and symbol detection or selection.

- the timing synchronization pattern depicted comprises four symbols arranged in a pattern corresponding to +2400 Hz, -2400 Hz, +2400 Hz, and -2400 Hz.
- the timing detector preferably correlates only the first three symbols to provide an estimate of the timing error.
- the timing detector calculates a correlation or cross-correlation between the received signal x(n) whose carrier error has been corrected, more particularly a sequence of symbol samples, specifically a sequence of samples corresponding to a predetermined number, preferably three, of symbols plus a number of samples equal to the correlation length, here 13, and a known timing acquisition pattern a(n), more particularly a predetermined sequence of symbol samples representative of the same number of symbols.
- the cross-correlation is performed by a signal processor, such as DSP but alternatively a dedicated IC, operating as a recursive structure and using a fast, recursive technique, as described further herein below.
- the timing detector 206 preferably locates or selects the peak or largest magnitude of the cross-correlations or the largest of the correlated magnitudes. This selected correlated magnitude is associated with a number of sample periods ( ⁇ n) and this corresponds to the timing error in terms of number of sample periods.

- the B output is proportional to a combination of a current B difference, from step 1009, and a first previous B output weighted or multiplied by a sinusoidal function, less a second previous B output.
- the sinusoidal function is, preferably, 2cos ⁇ , where the argument of the sinusoidal function corresponds to a second symbol frequency, preferably -2400 HZ.
- Step 1012 provides the last N R results from step 1011 to step 1013
- steps 1005 through step 1011 are or may be dealing with complex samples and must be performed for both the real and the imaginary components of the samples.
- Step 1013 combines, for each of the N R inputs from steps 1008 and 1012, sinusoidally weighted versions of the A and first previous A outputs and the first previous B outputs to provide a plurality of correlation magnitudes each corresponding to a number of samples spaced from the present receivers time reference.
- Step 1013 compares these N R correlation magnitudes and selects the largest such magnitude.
- the timing error, ⁇ n, corresponding to this largest magnitude is selected and step 1019 provides this ⁇ n to, preferably, the symbol detector (209) where step 1021 depicts a timing reference being adjusted.
- ⁇ n can be +/-6, sample times.
- the symbol detector (209) includes a signal processor (210) and magnitude selector (211) that operates preferably as a comparator, as well understood, to select the largest magnitude DTFT from among all DTFTs, preferably four, provided by the signal processor (210).
- the magnitude selector (211) provides a series of symbols, one for each symbol time period, or digital representations thereof to a decoder (213).
- the decoder then decodes these symbols in accordance with whatever over the air protocol is used as is well understood in the art, into a data or binary stream at output (215). As the details of the over the air protocol and decoding are well understood in general and not further relevant to this disclosure no further space will be devoted to them.
- FIG. 3 depicts in composite block diagram form 3 embodiments of a signal processor arranged and constructed to provide a discrete time Fourier transform (DTFT), at output (301), corresponding to a sequence of samples, x' i (n), x' q (n) (307), n being the sample sequence index and varying from 0, 1, 2, . . . , to N-1, where N, from above, is the number of samples, preferably 50 or alternatively 25 for a symbol time period, including a current, preferably, last sample, x' i (N-1), x' q (N-1), of a signal.
- DTFT discrete time Fourier transform
- the signal processor includes a recursive structure including a first recursive structure (303) and, when the signal is complex, a second recursive structure (305), that is coupled to the signal, specifically and respectively the sequence of samples x' i (n), x' q (n).
- the recursive structure (303) operates on the real part of the sequence of samples (307) to provide an output (309) designated y i (N-1
- the output is proportional, preferably equivalent, to a combination, such as an algebraic sum as provided by adders (311, 313), of the current and, preferably, last sample of the signal, x' i (N-1), and the first previous output (310) weighted at multiplier (315) by a sinusoidal function, less (indicated by multiplying by -1 at multiplier (317)) a second previous output at (316).
- a combination such as an algebraic sum as provided by adders (311, 313), of the current and, preferably, last sample of the signal, x' i (N-1), and the first previous output (310) weighted at multiplier (315) by a sinusoidal function, less (indicated by multiplying by -1 at multiplier (317)) a second previous output at (316).
- the second recursive structure (305) operates on the imaginary part of the sequence of samples (307) to provide an output (320) designated y q (N-1
- the output is proportional, preferably equivalent, to a combination, such as algebraic sum as provided by adders 322, 323), of the current and, preferably, last sample of the signal, x' q (N-1), and the first previous output (322) weighted at multiplier (325) by a sinusoidal function, less (indicated by multiplying by -1 at multiplier (327)) a second previous output at (326).
- This function becomes 2 cos( ⁇ /2) when a preferred form of a signal conditioner (319), later explained, is provided and enabled.
- the sinusoidal function as depicted and preferred is 2cos( ⁇ + ⁇ /2) when the frequency error, ⁇ , from output (207) is nonzero and the signal conditioner is used.
- a combiner (330) that is coupled to the output (309) and the first previous output (310) and when the signal is complex the output (320) and first previous output (321) for providing, at output (301), a DTFT signal,X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ ) +jX q ( ⁇ + ⁇ ).
- This DTFT signal may be shown to be proportional, preferably same magnitude but phase shifted from a DTFT evaluated at the arbitrary frequency for the sequence of samples x' i (n), x' q (n) (307).
- an adder (331) combines the output (309) with the first previous output (310) multiplied, at multiplier (333), by -cos( ⁇ + ⁇ /2), and, when the sequence of samples is complex, the first previous output (321) multiplied, at multiplier (335), by -sin( ⁇ + ⁇ /2) to provide X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ ).
- X q ( ⁇ + ⁇ ) is produced by adder (336) combining the output (320) with the first previous output (321) multiplied, at multiplier (337), by -cos( ⁇ + ⁇ /2), and the first previous output (310) multiplied or weighted, at multiplier (339), by +sin( ⁇ + ⁇ /2). From the algebraic signs it is clear that the adders very often are finding a difference between two inputs as weighted.
- the signal processor may provide completely satisfactory results if less than all N samples are used. For example, 40 or less of the 50 samples may well be sufficient to provide a reliable estimate of which of four different symbols is present in a given symbol time period, particularly under strong signal conditions.
- the signal processor may additionally include a signal conditioner (319) that operates on the sampled digital data x i (n), x q (n) from output (208) (sequential data sequence) to provide the sequence of samples (307) so as to limit the magnitude of the output (309, 320) and first previous outputs (310, 321).
- the signal conditioner (319) preferably, phase shifts each sample of an input signal, the sampled data signal, to provide the sequence of samples (307). Due to the recursive nature of the recursive structures (303, 305) intermediate results at the outputs such as output (309) may get quite large depending on the characteristics of the input data and more importantly the value of the argument for the sinusoidal function, specifically cosign function.
- phase shift may be any amount but three particular cases each having certain advantageous attributes will be considered. If the magnitude of the normalized radian frequency, ⁇ , or more specifically corrected normalized radian frequency ⁇ + ⁇ is not close to 0 or ⁇ , but rather lies within a range of approx. 0.25 ⁇ to 0.75 ⁇ then a phase shift of zero is typically acceptable.
- a phase shift of zero corresponds to not having the signal conditioner (319) or disabling it by insuring that a commutating switch (340) does not operate but rather directs each data sample x i (n), X q (n) pair to the recursive structures without modification. This corresponds to the switch (340) staying in the position depicted.
- phase shift of ⁇ /2 is particularly advantageous from a computational efficiency perspective. While preferably a positive ⁇ /2 shift is employed a negative ⁇ /2 shift works equally well, albeit is implemented differently as depicted by FIG. 3. In any event this phase shift amounts to multiplying each data sample by e.sup. ⁇ jn ⁇ /2. Those of ordinary skill will recognize this is a computationally efficient transform of the data samples, reducing to a routing or algebraic sign change only.
- x' i (n) x i (0), -x q (1),-x i (2), x q (3), x i (4), -x q (5) . . .
- x' q (n) x q (0), x i (1), -x q (2), -x i (3), x q (4), -x q ( 5 ), . . .
- the DTFT magnitude of a signal having an arbitrary frequency f such as nominally 2400 Hz, is required.
- the signal need not be conditioned, so the conditioner is disabled via output (351), and the signal is thus routed, sample by sample, directly to the recursive structures (303, 305).
- the sinusoidal functions or processing coefficients or constants, cos(0.34 ⁇ ) and sin(0.34 ⁇ ) are determined by calculation or lookup table to be 0.48175 and 0.87631 respectively.
- the recursive structures preferably, process all N samples, here 50 samples, and after each sample including the N th sample, specifically x i (N-1)+jx q (N-1), provides the outputs (309, 320) and the first previous outputs (310, 321).
- the combiner (330) combines as above explained these outputs and first previous outputs with one last sequence of multiplies and adds and provides the DTFT signal, X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ ) +jX q ( ⁇ + ⁇ ).
- This DTFT signal is proportional to a DTFT evaluated at the arbitrary frequency of 2400 Hz or after including the frequency error of 1000Hz, 3400 Hz for this sequence of samples.
- the DTFT signal may be shown to be proportional in amplitude to a DTFT for this 3400 Hz signal component but may vary in phase from the true DTFT. This variation results from certain simplifications that have been taken advantage of in the combiner (330). These simplifications are applicable when the primary interest is a frequency dependent amplitude or power in a signal and the phase information is not required.
- the DTFT signal is coupled to the magnitude selector (211) where the real and imaginary components are squared and added to find the magnitude or power of the 3400 Hz signal, specifically the power corresponding to a 2400 Hz symbol.
- the above process using the recursive structure and the combiner is repeated to form a second DTFT signal for a second frequency corresponding to a second symbol, such as -2400 Hz.
- the magnitude selector further forms a second magnitude of the second DTFT signal and selects the symbol corresponding to the larger of the two magnitudes. More specifically in the preferred embodiment having 4 different FSK symbols the above process is repeated for +800 Hz, -800 Hz, and -2400 Hz symbols after which a comparison of all magnitudes with one each corresponding to each possible symbol allows for one symbol to be selected, thus detected.
- FIG. 5 an alternative embodiment of a combiner (530) is depicted.
- This combiner is suitable for use as a substitute for the combiner (330) and has like inputs, namely the outputs (309, 320) and the first previous outputs (310, 321).
- the combiner (530) however provides, at output (301), a DTFT signal, X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ )+jX q ( ⁇ + ⁇ ), that has accurate phase and magnitude information.
- This combiner (530) would be required and useful in PSK or QAM systems where symbol detection requires the phase information, specifically tan -1 [X q ( ⁇ + ⁇ )/X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ )].
- QAM systems ordinarily require both phase and magnitude, specifically [X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ ) 2 +X q ( ⁇ + ⁇ ) 2 ] 1/2 . Due to practical difficulties, specifically extensive calculations, most practitioners will try to use the squared magnitude when feasible.
- an adder (531) combines the output (309) weighted or multiplied, at multiplier (521), by cos(N-1)( ⁇ + ⁇ /2) with the first previous output (310) multiplied, at multiplier (533), by -cosN(( ⁇ + ⁇ /2), and, when the sequence of samples is complex, the output (320) multiplied, at multiplier (523), by sin(N-1)( ⁇ + ⁇ /2), along with the first previous output (321) multiplied, at multiplier (535), by -sinN( ⁇ + ⁇ /2), to provide X i ( ⁇ + ⁇ ), the real or in phase portion of the DTFT signal.
- X q ( ⁇ + ⁇ ), the imaginary or quadrature portion of the DTFT signal is produced by adder (536) combining the output (320) multiplied, at multiplier (527), by cos(N-1)( ⁇ + ⁇ /2) with the first previous output (321) multiplied, at multiplier (537), by -cosN( ⁇ + ⁇ /2), and the output (309) multiplied, at multiplier (525), by -sin(N-1)( ⁇ + ⁇ /2) along with the first previous output (310) multiplied or weighted, at multiplier (539), by sinN(( ⁇ + ⁇ /2).
- step 701 samples a received signal and provides a corresponding sequence of samples to subsequent steps of the method.
- Step 703 processes a first portion, such as 602, of the signal or samples of the signal to provide a frequency error.
- Step 705 through step 711 is included in step 703.
- Step 705 operates in a recursive fashion to provide a plurality of DTFT signals, each preferably spaced across a range of possible frequency errors.
- Step 709 selects the largest DTFT signal from the plurality and a corresponding frequency error, for example 500 Hz.
- Step 711 provides this frequency error to the timing and symbol detection steps of the process, respectively, 713, 721.
- Step 713 responsive to the frequency error, processes, a second portion, such as 604, of the signal or corresponding sequence of samples to provide a timing error to the symbol detection process at step 719.
- Step 721 then, responsive to the frequency error and timing error, processes the symbol portion, such as 606, of the signal to provide detected symbols.
- Step 721 includes steps 723, 725, and 727.
- Step 723 operates recursively on the signal or corresponding sequence of samples to provide a DTFT at each symbol frequency, after which step 725 selects the largest magnitude DTFT and a corresponding symbol. This symbol is then provided, at step 727, to the decoder. The process ends at 730.
- the apparatus and methods disclosed provide various inventive techniques for receiving a signal or signal processing such as timing error detection or timing acquisition.
- the receiver or signal processor structure and methods discussed have improved computational efficiency significantly over known techniques, and when used as a timing error detector with other processes provided a receiver with a sensitivity very close to the theoretical level.
- the alternative approach of calculating a correlation compared to this timing error detector is 75 times more computationally burdensome This has been done without otherwise burdening processing resources.
- the present invention in furtherance of satisfying a long-felt need of messaging systems and receivers allows a lower cost processor or fewer processing resources to be used and additionally readily facilitates, for example, low power consumption portable receivers by providing methods and apparatus for signal processing, such as frequency and timing error detection or symbol detection that are practical to implement from a physical, economic and power source perspective.
