Definitions
- This specification relates to providing suggested search queries to an electronic device for display to a user based on the location of the electronic device.
- Search queries that may have in the past been input by a user sitting at a home or office computer, are now often input on the fly while the user is at a location relevant to his or her particular query. For example, as a user is leaving his office, he may search for nearby restaurants on his mobile telephone. Later, as the user is leaving a restaurant, he may use his mobile telephone to search for telephone numbers for taxi-cab companies. While riding in the taxi-cab, he may search for movies playing at a nearby theater that evening.
- This specification describes technologies relating to providing suggested queries to a user of an electronic device.
- the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for providing suggested queries to a user of an electronic device which include determining a current location of the user.
- a selection of the user's past search queries is generated, where each past search query in the selection is associated with a query location related to the query.
- a respective score is assigned to each past search query in the selection. The score for each query is based at least in part on the proximity of the current location to the query location of the query.
- One or more of the past search queries in the selection are provided for presentation to the user on the user's electronic device based on the assigned scores.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- One or more query search results having been previously presented to the user in response to one or more of the user's past search queries and having been previously selected by the user can be included in the generated selection.
- Each of the one or more query search results is associated with a location related to the query search result.
- Assigning a score to a query can include assigning the score based at least in part on how recent the query was input by the user as compared to a current time. Determining the score for a query can further include basing the score on the proximity of the user's current location to the user's location when the query was input or selected by the user. Assigning a score to a query can include assigning the score based at least in part on how often the user frequents the user's current location. Assigning a score to a query can include assigning the score based at least in part on the number of search results selected by the user when the query's search results were previously presented to the user.
- a method in another aspect, includes retrieving an item from a data store that includes multiple queries and query search results each associated with a location related to the query or query search result.
- the queries were previously input by a particular user and the query search results were previously presented to and selected by the user in response to a query by the user.
- a score is determined for the retrieved item. The score is based on the proximity of a current location of the user to the location associated with the retrieved item. The score is assigned to the retrieved item.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- determining the score for the retrieved item can further include basing the score at least in part on the number of search results selected by the user when the query's search results were previously presented to the user. Determining the score for the retrieved item can further include basing the score on how recent the retrieved item was input by the user (if a query) or selected by the user (if a query search result) as compared to a current time.
- a method in another aspect, includes receiving multiple queries input by a user. For each of the queries: a time at which the user input the query is determined; a location related to the query is determined; click data related to the query is obtained, where click data indicates a number of search results generated in response to the query that were clicked on by the user.
- the query is associated with data including: the time, the location related to the query and the click data.
- the multiple queries and associated data are stored in a data store.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a location of the user at the time the user input the query can be determined and associated with the query.
- the search result data including: the time the user input the query and the location related to the query can be determined.
- the search result and associated data can be stored in the data store.
- a user can be presented on a display screen of the user's electronic device with one or more suggested queries or query search results that are relevant to the user's current location without the user making any input into his electronic device, i.e., with “zero clicks”.
- the user can be presented with different suggestions that are relevant to his new current location. If the user had previously indicated interest in a query search result (e.g., by clicking on a webpage), the user can be presented with the query search result when it is relevant to his current location, saving the user from having to re-input the query and select from the search results.
- a user can be presented with locally relevant information about a location he may have previously searched but later forgotten about. For example, if the user input a query or clicked on a query search result months ago about a restaurant, and later was in the proximity of the restaurant (but had forgotten about it), he may be reminded by receiving a suggested query or query search result relating to the restaurant.

- FIG. 6 shows examples of computer devices that may be used to execute the actions discussed in this document.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system 100 for providing suggested search queries and/or query search results to a user. Queries and query search results from the user's own search history can be matched to the user's current geographical location and presented to the user as suggested queries and/or query search results.
- the user 102 may reside in San Francisco, Calif. and from his home computer 104 input various search queries while researching an upcoming trip to Kauai. His queries are transmitted over a network 106 to a search system 108 .
- the search system 108 shown is a simplified system for illustrative purposes, but it should be understood that the search system 108 can be implemented on multiple computers at more than one physical location.
- the search system 108 includes a search interface 110 , which can be configured to receive the user's search queries.
- the network 106 can include one or more local area networks (LANs), a wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, a wireless network, e.g., a cellular network, or a combination of two or more of them.
- the search interface 110 can transmit a search query to a search engine 112 , which can return a set of search results in response to the query.
- the search results are transmitted to the user's computer 104 for display on the computer's display device.
- Each search result relates to a resource and includes a link, e.g., tag with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), to the resource.
- the user may click on one or more of the search results and be directed to the resource that is the target of the link.
- the “click data”, that is, the information that the user clicked on a particular search result can be transmitted to the search system 108 .
- the user 104 inputs the following query: SURFING LESSONS KAUAI.
- the set of search results includes a search result that has a link to the website for “Kauai Surf School” and that may also include a snippet of information about the surf school. The user clicks on the link and is directed to the Kauai Surf School website, which he browses for a period of time.
- the user 104 also inputs the query: BEACHES KAUAI and is presented with a set of search results.
- the user's queries are stored in a history store 114 and are identified as queries of the particular user.
- a location related to each of the user's queries is determined and associated with the query in the history store 114 .
- the location “Kauai” can be extracted from each of the two example queries above and associated with the queries as the query location. Extracting a location from the query can be performed manually or automatically.
- one or more words forming the query can be automatically compared to a collection of words or phrases previously determined to identify locations, and if a match is found, the word or words in the query can be extracted as a location relating to the query.
- the locations identified in the collection correspond to cities, venues, addresses, landmarks and the like, and are mapped to geographic coordinates, e.g., latitude and longitude.
- the location associated with the query as the query location can be geographical coordinates and/or the corresponding name of the location (i.e., city, venue, etc.).
- query locations can have differing levels of granularity. For example, a first query can be related to a specific location (e.g., the geographical coordinates for the Empire State Building may be a query location for the query EMPIRE STATE BUILDING), while a second query can be related to a broader location (e.g., New York City for a query NEW YORK MARATHON).
- other data associated with each query can also be stored with each query in the data store.
- the user's location at the time he input the query can be stored with the query as the “user location”.
- the time when the user input the query can be stored in association with the query as the “query time”.
- Click data indicating the number of search results and/or which search results that were presented to the user in response to the query were clicked on by the user, can be stored in association with the query.
- a current location of the user is determined by the search system 108 as being Kauai. As is discussed further below, the current location of the user can be checked at periodic intervals by the search system 108 .
- a zero-click engine 118 can search the history store 114 to retrieve the user's previously input queries and/or query search results. The queries and query search results for the user can be searched for those having a query location that are relevant to the user's current location, namely Kauai.
- FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of an example search system 200 for providing suggested queries and/or query search results to a user.
- a simplified version of the search system 200 is shown for illustrative purposes, however it should be understood that the system 200 can be implemented over multiple computers which can be physically located at more than one location.
- Each search query can be transmitted to a search engine 206 for processing.
- the search engine can provide a set of query search results, which are transmitted back to the user 202 .
- the user 202 can select (e.g., click on) one or more of the query search results.
- Information about which query search results the user clicked on i.e., click data
- is received by the search system 200 for example, by the search interface 204 .
- the example system 200 described here in reference to FIG. 2 receives search queries at a search interface for transmission to a search engine.
- queries can be input and received in various types of search interfaces in various types of applications and for processing by various search engines.
- queries can be received and collected from a map application that includes a search field where a user can input a query.
- queries are received and collected from a search page for a search engine that searches documents included in the World Wide Web.
- Other examples of applications that receive queries are possible.
- a location determination engine 208 can be used to determine the location of the user at the time the user input the search query (the “user location”). For example, if the user is using a mobile electronic device, then the geographical location of the mobile electronic device (and therefore the user's location) can be determined using various techniques, some of which include using a global positioning system (GPS) information from the mobile device, cellular telephone cell tower triangulation techniques, sending a request for the location to a location service (e.g., Skyhook Wireless of Boston, Mass.), retrieving the information from the mobile electronic device's network, or receiving a manual input from the user.
- GPS global positioning system
- the location of the device may be determined using known WiFi access points and their known geographic locations. If the user is using a computer, the user's geographical location can be determined using information from the user's network provider, for example, using the user's IP address (e.g., using a service provided by IP2Location.com of Penang, Malaysia). Referring again to the previous example, the user location of San Francisco can be determined as the user's location at the time the user input the search query “SURFING LESSONS KAUAI”.
- the user action of inputting the search query can have a time stamp (the “query time”).
- a location extractor 212 can be used to determine a location related to the user's search query (the “query location”). As described above, in some implementations, each word (or words) included in the query can be checked against a collection of terms predetermined to identify locations and if a match is found that word(s) can be identified as the query location.
- the collection of terms is a database of location terms that can include administrative areas (e.g., streets, cities, districts, states, provinces, countries), geographical features (e.g., mountains, rivers, lakes), landmarks (e.g., important buildings, monuments) and venues (e.g., parks, stadiums). Each location term can have a corresponding latitude and longitude and may also include a shape or extent.
- the location extractor 212 can extract the location term and the corresponding latitude and longitude, and shape/extent if there is one, from the database of location terms.
- the term “KAUAI” is identified as a location and the location extractor 212 can identify Kauai as the query location.
- Other techniques for determining a location that is related to the query can be used. For example, if the query is input into a search field in a map application, the user's interaction with a map displayed by the map application can be used to determine a location relating to the query. By way of illustration, if a map of Hawaii was displayed to the user, and the user zoomed in on the map to Kauai and then input a search query BEACHES, then query location can be determined to be Kauai, even though Kauai was not a term in the query.
- the history store 214 is configured to store a set of queries and optionally query search results for one or more users.
- the queries and query search results for a particular user can be identified within the history store 214 as belonging to the particular user.
- the user logs into the search system 200 and can be identified by data stored in a cookie.
- a unique identifier for the user can be used to label his queries in the query index 202.
- Each query and query search result in the history store 214 can be labeled with a query location, i.e., a location related to the query or query search result.
- the query or query search result can be sent to the history store 214 from the search interface 204 already labeled with the query location.
- the query or query search result can be sent to the history store 214 at a first time, and then at a later second time, the query location can be sent to the history store 214 .
- the search system 200 can be further configured to associate other data with each query or query search result, including for example, the user location and query time for each query.
- Click data for a query can also be associated with the query in the history store 214 , where the click data can indicate the number of search results clicked on by a user when presented with the search results to the query, and/or indicate the particular search results that were clicked on by the user.
- the history store 214 can further include query search results that were previously selected by the user when presented to the user in response to one of their queries.
- the query search result can also be labeled with one or more query locations, which can be derived from the query search result itself and/or from the query corresponding to the query search result. For example, if the query is “SURFING LESSONS KAUAI” and the query search result is “Poipu Surf Academy”, the location “Kauai” can be extracted from the query and the more specific location “Poipu” (a town in Kauai) can be extracted from the query search result. Either or both locations can be used to label the query search result item within the history store 214 .
- Each item (i.e., query or query search result) in the history store 214 can be labeled with more than one query location.
- the query “SURFING LESSONS KAUAI” can be labeled with the query location “Kauai”.
- the larger location “Hawaii” can also be used to label the query.
- the user may initially land at the airport in Honolulu, Hi., before catching a connecting flight to the island of Kauai. Once he lands in Hawaii, the history store 214 can be searched for suggested queries and query search results relevant to his current location of Hawaii, and therefore find the query “SURFING LESSONS KAUAI”, even before he has arrived in Kauai.
- the query search result “Poipu Surf Academy” can be labeled with the query locations Poipu, Kauai and Hawaii.
- each query and query search result can be labeled with one query location, however, a match of a current location to a query location can include a radius broad enough to capture locations that are different than, but close to, the user's current location.
- a query labeled with the query location Poipu can still be retrieved from the history store and presented to the user when he lands in Honolulu, if Poipu is within a certain predetermined radius of the user's current location.
- the predetermined radius can vary (i.e., be increased or decreased) as a function of the density of items in the history store. For example, it may be desired to fetch a particular number of items from the history store.
- the radius can be increased or decreased depending on the density of items in the history store having a query location in the proximity of the current location. If there are few items in the history store having a query location within the predetermined radius to the current location, then the radius can be increased to increase the number of items that will be fetched.
- geographic coordinate locations corresponding to a location or venue derived from a query or a query search result can be determined from a look-up table having location and venue names correlated to corresponding geographic coordinates, e.g., GPS coordinates.
- the distance between two locations can then be computed by known methods. Particular locations or venues may have their separation distance determined beforehand and such a distance can be used.
- the zero click engine 216 can determine the current location of the user's device, e.g., by using the location determination engine 208 , and then provide the user's device° with a selection of queries and query search results retrieved from the history store 214 that have a query location matching his current location. What constitutes a matching location can vary in different implementations. For example, if the query location is within a predefined radius of the current location, the locations can be considered a match.
- a scoring module 218 can be configured to determine and assign a score to items retrieved from the history store 214 for the user, and the scores can be used to rank the retrieved items for presentation to the user. For example, the closer in proximity the user's current location is to the query location, the higher a score that can be assigned to the query.
- the closeness of the current location to a location related to a previously-clicked-on query result for the query can be used to determine the score. That is, if for a particular query the user had clicked on a search result, and the query search result was related to a location is that is close to the current location, then the score for that particular query can be boosted.
- the scoring module 218 can determine a score for a query. For example, the recency of the query can be determined by comparing the query time to the current time. The more recent a query, the higher the score that can be assigned to the query. As another example, click data associated with a query can be used to determine the score. For example, the more query search results that were clicked on by a user, the higher the score that can be assigned to the corresponding query.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for generating a history store of queries associated with location data.
- a query is received from a user (Step 302 ).
- the process 300 can be described in reference to the example system 200 in FIG. 2 , although it should be understood that a differently configured system can be used to implement the process 300 .
- the query can be received from the user 202 by the search interface 204 .
- the user's location at the time of inputting the query is determined (Step 304 ).
- the location determination engine 208 can be used to determine the user's location.
- the time at which the user input the query is determined (e.g., a time stamp of the user action) (Step 306 ).
- a timestamp can be included with the query, or alternatively, the query can be time stamped when received by the search interface 104 .
- a location related to the query is determined (Step 308 ).
- the location extractor 212 can be used to extract a location from the query search terms, as described above. That is, the search terms forming the query can be compared to a collection of terms known to identify locations. If a match is found, the term or terms can be identified as the query location.
- the query location can be a geographical location, e.g., a city name, can be the name of a venue, e.g., Empire State Building.
- a look-up table having location and venue names and corresponding geographic coordinate locations, e.g., GPS coordinates can be used to retrieve geographical coordinates for the query location.
- a query for SUBWAYS does not include a geographical location, and since subways are present in multiple different locations, a particular location cannot be inferred from the search query alone. If no location relating to the query can be determined from the query search terms, then the location of the user at the time the query was input can be used as the query location.
- a query location can be inferred from one or more query search results clicked on by the user. For example, if the user queries SUBWAYS and then clicks on a query search result for New York City Transit, the location “New York City” can be extracted from the query search result and used as the query location for the corresponding query SUBWAYS.
- a set of search results responsive to the query is determined (Step 310 ) and sent to the user (Step 312 ), for example, as a list with the most relevant search results positioned highest in the list, although other techniques for presenting search results can be used.
- the query is sent to the history store and labeled with the query location.
- additional data is associated with the query can also be sent to the history store (Step 314 ).
- the additional data includes the user location at the time the query was input and the time the query was input.
- the additional data is not sent to the history store, only some of the additional data is sent, or other additional data is sent to the history store in association with the query.
- the history store of the user's past queries accumulates. If the history store is used to store past queries of multiple users, the queries can be identified as originating from a particular user, so that the particular user's past history of queries can be identified and retrieved from the history store. The user can be asked whether or not he agrees to having his past queries included in the history store, and can opt not to participate, in which case his past queries will not be labeled with a query location and stored for later use.
- the click data for the query can be determined (Step 316 ).
- the click data can include the number of query search results that were clicked on by a user for a particular query, which can indicate the user's interest in the query search results.
- the history store can also be used to store query search results labeled with a query location, as was discussed above.
- the click data can include the clicked search results.
- Each clicked search result can be included as an item in the history store that is labeled with a location related to the search result. Additional data can be associated with the search result, such as the time the search result was presented to the user and/or the user's location when the search result was presented to the user.
- the click data is sent to the history store (Step 318 ).
- the history store includes clicked on search results
- the clicked on search results associated with query locations and optionally additional data also is sent to the history store.
- the query location for a query search result can be the query location of the corresponding query.
- a location can be extracted from the query search result itself.
- any search results generated in response to the query SURFING LESSONS KAUAI which is labeled with the query location “Kauai”, can automatically be labeled with the same query location, i.e., Kauai.
- search results that have not been clicked by the user can also be stored in the history store and labeled with a query location, which location can be determined as discussed above.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for generating a selection of suggested queries and/or query search results for presentation to a user.
- the current location of the user's device is determined, which can be taken as the user's current location (Step 402 ).
- the process 400 can be described in reference to the example system 200 in FIG. 2 , although it should be understood that a differently configured system can be used to implement the process 400 .
- the location determination engine 208 can be used to determine the user's current location.
- a selection of the user's past queries is generated (Step 404 ).
- the selection can include the user's past queries and previously presented search results (i.e., presented in response to the past queries).
- the previously presented search results is narrowed to include only search results previously selected (i.e., clicked) by the user.
- all the past queries and query search results stored for the particular user in the history store 214 are included in the generated selection, which includes the query location and user location (i.e., location of user at time the query was input).
- the selection can be processed to generate two further selection: the first selection can order the selected items based on the distance between the user's current location and the query location (e.g., the closest items are positioned highest on a list represented the first selection); and the second selection can order the selected items based on the distance between the user's current location and the user location (i.e., location at query time).
- a score is assigned to the selected items (Step 406 ).
- the score assigned to a selected item can be determined so that items most probable to be relevant to the user's current context are presented to the user at the top of a listing of the selected items.
- the items for the user included in the history store can be indexed by either or both of the user location and query location, e.g., to avoid retrieving the entire history for the particular user for scoring. If the user's device has a relatively small display area, e.g., a mobile telephone, then the number of items that can be presented to the user may be limited, in which case selecting the few items for presentation to the user is that much more important.
- a scoring function can be used that generates a score based on the proximity of the user's current location to the query location.
- the scoring function can also generate the score based on the recency of the query as compared to the current time, the distance between the user's current location and the user location for the query and/or an estimated level of interest in search results that were generated for the query (if the selected item is a query and not a query search result).
- the selection can be sorted according to the assigned scores, with the higher scoring items at the top of the selection (Step 408 ).
- the two selections can be merged and sorted (or sorted and merged).
- One or more selected items of the sorted list e.g., the top N items (N being an integer) are sent to the user's device for presentation to the user (Step 410 ).
- N being an integer
- N may be a small number like five or three items.
- N can be a larger number, thereby presenting the user with many different suggested queries and query search results.
- the user can chose to select one of the suggested queries, in which case the query is submitted to a search engine and a fresh set of search results is generated and presented to the user.
- the user can chose to select one of the suggested query search results, in which case he can obtain more information about the result. For example, a query search result provides a link to a webpage, in which case clicking the query search result directs the user to the webpage.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process for determining a score for an item included in a history store of queries and query search results that are labeled with a query location.
- the process 500 shall be described in relation to the example scoring function set out below, although it should be understood that a different scoring function can be used.
- Score A *distance(current location,query location)+ B *distance(current location,user location)+ C *(current time,query time)+ D *length(clicked search results)+ E
- the values A, B, C, D and E are determined by manual iteration and evaluation. In other implementations, the values can be determined by a machine learning system.
- the value of E is a constant which can be used to boost the score of items considered to be more interesting and can be eliminated or set to zero.
- a selected item i.e., a query or query search result
- a scoring module included in a zero click engine such as the scoring module 218 and zero click engine 216 shown in FIG. 2
- the selected item comes labeled with a query location and the proximity of the query location to the user's current location is determined (Step 504 ).
- the proximity of the user location i.e., the location of the user when he input the query
- the user's current location is determined (Step 506 ). Using this proximity determination can help to provide relevant suggestions in the following type of scenario.
- the user goes to Cambridge infrequently, but when he does go there, he often needs to find the telephone number of a taxi-cab company and he likes to visit the same restaurants each visit.
- the user is in Cambridge (i.e., his user location is Cambridge) and inputs a search query TAXI-CAB and another search query RESTAURANTS CAMBRIDGE.
- the value B in the above scoring function can be set to zero (0), or this step eliminated altogether, to prevent queries input at locations the user frequents (e.g., his home and office) from always showing up when the user is near those locations and effectively drowning out other, potentially more interesting, queries.
- the Count (All locations) refers to the total number of current locations reported for the user, which can be limited in some examples to a certain time period. For example, a historical set of reported current locations for the user can be stored (optionally with timestamps) in a store of location history indexed by user. The value for Count (All locations) can be obtained from the store of location history.
- the Count (Locations within X km/ml of Current Location) refers to the number of total locations within the store of location history for the user that are within a predefined distance to the user's current location.
- the user's current location is a coffee shop a block from his office and the predefined distance is 1 kilometer (or 1 ⁇ 2 mile).
- the Count (All locations) value is 100 locations.
- the Count (Locations within 1 km of current location) is 55 locations.
- the Familiarity score is therefore 100/55 or 1.8. Later, the user is 5 kilometers away from his office and the Count (Locations within 1 km of current location) is only 10 locations. The Familiarity score is therefore 100/10 or 10.
- B′ can be determined by manual iteration and evaluation or by a machine learning system.
- Multiplying the value B′ by the Familiarity score can boost scores for queries input by a user in a location of which he does not usually frequent when he is later at the same location, e.g., Cambridge, in the above example, by giving a higher score to a current location the user visits less often and a lower score to a current location the user frequents often (e.g., his office).
- certain queries can be suggested to the user when he is at places he frequents, for example, queries relating to stock prices or the weather can be suggested to him when he is at a location having a very low familiarity score indicating he frequents it often, such as his home or office.
- the recency of the selected item can be determined (Step 508 ).
- the current time can be determined and compared to the time stamp given to the query or query search result. The more recent a query was input (or query search result selected), the higher the score the query or query search result can be assigned.
- Click data for the search results for a query can be determined (Step 510 ). If the selected item is a query, then the click data for the query may be indicative of how responsive the search results were to the query (i.e., the “success” of the query). In one example, the number of search results selected (e.g., clicked on) by the user can be used to estimate the query's success. If the selected item is a query search result, then click data for the query search result can be indicative of how responsive the particular query search result was to a corresponding query. Other click data, such as the length of time the user spent at a webpage corresponding to the clicked on query search result, can also be used to estimate the success of the query search result.
- a score for the selected item can be calculated based on the above discussed determinations (Step 512 ).
- the score is calculated using the scoring function set forth above. That is, a multiplier can be determined for each of the 4 factors and can be multiplied by the determinations made in steps 504 - 510 above to calculate a score, which may or may not be adjusted by a constant E.
- the specificity of the query location can be used when calculating the score. That is, the more specific a query location, the higher the score can be assigned, as compared to a query location that is rather broadly defined. For example, the query location “Manhattan” is not that specific, since Manhattan is an entire borough of New York City. By comparison, the query location “Greenwich Village”, which is only a small section of Manhattan, is more specific.
- a query having the query location Manhattan can score lower for specificity than a query having the query location Greenwich Village, however, the Manhattan query can score higher overall if the user's proximity is closer to the center of Manhattan than Greenwich Village and/or if the query time of the query for Manhattan is significantly more recent than the query for Greenwich Village.
- the process 400 in FIG. 4 can be initiated automatically based on various triggers.
- the process 400 can be scheduled to execute periodically at a predefined interval, e.g., every 15 minutes.
- the process 400 can be triggered once the user's current location has changed by a certain predefined distance.
- the user's current location can be periodically determined and compared to a last reported current location to calculate the change, if any, in the user's current location since the last report.
- the user can initiate the process manually, for example, by selecting an icon on his display screen, clicking a button, or otherwise inputting a command to present him with suggested queries and query search results.
- the command can be as subtle as placing the focus of a web browser on a search field displayed by the web browser application.
- a user control can be provided to the user so the user can manually change the trigger to initiate the process. For example, as a default the process can initiate every 15 minutes, but the user can be permitted to change the default to initiate more or less frequently, on-demand-only, or when his current location has changed by a predefined amount, which the user may also be also to set.
