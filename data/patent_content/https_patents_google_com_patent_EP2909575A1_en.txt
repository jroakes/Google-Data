Definitions
- three-dimensional (3D) modeling involves generation of a representation of a 3D surface of an object.
- the representation may be referred to as a 3D object data model, and can be rendered or displayed as a two-dimensional image via 3D rendering or displayed as a 3D image.
- 3D object data models represent a 3D object using a collection of points in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc.
- 3D models can be created by hand, algorithmically, or objects can be scanned, for example.
- an artist may manually generate a 3D image of an object that can be used as the 3D model.
- a given object may be scanned from a number of different angles, and the scanned images can be combined to generate the 3D image of the object.
- an image of an object may be used to generate a point cloud that can be algorithmically processed to generate the 3D image.
- 3D object data models may include solid models that define a volume of the object, or may include shell or boundary models that represent a surface (e.g. the boundary) of the object. Because an appearance of an object depends largely on an exterior of the object, boundary representations are common in computer graphics.
- 3D models are used in a wide variety of fields, and may be displayed using a number of different types of interfaces.
- Example interfaces may provide functionality to enable interaction between a user and the 3D models.
- the present application discloses systems and methods for marking images for three- dimensional (3D) image generation.

Images of the second set of images may be captured from the respective angles with respect to the object and may be indexed such that each image of the second set of images corresponds to a respective image of the first set of images. The images of the second set of images may be captured while a pattern is projected on the object.
- the method may further comprise matching portions of the pattern in each image of the second set of images to corresponding portions of the pattern in spatially neighboring images of the second set of images so as to spatially align the images of the second set of images.
- the method may also comprise determining respective images of the first set of images corresponding to spatially aligned images of the second set of images, based on indexing of the images of the second set of images to the images of the first set of images.
- the method may further comprise generating a 3D image of the object based on the respective images of the first set of images determined to correspond to the spatially aligned images of the second set of images.
- a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions executable by a computing device to cause the computing device to perform functions may comprise receiving a first set of images of an object. Images of the first set of images may be captured from respective angles with respect to the object. The functions may also comprise receiving a second set of images of the object. Images of the second set of images may be captured from the respective angles with respect to the object and may be indexed such that each image of the second set of images corresponds to a respective image of the first set of images. The images of the second set of images may be captured while a pattern is projected on the object.
- the functions may further comprise matching portions of the pattern in each image of the second set of images to corresponding portions of the pattern in spatially neighboring images of the second set of images so as to spatially align the images of the second set of images.

- a network such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless network (Wi-Fi), or Internet, for example.
- any of the components of the system 100 may be coupled to each other using wired or wireless communications.
- communication links between the input source 102 and the server 104 may include wired connections, such as a serial or parallel bus, or wireless links, such as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 (IEEE 802.11 may refer to IEEE 802.11-2007, IEEE

- 3D model acquisition shape and appearance
- structured light scanners may capture images of an object and a shape of the object may be recovered using monochrome stereo cameras and a pattern projector.
- a high- resolution DSLR camera may be used to capture images for color texture information.
- a raw computer-aided drafting (CAD) set of drawings may be received for each object.
- the input source 102 may provide a 3D object data model, in various forms, to the server 104. As one example, multiple scans of an object may be processed into a merged mesh and assets data model, and provided to the server 104 in that form.
- the server 104 includes a model builder 110, an object data model processor 112, a semantics and search index 114, and a graphics library 116, a shader application 118, a materials application 120, and an object data model renderer/viewer 122.

- the model builder 110 may perform coherent texture unwrapping from the mesh surface, and determine textures of surfaces emulated from the geometry.
- the object data model processor 112 may also receive the mesh data set for each object from the input source 102 and generate display meshes. For instance, the scanned mesh images may be decimated (e.g., from 5 million to 120,000 surfaces) utilizing texture- preserving decimation. Texture map generation can also be performed to determine color texture for map rendering. Texture map generation may include using the mesh data sets (H) that have colors but no UV (coordinate system of a 2D texture space) unwrapping to generate a mesh (D) with UV unwrapping but no colors.
- texture pixel of an image processing may include, for a given point in UV determine a triangle in the mesh's UV mapping D, and using triangle-local coordinates, move to an associated 3D point on the mesh.

For instance, an annotation may be provided to label or index aspects of color, texture, shape, appearance, description, function, etc., of an aspect of a 3D object data model. Annotations may be used to label any aspect of an image or 3D object data model, or to provide any type of information. Annotations may be performed manually or automatically. In examples herein, an annotated template of an object in a given classification or category may be generated that includes annotations, and the template may be applied to all objects in the given classification or category to apply the annotations to all objects.

- the system 100 may be used to acquire data of an object, process the data to generate a 3D object data model, and render the 3D object data model for display.
- Figure 2 illustrates another example system 200 for object data modeling, in accordance with an embodiment.
- the system 200 includes the input source 102 coupled to the server 104, which is coupled to a client device 124.
- the input source 102 and the server 104 may be as described in Figure 1.
- the client device 124 may receive outputs from any of the components of the server 124, and may be configured to render a 3D image.

- the object data model renderer/viewer 126, the shader application 128, and the materials application 130 may all be configured as described with respect to the object data model renderer/viewer 122, the materials application 120, and the shader application 118 of the server 104 as described with respect to Figure 1.
- the client device 124 may receive the 3D object data model file or files from the server 104 and render a 3D image of the object by executing the shader application 128 and the materials application 130.
- the client device 124 may access separate databases to retrieve appropriate shader and material information to apply to the image, access the server 104 to receive appropriate shader and material information from the shader application 118 and the materials application 120, or may store information locally regarding the appropriate shader and material information to apply.
- the client device 124 may receive the 3D object data model file or files from the server 104 and render a 3D image of the object.
- the server 104 may render a 3D image of the object and stream the 3D image to the client device 124 for display.
- the 3D object data model may include various forms of data, such as raw image data captured, mesh data, processed data, etc.
- Data of the 3D object data model may be encoded and compressed so as to store information related to 3D geometry of an object associated with information related to appearance of the object for transmission and display within a web browser or application on a device.
- data of the 3D object data model may be compressed by initially encoding a triangle mesh representing the 3D object as a list including a plurality of vertices and a plurality of indices.
- Each vertex in the list may have several arbitrary parameters associated with the vertex, including, but not limited to, position, surface normal, and texture coordinates.
- the triangle indices may be stored in a 16-bit unsigned integer format and vertex attributes may be stored in a 32-bit floating point format.
- the 32-bit floating point format vertex attributes may be reduced to 15-bits.
- a delta compression may be used to store differences between the triangle indices and vertex attributes, either in an array of structures layout or a transposed layout.
- post-delta data may be ZigZag encoded (e.g., using open- source Protocol Buffer library available from Google Inc.). Encoding may follow the format ZigZag(x): (x « 1) ⁇ (x » 15) with a corresponding decoding (during decompression) to follow the format UnZigZag(x): (x » 1) ⁇ (-(x & 1)).
- ZigZag encoding may be followed by multi-byte character encoding using UTF-8 encoding.
- the UTF-8 encoded data may be compressed using GNU Gzip or bzip2 to generate a compressed 3D object data model file.
- the compressed copy of the 3D object data model file may be stored in a database, such as the database 106 in Figure 1, in the server 104, or on the client device 124, for example.
- the compressed 3D object data model file may be provided by the server 104 to the client device 124 in response to a request from the client device 124.
- the client device 124 may decompress the compressed 3D object data model file according to Java instructions provided in the object browser web page.
- a local copy of the object browser web page and a local copy of the uncompressed, searchable data of the 3D object data model file can be stored in local memory of the client device 124.
- the client device 124 may display exemplary screenshots of an initial default view of a 3D object, based on the searchable data of the 3D object data model file loaded in the web browser.
- the 3D object data file includes information as to geometry of an object sorted by material and divided into portions to be loaded as fragments and reassembled in portions by the client device.

- the camera 404 is shown in Figure 4A at different angles with respect to the object 402 and may be configured to capture the first set of images of the object 402.
- the first set of images may include images taken at different elevation as well as different angles.
- the number of angles may vary based on complexity of the object 402, for example. Images from fewer angles may be captured for a symmetric object, for example, than for a more complex object that is not symmetric.
- various lighting or backgrounds may be applied to the object, and images may be captured depicting the variations.
- the camera 404 may be fixed, while the object 402 may be rotated in front of the camera 404 such that the camera 404 may capture images from different angles with respect to the object 402.
- the object 402 may be rotated at a given elevation for the camera 404 to capture a given set of images, then elevation may be changed and the object 402 is rotated again for the camera 404 to capture another set of images.

- the markings for example, may depict a pattern made of light emitted from the light source.
- the pattern may be simple (e.g., dots tracing a curve), or complex (e.g., a flower).
- the light source may generally be an electromagnetic radiation source. Light source and electromagnetic radiation source are used interchangeably herein.
- the electromagnetic radiation source may be configured to project a light beam of any wavelength, visible or invisible.
- the electromagnetic radiation source may be configured to project visible light such as laser beams with different colors and may additionally or alternately be configured to project invisible light such as infrared light.

- Other examples of imaging parameters that can be configured differently between the first camera and the second camera may include aperture, focal depth, etc.
- Image resolution refers to details that an image holds. Higher resolution means more image detail. Image resolution can be measured in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be visibly resolved. Resolution units can be tied to physical sizes (e.g. lines per mm, lines per inch), to an overall size of a picture (lines per picture height), or to angular subtenant. Line pairs may be used instead of lines in some examples. A line pair comprises a dark line and an adjacent light line. A line may either be a dark line or a light line. For instance, a resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm).
- image resolution refers to a pixel count in an image, which may be specified as number of megapixels, and can be calculated by multiplying pixel columns by pixel rows and dividing by one million. Other conventions include describing pixels per length unit or pixels per area unit, such as pixels per inch or per square inch. Thus, a higher resolution image may have a higher pixel count (i.e., a larger number of pixels) than a lower resolution image.
- the given camera may be configured for given imaging parameter(s) to capture the first set of images, then the imaging parameter(s) may be adjusted before capturing the second set of images, for example.
- the electromagnetic radiation source may be separate from the camera capturing the images of the second set of images.
- the electromagnetic radiation source may be coupled to the camera capturing the second set of images and the camera may be configured to activate the electromagnetic radiation source before capturing the images of the second set of images.
- the images of the second set of images may be captured from same angles and/or elevations as the images of the first set of images. In other examples, the images of the second set of images may be captured from different angles and/or elevations than the images of the first set of images.
- the images of the second set of images may be indexed to correspond to the images of the first set of images. In an example, each image of the second set of image may correspond to a respective image of the first set of images. For example, if the images of the second set of images are captured from the same angles as the images of the first set of images, then a given image of the second set of images captured from a given angle is indexed to correspond to a respective image of the first set of images captured from the given angle. Other correspondence arrangements are possible.

Accordingly, the computing device may be configured to recognize mismatches in line types, align the images 502 and 504 quicker and more efficiently, for example, and may reduce number of, avoid, or eliminate incorrect alignment iterations.

- the pattern may include distinctive features which can be determined by local feature detection algorithms such as SIFT (Scale Invariant

- ORB Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF
- These algorithms may identify distinctive points on an image that can be recognized reliably as the orientation or distance to an object changes.
