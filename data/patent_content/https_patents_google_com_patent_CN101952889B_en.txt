Description
Related application
The common pending trial that the application relates on November 29th, 2007 and submits to and total application number be 11/946,978 U.S. Patent application, the full content of this application is incorporated herein by reference.
Technical field
Relate generally to of the present invention presents audible content, and relates in particular to bandwidth expansion technique.
Background technology
Can present the effort that audio content comprises well known range from numeral with listening.In some application arranged, numeral comprised the complete corresponding bandwidth relevant with the original audio sampling.Under these circumstances, can listen and present the sounding output that can comprise pin-point accuracy and nature.Yet such mode requires sizable overhead resource that corresponding data volume is provided.In the many application such as the radio communication setting arrange, can not always fully support such quantity of information.
In order to adapt to such limitation, so-called narrowband speech technology can be used for coming the restricted information amount by further expression being restricted to less than the complete corresponding bandwidth relevant with the original audio sampling.Only as the example about this point, although natural-sounding comprises the active constituent up to 8kHz (or higher), the arrowband represents can only provide about for example information of 300-3400Hz scope.When the content that obtains was presented to such an extent that can listen, the content that obtains is clear the function needs that are enough to support voice-based communication usually.Yet regrettably, narrowband speech is processed and also often to be obtained the voice that sound oppressive, and compares with the Whole frequency band voice even may reduce sharpness.
In order to satisfy this needs, sometimes adopt bandwidth expansion technique.Based on can with narrow band information and the artificial information of losing that generates in the higher and/or lower frequency band of other information select to be added to information in the arrowband content, thereby synthetic pseudo-broadband (or full band) signal.
Use such technology, for example, the narrowband speech in the 300-3400Hz scope can be converted to the broadband voice in the 100-8000Hz scope for example.For this reason, a needed key message is the spectrum envelope in high frequency band (3400-8000Hz).If estimated the broader frequency spectrum envelope, so usually can easily from the spectrum envelope of broadband, extract the high frequency band spectrum envelope.Can consider the high frequency band spectrum envelope by shape and gain (perhaps equally, energy) formation.
For example, by a kind of mode, by means of estimating high frequency band spectrum envelope shape by codebook mapping from narrow band spectrum envelope estimation broader frequency spectrum envelope.Then, estimate high-band energy by the energy in the arrowband part that is adjusted at the broader frequency spectrum envelope with the energy of coupling narrow band spectrum envelope.In this mode, high frequency band spectrum envelope shape is determined high-band energy, and any mistake in estimating shape also will correspondingly affect the estimation of high-band energy.
In another kind of mode, estimate respectively high frequency band spectrum envelope shape and high-band energy, and adjust the last high frequency band spectrum envelope that uses, with the high-band energy of coupling estimation.By a kind of relevant mode, use the high-band energy of the estimation except other parameters to determine high frequency band spectrum envelope shape.Yet, may not guarantee that the high frequency band spectrum envelope that obtains has suitable high-band energy.Therefore, need additional step that the energy adjusting of high frequency band spectrum envelope is arrived estimated value.Unless pay special attention to, this mode is created in discontinuous in the broader frequency spectrum envelope with the boundary between arrowband and high frequency band.Although for bandwidth expansion, and the existing mode successful of particularly estimating for high band envelope, at least some application arranged, these modes may not produce the voice that obtain of suitable quality.
In order to generate the voice of the bandwidth expansion that can accept quality, should be minimized in the number of the manual signal (artifact) in such voice.The excessive estimation of known high-band energy causes the manual signal of trouble.The incorrect estimation of high frequency band spectrum envelope shape also may cause manual signal, but these manual signals are usually not too serious, and is covered by narrowband speech easily.

Embodiment
Instruction discussed here is for a kind of cost-efficient method and system for artificial bandwidth expansion.According to such instruction, receive the narrow-band digital sound signal.For example, the narrow-band digital sound signal can be the signal that receives via movement station in cellular network, and the narrow-band digital sound signal can comprise the voice in the frequency range of 300-3400Hz.It is to comprise such as the low band frequencies of 100-300Hz and such as the high-band frequency of 3400-8000Hz that the artificial bandwidth expansion technology is implemented as spread spectrum with digital audio and video signals.By utilize artificial bandwidth expansion with spread spectrum for comprising low band frequencies and high-band frequency, produce the more digital audio and video signals of natural pronunciation, this signal is more pleasant for the user of the movement station of realizing this technology.
In the artificial bandwidth expansion technology, based on the prior imformation that obtains from speech database and store and available narrow band information, the artificially generates the information of losing in high frequency band (3400-8000Hz) and the lower band (100-300Hz), and add it to narrow band signal, with synthetic pseudo-broadband signal.Because require the change to the minimum of existing transmission system, so such solution is very attractive.For example, do not need extra bit rate.Therefore artificial bandwidth expansion can be incorporated in the after-treatment component at receiving end place, and is independent of the speech coding technology that uses in the communication system or the character of communication system itself, for example simulation, digital, wire over ground or honeycomb.For example, can realize the artificial bandwidth expansion technology by the movement station that receives the narrow-band digital sound signal, and utilize the broadband signal that obtains to generate the audio frequency of playing to the user of movement station.
When definite high frequency band information, at first estimate the energy in the high frequency band.Utilize the subset of narrow band signal to estimate high-band energy.Subset near the narrow band signal of high-band frequency has the correlativity the highest with high-frequency band signals usually.Therefore, only utilize the subset of arrowband rather than whole arrowband to estimate high-band energy.Employed subset is called " transitional zone ", and can comprise the frequency such as 2500-3400Hz.More specifically, transitional zone is defined as is included in the arrowband and near the frequency band of high frequency band here, that is, its is with the transition of accomplishing high frequency band.This mode is different from the bandwidth extension system of prior art, and the bandwidth extension system of prior art is estimated high-band energy according to the energy in the whole arrowband, is generally ratio.
In order to estimate high-band energy, at first estimate the transitional zone energy via following technology about Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 discussion.For example, can be at first by the input narrow band signal is carried out up-sampling, calculate up-sampling narrow band signal frequency spectrum and then the energy phase Calais of the spectrum component in the transitional zone is calculated the transitional zone energy of transitional zone.Subsequently, the transitional zone energy of estimating is inserted in the Polynomial Equality as independent variable estimate high-band energy.Select coefficient or the weight of the different powers of the independent variable in the Polynomial Equality (to comprise zero power, namely, constant term, coefficient or weight) come to minimize the actual value of high-band energy and the mean square deviation between the estimated value at a large amount of frames from the training utterance database.As following discussed in detail, by regulating the estimation of the parameter that obtains to the parameter that obtains from narrow band signal and from the transitional zone signal, can further improve accuracy of estimation.After having estimated high-band energy, estimate the high frequency band frequency spectrum based on high-band energy.
By utilizing transitional zone in this mode, a kind of firm bandwidth expansion technique is provided, to compare with sound signal possible when estimating high-band energy with the energy in the whole arrowband, this technology produces higher-quality corresponding sound signal.In addition, because bandwidth expansion technique is applicable to the narrow band signal that receives via communication system, so can in the situation that the existing communication system is not had excessive adverse effect, utilize this technology, that is, can utilize the existing communication system to send narrow band signal.
Fig. 1 illustrates the process 100 that is used for generating the bandwidth expansion digital audio and video signals according to various embodiments of the present invention.At first, at operation 101 places, receive the narrow-band digital sound signal.In typical application arranged, this operation comprised a plurality of frames of the content that provides such.These instructions are easy to process each such frame according to above-mentioned steps.For example, by a kind of mode, each such frame can be corresponding with the 10-40 millisecond of original audio content.
This can comprise, for example, provides the digital audio and video signals that comprises synthetic sound content.For example, this is the voice content of the sound encoder that receives in the being combined in portable radio communication device situation when adopting these instructions.Yet, those skilled in the art will appreciate that also to have other possibilities.For example, digital audio and video signals may alternatively comprise the version of the resampling of primary speech signal or primary speech signal or synthetic voice content.
With reference now to Fig. 2,, should be appreciated that this digital audio and video signals relates to certain original audio signal 201, it has the signal bandwidth 202 of original correspondence.The signal bandwidth 202 of the correspondence that this is original is usually greater than the aforesaid signal bandwidth corresponding with digital audio and video signals.For example, when digital audio and video signals only represents the part 203 of original audio signal 201 and other parts of original audio signal 201 when staying outside the frequency band, this may occur.In illustrated illustrated examples, this comprises low-frequency band part 204 and highband part 205.Those skilled in the art will recognize that this example only is used for the illustrative purpose, and the part of not expression can only comprise low-frequency band part or highband part.During arranging, the application of midband that the part that these instructions also are applicable to not represent therein drops on the part (not shown) of two or more expressions uses.
Therefore, understand easily, the not part (a plurality of) of expression of original audio signal 201 comprises that these existing instructions may reasonably manage to replace or the content of expression otherwise in some reasonable and acceptable modes.It is also understood that this signal bandwidth only takies the part of the Nyquist bandwidth of being determined by the correlated sampling frequency.This so be understood as that the frequency field that wherein will realize the bandwidth expansion expected further be provided.
Return with reference to figure 1,102 places process input digital audio signal in operation, to generate the digital audio and video signals of processing.By a kind of mode, the processing at operation 102 places is the up-sampling operation.By another kind of mode, it can be simple unity gain system, and this system's output is equaled input.At operation 103 places, bring based on the transition of the digital audio and video signals of the processing in the predetermined upper limiting frequency scope of narrow band bandwidth and to estimate the high-band energy level corresponding with input digital audio signal.
By using the transitional zone component as the basis of estimating, obtain to estimate more accurately than common resulting estimation when jointly estimating the energy value of high band component with all arrowband components.By a kind of mode, use the high-band energy value to visit look-up table, to determine the high frequency band spectrum envelope, i.e. the suitable high frequency band spectrum envelope shape at correct energy level place, described look-up table comprises candidate's high frequency band spectrum envelope shape of a plurality of correspondences.
Then, this process 100 merges 104 with digital audio and video signals with the high frequency band content corresponding with the frequency spectrum of the energy value of estimating and high band component alternatively, so that the bandwidth expansion version of the narrow-band digital sound signal that will present to be provided.Added the high band component of estimating although process shown in Figure 1 only illustrates, will be appreciated that, can also estimate low frequency band component and itself and narrow-band digital sound signal merged, with the broadband signal of generation bandwidth expansion.
When be current with the form of can listening, compare with original narrow-band digital sound signal, the bandwidth expansion sound signal that obtains (obtaining by input digital audio signal and the outer content of the artificial signal bandwidth that generates are merged) has the audio quality of improvement.By a kind of mode, this can comprise and will merge about mutual two items not to be covered of its spectral content.Under these circumstances, such merging can be adopted and for example two (or a plurality of) segmentations be linked simply or the form of gang otherwise.By another kind of mode, if expectation, high-band bandwidth content and/or low-band bandwidth content can have the part in the respective signal bandwidth of digital audio and video signals.By the lap of high-band bandwidth content and/or low-band bandwidth content and the corresponding band of digital audio and video signals were merged in inner minute, such overlap at least some application and can be used for smoothing and emergence are carried out in the transition from a part to another part in arranging.
Those skilled in the art will recognize that, with multiple can with and/or the platform of easily configuration in any one easily realize said process, this platform comprises the programmable platform of a part or whole part known in the field or may expect dedicated platform for some application.With reference now to Fig. 3,, will provide now the illustrative approach for such platform.
In this illustrated examples, in equipment 300, the processor 301 of selection operationally is coupled to input end 302, and this input end 302 is configured and is arranged to receive the digital audio and video signals with corresponding signal bandwidth.When equipment 300 comprises the wireless two-way communication device, can provide such digital audio and video signals by the receiver 303 of correspondence well known in the art.Under these circumstances, for example, digital audio and video signals can comprise the synthetic sound content that the voice content of the sound encoder that basis receives forms.
As mentioned above, by a kind of mode, aforementioned high-band energy value can be used for the look-up table that convenient access comprises candidate's spectrum envelope shape of a plurality of correspondences.In order to support such method, if expectation, this equipment can also comprise one or more look-up tables 304, and these one or more look-up tables 304 operationally are coupled to processor 301.In the situation of so configuration, processor 301 can easily be accessed look-up table 304 in due course.
Those skilled in the art will be familiar with and understand, and such equipment 300 can be made of a plurality of physically different elements of as shown in Figure 3 diagram suggestion.Yet, this diagram can also be regarded as and comprise logical view, in this case, can allow and realize one or more in these elements via shared platform.It is also understood that such shared platform can comprise the whole or at least part of programmable platform as being known in the art.
Will be appreciated that above-mentioned processing can be carried out by the movement station that carries out radio communication with the base station.For example, the base station can be transmitted into movement station with the narrow-band digital sound signal via traditional approach.In case receive this narrow-band digital sound signal, the processor (a plurality of) in the movement station generates the bandwidth expansion version of digital audio and video signals with regard to carrying out necessary operation, and its user for movement station is clearer and more pleasant acoustically.
With reference now to Fig. 4,, at first uses 401 couples of input narrowband speech s with the 8kHz sampling of corresponding up-sampler

Carry out inverse filtering, to obtain the LP residual signals
Wherein, n is sample index.
In typical application arranges, can carry out on basis frame by frame
Can also directly calculate the 2P rank LP parameter of inverse filtering operation from the narrowband speech of up-sampling.Yet this mode may improve calculating LP parameter and inverse filtering operates the complicacy of the two, and not necessarily improves performance under the certain operations condition.
Next, come the residual signals to LP with full wave rectifier 405
Carry out full-wave rectification, and (for example, use have the Hi-pass filter (HPF) 406 to the passband between the 8000Hz at 3400Hz) carry out high-pass filtering to the result, to obtain the residual signals rr of high frequency band rectification
HbSimultaneously, also high-pass filtering 408 is carried out in the output of pseudo-random noise source 407, to obtain high band noise signal n
HbAlternatively, the noise sequence of high-pass filtering can be pre-stored in the buffer (for example, circular buffer) and conduct interviews when needed to generate n
HbUse such buffer to eliminate with real-time pseudo noise is sampled and carry out the calculating that high-pass filtering is associated.Then, according to by estimate and the horizontal v of sounding (voicing) that control module (ECM) 410 (below will describe in more detail this module) provides in mixer 409 to these two signals rr namely
HbAnd n
HbMix.In this illustrated examples, the scope from 0 to 1 of the horizontal v of this sounding, wherein, 0 indication voiceless sound level, and the level of the full voiced sound of 1 indication.Mixer 409 forms in fact the weighted sum of two input signals in its output place after having identical energy level guaranteeing that two input signals are adjusted to.Mixer output signal m

Those skilled in the art will recognize that other mixing rules also are possible.Can also be at first to two signals, that is, LP residual signals and the pseudo-random noise signal of full-wave rectification mix, and then the signal that mixes are carried out high-pass filtering.In this case, the single Hi-pass filter with output place that places mixer 409 substitutes two Hi- pass filters 406 and 408.
Then, the signal m that uses 411 pairs of pretreaters of high frequency band (HB) excitation to obtain

Bwe
Those skilled in the art are to be understood that and recognize, by this specific illustrated examples, according to the sounding level excitation of high frequency band rectification residual error and high band noise excitation are mixed.When the sounding level be the indication unvoiced speech 0 the time, exclusively use noise excitation.Similarly, when the sounding level be the indication voiced speech 1 the time, exclusively use high frequency band rectification residual error excitation.When the sounding level the voice of indication confluent articulation 0 and 1 between the time, come two excitations are mixed and use according to the determined proper proportion of sounding level.Therefore, the high band excitation of mixing is suitable for the sound of voiced sound, voiceless sound and confluent articulation.
Should further understand and appreciate, in this illustrated examples, synthesize with equalization filter
Input signal
It should be recognized by those skilled in the art that except LP analyzes, exist additive method to obtain the spectrum envelope of given speech frame, for example, the piecewise linearity of spectrum amplitude peak value or higher-order curve, cepstral analysis etc.
Those skilled in the art it should also be appreciated that conduct is to input signal
Above-mentioned for the synthesis of
equalization filter 413 is zero, so the different frequency component of balanced device output is aimed in time with the respective components of input.Because the residual error high band excitation ex of rectification
HbThe narrowband speech of high-energy segmentation (such as, larynx pulse segmentation) and the up-sampling of balanced device input
Corresponding high-energy segmentation aim in time, and usually be used for guaranteeing good voice quality keeping of this time alignment of balanced device output place, so this helps voiced speech; Ii) input of equalization filter 413 does not need to have the smooth frequency spectrum in the situation of LP composite filter; Iii) in frequency domain, specify equalization filter 413, and therefore better the and meticulousr control on the different piece of frequency spectrum is feasible; And iv) can carry out iteration and improve filtration efficiency (for example, balanced device output can be fed back to input repeatedly to carry out equilibrium, to improve performance) take extra complicacy and delay as cost.
Some additional details about described configuration will be proposed now.
The high band excitation pre-service: the amplitude response of equalization filter 413 is by SE

Mb(ω) near desirable spectrum envelope SE
Wb(ω), balanced device is just easier proofreaies and correct the input spectrum envelope for mating desirable spectrum envelope.At least one function of high band excitation pretreater 411 is to make SE
Mb(ω) more near SE
Wb(ω), and therefore make the work of equalization filter 413 easier.At first, this passes through mixer output signal m
HbAdjust to the horizontal E of correct high-band energy that ECM 410 provides
HbFinish.Then, alternatively to mixer output signal m
HbCarry out shaping, so that in the situation that does not affect its phase spectrum, the high frequency band spectrum envelope SE that its spectrum envelope coupling ECM 410 provides
HbSecond step can comprise the preequalization step in fact.
Lower band excitation: from caused by the limit bandwidth that applies by sample frequency at least in part in high frequency band information lose different, information loses at least that major part is because the frequency band limits effect of channel transfer functions (comprises in the low-frequency band of narrow band signal (0-300Hz), for example, microphone, amplifier, speech coder, transmission channel etc.) due to.Therefore, in clean narrow band signal, low-frequency band information still exists, but is in extremely low level.Can amplify this low-level information in the mode of direct (straight forward), to recover original signal.But in this process, should be noted that because low-level information is subject to the destruction of error, noise and distortion easily.A kind of replacement scheme is to be similar to the synthetic low band excitation signal of aforesaid high band excitation signal.That is, form high frequency band mixer output signal m to be similar to

Sounding horizontal estimated: in order to estimate the sounding level, zero crossing counter 501 following calculating narrowband speech s
NbEach frame in the number of zero crossing zc:
Wherein
N is sample index, and N is the frame sign in the sampling.Those that be convenient to use in the frame sign that will be among the ECM 410 uses and the overlapping maintenance of number percent and equalization filter 413 and the analysis filter block are identical, for example, with reference to aforesaid illustrative value, T=20ms, sampling N=160 for 8kHz, for the sampling N=320 of 16kHz, and overlapping be 50%.The zc range of parameter values from 0 to 1 of as above calculating.From the zc parameter, sounding horizontal estimated device 502 can the horizontal v of following estimation sounding:

In order to estimate high-band energy, transitional zone energy estimator 504 is from the narrow band voice signal of up-sampling
Be the transitional zone ENERGY E of dB from unit
Tb, estimate that according to following formula unit is the high-band energy of dB:
E
hb0＝αE
tb+β，
Wherein, select factor alpha and β to be minimized in from the actual value of the high-band energy on a large amount of frames of training utterance database and the square error between the estimated value.
Can further improve accuracy of estimation by adopting the context information from extra speech parameter, this extra speech parameter such as zero crossing parameter zc and the transitional zone spectrum slope parameter s 1 that can be provided by transitional zone slope estimator 505.Aforesaid zero crossing Parametric Representation speech utterance level.The ratio of the change of the spectrum energy in the Slope Parameters indication transitional zone.Can be by means of for example by linear regression the spectrum envelope in the transitional zone (unit is dB) being approximately straight line and calculating its slope and come from arrowband LP parameter A
NbEstimate Slope Parameters.Then, the zc-s1 parameter plane is divided into a plurality of zones, and is that factor alpha and β are selected separately in each zone.For example, if the scope of zc and s1 parameter all is divided into 8 equal intervals, then the zc-s1 parameter plane is divided into 64 zones, and selects 64 groups of α and beta coefficient, each regional one group.
By another kind of mode (not shown among Fig. 5), the further improvement of following realization accuracy of estimation.Note, as substituting of Slope Parameters s1 (it is that the first rank of spectrum envelope in the transitional zone represent), can adopt high resolving power more to represent to improve the performance of high-band energy estimator.For example, can use the vector quantization of transitional zone spectrum envelope shape (unit is dB) to represent.As an illustrated examples, vector quantizer (VQ) code book comprises 64 shapes, and these 64 shapes are called transitional zone spectrum envelope form parameter tbs, calculate this parameter according to large tranining database.Can replace s1 parameter in the zc-s1 parameter plane with the tbs parameter, with the performance that realizes improving.Yet, by another kind of mode, introduce the 3rd parameter that is called frequency spectrum flatness tolerance sfm.Frequency spectrum flatness tolerance is defined in the geometrical mean of the narrow band spectrum envelope (unit is dB) of (for example 300-3400Hz) in the suitable frequency range and the ratio of arithmetic mean.How smooth sfm parameter indication spectrum envelope have---and scope is approximately 0 to 1 of fully smooth envelope from what the peak envelope arranged in this example.The sfm parameter also relates to the sounding level of voice, but different from the mode of zc.In a kind of mode, three-dimensional zc-sfm-tbs parameter space is divided into following a plurality of zone.The zc-sfm plane is divided into 12 zones, thereby in three dimensions, produces 12 * 64=768 possible zone.Yet, be not that all these zones have enough data points from tranining database.Therefore, for a lot of application settings, the number in useful zone being restricted to about 500, and is that each of these zones is selected independent one group of α and beta coefficient.
High-band energy estimator 506 can be by estimating E
Hb0The E of the higher power of middle use
TbThe extra improvement of accuracy of estimation aspect is provided, for example,
E

tb+β
In this case, for each subregion (alternatively, being each subregion of zc-sfm-tbs parameter space) of zc-s1 parameter plane is selected 5 different coefficients, that is, and α

Hb0Above equation (with reference to the 69th section and the 74th section) be nonlinear, so must pay special attention to the change according to the input signal level, that is, the high-frequency energy of estimation is adjusted in the change of energy.A kind of mode that realizes this point is to estimate that unit is the input signal level of dB, adjusts up or down E
TbWith corresponding with the nominal signal level, estimate E
Hb0, and adjust up or down E
Hb0With corresponding with the actual signal level.
Although above-mentioned high-band energy method of estimation can be extraordinary for most of frames, exist once in a while its high-band energy is seriously over-evaluated or the frame of substantially understate.Can proofread and correct at least in part such evaluated error by the energy track smoother 507 that comprises smoothing filter.Can design smoothing filter, so that allow the actual transition transition of voiced segments and voiceless sound segmentation (for example) in the energy track to pass through insusceptibly, but the correction gross error once in a while in other smoothing energy tracks in voiced segments or voiceless sound segmentation for example.For this reason, suitable wave filter is median filter, for example, and described 3 median filters of following equation:
E
hb1(k)＝median(E
hb0(k-1)，E
hb0(k)，E
hb0(k+1))
Wherein, k is frame index, and median (.) operational symbol is selected the intermediate value of its three independents variable.These 3 median filters are introduced the delay of a frame.Can also be designed for the wave filter that postpones or do not have the other types of delay that has of smoothing energy track.
Can be by energy adapter 508 further adaptive level and smooth energy value E
Hb1, estimate E to obtain final adaptive high-band energy
HbThis adaptive can relating to: reduce or improve level and smooth energy value based on d parameter and/or the horizontal parameter v of sounding by onset/plosive detecting device 503 outputs.By a kind of mode, because the selection of high frequency band frequency spectrum may depend on the energy of estimation, so adaptive high-band energy value not only changes this energy level, also change the spectrum envelope shape.
Based on the horizontal parameter v of sounding, can following realization energy adaptive.For the v=0 corresponding with unvoiced frames, increase a little level and smooth energy value E
Hb1, for example, increase 3dB, to obtain adaptive energy value E
HbCompare with the arrowband input, the energy level of increase is emphasized the unvoiced speech in bandwidth expansion output, and helps to select for the more suitable spectrum envelope shape of voiceless sound segmentation.For the v=1 corresponding with unvoiced frame, the energy value E that slight reduction is level and smooth
Hb1, for example, reduce 6dB, to obtain adaptive energy value E
HbThe energy level of slight reduction helps to cover to any error in the selection of the spectrum envelope shape of voiced segments and the noise manual signal that obtains.
When the horizontal v of sounding is between corresponding with the confluent articulation frame 0 and 1, do not carry out the adaptive of energy value.Such confluent articulation frame only represents the sub-fraction in all frames, and not adaptive energy value is applicable to such frame well.Based on the output d of onset/plosive detecting device, the following energy that carries out is adaptive.When d=1, frame corresponding to indication comprises onset, for example, and from the transition of mourn in silence voiceless sound or voiced sound, perhaps such as the plosive of/t/.In this case, the high-band energy of particular frame and a rear frame is adapted to be very low value, so that its high-band energy content is low in the bandwidth expansion voice.This helps avoid the manual signal of the chance that is associated with such frame.For d=0, do not carry out the further adaptive of energy; That is, the aforesaid energy based on the horizontal v of sounding of reservation is adaptive.
Next, broader frequency spectrum envelope SE is described

Narrow band spectrum estimator 509 can be from the narrowband speech of up-sampling
In above-mentioned equation, by ω=2 π f/2F
sProvide the angular frequency in radian/sampling, wherein, f is that unit is the signal frequency of Hz, and F
sThat unit is the sample frequency of Hz.Note spectrum envelope SE

As an illustrated examples about this point, followingly calculate SE with FFT

UsnbFrequency resolution be 16000/1024=15.625Hz.From SE
Usnb, only estimate narrow band spectrum envelope SE by extracting simply spectrum amplitude in the approximate range 300-3400Hz
Nb
It should be recognized by those skilled in the art that except LP analyzes to also have additive method to obtain the spectrum envelope of given speech frame, for example, the piecewise linearity of cepstral analysis, spectrum amplitude peak value or more luminance curve match etc.
High frequency band spectral estimator 510 as input, and is selected the high frequency band spectrum envelope shape consistent with the high-band energy of estimation with the estimation of high-band energy.Next, technology from the corresponding different high frequency band spectrum envelope shapes of different high-band energies describe to be proposed.
Large tranining database with the broadband voice of 16kHz sampling begins, and the LP of Application standard analyzes or other technologies are calculated the broader frequency spectrum amplitude envelops for each speech frame.From the broader frequency spectrum envelope of each frame, extract the highband part corresponding with 3400-8000Hz with normalization by the spectrum amplitude divided by 3400Hz.Therefore, the high frequency band spectrum envelope that obtains has the amplitude of 0dB at 3400Hz.Next, calculate the high-band energy corresponding with each normalized high band envelope.Then, the set of dividing the high frequency band spectrum envelope based on high-band energy, for example, the nominal energy value sequence of selecting to differ 1dB is contained gamut, and all envelopes with the energy in nominal value 0.5dB are grouped in together.
For each grouping of formation like this, calculate mean height band spectrum envelope shape, and calculate subsequently corresponding high-band energy.In Fig. 6, show one group 60 the high frequency band spectrum envelope shapes 600 (wherein unit is that the amplitude of dB is the frequency of Hz to unit) of different-energy level.Begin counting from accompanying drawing bottom, use with the similar technology of aforementioned techniques obtain first, the tenth, the 20, the 30, the 40, the 50 and the 60 's shape (being called precalculated shape here).By obtaining remaining 53 shape carrying out simple linear interpolation (in the dB territory) between the nearest in advance calculating shape.
The energy range of these shapes is from about 43.5dB of 60 shapes of 4.5dB to the of about first shape.In the situation of the high-frequency energy that provides frame, the high frequency band spectrum envelope shape that is chosen in the immediate coupling that will describe after a while herein is simple question.Selected shape is with the high frequency band spectrum envelope SE that estimates
HbBe expressed as constant.In Fig. 6, average energy resolution is approximately 0.65dB.Obviously, can also obtain better resolution by increasing the shape number.In the situation of the shape in providing Fig. 6, the selection of the shape of particular energy is unique.It is also conceivable that for given energy has situation more than one shape, and for example, 4 shapes of each energy level, and in this case need extra information to select in 4 shapes of each given energy level one.In addition, can have many group shapes, wherein each group is carried out index by high-band energy, for example, can be by two groups of shapes of sounding parameter v selection, one group is used for unvoiced frame, and another group is used for unvoiced frames.For the confluent articulation frame, can suitably merge two shapes from two groups, selecting.
Above-mentioned high frequency band spectrum estimating method provides some obvious advantages.For example, this mode provides the clear and definite control to the time evolution of high frequency band spectrum estimation.The different phonetic segmentation usually is important such as the smooth evolution of the high frequency band spectrum estimation in voiced speech, the unvoiced speech etc. for prosthetic signal bandwidth extended voice.For above-mentioned high frequency band spectrum estimating method, be apparent that from Fig. 6 the little change in high-band energy causes the little change in high frequency band spectrum envelope shape.Therefore, can also be the level and smooth smooth evolution that guarantees the high frequency band frequency spectrum by the time evolution that guarantees different phonetic segmentation medium-high frequency band energy in fact.This realizes clearly by aforesaid energy smooth trajectory.
Note, for example by using in measuring such as the log spectrum distortion or based on the known spectral distance of the plate storehouse distortion of LP any one to come change in the narrowband speech frequency spectrum of frame ground tracking narrowband speech frequency spectrum one by one or up-sampling, can with in addition thinner resolution identify and wherein finished the level and smooth clearly voice segment of energy.Use this mode, different voice segments can be defined as the sequence of frame, in this sequence, the slow evolution of frequency spectrum, and change the frame that surpasses fixing or adaptive threshold value by the frequency spectrum that wherein calculates and sort out in every side, thereby indicate the either side of this different voice segment to have the frequency spectrum transition.Then, in this different voice segment, but do not cross section boundaries, come the energy track is carried out smoothing.
Here, the smooth evolution of high-band energy track changes the smooth evolution of the high frequency band spectrum envelope of estimation into, and this is the different interior ideal behavior of voice segment.Also note, be used for guaranteeing the post-processing step of sequence of the high frequency band spectrum envelope of the estimation that this mode of the smooth evolution of the high frequency band spectrum envelope in the different phonetic segmentation also can obtain by art methods with opposing.Yet, in this case, in different voice segments, needing the high frequency band spectrum envelope is carried out clear and definite smoothing, this DIRECT ENERGY smoothing track from the current instruction of the smooth evolution that automatically causes the high frequency band spectrum envelope is different.
The losing of the information of the narrow band voice signal the low-frequency band (in this illustrated examples can from 0Hz to 300Hz) is not owing to causing such as the limit bandwidth that is applied by sample frequency in the situation in the high frequency band, but since the frequency band limits effect (for example comprising microphone, amplifier, speech coder, transmission channel etc.) of channel transfer functions cause.
Then, recover the direct mode counteracting of low band signal in the effect of this channel transfer functions in the scope of 0Hz to 300Hz.The plain mode of realizing this point is to estimate to obtain channel transfer functions from the frequency range of 0Hz to 300Hz its inverse, and promote the spectrum envelope of the narrowband speech of up-sampling with this inverse from data available with low-frequency band spectral estimator 511.That is, with low-frequency band spectrum envelope SE
1bBe estimated as SE
UsnbThe spectrum envelope that designs with inverse from channel transfer functions promotes characteristic SE
BoostAnd (the spectrum envelope amplitude is expressed in supposition in log-domain, for example, dB).For a lot of application settings, at design SE
BoostIn time, should be noted that.Because the recovery of low band signal is based in fact the amplification of low level signal, so it relates to the risk of amplifying the error, noise and the distortion that usually are associated with low level signal.According to the quality of low level signal, should suitably limit the maximum lift value.And in the scope from 0Hz to about 60Hz, expectation is with SE
BoostBe designed to have low (even bearing i.e. decay) value, to avoid amplification electron buzz and ground unrest.
Then, broader frequency spectrum estimator 512 is estimated the broader frequency spectrum envelope by the spectrum envelope that can merge the estimation in arrowband, high frequency band and the low-frequency band.It is as described below to merge a kind of mode that these three kinds of envelopes estimate the broader frequency spectrum envelope.
