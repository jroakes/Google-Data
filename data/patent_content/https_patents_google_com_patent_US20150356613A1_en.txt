- a hotel in Seattle can be provided with the turn-by-turn directions from San Francisco to Seattle.
- a mode of transportation is a manner by which a person (or other physical object) travels between geographic locations, such as cars, trains, buses, and/or airplanes.
- Promotional information associated with modes of transportation can be provided with maps and/or directions, and can be selected based on the maps and/or directions with which the promotional information is being provided. For example, if a client computing device submits an electronic request for a driving direction from San Francisco to Seattle, promotional information associated with modes of transportation for travelling from San Francisco to Seattle can be provided with and selected based on the driving directions. For instance, an ad for flights from San Francisco to Seattle can be provided with the driving directions from San Francisco to Seattle.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving at a server system a request from a client computing device for directions from a start geographic location to a destination geographic location; and identifying by the server system at least one mode of transportation from a plurality of modes of transportation for traveling from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.
- the method can also include selecting by the server system promotional information related to the identified at least one mode of transportation to provide to the client computing device; and providing by the server system and to the client computing device the selected promotional information with directions to guide a user of the client computing device from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.
- a system for providing promotional information to a client computing device in response to a request for directions includes one or more servers, and an interface for the one or more servers to receive a request from the client computing device for directions from a start geographic location to a destination geographic location.
- the system can also include a mode of transportation component to identify at least one mode of transportation for traveling from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.

- users can be provided with more relevant promotional information.
- a user who is interested in travelling from a start location to a destination location may be more interested in promotional information related to a mode of transportation from the start location to the destination location than in an alternate start and/or destination location—the user already knows that he/she wants to travel from point A to point B and may have little interest in promotional information related to point C.
- the user can be provided with promotional information that may provide options for travelling from point A to point B that the user may not have known about.
- parties whose services/products related to modes of transportation that are being promoted in promotional information may be more likely to reach interested users. Users may be more likely to select such promotional information and ultimately purchase/use the promoted service/product based on the promotional information that is more contextually relevant to users (e.g., promotional information related to a mode of transportation from a start to a destination location with directions from the start location to the destination location), as indicated above.
- promotional information related to a mode of transportation from a start to a destination location with directions from the start location to the destination location
- parties who provide promotional information for presentation to users may experience an increased benefit, such as increased revenue, by providing promotional information related to modes of transportation.
- promotional information related to modes of transportation may receive revenue when users viewing promotional information convert promotional information views (e.g., select a link provided with the promotional information to receive more information, interact with the promotional information, etc.).
- Users provided with more relevant promotional information related to modes of transportation may be more interested in such promotional information, as indicated above, and may be more likely to seek additional information by converting the promotional information into revenue for the promotional information provider.

- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- This document generally describes techniques, methods, systems, and computer program products for providing promotional information (e.g., ads, public service announcements, etc.) related to modes of transportation (e.g., car, bus, airplane, boat, etc.) for traveling from a start location to a destination location. More specifically, this document describes techniques, methods, systems, and computer program products for providing mode of transportation-related promotional information for display with electronic documents and/or applications related to traveling from a start location to a destination location (e.g., browser-based maps and/or driving directions, travel reservation web pages, travel related mobile phone applications, etc.).
- promotional information e.g., ads, public service announcements, etc.
- modes of transportation e.g., car, bus, airplane, boat, etc.
- a user requests driving directions from the user's home address in San Francisco (an example start location) to a friend's home address in Los Angeles (an example destination location) from a website that provides a map and driving directions service (e.g., YAHOO! MAPS, BING MAPS).
- a web page e.g., HTML document
- Ads related to the San Francisco and/or Los Angeles may be included with the driving directions and the map on the web page. For instance, the user may be presented with an ad for a hotel in Los Angeles.
- location-based ads that promote alternate start or destination locations may be irrelevant to a user who is interested in traveling from a specific start location to a specific destination location.
- the ad for the hotel in Los Angeles promotes an alternate destination location to the user—the hotel in Los Angeles instead of the friend's home in Los Angeles.
- the user is interested in finding out how to travel from the user's home in San Francisco (start location) to the friend's home in Los Angeles (destination location), not in identifying a different destination location.
- a user who is interested in traveling between locations may find promotional information that is related to a mode of transportation for traveling between the locations to be more relevant than promotional information that is related to an alternate location. For instance, referring to the previous example, instead of presenting the user with an ad for a hotel in Los Angeles with the requested driving directions, the user can be presented with an ad regarding airfare for flying roundtrip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Given that the user is interested in figuring out how to travel between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the user may be more interested in the airfare ad than the hotel ad.
- Transportation-related promotional information can be selected based on location(s) for a map and/or directions with which the promotional information is being provided. For instance, if promotional information is being provided with directions from a start location to a destination location, one or more modes of transportation can be identified based on, at least, the start location and the destination location. For example, if a user has requested directions from San Francisco to Los Angeles, it may be appropriate to provide promotional information related to longer-distance modes of transportation, like airplanes. However, if a user has requested directions from San Francisco to San Jose, Calif., it may be appropriate to provide promotional information related to shorter-distance modes of transportation, like public transportation (e.g., commuter bus and rail lines).
- public transportation e.g., commuter bus and rail lines
- Various criteria can be used to determine which modes of transportation are appropriate (e.g., likely to be of interest to a user) given one or more locations presented on a map and/or directions, such as a distance between locations and/or modes of transportation that are associated with promotional information that was previously selected by users (e.g., indications of modes of transportation that users previously found to be relevant to a map and/or directions).
- Promotional information can be selected to target a mode of transportation that is an alternative to a mode of transportation that is a subject of a map and/or directions. For example, if a user requests directions for driving an automobile from San Francisco to Los Angeles, the user may be more interested in promotional information that provides an alternative to driving an automobile than in promotional information related to driving (e.g., ads for car rentals). For instance, a user can be provided with promotional information regarding alternative modes of transportation from San Francisco to Los Angeles, such as ads for airplane flights and ads for bus fares.
- Modes of transportation can include a variety of ways to travel between locations, such as machine powered modes of transportation (e.g., cars, airplanes) and human powered modes of transportation (e.g., bicycle, walking).
- modes of transportation can include cars, taxis, buses, trains (e.g., AMTRAK, subways, light-rail trains, personal rapid transit, etc.), boats (e.g., ferries, cruise ships, etc.), airplanes, bicycles, walking/hiking, and/or motorcycles.
- trains e.g., AMTRAK, subways, light-rail trains, personal rapid transit, etc.
- boats e.g., ferries, cruise ships, etc.
- airplanes bicycles, walking/hiking, and/or motorcycles.
- Promotional information that is related to modes of transportation can be provided with a variety of documents and/or applications.
- promotional information can be provided with web pages (example documents) displaying maps and/or navigational directions.
- promotional information can be provided with a document that includes results for a search query that is determined to be related to travelling between locations. For example, if a user submits the search query “England trip” to a search engine, the search query can be determined to be related to travelling from the user's current geographic location (e.g., city, geographic positioning system (GPS) coordinates, country, street address, etc.) to England.
- GPS geographic positioning system
- a user's geographic location can be determined from any of a variety of techniques, such as associations between a user's internet protocol (IP) address and geographic location, GPS information, and/or wireless signal (e.g., cellular network signal, 3G/4G signal) triangulation.
- IP internet protocol
- GPS information e.g., GPS information
- wireless signal e.g., cellular network signal, 3G/4G signal

- the client computing device 100 may have previously received an electronic document (e.g., a web page) and/or an application (e.g., standalone directions application, web browser, etc.) through which the request was generated by a user of the client computing device 100 .
- an application e.g., standalone directions application, web browser, etc.
- a user of the client computing device 100 may have previously requested a directions home page that is hosted by the directions server system 102 and that contains a form that can be used to request directions (e.g., start location field, destination location field, submit button, etc.).
- the client computing device 100 can cause the request to be transmitted to the directions server system 102 .
- the directions server system 102 can begin to serve the request. Serving such a request can include determining the requested directions and selecting promotional information to provide with the directions. As indicated by step B ( 108 ), the directions server system 102 can request promotional information to provide with the driving directions from the promotional information server system 104 .
- the directions server system 102 can include information 109 with the request regarding the directions that the promotional information will be provided with, such as a start location (L.A.) and a destination location (S.F.). Additional information not depicted can be included with the request, such as a mode of transportation for which the map and/or directions are being provided by the directions server system 102 .
- the promotional information server system 104 can identify promotional information to provide with the requested driving directions based on modes of transportation from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
- the promotional information server system 104 can use, at least, the information 109 included in the request and table 112 that associates promotional information with modes of transportation and locations to identify promotional information to provide to the directions server system 102 .
- the table 112 includes entries 114 a - g for promotional information P 1 -P 7 , respectively.
- the entries 114 a - g indicate a mode of transportation that is associated with promotional information (e.g., a mode of transportation for the product/service being promoted by the promotional information) and information regarding the corresponding promotion (e.g., start location, destination location, price, round-trip or one-way, etc.).
- the table 112 can be part of a data repository (e.g., database) and can include a variety of other fields and/or information, such as a start location field, a destination location field, a timeframe during which the promotion is valid, and/or bids for the opportunity to display the promotional information to a user (e.g., an bid from an advertiser to present an ad to a user).
- the table 112 is depicted as including example entries 114 a - g for promotional information P 1 -P 7 .
- Entry 114 a indicates that promotional information P 1 regards a round-trip bus trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $50
- entry 114 b indicates that promotion P 2 regards a round-trip bus trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas (L.V.) for $70
- Entry 114 c indicates that promotional information P 3 regards round-trip train transportation from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $100.
- Entry 114 d indicates that promotional information P 4 regards one-way airfare from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $100

- Entry 114 g indicates that promotional information P 7 regards an offer for a boat cruise from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and continuing on to Seattle for $300.
- the promotional information server system 104 can determine whether to provide mode of transportation-related promotional information.
- the promotional information server system 104 may be configured to serve a variety of promotional information, including promotional information that is not related to modes of transportation (e.g., location-based promotional information).
- the promotional information server system 104 can determine whether mode of transportation-related promotional information would likely be relevant to a user of the client computing device 100 .
- Such a determination can be based on a variety of factors, such as whether the request from the client computing device 100 relates (explicitly or implicitly) to travelling between locations and/or whether users have previously found mode of transportation-related promotional information to be relevant when presented in response to requests similar to the request from the client computing device 100 .
- a request from the client computing device 100 regarding travelling can indicate that a user of the client computing device 100 is currently interested in modes of transportation between locations.
- the promotional information server system 104 can determine whether a request relates to travelling between locations. For instance, some requests can explicitly relate to travelling between locations, such as a request for directions between locations and a request for airfare information between two locations. Some requests can be determined to implicitly relate to travelling between locations, such as a request for a map and/or a search query for vacation destination (e.g., search query “vacation Mexico”). Start and/or destination locations can be inferred if not specified.
- client computing device 100 located in Boston, Mass. provides a request for a map of New York, N.Y., to the directions server system 102 , the destination location can be identified from the request as New York and the start location can be determined from the current geographic location of the device 100 (Boston).
- Systems other than the directions server system 102 can provide requests for promotional information to the promotional information server system 104 for which mode of transportation-related promotional information is provided.
- a search engine server system (not depicted) can provide requests for promotional information to the promotional information server system 104 .
- the content of a search query can be analyzed to determine, at least in part, whether mode of transportation-related promotional information is likely to be relevant to a user who provided a search query.
- Other server systems not mentioned in this document can also provide requests to the promotional information server system 104 and receive mode of transportation-related promotional information in return.
- the promotional information server system 104 can access user behavior data that indicates how users have interacted with previously provided mode of transportation-related promotional information. Interaction can include a variety user action, such as a user clicking on a link provided with the promotional information, a user selecting a play button for a video included with the promotional information, and/or a user playing an interactive game included as part of the promotional information. User interaction with promotional information can indicate that a user has previously found promotional information to be relevant to his/her request (e.g., request for directions, request for a map, search query, etc.).
- User behavior data which is anonymized to protect user privacy, can be used to identify situations (e.g., requests for directions, search queries related to travel, etc.) when users have previously found mode of transportation-related promotional information to be relevant to a request.
- the promotional information server system 104 can present mode of transportation-related promotional information in situations similar to the relevant situations identified based on user behavior data.
- the promotional information server system 104 has provided mode of transportation-related promotional information to a variety of client computing devices in a variety of different situations (e.g., search queries, driving directions, map request, etc.) and that user behavior data is obtained based on user interaction with the promotional information (e.g., unique identifier included in link user selects, etc.). If the user behavior data indicates that user interaction with the mode of transportation-related promotional information has occurred predominantly when a user has received the promotional information in response to a request for driving directions exceeding 300 miles, then the promotional information server system 104 can provide mode of transportation-related promotional information in response to requests for driving directions exceeding 300 miles.
- mode of transportation-related promotional information to a variety of client computing devices in a variety of different situations (e.g., search queries, driving directions, map request, etc.) and that user behavior data is obtained based on user interaction with the promotional information (e.g., unique identifier included in link user selects, etc.). If the user behavior data indicates that user interaction with the mode of transportation-related promotional information has occurred
- Factors for determining when to present mode of transportation-related promotional information may also be employed when appropriate.
- the promotional information server system 104 can select one or more of the promotional information P 1 -P 7 to provide to the directions server system 102 with the requested directions.
- the aim of the promotional information server system 104 can be to select promotional information that is likely to be relevant to the user of the client computing device 100 that is requesting the driving directions.
- the promotional information server system 104 can make such a selection based on a variety of factors, such as whether the promotional information pertains to a mode of transportation for travelling to/from one or more of the locations specified in the request from the client computing device 100 (or other locations within a threshold distance of the specified locations), a distance between the start and destination locations, and/or user behavior data indicating promotional information that users have previously found to be relevant in response to similar requests.
- the promotional information server system 104 can select promotional information that pertains to the start and/or destination location, such as the promotional information P 1 for a bus trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco, as indicated by entry 114 a .
- the promotional information P 2 for a bus trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, as indicated by entry 114 b may not be as relevant to the request from client computing device 100 as promotional information P 1 based on the promotional information P 2 providing an alternate destination location (Las Vegas).
- the promotional information server system 104 can select promotional information based on a distance between a start and destination location. For example, mode of transportation information related to airfare may be provided when a distance between the start and destination locations exceeds a threshold distance, such as 100 miles, 200 miles, 300 miles, 500 miles, and/or 1000 miles. Various distance thresholds associated with one or more modes of transportation can be used to select promotional information. For example, promotional information related to bus travel may be selected when the distance between the start and destinations locations is less than 1000 miles, 500 miles, 250 miles, and/or 150 miles.
- the promotional information server system 104 can use user behavior data to select promotional information to provide to the client computing device 100 . Similar to the discussion of user behavior data above, the promotional information server system 104 can analyze user behavior data to determine which of the promotional information P 1 -P 7 is likely to be relevant given the request from the client computing device 100 . For example, if other users requesting driving directions from Los Angeles to San Francisco (or between locations nearby L.A. and S.F., or between locations separate by a similar distance) have interacted with airfare promotions (e.g., P 4 and P 5 ) with the greatest amount of frequency, then the promotional information server system 104 can select promotional information related to modes of transportation by airplane between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
- airfare promotions e.g., P 4 and P 5
- the promotional information server system 104 can also take into account bids from parties (e.g., advertisers) providing promotional information. For instance, parties may express their interest in having their respective promotional information provided to a user in an amount they are willing to pay to have their promotional information provided to a user. With multiple parties competing for a limited number of opportunities to provide promotional information to a user, a mechanism such as an auction can be used to award opportunities to parties. Auctions can take a variety of forms.
- an auction can take into consideration that relevance and quality of promotional information (e.g., quality of content of promotional information) to balance the interests of parties providing promotional information with the interests of users viewing the promotional information—users would like to see high quality advertisements that are relevant to the users' current interests.
- promotional information can be scored based on an expectation that, given the request from the client computing device 100 , that a user of the client computing device 100 will interact with the promotional information. Such a score can be termed a “click through” rate or score.
- a variety of factors, including those discussed in the examples above, can be used to determine a likelihood that a user will interact with mode of transportation-related promotional information.
- Scores and bids for promotional information can be combined (e.g., multiplied, added, etc.) and the combinations can be ranked.
- Promotional information can be selected based on the ranking (e.g., select the top 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. ranked promotional information) and/or on the combined score (e.g., select promotional information having at least a threshold combined score).
- the promotional information server system 104 selects the promotional information P 1 ( 114 a ) and the promotional information P 5 ( 114 e ) regarding a round-trip bus fare and airfare from Los Angeles to San Francisco, respectively.
- the selection can be based on one or more of the selection techniques described above.
- the promotional information server system 104 can attempt to display alternative modes of transportation from the start location (Los Angeles) to the destination location (San Francisco) to the mode of transportation the user is currently considering for the trip (driving an automobile).
- the promotional information P 1 regarding travelling by bus and the promotional information P 5 regarding travelling by airplane can be selected to provide the user with alternatives to driving between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
- the promotional information server system 104 can provide the selected promotional information P 1 and P 5 ( 118 a - b ) to the directions server system 102 .
- the directions server system 102 can determine directions for the route requested by the client computing device 100 and add the promotional information P 1 and P 5 to the directions (e.g., add code to a web page that causes the promotional information P 1 and P 5 to be retrieved and/or displayed with the directions), as indicated by step E ( 120 ).
- the directions server system 102 provides the directions 124 with the promotional information P 1 and P 5 ( 118 a - b ) to the client computing device 100 for presentation to a user of the client computing device 100 .
- the directions 124 and the promotional information 118 a - b can be provided in any of a variety of electronic data formats, such as HTML, extensible markup language (XML), SHOCKWAVE/FLASH, JAVASCRIPT, and/or HTMLS.
- the directions 124 and the promotional information 118 a - b can be provided (e.g., displayed, audibly played, etc.) to a user of the client computing device 100 .
- An example of the directions 124 and the promotional information 118 a - b being provided on the client computing device 100 is depicted as display 126 .
- the display 126 includes driving directions 128 from Los Angeles to San Francisco (map and turn-by-turn directions).
- the display 126 also includes promotional information 130 for round-trip bus fare from L.A. to S.F.
- the promotional information 130 includes a selectable link 132 (e.g., a hyperlink) that a user of the client computing device 100 can select to receive more information regarding the promotion (e.g., selection can cause the client computing device 100 to request a web page regarding the bus fare promotion).
- the display 126 also includes promotional information 134 regarding round-trip airfare from L.A. to S.F., and a selectable link 136 for the user to request more information regarding the airfare promotion.

- the promotional information server system 306 can provide the selected promotional information to the content server system 304 (step 332 ). In some implementations, the promotional information server system 306 can provide the promotional information to the client computing device 302 instead of to the content server system 304 , as described above with regard to FIG. 2 .
- the content server system 304 receives the promotional information (step 334 ) and combines the promotional information with content that is responsive to the request from the client computing device 302 (step 336 ). For example, code that causes the promotional information to be presented can be added to an electronic document that includes at least a portion of the requested content.
- the promotional information and the content can be provided by the content server system 304 to the client computing device 302 (step 338 ).
- the client computing device can receive and present the content and promotional information (step 340 ). For example, if the client computing device 302 requests web page with driving directions from the content server system 304 , the client computing device 302 can receive a web page with the requested directions and alternative mode of transportation promotional information, like airfare and bus fare promotional information.
- the client computing device 302 can display the web page and promotional information to a user of the client computing device 302 using a variety of hardware and/or software components, such as a display screen, speakers, a web browser application, and/or scripting applications.

The method can also include selecting by the server system promotional information related to the identified at least one mode of transportation to provide to the client computing device; and providing by the server system and to the client computing device the selected promotional information with directions to guide a user of the client computing device from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.
Description
- This document generally describes techniques, methods, and systems for providing promotional information such as advertisements to a client computing device.
- Various computer server systems provide web browser-based map and direction services. With such a system, a client computing device can submit an electronic request over a network (e.g., Internet, local area network (LAN), etc.) to the system and receive an electronic document (e.g., a web page) that includes maps and/or directions (e.g., driving directions, biking directions, walking directions, etc.) in response. For example, a client computing device (e.g., a laptop computer, a smart phone, a mobile phone, a tablet, etc.) can send a request to a computer server system for driving directions from San Francisco to Seattle and receive a web page (e.g., a hypertext markup language (HTML) document, etc.) in return that contains a map with turn-by-turn directions from San Francisco to Seattle.
- Promotional information (e.g., ads, public service announcements, etc.) has been provided in conjunction with such web-based map and direction services. For instance, a web-based advertisement (e.g., HTML code, an image file, interactive application, etc.) for a hotel in Seattle can be provided with the turn-by-turn directions from San Francisco to Seattle.
- This document describes techniques for providing promotional information associated with to modes of transportation (e.g., automobile, airplane, train, etc.). A mode of transportation is a manner by which a person (or other physical object) travels between geographic locations, such as cars, trains, buses, and/or airplanes. Promotional information associated with modes of transportation can be provided with maps and/or directions, and can be selected based on the maps and/or directions with which the promotional information is being provided. For example, if a client computing device submits an electronic request for a driving direction from San Francisco to Seattle, promotional information associated with modes of transportation for travelling from San Francisco to Seattle can be provided with and selected based on the driving directions. For instance, an ad for flights from San Francisco to Seattle can be provided with the driving directions from San Francisco to Seattle.
- In one implementation, a computer-implemented method includes receiving at a server system a request from a client computing device for directions from a start geographic location to a destination geographic location; and identifying by the server system at least one mode of transportation from a plurality of modes of transportation for traveling from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location. The method can also include selecting by the server system promotional information related to the identified at least one mode of transportation to provide to the client computing device; and providing by the server system and to the client computing device the selected promotional information with directions to guide a user of the client computing device from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.
- In another implementation, a system for providing promotional information to a client computing device in response to a request for directions includes one or more servers, and an interface for the one or more servers to receive a request from the client computing device for directions from a start geographic location to a destination geographic location. The system can also include a mode of transportation component to identify at least one mode of transportation for traveling from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location. The system can further include a promotional information module to select promotional information related to the identified at least one mode of transportation and to provide to the client computing device the selected promotional information with directions from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.
- In another implementation, a system for providing promotional information to a client computing device in response to a request for directions includes one or more servers, and an interface for the one or more servers to receive a request from the client computing device for directions from a start geographic location to a destination geographic location. The system can also include means for identifying at least one mode of transportation for traveling from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location. The system can further include a promotional information module to select promotional information related to the identified at least one mode of transportation and to provide to the client computing device the selected promotional information with directions from the start geographic location to the destination geographic location.
- The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Various advantages can be provided. For example, users can be provided with more relevant promotional information. For instance, a user who is interested in travelling from a start location to a destination location may be more interested in promotional information related to a mode of transportation from the start location to the destination location than in an alternate start and/or destination location—the user already knows that he/she wants to travel from point A to point B and may have little interest in promotional information related to point C. Instead, the user can be provided with promotional information that may provide options for travelling from point A to point B that the user may not have known about.
- In another example, parties whose services/products related to modes of transportation that are being promoted in promotional information may be more likely to reach interested users. Users may be more likely to select such promotional information and ultimately purchase/use the promoted service/product based on the promotional information that is more contextually relevant to users (e.g., promotional information related to a mode of transportation from a start to a destination location with directions from the start location to the destination location), as indicated above.
- Additionally, parties who provide promotional information for presentation to users may experience an increased benefit, such as increased revenue, by providing promotional information related to modes of transportation. For instance, such providers may receive revenue when users viewing promotional information convert promotional information views (e.g., select a link provided with the promotional information to receive more information, interact with the promotional information, etc.). Users provided with more relevant promotional information related to modes of transportation may be more interested in such promotional information, as indicated above, and may be more likely to seek additional information by converting the promotional information into revenue for the promotional information provider.
- Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. - Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- This document generally describes techniques, methods, systems, and computer program products for providing promotional information (e.g., ads, public service announcements, etc.) related to modes of transportation (e.g., car, bus, airplane, boat, etc.) for traveling from a start location to a destination location. More specifically, this document describes techniques, methods, systems, and computer program products for providing mode of transportation-related promotional information for display with electronic documents and/or applications related to traveling from a start location to a destination location (e.g., browser-based maps and/or driving directions, travel reservation web pages, travel related mobile phone applications, etc.).
- For example, assume that a user requests driving directions from the user's home address in San Francisco (an example start location) to a friend's home address in Los Angeles (an example destination location) from a website that provides a map and driving directions service (e.g., YAHOO! MAPS, BING MAPS). In response, the user can receive a web page (e.g., HTML document) that includes turn-by-turn directions from the user's home in San Francisco to the friend's home in Los Angeles and a map highlighting the suggested route. Ads related to the San Francisco and/or Los Angeles may be included with the driving directions and the map on the web page. For instance, the user may be presented with an ad for a hotel in Los Angeles.
- However, location-based ads that promote alternate start or destination locations may be irrelevant to a user who is interested in traveling from a specific start location to a specific destination location. For instance, expanding upon the previous example, the ad for the hotel in Los Angeles promotes an alternate destination location to the user—the hotel in Los Angeles instead of the friend's home in Los Angeles. As demonstrated by the user's request for driving directions, the user is interested in finding out how to travel from the user's home in San Francisco (start location) to the friend's home in Los Angeles (destination location), not in identifying a different destination location.
- Instead, a user who is interested in traveling between locations may find promotional information that is related to a mode of transportation for traveling between the locations to be more relevant than promotional information that is related to an alternate location. For instance, referring to the previous example, instead of presenting the user with an ad for a hotel in Los Angeles with the requested driving directions, the user can be presented with an ad regarding airfare for flying roundtrip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Given that the user is interested in figuring out how to travel between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the user may be more interested in the airfare ad than the hotel ad.
- Transportation-related promotional information can be selected based on location(s) for a map and/or directions with which the promotional information is being provided. For instance, if promotional information is being provided with directions from a start location to a destination location, one or more modes of transportation can be identified based on, at least, the start location and the destination location. For example, if a user has requested directions from San Francisco to Los Angeles, it may be appropriate to provide promotional information related to longer-distance modes of transportation, like airplanes. However, if a user has requested directions from San Francisco to San Jose, Calif., it may be appropriate to provide promotional information related to shorter-distance modes of transportation, like public transportation (e.g., commuter bus and rail lines). Various criteria can be used to determine which modes of transportation are appropriate (e.g., likely to be of interest to a user) given one or more locations presented on a map and/or directions, such as a distance between locations and/or modes of transportation that are associated with promotional information that was previously selected by users (e.g., indications of modes of transportation that users previously found to be relevant to a map and/or directions).
- Promotional information can be selected to target a mode of transportation that is an alternative to a mode of transportation that is a subject of a map and/or directions. For example, if a user requests directions for driving an automobile from San Francisco to Los Angeles, the user may be more interested in promotional information that provides an alternative to driving an automobile than in promotional information related to driving (e.g., ads for car rentals). For instance, a user can be provided with promotional information regarding alternative modes of transportation from San Francisco to Los Angeles, such as ads for airplane flights and ads for bus fares.
- Modes of transportation can include a variety of ways to travel between locations, such as machine powered modes of transportation (e.g., cars, airplanes) and human powered modes of transportation (e.g., bicycle, walking). For example, modes of transportation can include cars, taxis, buses, trains (e.g., AMTRAK, subways, light-rail trains, personal rapid transit, etc.), boats (e.g., ferries, cruise ships, etc.), airplanes, bicycles, walking/hiking, and/or motorcycles. These example modes of transportation, as well as other modes of transportation not mentioned, can be used to target promotional information to users.
- Promotional information that is related to modes of transportation can be provided with a variety of documents and/or applications. For example, such promotional information can be provided with web pages (example documents) displaying maps and/or navigational directions. In another example, such promotional information can be provided with a document that includes results for a search query that is determined to be related to travelling between locations. For example, if a user submits the search query “England trip” to a search engine, the search query can be determined to be related to travelling from the user's current geographic location (e.g., city, geographic positioning system (GPS) coordinates, country, street address, etc.) to England. Promotional information related to modes of transportation between the user's current geographic location and England can be provided to the user, such as ads for airplane flights and cruise ships. A user's geographic location can be determined from any of a variety of techniques, such as associations between a user's internet protocol (IP) address and geographic location, GPS information, and/or wireless signal (e.g., cellular network signal, 3G/4G signal) triangulation.

FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram of an example system for providing promotional information with navigational directions based upon modes of transportation.FIG. 1 depicts an exampleclient computing device 100 that requests driving directions from adirections server system 102. As part of serving the request from theclient computing device 100, thedirections server system 102 interacts with a promotionalinformation server system 104 that is configured to select and provide promotional information based on modes of transportation for travelling between the locations specified in the request. - The
client computing device 100, thedirections server system 102, and the promotionalinformation server system 104 can each be any of a variety of computing devices, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a mobile telephone, a smart phone, a computer server system, or any combination thereof. Theclient computing device 100, thedirections server system 102, and the promotionalinformation server system 104 can communicate through any of a variety of communications channels, such as the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a wireless network (e.g., wifi, cellular telephone network, 3G/4G data network, etc.), or any combination thereof. - As depicted at step A (106) in the example, the
client computing device 100 provides a request to thedirections server system 102 for driving directions from Los Angeles (L.A.) to San Francisco (S.F.). Theclient computing device 100 may have previously received an electronic document (e.g., a web page) and/or an application (e.g., standalone directions application, web browser, etc.) through which the request was generated by a user of theclient computing device 100. For example, a user of theclient computing device 100 may have previously requested a directions home page that is hosted by thedirections server system 102 and that contains a form that can be used to request directions (e.g., start location field, destination location field, submit button, etc.). In response to the user of theclient computing device 100 entering Los Angeles and/or San Francisco into the form and performing an action to trigger the request (e.g., select the submit button, complete the fields of the form, etc.), theclient computing device 100 can cause the request to be transmitted to thedirections server system 102. - In response to receiving the request, the
directions server system 102 can begin to serve the request. Serving such a request can include determining the requested directions and selecting promotional information to provide with the directions. As indicated by step B (108), thedirections server system 102 can request promotional information to provide with the driving directions from the promotionalinformation server system 104. Thedirections server system 102 can includeinformation 109 with the request regarding the directions that the promotional information will be provided with, such as a start location (L.A.) and a destination location (S.F.). Additional information not depicted can be included with the request, such as a mode of transportation for which the map and/or directions are being provided by thedirections server system 102. - As indicated by step C (110), the promotional
information server system 104 can identify promotional information to provide with the requested driving directions based on modes of transportation from Los Angeles to San Francisco. The promotionalinformation server system 104 can use, at least, theinformation 109 included in the request and table 112 that associates promotional information with modes of transportation and locations to identify promotional information to provide to thedirections server system 102. In this example, the table 112 includes entries 114 a-g for promotional information P1-P7, respectively. The entries 114 a-g indicate a mode of transportation that is associated with promotional information (e.g., a mode of transportation for the product/service being promoted by the promotional information) and information regarding the corresponding promotion (e.g., start location, destination location, price, round-trip or one-way, etc.). The table 112 can be part of a data repository (e.g., database) and can include a variety of other fields and/or information, such as a start location field, a destination location field, a timeframe during which the promotion is valid, and/or bids for the opportunity to display the promotional information to a user (e.g., an bid from an advertiser to present an ad to a user). - The table 112 is depicted as including example entries 114 a-g for promotional information P1-P7.
Entry 114 a indicates that promotional information P1 regards a round-trip bus trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $50, and entry 114 b indicates that promotion P2 regards a round-trip bus trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas (L.V.) for $70.Entry 114 c indicates that promotional information P3 regards round-trip train transportation from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $100.Entry 114 d indicates that promotional information P4 regards one-way airfare from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $100, andentry 114 e indicates that promotional information P5 regards round-trip airfare from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $150.Entry 114 f indicates that promotional information P6 regards a car rental offer for Los Angeles pickup at a rate of $40/day.Entry 114 g indicates that promotional information P7 regards an offer for a boat cruise from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and continuing on to Seattle for $300. - In response to receiving the request for promotional information from the
directions server system 102, the promotionalinformation server system 104 can determine whether to provide mode of transportation-related promotional information. For instance, the promotionalinformation server system 104 may be configured to serve a variety of promotional information, including promotional information that is not related to modes of transportation (e.g., location-based promotional information). The promotionalinformation server system 104 can determine whether mode of transportation-related promotional information would likely be relevant to a user of theclient computing device 100. Such a determination can be based on a variety of factors, such as whether the request from theclient computing device 100 relates (explicitly or implicitly) to travelling between locations and/or whether users have previously found mode of transportation-related promotional information to be relevant when presented in response to requests similar to the request from theclient computing device 100. - Regarding the first example factor (request relates to travelling), a request from the
client computing device 100 regarding travelling can indicate that a user of theclient computing device 100 is currently interested in modes of transportation between locations. The promotionalinformation server system 104 can determine whether a request relates to travelling between locations. For instance, some requests can explicitly relate to travelling between locations, such as a request for directions between locations and a request for airfare information between two locations. Some requests can be determined to implicitly relate to travelling between locations, such as a request for a map and/or a search query for vacation destination (e.g., search query “vacation Mexico”). Start and/or destination locations can be inferred if not specified. For instance, ifclient computing device 100 located in Boston, Mass., provides a request for a map of New York, N.Y., to thedirections server system 102, the destination location can be identified from the request as New York and the start location can be determined from the current geographic location of the device 100 (Boston). - Systems other than the
directions server system 102 can provide requests for promotional information to the promotionalinformation server system 104 for which mode of transportation-related promotional information is provided. For example, a search engine server system (not depicted) can provide requests for promotional information to the promotionalinformation server system 104. As indicated above, the content of a search query can be analyzed to determine, at least in part, whether mode of transportation-related promotional information is likely to be relevant to a user who provided a search query. Other server systems not mentioned in this document can also provide requests to the promotionalinformation server system 104 and receive mode of transportation-related promotional information in return. - Regarding the second example factor mentioned above (whether users have previously found mode of transportation-related promotional information to be relevant), the promotional
information server system 104 can access user behavior data that indicates how users have interacted with previously provided mode of transportation-related promotional information. Interaction can include a variety user action, such as a user clicking on a link provided with the promotional information, a user selecting a play button for a video included with the promotional information, and/or a user playing an interactive game included as part of the promotional information. User interaction with promotional information can indicate that a user has previously found promotional information to be relevant to his/her request (e.g., request for directions, request for a map, search query, etc.). User behavior data, which is anonymized to protect user privacy, can be used to identify situations (e.g., requests for directions, search queries related to travel, etc.) when users have previously found mode of transportation-related promotional information to be relevant to a request. The promotionalinformation server system 104 can present mode of transportation-related promotional information in situations similar to the relevant situations identified based on user behavior data. - For example, assume that the promotional
information server system 104 has provided mode of transportation-related promotional information to a variety of client computing devices in a variety of different situations (e.g., search queries, driving directions, map request, etc.) and that user behavior data is obtained based on user interaction with the promotional information (e.g., unique identifier included in link user selects, etc.). If the user behavior data indicates that user interaction with the mode of transportation-related promotional information has occurred predominantly when a user has received the promotional information in response to a request for driving directions exceeding 300 miles, then the promotionalinformation server system 104 can provide mode of transportation-related promotional information in response to requests for driving directions exceeding 300 miles. - Factors for determining when to present mode of transportation-related promotional information other than the two factors mentioned above may also be employed when appropriate.
- The promotional
information server system 104 can select one or more of the promotional information P1-P7 to provide to thedirections server system 102 with the requested directions. The aim of the promotionalinformation server system 104 can be to select promotional information that is likely to be relevant to the user of theclient computing device 100 that is requesting the driving directions. The promotionalinformation server system 104 can make such a selection based on a variety of factors, such as whether the promotional information pertains to a mode of transportation for travelling to/from one or more of the locations specified in the request from the client computing device 100 (or other locations within a threshold distance of the specified locations), a distance between the start and destination locations, and/or user behavior data indicating promotional information that users have previously found to be relevant in response to similar requests. - For example, the promotional
information server system 104 can select promotional information that pertains to the start and/or destination location, such as the promotional information P1 for a bus trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco, as indicated byentry 114 a. The promotional information P2 for a bus trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, as indicated by entry 114 b, may not be as relevant to the request fromclient computing device 100 as promotional information P1 based on the promotional information P2 providing an alternate destination location (Las Vegas). - In another example, the promotional
information server system 104 can select promotional information based on a distance between a start and destination location. For example, mode of transportation information related to airfare may be provided when a distance between the start and destination locations exceeds a threshold distance, such as 100 miles, 200 miles, 300 miles, 500 miles, and/or 1000 miles. Various distance thresholds associated with one or more modes of transportation can be used to select promotional information. For example, promotional information related to bus travel may be selected when the distance between the start and destinations locations is less than 1000 miles, 500 miles, 250 miles, and/or 150 miles. - In a further example, the promotional
information server system 104 can use user behavior data to select promotional information to provide to theclient computing device 100. Similar to the discussion of user behavior data above, the promotionalinformation server system 104 can analyze user behavior data to determine which of the promotional information P1-P7 is likely to be relevant given the request from theclient computing device 100. For example, if other users requesting driving directions from Los Angeles to San Francisco (or between locations nearby L.A. and S.F., or between locations separate by a similar distance) have interacted with airfare promotions (e.g., P4 and P5) with the greatest amount of frequency, then the promotionalinformation server system 104 can select promotional information related to modes of transportation by airplane between Los Angeles and San Francisco. - The promotional
information server system 104 can also take into account bids from parties (e.g., advertisers) providing promotional information. For instance, parties may express their interest in having their respective promotional information provided to a user in an amount they are willing to pay to have their promotional information provided to a user. With multiple parties competing for a limited number of opportunities to provide promotional information to a user, a mechanism such as an auction can be used to award opportunities to parties. Auctions can take a variety of forms. - In one example, an auction can take into consideration that relevance and quality of promotional information (e.g., quality of content of promotional information) to balance the interests of parties providing promotional information with the interests of users viewing the promotional information—users would like to see high quality advertisements that are relevant to the users' current interests. As part of such an auction, promotional information can be scored based on an expectation that, given the request from the
client computing device 100, that a user of theclient computing device 100 will interact with the promotional information. Such a score can be termed a “click through” rate or score. A variety of factors, including those discussed in the examples above, can be used to determine a likelihood that a user will interact with mode of transportation-related promotional information. Scores and bids for promotional information can be combined (e.g., multiplied, added, etc.) and the combinations can be ranked. Promotional information can be selected based on the ranking (e.g., select the top 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. ranked promotional information) and/or on the combined score (e.g., select promotional information having at least a threshold combined score). - In the example depicted in
FIG. 1 , the promotionalinformation server system 104 selects the promotional information P1 (114 a) and the promotional information P5 (114 e) regarding a round-trip bus fare and airfare from Los Angeles to San Francisco, respectively. The selection can be based on one or more of the selection techniques described above. For instance, the promotionalinformation server system 104 can attempt to display alternative modes of transportation from the start location (Los Angeles) to the destination location (San Francisco) to the mode of transportation the user is currently considering for the trip (driving an automobile). In this example, the promotional information P1 regarding travelling by bus and the promotional information P5 regarding travelling by airplane can be selected to provide the user with alternatives to driving between Los Angeles and San Francisco. - As indicated at step D (116), the promotional
information server system 104 can provide the selected promotional information P1 and P5 (118 a-b) to thedirections server system 102. Thedirections server system 102 can determine directions for the route requested by theclient computing device 100 and add the promotional information P1 and P5 to the directions (e.g., add code to a web page that causes the promotional information P1 and P5 to be retrieved and/or displayed with the directions), as indicated by step E (120). - As indicated by step F (122), the
directions server system 102 provides thedirections 124 with the promotional information P1 and P5 (118 a-b) to theclient computing device 100 for presentation to a user of theclient computing device 100. Thedirections 124 and the promotional information 118 a-b can be provided in any of a variety of electronic data formats, such as HTML, extensible markup language (XML), SHOCKWAVE/FLASH, JAVASCRIPT, and/or HTMLS. - Using any of a variety of applications installed (as software and/or hardware) on the
client computing device 100, thedirections 124 and the promotional information 118 a-b can be provided (e.g., displayed, audibly played, etc.) to a user of theclient computing device 100. An example of thedirections 124 and the promotional information 118 a-b being provided on theclient computing device 100 is depicted asdisplay 126. Thedisplay 126 includes drivingdirections 128 from Los Angeles to San Francisco (map and turn-by-turn directions). Thedisplay 126 also includespromotional information 130 for round-trip bus fare from L.A. to S.F. Thepromotional information 130 includes a selectable link 132 (e.g., a hyperlink) that a user of theclient computing device 100 can select to receive more information regarding the promotion (e.g., selection can cause theclient computing device 100 to request a web page regarding the bus fare promotion). Thedisplay 126 also includespromotional information 134 regarding round-trip airfare from L.A. to S.F., and aselectable link 136 for the user to request more information regarding the airfare promotion. Thepromotional information -

Theclient computing device 202 includes an input/output (I/O)interface 210 that thedevice 202 uses to communicate with other computing devices over thenetwork 204. The I/O interface 210 can be any of a variety of communications interfaces, such as an Ethernet card, a wireless network card, a cellular network transceiver, or any combination thereof. Theclient computing device 202 includes acontent request module 212 that is configured to provide requests for content to thecontent server system 206 over thenetwork 204. Thecontent request module 212 can be configured to make such requests in response to user input, such as a user selecting a link and/or button provided by an electronic document (e.g., web page). Theclient computing device 202 can also include acontent presentation module 214 that is configured to provide (e.g., display, audibly play, etc.) content and promotional information on theclient computing device 202. - The
network 204 can be any of a variety of networks over which computing devices can communicate. For instance, thenetwork 204 can include a LAN, a WAN, a VPN, a wireless network, the Internet, a point-to-point network, a telephone network (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN)), a cellular telephone network, a 3G/4G network, or any combination thereof. - The
content server system 206 can be any of a variety of computing devices, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a distributed computer server system, a dedicated computer server system, and/or a colocated computer server system. Thecontent server system 206 is configured to serve requested content to various computing devices, such as theclient computing device 202. Thecontent server system 206 can be configured to serve a variety of content, such driving directions, maps, search queries, and/or travel information. For example, thecontent server system 206 can be a search engine. In another example, thecontent server system 206 can be a driving directions server system. - The
content server system 206 includes an I/O interface 216 that is configured to communicate with other computing devices over thenetwork 204. The I/O interface 216 can be similar to the I/O interface 210 of theclient computing device 202. Thecontent server system 206 further includes a contentrequest receiving module 218 that is configured to receive requests for content, such as requests from theclient computing device 202. The contentrequest receiving module 218 can cause acontent serving component 220 of thecontent server system 206 to identify and serve the content requested by theclient computing device 202. Thecontent serving component 220 access acontent data repository 222 to identify/serve at least some of the requested content. Thecontent data repository 222 can be any of a variety of mechanisms for storing data, such as a database and/or a file system. - As part of processing a received request for content, the content
request receiving module 218 can also cause a request for promotional information to be provided to the promotionalinformation server system 208. - The promotional
information server system 208 can be any of a variety of computing devices, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a distributed computer server system, a dedicated computer server system, and/or a colocated computer server system. The promotionalinformation server system 208 is configured to provide, at least, mode of transportation-related promotional information for presentation with content from thecontent server system 206, similar to the promotionalinformation server system 104 described above with regard toFIG. 1 . The promotionalinformation server system 208 includes an I/O interface 224 that is similar to the I/O interfaces 210 and 216, as described above, and that is configured to receive requests for promotional information. - The promotional
information server system 208 also includes a promotional informationrequest processing module 226 that is configured to determine whether to provide mode of transportation-related promotional information in response to a received request. The promotional informationrequest processing module 226 can make such a determination in a similar manner as the determination to provide mode of transportation-related promotional information discussed above with regard to the promotionalinformation server system 104. The promotional informationrequest processing module 226 can also identify information associated with a request from theclient computing device 202, such as a mode of transportation that is associated with the request (e.g., identify automobile as a mode of transportation when theclient computing device 202 has requested driving directions) and/or start/destination locations associated with such the request. For example, the promotional informationrequest processing module 226 can identify start and/or destination locations based on information provided in a request from theclient computing device 202 and/or other information, such as a current geographic location associated with theclient computing device 202. - The promotional
information server system 208 can also include an alternate mode oftransportation component 228 that is configured to identify modes of transportation that are alternatives to a mode of transportation associated with a request from theclient computing device 202. For instance, if theclient computing device 202 has requested driving directions, alternative modes of transportation can be identified as airplanes and trains. - The alternate mode of
transportation component 228 can interact with one or more of the data repositories 230 a-c to make such a determination. The data repositories 230 a-c include: apromotional information repository 230 a that is configured to store promotional information (e.g., text ads, video ads, audio public service announcements, etc.) and details regarding promotional information (e.g., mode of transportation, start location, destination location, bid, etc.); a mode oftransportation repository 230 b that is configured to store information regarding modes of transportation, such as information identifying alternative modes of transportation and/or information indicating various details regarding when modes of transportation are likely to be relevant to requesting users (e.g., distance thresholds); and a userbehavior data repository 230 c that is configured to store user behavior data that indicates how users have interacted with mode of transportation-related promotional information previously. The alternate mode oftransportation component 228 can access, at least, the mode oftransportation repository 230 b when identifying alternative modes of transportation to a mode of transportation associated with a request from theclient computing device 202. - A
user behavior module 232 of the promotionalinformation server system 208 can identify and analyze user behavior that is relevant to a request from aclient computing device 202. For instance, theuser behavior module 232 can identify user behavior data from the userbehavior data repository 230 c regarding previous user requests that are similar to a current request from theclient computing device 202. Such user behavior data can be used by a mode oftransportation component 234, which is configured to identify one or more modes of transportation that are likely to be relevant to a user of theclient computing device 202. The mode oftransportation component 234 can make such a determination based on information and analysis provided by the promotional informationrequest processing module 226, the alternate mode oftransportation component 228, and/or theuser behavior module 232. Such a determination can be made in a manner similar to the determination discussed with regard to the promotionalinformation server system 104. - A promotional information module 236 of the promotional
information server system 208 can select promotional information to provide to theclient computing device 202 based on, at least, the one or more modes of transportation identified by the mode oftransportation component 234. The promotional information module 236 can use a variety of techniques to select promotional information, similar to the techniques described with regard to the promotionalinformation server system 104. For instance, the promotional information module 236 can perform an auction to select mode of transportation-related promotional information from thepromotional information repository 230 a. - The promotional information module 236 can provide selected promotional information to the
content server system 206 through the I/O interface 224 and thenetwork 204. Thecontent server system 206 can integrate the selected promotional information with the requested content such that the promotional information is presented on theclient computing device 202 in conjunction with the requested content. For example, thecontent server system 206 can add code to an electronic document that includes the requested content that causes the promotional information to be displayed as part of the document. - The
content server system 206 can provide the requested content to theclient computing device 202 using thecontent serving component 220, the I/O interface 216, and thenetwork 204. Theclient computing device 202 can receive the requested content and the selected promotional information through theinterface 210 and can present the requested content and/or selected promotional information to a user of theclient computing device 202 using thecontent presentation module 214. - In some implementations, the
content server system 206 can provide code to client with the requested content that, when interpreted and/or executed by theclient computing device 202, can cause theclient computing device 202 to request promotional information from the promotionalinformation server system 208. In such implementations, the promotionalinformation server system 208 can provide promotional information to theclient computing device 202 through thenetwork 204, instead of providing selected promotional information to thecontent server system 206. The code provided to theclient computing device 202 can include code to receive and present promotional information from the promotionalinformation server system 208 on theclient computing device 202. -
FIGS. 3A-B depict a flowchart showing anexample technique 300 for providing promotional information based upon modes of transportation. Portions of thetechnique 300 are depicted as being performed by aclient computing device 302, acontent server system 304, and a promotionalinformation server system 306. Theclient computing device 302 can be any of a variety of computing device, such as theclient computing device FIGS. 1 and 2 , respectively. Thecontent server system 304 can be any of a variety of computer server systems, such as thedirections server system 102 or thecontent server system 206 described above with regard toFIGS. 1 and 2 , respectively. The promotionalinformation server system 306 can be any of a variety of server system, such as the promotionalinformation server system FIGS. 1 and 2 , respectively. - Referring to
FIG. 3A , thetechnique 300 starts atstep 308 by the exampleclient computing device 302 providing a request for content to the examplecontent server system 304. For example, theclient computing device 302 can request driving directions from a start location to a destination location from thecontent server system 304. - The
content server system 304 receives the request from the client computing device 302 (step 310) and begins processing the request (step 312). Processing the request can include identifying the content requested by theclient computing device 302, such a driving directions or results to a search query. Processing a request can also include preparing and/or formatting the requested content for transmission to theclient computing device 302 so that the content can be properly presented to a user of the client computing device. As part of preparing and/or formatting, one or more electronic documents (e.g., HTML documents, XML documents, etc.) can be generated and/or retrieved by thecontent server system 304. - In addition to processing the request at
step 312, thecontent server system 304 can request promotional information from the promotional information server system 306 (step 314) in response to receiving the request from theclient computing device 302. - The promotional
information server system 306 receives the request for promotional information from the content server system 304 (step 316) and, in some implementations, determines whether the request relates to travelling from a start location to a destination location (step 318). As described above with regard to the promotionalinformation server system 104, such a determination can be used by the promotionalinformation server system 306 to determine whether to provide mode of transportation-related promotional information with the content requested by theclient computing device 302. For example, a search query “vacation Las Vegas” can be determined to be related to travelling between a user's current location (a start location that is not mentioned in the query) and Las Vegas (a destination location). - When the request is determined to relate to travelling between locations, but the start location is not specified, the current geographic location for the
client computing device 302 can be determined (step 320) and can be inferred as a start location. As discussed above with regard toFIG. 1 , a variety of techniques can be used to determine a current geographic location for theclient computing device 302, such as an IP address lookup and/or geographic location information (e.g., GPS data) provided by theclient computing device 302. - In some implementations, user behavior data can be retrieved (step 322) and used by the promotional
information server system 306 to determine whether to provide mode of transportation-related promotional information with the requested content and/or to select mode of transportation-related promotional information to provide to theclient computing device 302. - The promotional
information server system 306 can identify one or more modes of transportation for travelling between the start and destination locations (step 324). Such a determination can be made based on a distance between the start location and the destination location. For example, if the distance exceeds a threshold, the promotionalinformation server system 306 can identify airplanes as at least one of the modes of transportation that should be presented to theclient computing device 302. - In some implementations, the promotional
information server system 306 can identify a mode of transportation specified with the request from the client computing device 302 (step 326). For example, if theclient computing device 302 requests driving directions form thecontent server system 304, the mode of transportation associated with the request can be determined to be automobiles. - Referring to
FIG. 3B , in some implementations the promotionalinformation server system 306 can determine whether to identified modes of transportation are alternatives to the specified mode of transportation in the request (step 328). The promotionalinformation server system 306 can make such a determination to narrow the group of modes of transportation to those that are alternatives to the specified mode of transportation that are likely to be relevant to a user of theclient computing device 302. - The promotional
information server system 306 can select promotional information related to the identified modes of transportation (step 330). A variety of techniques can be used to select promotional information, such as conducting an auction. The promotionalinformation server system 306 can provide the selected promotional information to the content server system 304 (step 332). In some implementations, the promotionalinformation server system 306 can provide the promotional information to theclient computing device 302 instead of to thecontent server system 304, as described above with regard toFIG. 2 . - The
content server system 304 receives the promotional information (step 334) and combines the promotional information with content that is responsive to the request from the client computing device 302 (step 336). For example, code that causes the promotional information to be presented can be added to an electronic document that includes at least a portion of the requested content. The promotional information and the content can be provided by thecontent server system 304 to the client computing device 302 (step 338). - The client computing device can receive and present the content and promotional information (step 340). For example, if the
client computing device 302 requests web page with driving directions from thecontent server system 304, theclient computing device 302 can receive a web page with the requested directions and alternative mode of transportation promotional information, like airfare and bus fare promotional information. Theclient computing device 302 can display the web page and promotional information to a user of theclient computing device 302 using a variety of hardware and/or software components, such as a display screen, speakers, a web browser application, and/or scripting applications. -
