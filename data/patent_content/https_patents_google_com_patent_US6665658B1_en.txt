Definitions
- the present invention is related to the area of Internet search technologies and resource gathering using web crawling techniques, and in particular to a method and apparatus for automatically gathering dynamic content and resources on the world wide web by simulating user interaction and managing session information.
- Some websites generate dynamic content and require user input/interaction to access the data. These sites are typically shopping or password protected sites providing personalization features based on specific user input. In order to keep track of user preferences, personal data, and passwords, these sites issue “cookies” to store status information.
- a “cookie” is data that is stored on a users machine and is read by the server that sets it. The server reads the cookie when the user returns to a site and the site is then personalized with a greeting such as “Welcome Back John Doe”. This user will not be able to navigate the site unless that cookie is read from their machine.
- the “AMAZON.COM” server When a user or client visits the “AMAZON.COM” site, the “AMAZON.COM” server tries to set a “cookie”, which has to be accepted by the client. Many web browsers have automatic functionality built in which will handle this, and asks the user whether to accept or reject the cookie request.
- the standard web crawler is not able to systematically crawl the site and replicate the database because of the need for user interaction. There is no mechanism to simulate the user's behavior, or interaction, during a typical search session.
- a domain specific search engine like “jCentral” from IBM, (http://www.ibm.com/developer/ibm), which is focused on the programming language “Java”, might be interested in providing a search feature for books about “Java.” So it would be a benefit for software developers if “jCentral” could create an index of the data on “Java” which is stored on “AMAZON.COM”, and provide a domain specific search for interested “Java” developers.
- AMAZON.COM AMAZON.COM

- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the of the present invention
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of the process of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of the apparatus of the present invention.
- FIGS. 1-3 of the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention.
- Features of the invention are not necessarily shown to scale in the drawings.
- the present invention provides a apparatus and method for a web crawler to automatically simulate user interaction with a dynamic website in order to gather and extract information from the website.
- This interactive web crawler will be able to systematically crawl dynamic personalized content on a website and retrieve the information desired by the user/client.
- the present invention extends the capabilities of current search engines and increases the amount of resources collected, which enhances search results.
- the present invention will even collect resources, which with current technologies, would have not been discovered.
- the present invention increases the coverage of the web, which is currently made available for search through Internet search engines. With the growing amount of information available on the Internet, it is important to keep pace with successfully delivering this useful information to users.
- the system of the present invention will typically have the following assembly of components as shown in FIG. 1 :
- Session Manager 14 1.
- the system can make use of a:
- SITE information database 10 which contains document type definition (“DTD”) descriptions about dynamic web sites, how to perform interaction with the site, site navigation details, and how to extract data.
- DTD document type definition
- SEARCH TOPICS database 12 which contains a database of topics to search.
- REPOSITORY 28 or data storage facility for storage of search results and data, and can include summaries of the content gathered from the search.
- the Session Manager 14 will request a uniform resource locator (“URL”) for a website to be searched and analyzed from URL site list 30 .
- URL site list 30 is manually created and compiled. Typically, it may comprise a list of pages with interactive URL sites to be searched.
- Session manager 14 can determine whether the given website is an interactive site that sets “cookies” by performing a GET method, as defined by the hypertext transfer protocol (“HTTP”), to download the content of the website.
- the downloaded content may also contain a header, which has additional information about the site.
- the header is scanned for session data, which can be represented using “cookies.”
- the content, along with the session data, can be stored in SITE information database 10 .
- this URL is marked as “NOT INTERACTIVE” in the SITE database.
- the site can be crawled and analyzed using standard web crawling techniques.
- Session Manager 14 will pass the downloaded data, along with name of the site to query, to the Query Template Builder 16 .
- Query Template Builder 16 obtains the URL data, along with the downloaded content or data from Session Manager 14 , and constructs a query template with the session information that will be used to navigate the site. This component builds the type of query that the site requires based on the knowledge obtained from a Document Type Definition (“DTD”) in the SITE information database 10 .
- DTD Document Type Definition
- a DTD is essentially a scheme of describing of how to interact with the particular web site.
- the SITE database is also user created and an external software component may be utilized that automatically extracts data from web sites, but is manually configured once per site, to ensure proper functionality.
- Query Template Builder 16 typically has to look for HTML based form, which can easily be recognized on HTML markup tags.
- Query Template Builder 16 is able to automatically construct a query template for the query process. Once a query template is generated, it can be stored in the SITE database 10 for later use. Associating the session information with the query represents a key component in simulating human web browsing techniques.
- Query Manager 18 oversees the status of each query request. This includes its validity and state. Since session information may have expiration dates, the associated query may become unavailable. Thus, Query Manager 18 must determine if a query is still valid. It also determines if another query is ready and whether the Requester 20 has completed the previous query. Query Manager 18 also retrieves the topic(s) to be searched from the Search TOPICS database 12 , and inserts the topics, which can be represented as a list of keywords, into the query template to complete the query string. If there is more than one topic to be searched, a query string is completed for each topic. Each topic and query must be searched on the site. To ensure this is done, Query Manager 18 analyzes topics/queries associations.
- Query Manager 18 has to loop over all the search topics, to ensure that every topic will be gathered, on all the designated web sites from the database 30 .
- the completed query template is passed to Requester 20 , which then takes over to process the request. If a request is processed, it will also receive notification from the Search Result Manager 22 , so that a search request can be marked as processed.
- Requester 20 receives a complete query template (or query string), along with the site to query from the Query Manager 18 . With this information it now knows exactly how to query the dynamic site. Then, it sends a request to the site and waits for the returned search results. Once it receives the search results, it sends the search results page to the Search Result Manager 22 for further processing.
- the search results may be in the form of an HTML page with URLs, or some other structured format (e.g. XML).
- the Search Result Manager 22 analyzes a search result page received from the Requester 20 . For this, it has to have a knowledge about the search result page structure, which will be obtained from the SITE database 10 . Like the Query Manager 18 , the Search Result Manager 22 can make use of tools that transfer data out of webpages to simplify the parsing of a search result page. Search Result Manager 22 is capable of page navigation and can identify additional pages of results to be retrieved. Requester 20 can continue to retrieve the additional result pages. After successfully analyzing the search results, Search Result Manager 22 is able to separate the data (e.g., URL, abstract, additional summary data provided) and the paging commands (for browsing additional search result items).
- data e.g., URL, abstract, additional summary data provided
- search engine sites such as “HOTBOT” and “ALTAVISTA”
- search engine sites provide users with a fixed result set size and only a small set will be displayed at once. This requires the Search Result Manager 22 to actually page through the search results. In some instances, there may be no search results at all. Overall, the task of Search Result Manager 22 is to manage the navigation through the search result set. If there are more search result items available, which are not shown yet, additional requests (i.e searches) have to be made, until there are no more search result items available.
- the Search Result Manager 22 will use the query template, along with the paging command, and passes this information (newly constructed query) to the Requester 20 . As a result, the collected data is sent to the Result Manager 26 . Once a request is completed, the Result Manager 26 notifies the Query Manager 18 , and becomes ready to process another series of queries.
- Result Manager 26 performs some analysis on the results (checks for valid URLs, corrupted data, etc.). Result Manager 26 can also determine if all search topics associated with the URL have been searched or queried. If not, Result Manager 26 can instruct the Search Result Manager 22 and Query Manager 18 to execute additional searches until all topics are queried. Also, it could be possible to pass the data to a summarizer component to create metadata summary information.
- the received search results are in the form of a list of URL sites and associated data received from the Search Result Manager 22 . If necessary, duplicated content can be discarded. Essentially, the retrieved data is stored in a repository or data storage facility 28 , and is associated to the topic from the Search Topics database 12 .
- Repository 28 represents the “harvest” of all efforts. It can be implemented as a complete information access and retrieval system, like “GRANDCENTRAL STATION” from IBM, to allow the platform independent access to the information, metadata and document, and provide powerful search features.
- the process of the present invention may be implemented as follows:
- Session manager 14 retrieves a URL ( 100 ) from the URL site list 30 . Session manager 14 then retrieves the DTD information ( 102 ) for the retrieved URL from the Site Information database 10 , which is also passed to the Query Template Builder 16 . Session manager 14 then passes the retrieved URL and DTD information to the Query Template Builder 16 .
- Query Template Builder 16 creates a query template ( 104 ) for the retrieved URL using the DTD information and passes the partial query template to the Query Template Manager 18 .
- Query Manager 18 retrieves the topic to be searched ( 106 ) from the Search Topics database 12 and inserts the topic into the query template ( 108 ), which completes the query string.
- the fully completed query string is then passed to the Requester 20 , which performs a HTTP request ( 110 ) to the URL site 24 .
- Requester 20 receives the results of the query from the URL site and passes the results ( 112 ) to the Search Results Manager 22 .
- the results of a search will contain more than one result, and many times more than one page of results.
- Search Results Manager 22 knows from the DTD the page structure/schemata and is able to perform page navigation. If there is more than one page of results, the Search Results Manager 22 is capable of instructing the Requester to retrieve any additional pages of results ( 114 ) and can forward the query string back to the Requester 20 . This cycle is continued until all of the results of the search are retrieved and the Search Results Manger has all of the search results.
- Results Manager 26 can determine if there are additional topics to be searched ( 116 ) and Query Manager 18 can send additional query search strings to Requester 20 for further searches. This cycle of events is continued until all search topics have been searched. For example, a search of the site “AMAZON.COM” may include searching 15 different topics, in that site. After each search, Query Manager 26 can determine from the DTD that there are additional topics to be searched. It can cause additional search topic(s) to be retrieved from the Search Topics database 12 and cause a new search string to be created for each search topic. In this fashion, Query Manager 18 can cause 15 different query strings to be created, each of which will produce a different set of search results.
- the search results are processed ( 118 ) by Results Manager 26 , and may include notifying the Query Manger 18 that the search cycle is complete and that another search may proceed ( 120 ).
- Result Manager 26 may also store the search results, in for example, a data repository 28 , and can also associate the search data with the DTD information and search topic categories.
- Results Manager 26 may also be able to extract, analyze or summarize the search results and data.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of a typical computer system which may be used to practice the present invention.
- Computer systems 50 and 60 are linked such that the computers are capable of sending information to and from each computer. Information is made available to both computer systems using a communication protocol sent over a communication channel such as the Internet or through a dial-up connection, e.g., ISDN line.
- Computer 50 is capable of utilizing program storage devices embodying machine readable program source code which causes the computers to perform the method steps of the present invention.
- the program storage devices of the present invention may be devised, made and used as a component of a machine utilizing optics, magnetic properties and/or electronics to perform the method steps of the present invention.
- Program storage devices include, but are not limited to, magnetic diskettes, magnetic tapes, optical disks, Read Only Memory (ROM), floppy disks, semiconductor chips and the like.
- Database 52 may be internal or external to computer system 50
- Computer 60 is linked by telephone or other conventional communication interface to the world wide web.
- Computer systems 50 and 60 have a microprocessor for executing stored programs and computer system 50 includes data storage device 56 on its program storage device for storage of information and data.
- the computer program or software incorporating the method steps and instructions described may be stored in both computer(s) and network server on an otherwise conventional program storage device.
- Program storage device may include such devices as a semiconductor chip, a read-only memory, or magnetic media such as a diskette or computer hard drive, which is readable and executable by a computer(s).
- a screen 58 is able to display the desired results accessed from the computer 50 .
- the present invention achieves its objectives by providing a method and apparatus to automatically “crawl” and searching dynamic websites by simulating user interaction with the website. Using the method and apparatus of the present invention, information and data that could not otherwise be automatically gathered, can now be obtained during a search and query of a dynamic website.
