Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the ranking of search results and, more particularly, to search engines that intelligently rank web pages based on a search query.
- the World Wide Web ( “web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results to the user based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are “hits” and are returned to the user.
- a search engine may attempt to sort the list of hits so that the most relevant and/or highest quality pages are at the top of the list of hits returned to the user. For example, the search engine may assign a rank or score to each hit, where the score is designed to correspond to the relevance or importance of the web page. Determining appropriate scores can be a difficult task. For one thing, the importance of a web page to the user is inherently subjective and depends on the user's interests, knowledge, and attitudes. There is, however, much that can be determined objectively about the relative importance of a web page. Conventional methods of determining relevance are based on the contents of the web page.
- More advanced techniques determine the importance of a web page based on more than the content of the web page. For example, one known method, described in the article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a web page based on the link structure of the web page. In other words, the Brin and Page algorithm attempts to quantify the importance of a web page based on more than just the content of the web page.
- the overriding goal of a search engine is to return the most desirable set of links for any particular search query.
- Systems and methods consistent with the present invention address this and other needs by providing an improved search engine that refines a document's relevance score based on inter-connectivity of the document within a set of relevant documents.
- the present invention is directed to a method of identifying documents relevant to a search query.
- the method includes generating an initial set of relevant documents from a corpus based on a matching of terms in a search query to the corpus. Further, the method ranks the generated set of documents to obtain a relevance score for each document and calculates a local score value for the documents in the generated set, the local score value quantifying an amount that the documents are referenced by other documents in the generated set of documents. Finally, the method refines the relevance scores for the documents in the generated set based on the local score values.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which concepts consistent with the present invention may be implemented
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for ranking documents within a search engine.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating, in additional detail, methods consistent with the present invention for ranking documents within a search engine.
- a search engine modifies the relevance rankings for a set of documents based on the inter-connectivity of the documents in the set.
- a document with a high inter-connectivity with other documents in the initial set of relevant documents indicates that the document has “support” in the set, and the document's new ranking will increase.
- the search engine re-ranks the initial set of ranked documents to thereby refine the initial rankings.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which concepts consistent with the present invention may be implemented.
- the system includes multiple client devices 102 , a server device 110 , and a network 101 , which may be, for example, the Internet.
- Client devices 102 each include a computer-readable medium 109 , such as random access memory, coupled to a processor 108 .
- Processor 108 executes program instructions stored in memory 109 .
- Client devices 102 may also include a number of additional external or internal devices, such as, without limitation, a mouse, a CD-ROM, a keyboard, and a display.
- users 105 can communicate over network 101 with each other and with other systems and devices coupled to network 101 , such as server device 110 .
- server device 110 may include a processor 111 coupled to a computer readable memory 112 .
- Server device 110 may additionally include a secondary storage element, such as database 130 .
- Client processors 108 and server processor 111 can be any of a number of well known computer processors, such as processors from Intel Corporation, of Santa Clara, Calif.
- client device 102 may be any type of computing platform connected to a network and that interacts with application programs, such as a digital assistant or a “smart” cellular telephone or pager.
- Server 110 although depicted as a single computer system, may be implemented as a network of computer processors.
- Memory 112 contains a search engine program 120 .
- Search engine program 120 locates relevant information in response to search queries from users 105 .
- users 105 send search queries to server device 110 , which responds by returning a list of relevant information to the user 105 .
- users 105 ask server device 110 to locate web pages relating to a particular topic and stored at other devices or systems connected to network 101 .
- Search engine 120 includes document locator 121 and a ranking component 122 .
- document locator 121 finds a set of documents whose contents match a user search query.
- Ranking component 122 further ranks the located set of documents based on relevance.
- Document locator 121 may initially locate documents from a document corpus stored in database 130 by comparing the terms in the user's search query to the documents in the corpus.
- processes for indexing web documents and searching the indexed corpus of web documents to return a set of documents containing the searched terms are well known in the art. Accordingly, this functionality of relevant document component 121 will not be described further herein.
- Ranking component 122 assists search engine 120 in returning relevant documents to the user by ranking the set of documents identified by document locator 121 . This ranking may take the form of assigning a numerical value corresponding to the calculated relevance of each document identified by document locator 121 .
- Ranking component 122 includes main ranking component 123 and re-ranking component 124 .
- Main ranking component 123 assigns an initial rank to each document received from document locator 121 .
- the initial rank value corresponds to a calculated relevance of the document.
- suitable ranking algorithms known in the art. One of which is described in the article by Brin and Page, as mentioned in the Background of the Invention section of this disclosure.
- main ranking component 123 and document locator 121 may be combined so that document locator 121 produces a set of relevant documents each having rank values.
- the rank values may be generated based on the relative position of the user's search terms in the returned documents. For example, documents may have their rank value based on the proximity of the search terms in the document (documents with the search terms close together are given higher rank values) or on the number of occurrences of the search term (e.g., a document that repeatedly uses a search term is given a higher rank value).
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for implementing ranking component 122 .
- document locator 121 and main ranking component 123 In response to a search query, document locator 121 and main ranking component 123 generate an initial set of relevant documents, including ranking values associated with each of the documents in the set. (Act 201 ).
- the initial rankings, for each document, x, in the returned set of relevant documents, is referred to herein as OldScores(x).
- re-ranking component 124 calculates a second value, referred to as LocalScore(x). (Act 202 ).
- the LocaiScore for each document x is based on the relative support for that document from other documents in the initial set (the computation of LocalScore is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 3 ).
- Documents linked to by a large number of other documents in the initial set i.e., documents with high relative support
- search engine 120 computes the final, new ranking value for each document, called NewScore(x), as a function of the document's LocalScore value and its OldScore value. (Act 203 ).
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating the calculation of the LocalScore value, by re-ranking component 124 , for each document x in the initial set of documents.
- Re-ranking component 122 begins by identifying the documents in the initial set that have a hyperlink to document x. (Act 301 ).
- the set of documents that have such hyperlinks are denoted as B(y).
- Documents from the same host as document x tend to be similar to document x but often do not provide significant new information to the user.
- multiple different hosts may be similar enough to one another to be considered the same host for purposes of Acts 301 and 302 .
- one host may be a “mirror” site for a different primary host and thus contain the same documents as the primary host.
- a host site may be affiliated with another site, and thus contain the same or nearly the same documents. Similar or affiliated hosts may be determined through a manual search or by an automated web search that compares the contents at different hosts. Documents from such similar or affiliated hosts may be removed by re-ranking component 124 from B(y) in Act 302 .
- m is a predetermined value that controls the sensitivity of LocalScore to the documents in BackSet.
- the appropriate value at which m should be set varies based on the nature of the OldScore values, and can be determined by trial and error type testing. Typical values for m are, for example, one through three.
- NewScore is computed for each document x by search engine 120 as a function of LocalScore(x) and OldScore(x). More particularly, NewScore(x) may be defined as
- NewScore( x ) ( a +LocalScore( x )/Max LS )( b +OldScore( x )/Max OS ),
- MaxLS is the maximum of the LocaIScore values and MaxOS is the maximum of the OldScore values for each document in the initial set of documents.
- the a and b values are constants, and, may be, for example, each equal to one.
- MaxLS MaxLS Min
- MaxLSMin MaxLSMin
- the appropriate value for MaxLSMin is dependent on the nature of the ranking values generated by main ranking component 123 and can be determined by trial and error.
- a document's relevance ranking is refined based on the inter-connectivity between the document and other documents that were initially determined to be relevant to a user's search query.
- the new, modified rank value for the document may then be used by the search engine in ordering the list of relevant documents returned to the user.
- search engine 120 may receive a search query from one of users 105 .
- Document locator 121 generates an initial list of potentially relevant documents. These documents are ranked by main ranking component 123 based on relevance, and then assigned modified rank values by re-ranking component 124 .
- Search engine 120 may then sort the final list of documents based on the modified rank values (i.e., on the NewScore values) and return the sorted list to the user. Ideally, the documents that the user is most interested in viewing will be the first ones returned by search engine 120 .
