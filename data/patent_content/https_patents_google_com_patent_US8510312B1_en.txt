- the processes of FIGS. 4-8 may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within document capture system 110 or processing system 120 , or a combination thereof. In another implementation, the processes may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or including document capture system 110 and/or processing system 120 .

- images associated with the document may be received from other sources, such as a database of previously scanned documents, third party sources, etc.
- OCR may then be performed on the images of the pages of the document (block 420 ).
- OCR techniques may be used to recognize the text in the document, characteristics of the text (e.g., font, size, etc.), and where the text lies on the pages based on the images of the pages of the document.
- the document images and/or text may then be stored in document database 130 and/or metadata database 140 (block 430 ).
- recognized content of a copyright page associated with a scanned document may be statistically compared to content of bibliographic metadata records stored in metadata database 140 (block 440 ).

- the copyright page typically includes information regarding the publisher of the document 910 , the title, copyright date, and author of the document 920 , a statement of rights regarding the document 930 , Library of Congress data 940 , and a location of printing 950 .
- Other copyright pages might include more, fewer, or different pieces of information.
- the first several pages of the document may be analyzed.
- the first several pages of the document may be searched for the presence of a certain keyword, or keywords, that is indicative of the copyright page, such as “Library of Congress,” “ISBN,” or “ISSN.”
- the pages may be searched for other information that is indicative of the copyright page, such as the copyright symbol ( ⁇ ), typical phrases of copyright statements, a “printed in” clause, or the presence of a date.
- the comparison may result in a number of sets of matching words or phrases associated with or found within a selected copyright page (block 450 ), where each set of matches corresponds to a metadata record having one or more words or phrases contained within the selected copyright page. It should be noted that, in one implementation, sets of matches may be identified for each copyright page recognized or otherwise received in block 420 . Additional details regarding the comparison and identification of the sets of matches will be set forth in detail below with respect to FIG. 5 .
- the sets of matches may be scored to reflect a measure of similarity between the copyright page and each metadata record corresponding to the sets of matches (block 460 ).
- the sets of matches may be scored based on relative probabilities of finding each matching term randomly in both a collection of captured copyright pages and a collection of bibliographic metadata records. Additional details regarding the scoring of sets of matches will be set forth in detail below with respect to FIG. 6 .
- the metadata information contained within a highest scoring record may be associated with or linked to the document associated with the selected copyright page (block 470 ).
- the captured document may be stored along with a link to the highest scoring metadata record.
- the metadata record may be modified to include a link to the captured document.
- content of the captured document and the highest scoring metadata record may be combined in an index that may be subsequently searchable via a suitable mechanism, such as a search engine.
- more than one metadata record may be associated with the document.
- the document may have associated metadata records in a number of different databases or catalogs. In this implementation, each matching or highest scoring record may be associated with the document.
- metadata associated with the document may be automatically identified and assigned to the document, without requiring specific or unique document identifiers, format, languages, etc.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating detailed processing for comparing a selected copyright page of a document to metadata records and identifying sets of matching records for the selected copyright page.
- the processing of FIG. 5 may replace or add to similar processing described above with respect to blocks 440 and 450 of FIG. 4 .
- the processing may begin with identifying occurrences of words and phrases (i.e., combinations of words) found in the metadata records (block 510 ). Similarly, occurrences of words and phrases found in the selected copyright page may be identified (block 520 ).
- common OCR substitutions may be dynamically added into the recognized copyright pages for the purpose of metadata identification, thereby potentially increasing the number of accurately recognized words and phrases associated with the copyright page. Such inclusion may prevent OCR errors from overly impacting document analysis.
- the identified words and phrases in the records and the identified words and phrases in the selected copyright page may be compared to each other (block 530 ) and sets of matching words and phrases may be generated based on the comparison (block 540 ). Each set of matching words and phrases may correspond to one matching record.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating detailed processing for scoring the sets of matches.
- the processing of FIG. 6 may replace or add to similar processing described above with respect to block 460 of FIG. 4 .
- the processing may begin with calculating, for each word or phrase in the selected copyright page, a probability of finding the word or phrase among all copyright pages in the collection of documents stored in document database 130 (block 610 ). In one implementation, such a probability may be expressed as p(w), where w represents an individual word or phrase. Similarly, a probability of finding each word or phrase in the selected copyright page among all metadata records may be calculated for each word or phrase (block 620 ). In one implementation, this probability may be expressed as q(w).
- the probability p(w) may be defined as:
- the probability q(w) may be defined as:
- Nw is a count of occurrences of the phrase or word (or phrase) w among all metadata records in the collection of metadata records and N represents the total number of metadata records in the collection of metadata records.
- a score for each set of matching words or phrases may be generated based on the probabilities (block 630 ).
- a score for a set of matches M may be defined as:
- This expression may be further defined in terms of the product of the probabilities p(w) and q(w):
- ⁇ w M ⁇ ( p ⁇ ( w ) * q ⁇ ( w ) ) represents the combined product of p(w) ⁇ q(w) for each word in the set M.
- This product defines the probability P of observing at least the set of matches M among all copyright pages and metadata records.
- the probability P assumes that the words in the copyright pages and the metadata records are allocated independently and at random. Accordingly, for each probability P, a high value represents a less likely random occurrence and a higher likelihood that the two records (e.g., the copyright page and the metadata record) are in fact related to each other or that the metadata record relates to the matching copyright page.
- This operation sums the log of the probability of finding each term in the set of matches in a random copyright page with the log of the probability of finding each term in the set of matches in a random metadata record.
- the score S(M) may be calculated as:
- a matching record's score may take into account the fact that the metadata record includes specific fields or groups of information (e.g., author, title, publisher, etc.).
- a match on each type of information may be weighted differently. For example, a match on the title may be considered more important than a match on the author, even after taking into account the fact that the title is more rare than the author.
- cataloging-in-publication (CIP) data includes document data prepared by a national library for the country where the document was published (e.g., the Library of Congress). In this example, a score of a match may be increased if the match occurs near the bottom of the metadata record.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating detailed processing for selecting the most informative words or phrases in a copyright page and scoring the matches for those phrases.
- the processing of FIG. 7 may replace or add to similar processing described above with respect to blocks 440 and 450 of FIG. 4 and following block 620 of FIG. 6 .
- the processing may begin with calculating, for each word or phrase in a selected copyright page, a count nw and a probability p(w). In one implementation, these values may be retrieved from a storage or memory when the values had been previously calculated, such as during processing of prior copyright pages.
- the count nw may include a count of all occurrences of a phrase in the collection of documents, and the probability p(w) may indicate how likely it is to find that phrase in a randomly selected copyright page.
- a list of words and phrases found in the selected copyright page may be sorted based on a score upper bound (block 715 ).
- an upper bound associated with a word or phrase's score may be defined as the highest score obtainable for that word or phrase given the word or phrase's p(w), regardless of the value of Nw (and consequently its probability q(w)). Based on this convention, a word or phrase's score upper bound may be expressed as: S ( w ) ⁇ log( p ( w ) ⁇ log(1 /N+ 1), where log(1/N+1) defines a maximum possible contribution to the score based on the collection of metadata records. That is, this value reflects the contribution of a word or phrase that appears only once in the entire collection of metadata records.
- an upper bound for the word or phrase's score may be generated based solely on the contribution of the collection of documents.
- sub-phrases or words fully included within parent phrases may be assigned an upper bound based on the contribution of the collection of metadata records to the score of the parent phrase.
- the maximum possible contribution to the score of a sub-phrase based on the collection of metadata records may be limited by the actual contribution to the score of the parent phrase based on the collection of metadata records. This relationship may be defined as: S ( w ) ⁇ log( p ( w ) ⁇ log( q ( W )), where w represents the sub-phrase and W represents the parent phrase.
- phrases already scored during prior processing may have their upper bound set to the calculated score. For these terms, additional database queries for the collection of metadata records are not required and sorting based on these known scores may be accurately performed.
- the present method may be used to select a particular number of informative words or phrases from among the words and phrases on the selected copyright page. In one exemplary embodiment, this number K may be approximately 50.
- the value of K may be dynamic, increasing until a clear best candidate matching record is identified. For example, a first number of informative words or phrases may be processed and the resulting scores generated. For maximum scores not meeting a particular threshold, additional informative words or phrases may be added, resulting in potentially increased scores for matching records.
- the process goes to block 720 for a determination of whether the new top-most word or phrase has been fully scored. If it is determined that the top-most word or phrase has not been scored (block 720 —NO), the collection of metadata records may be queried for a count Nw relating to the top-most word or phrase, a probability q(w) for the top-most word or phrase may be calculated based on the count Nw, and a score S(w) for the phrase may be calculated based on the previously generated probability p(w) and the newly calculated probability q(w) in the manner described in detail above (block 735 ).
- Any sub-phrases included in the word or phrase w may be identified and their upper bounds may be adjusted based on the values of q(w) for parent phrase w (block 740 ). The list of remaining words and phrases may then be re-sorted based on the calculated score S(w) and the new upper bounds for any included sub-phrases (block 745 ). Next, it may be determined whether the count Nw for the word or phrase w is equal to zero (block 750 ).
- the word or phrase w may be removed from the list (block 755 ) and processing may return to block 720 for a determination of whether the top-most word or phrase of the newly re-sorted list has been fully scored. If count Nw is not equal to zero (block 750 —NO), processing returns to block 720 without removing the word or phrase w.
- a number of sets of matching words or phrases associated with one or more of the K words or phrases may be identified (block 760 ), where each set of matches corresponds to a metadata record having one or more words or phrases contained within the K words or phrases. Processing may then continue to block 460 of FIG. 4 described in detail above.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating detailed processing for reducing the cumulative effect of matching sub-phrases of already matching parent phrases.
- the processing of FIG. 8 may replace or add to similar processing described above with respect to block 460 of FIG. 4 .
- the processing may begin by sorting the phrases or words in each set of matches in order of increasing length, such that sub-phrases are listed ahead of their parent phrase (block 830 ). For example, consider the phrases “John”, “John Wiley”, “John Wiley &”, “John Wiley & Sons”, “Wiley”, “Wiley &”, “Wiley & Sons”, “&”, “& Sons”, and “Sons.” In this example, these phrases would be listed as:
- lists of metadata records matching each phrase may be generated in order of the position of the phrases on the list (block 835 ).
- a list of records matching the phrase “John” may be first generated, followed by a list of records matching the phrase “John Wiley”.
- Each list generated may include a pointer or identifier that references a record in the collection of metadata records.
- Generation of the lists may be facilitated by the creation of an inverted index linking terms or phrases to each record in which those terms and phrases are found.
- the first two lists may be represented as:
- the records identified in the list relating to the parent phrase that also appear in a list relating to a sub-phrase of the parent phrase may be removed (block 840 ).
- the parent phrase list includes records A24, A38, and A122. Accordingly, records A24, A38, and A122 would be removed from the list of matches associated with the phrase “John” and the list of matches associated with the phrase “Wiley”.
- record A24 which matches the entire phrase, may be scored in the manner described above based on the relative contribution of each of the phrases “John”, “Wiley”, and “John Wiley”. Such a scenario may exaggerate the contribution of this one matching phrase by accumulating the contribution of each of the phrases. Consistent with aspects described herein, removal of record A24 for each list associated with an identified sub-phrase (e.g., the list of “John” and the list for “Wiley”), scoring of record A24 may be performed based only on the contribution of the parent phrase.
- p 2 (w) p 1 (w)/r.
- a new hidden variable may be introduced relating to the language of the document.
- the above-described analysis may then be performed for each possible language given that the probabilities associated with words and phrases may vary depending on the language (for instance “the” is more likely to occur in English than in Spanish).
- a posterior probability of the language may then be computed by calculating a matching record's score conditionally for each possible language, multiplying by the prior probabilities over languages and renormalizing.
- Systems and methods consistent with the aspects described herein may automatically identify metadata associated with a document and create an association between the metadata and the image and/or text version of the document, making both the document content and its associated metadata available for searching or other processing.
- the document may be more accurately identified and retrieved in response to subsequent search queries.
- a content of a first group of documents may be associated with or matched to content of a second group of documents.
- pages may be matched to entries in a table of contents
- pages or document content may be matched to other documents (e.g., cited references)
- document pages may be matched to other document pages for detection of duplicate pages.
- This latter embodiment may be particularly useful where two populations of documents are the same but even identical pages may not match perfectly due to different OCR or processing errors.
- web documents may be matched to copyrighted words, thereby assisting in the identification or detection of copyright infringement.
Abstract
Description
where nw is a count of occurrences of the phrase or word (or phrase) w among all copyright pages in the collection of documents and n represents the total number of copyright pages in the collection of documents. It should be noted that the above expression accounts for words or phrases that may be found in the collection of metadata records but not in the collection of documents by reserving one count for unknown words (e.g., nw=0).
where Nw is a count of occurrences of the phrase or word (or phrase) w among all metadata records in the collection of metadata records and N represents the total number of metadata records in the collection of metadata records. It should be noted that the above expression accounts for words or phrases that may be found in the collection of documents but not in the collection of metadata records by reserving one count for unknown words (e.g., Nw=0). It should be noted that other methods of smoothing or accounting for unknown words may be used, such as Good Turing or absolute discounting.
where
represents the combined product of p(w)×q(w) for each word in the set M. This product defines the probability P of observing at least the set of matches M among all copyright pages and metadata records. The probability P assumes that the words in the copyright pages and the metadata records are allocated independently and at random. Accordingly, for each probability P, a high value represents a less likely random occurrence and a higher likelihood that the two records (e.g., the copyright page and the metadata record) are in fact related to each other or that the metadata record relates to the matching copyright page.
Term | p(wx) | q(wx) | log(p(wx)) | log(q(wx)) |
w1 | 0.712 | 0.584 | −0.148 | −0.234 |
w2 | 0.213 | 0.154 | −0.672 | −0.812 |
w3 | 0.00005 | 0.0025 | −4.301 | −2.602 |
As calculated, the contribution of word w3, which has a much lower probability of occurring in both the collection of documents and the collection of metadata records, accounts for approximately 80% of the resulting score. Once computed for each set of matches between a copyright page and the metadata records, the scores may be used to rank the matching records. Information associated with one or more of the metadata records may be associated with the document relating to the copyright page based on the ranking. In an alternative implementation, the score S(M) may be calculated based on other functions of the probabilities p and q.
S(w)=−(log(p(w))+log(q(w)))
S(w)≦−log(p(w)−log(1/N+1),
where log(1/N+1) defines a maximum possible contribution to the score based on the collection of metadata records. That is, this value reflects the contribution of a word or phrase that appears only once in the entire collection of metadata records. By setting the contribution of the metadata records to a maximum, an upper bound for the word or phrase's score may be generated based solely on the contribution of the collection of documents. By sorting the scores of the words or phrases found in the selected copyright page based on the upper bound, unnecessary queries relating to the collection of metadata records may be minimized, thereby enhancing the performance of the scoring method.
S(w)≦−log(p(w)−log(q(W)),
where w represents the sub-phrase and W represents the parent phrase. Note that the contribution of −log(q(w)) will not be larger than that of −log(q(W)) when w is included within W, since the occurrences of sub-phrase w will always be equal to or greater than occurrences of parent phrase W in the collection of metadata records. By restricting upper bound score for the sub-phrase based on the parent phrase, a more accurate estimated score may be calculated as the score upper bound, resulting in more accurate placement into the list of words and phrases.
