- FIG. 1A illustrates a distributed computer system 100 in accordance with some embodiments.
- the distributed system 100 includes one or more web servers 120 that host web sites and serve web pages upon receiving requests from clients 110 .
- the web servers 120 collect web traffic data in logfiles 130 .
- the web pages hosted by the web servers 120 include one or more embedded computer programs such as Javascript codes for capturing the web traffic data.
- the embedded computer programs When a user requests and downloads the web pages to a client 110 , the embedded computer programs also reside in the client 110 and monitor the user's activities on the web pages. This approach can avoid some web caching-related issues and is sometimes referred to as “page tagging.”
- a web server 120 may employ both mechanisms for gathering web traffic data.
- the distributed system 100 includes an analytics system 140 that includes a log processor 150 for extracting web page hit data from the logfiles 130 or receiving web page hit data captured by the embedded computer programs from the clients 110 and storing the hit data in a hits database 155 .
- One or more aggregation servers 160 process the hit data and generate aggregated web analytics data that is stored in aggregates database 165 .
- the time series gathering servers 170 extract or receive newly aggregated data from the aggregates database 165 and create or update a plurality of time series for each web site, which are stored in the time series database 175 . In some embodiments, the time series gathering servers 170 also extract web analytics data from the hits database 155 .
- One or more event detection servers 180 process the time series in the database 175 at regular time interval (e.g.
- the event detection process is a rule-based one in which the event detection servers 180 extract user-specified alert rules from the alert rules database 195 .
- the analytics system 140 includes a query processor 190 for accessing the aggregates database 165 , the time series database 175 , and the events database 185 , and returning the query results as web analytics reports to users of the analytics system 140 (who use the analytics system to track the visitors' activities at one or more of their web sites). If the user-requested data has not been aggregated, the query processor 180 reads the raw hits data in real time and computes the desired aggregates from it.
- the analytics system 140 processes and returns a set of the web analytics reports that correspond to a desired data view specified by a user. In some embodiments, the analytics system 140 identifies those hits in the hits database 155 that are context-insensitive and processes these hits to incrementally update a first plurality of aggregate tables in the aggregates database 165 . The analytics system 140 identifies those hits in the hits database 155 that are context-sensitive and processes these hits to incrementally update a second plurality of aggregate tables using the second context-sensitive entries, but only, at the end of the specified period of time, such as at the end of the day. Doing so speeds up the incremental updates to more than 90% of the data, as discussed below.
- the distributed system 100 also includes a plurality of data servers 106 that store one or more data structures, such as tables, that may be used by the analytics system 140 for storage.
- the data servers 106 store the logfiles 130 , the hit data 155 , the aggregate data 165 , the time series data 175 , and/or the events data 185 .
- data servers 106 are clustered in a data center or in two or more interconnected data centers.
- the distributed system 100 includes as many as 1000 data servers or more.
- the various components of the distributed system 100 are interconnected by a network 102 .
- the network 102 may be any suitable network, including but not limited to a local area network (LAN), a wide-area network (WAN), the Internet, an Ethernet network, a virtual private network (VPN), or any combination of such networks.
- the network 102 can be wired or wireless.
- the network 102 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to transport information between different networks.
- HTTP permits client devices to access various information items available on the Internet via the network 102 .
- the various embodiments of the invention are not limited to the use of any particular protocol.
- the log data entry (stored in one or more databases represented by logfiles 130 or captured by the computer program embedded in the web page) records multiple variables about the visits, typically including the IP address, the user agent, the web page viewed, the time and date that the web page was accessed and a status field.
- Each data entry in a log file represents a single “hit” on a file hosted by a web server 120 , and consists of a number of fields (explained below in connection with FIG. 2 ). Any server request is considered a hit. For example, when a visitor calls up a web page with six images, that is seven hits—one for the page, and six for the images.
- the visitor may have employed a query in a search engine and the web-site under scrutiny was turned up in the search results.
- the corresponding entry in the log data may reveal a “reference” and the “search term” entered by the visitor.
- the visitor is not an individual, but rather a software process such as an Internet robot, web crawler or spider, link checker, mirror agent, hacker, or other such entity used to systematically peruse vast amounts of data available via the network 102 .
- the log data entry corresponding to such accesses may display an IP address, host name and/or user agent that may be associated with such entities.
- a session identifier or session ID is a unique identifier (such as, a fixed-length alphanumeric string) that a web server assigns to a specific user for the duration of that user's visit and that identifies the user's session (maybe a series of related message exchanges).
- Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP. For example, a buyer who visits a seller's web site wants to collect a number of articles in a virtual shopping cart and then finalize the shopping transaction by going to the site's checkout page. This typically involves an ongoing communication including several web pages requested by the client 110 and sent back by the server 120 . In such a situation, it is vital to keep track of the current state of the shopper's cart, and a session ID is one way to achieve that goal.
- a session ID is typically granted to a visitor on his first visit to a web site. It is different from a user ID because sessions are typically short-lived (they expire after a preset time of inactivity which may be minutes or hours) and may become invalid after a certain goal has been met (for example, once the buyer has finalized his order, he can not use the same session ID to add more items).
- FIG. 1B illustrates the distributed system 100 with an emphasis on the client-server interactions in accordance with some embodiments.
- a client 110 (also known as a “client device”) may be any computer or similar device through which a user of the client 110 can submit data access requests to and receive results or other services from the analytics system 140 . Examples include, without limitation, desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, mobile devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, set-top boxes, or any combination of the above.
- a respective client 110 may contain at least one client application 112 for submitting requests to the analytics system 140 .
- the client application 112 can be a web browser or other type of application that permits a user to access the services provided by the analytics system 140 .
- the client application 112 includes one or more client assistants 114 .
- a client assistant 114 can be a software application that performs tasks related to assisting a user's activities with respect to the client application 112 and/or other applications.
- a client assistant 114 includes a local copy of the executable version of the embedded computer programs for collecting web analytics data relating to web pages from a particular web site.
- the client assistant 114 may assist a user at the client 110 with browsing information (e.g., web pages), processing information (e.g., query results) received from the analytics system 140 , and monitoring the user's activities on the query results.
- the client assistant 114 is embedded in a web page (e.g., a query results web page) or other documents downloaded from the analytics system 140 .
- the client assistant 114 is a part of the client application 112 (e.g., a plug-in application of a web browser).
- the client 110 further includes a communication interface 118 to support the communication between the client 110 and other devices (e.g., the analytics system 140 or another client 110 ).
- the query processor 190 includes a web interface 192 (sometimes referred to as a “front-end server”) and a server application 194 (sometimes referred to as a “mid-tier server” or “mid-tier API”).
- the web interface 192 receives data access requests from client devices 110 and forwards the requests to the server application 194 .
- the server application 194 processes the requests including generating database queries associated with a request, applying the queries to different databases for data requested by the client, and returning the query results to the requesting clients 110 .
- the client application 112 at a particular client 110 displays the result to the user who submits the original request.
- each of the databases shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B is effectively a database management system including a database server that is configured to manage a large number of data records stored in the corresponding database.
- the database server In response to a query submitted by the server application 194 , the database server identifies zero or more data records that satisfy the query and returns the data records to the server application 194 for further processing.
- the analytics system 140 is an application service provider (ASP) that provides web analytics services to its customers (e.g., a web site owner) by visualizing the web traffic data generated at a web site in accordance with various user requests.
- ASP application service provider
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a data structure used in the hits database 155 to store sessionized web traffic data at different web sites in accordance with some embodiments.
- the web traffic data stored in the data structure 200 have a hierarchical structure. The top level of the hierarchy corresponds to different web sites 200 A, 200 B (i.e., different web servers). For a respective web site, the traffic data is grouped into multiple sessions 210 A, 210 B, and each session having a unique session ID 220 .
- a session ID uniquely identifies a user's session with the web site 200 A for the duration of that user's visit.
- session-level attributes include the operating system 220 B (i.e., the operating system the computer runs on from which the user accesses the web site), the browser name 220 C (i.e., the web browser application used by the user for accessing the web site) and the browser version 220 D, geographical information of the computer such as the country 220 E and the city 220 F, etc.
- the web traffic data within a user session is further divided into one or more hits 230 A to 230 N.
- a hit typically corresponds to a request to a web server for a document such as a web page, an image, a JavaScript file, a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file, etc.
- Each hit 230 A may be characterized by attributes such as the type of hit 240 A (e.g. transaction hit, etc.), the referral URL 240 B (i.e., the web page the visitor was on when the hit was generated), the timestamp 240 C that indicates when the hit occurs and so on.
- session-level and hit-level attributes as shown in FIG. 2 are listed for illustrative purposes only.
- a session or a hit of web traffic data may include many other attributes that either exist in the raw traffic data (e.g., the timestamp) or can be derived from the raw traffic data by the analytics system 150 (e.g., the average pageviews per session).
- the aggregation servers 160 is responsible for aggregating the data records in the hits database 155 at a regular time interval (e.g., per day or per hour) based on their respective session IDs and other dimension or metric attributes. For example, the aggregation servers 160 may determine the total number of visits to a web site during one day by counting the number of sessions associated with the web site for the same day. The aggregation servers 160 may also determine the total number of visits to a web site using a particular type or even version of web browser during one day by counting the number of sessions associated with the web site for the same day that have the specified type or even version of web browser. In some embodiments, the aggregation servers 160 determine values for hundreds or even thousands of predefined attributes based on the hits data records and store the determined values and their associated attributes in a data structure like the one shown in FIG. 3 in accordance with some embodiments.
- a regular time interval e.g., per day or per hour
- the aggregated data stored in the data structure 300 also has a hierarchical structure.
- the top level of the hierarchy corresponds to different sources 300 A, 300 B (e.g., different web sites), each source having a unique source ID 310 A.
- the aggregated metrics 310 B include those attributes and associated values that are determined from the hits data for a predefined period of time without applying any restrictions. For example, if the predefined period of time is one day, the visits attribute 320 A may be associated with one or more pairs of (time, value) 330 A in which the time represents a specific day such as Oct.
- the pageview attribute 320 B is also associated with one or more pairs of (time, value) 330 B in which the time represents a specific day and the value represents the total number of pageviews during the same day regardless of, e.g., what web browser is used for each pageview.
- a breakdown of a lump sum metric value (e.g., the visits 320 A) into multiple values defined by different conditions is desired because it can provide more information to a web analyst about the web traffic.
- the conditions 310 C limit the aggregation of web traffic data for a particular web site to sessions whose country is China.
- the aggregation servers 160 generate another set of aggregated metrics 320 C by skipping any session whose country is not China.
- the conditions 310 D focuses only on the sessions that use Firefox as the web browser. Accordingly, the aggregated metrics 320 D should not take into account of any session that uses Internet Explorer.
- condition-free aggregated metrics 310 B may be derived from the conditioned aggregated metrics 320 C, 320 D.
- the aggregate servers 160 typically pre-compute values for many hundreds of aggregated metrics with or without conditions and store those values in the aggregates database 165 for future use.
- One use of the aggregates database 165 is to detect events of potential interest in the web analytics data and present them to a web analyst in an intuitive manner.
- An event of potential interest (also referred to as an alert or an anomaly in this application) is something that might be valuable to the web analyst but is hidden in the vast amount of web traffic data and difficult to identify.
- a market analyst is very interested in learning the advertisement's effectiveness in terms of whether there is any traffic increase at the web site during a predefined time period, from what source it sees the largest traffic increase or decrease, and how much of the increased web traffic is related to the advertisement (e.g., as measured by the click-through rate).
- a webmaster concerned with the security of a web site is interested in learning about abnormal web traffic patterns as early as possible to prevent serious attacks.
- One aspect of the present application is to develop a system that can automatically detect those events of potential interest from the web analytics data with no or minimal user effort and present the detection result to the web analyst in an efficient and user-friendly manner to help the web analyst's decision making process.
- the process of identifying any events of potential interest in the web analytics data begins with deriving a number of time series or time sequences from the aggregated web analytics data stored in the data structure shown in FIG. 3 and store the time series in another data structure for further processing.
- a number of time series or time sequences from the aggregated web analytics data stored in the data structure shown in FIG. 3 and store the time series in another data structure for further processing.
- at least two ways of detecting events of potential interest are disclosed in the present application: (i) model-based event detection; and (ii) rule-based event detection.
- the model-based event detection method described herein applies one or more statistical models to a time series to forecast or predict or estimate one or more values for a future time period and then compares the predicted values with the actual value when available. If the differences between the predicted values and the actual value meet a predefined condition, an event of potential interest or an anomaly is identified for the corresponding time period.
- the rule-based approach combines the prediction models and the predefined condition of the model-based approach into a user-specified alert rule.
- one alert rule may specify that an event of potential interest is detected if the revenue metric attribute of a website at a particular date drops at least 15% than the revenue metric attribute of the same website at the same date of the previous year.
- the model-based or rule-based event detection method can also be performed on a collection of time series data, e.g., in a batch mode, to not only predict anomalies in the future (which is typically the current day, week, or month) but also identify anomalies in the past.
- the anomaly prediction for the current time period e.g., today, this week or month
- the prediction for the current time period may start right after the time series update with the data samples of the immediately previous time period.
- the anomaly prediction for the current time period uses the data samples from the current time period as well.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a data structure that stores time series data extracted from the aggregated web traffic data in accordance with some embodiments.
- the time series data stored in the data structure 400 has a hierarchical structure.
- the top level of the hierarchy corresponds to different sources 400 A, 400 B (e.g., different web sites), each source having a unique source ID 410 A.
- the source ID 4100 A may be the same as the source ID 310 A for the same source.
- each source in the data structure 400 may be associated with a plurality of time series, each time series having a unique combination of metric and condition.
- the metric 410 B is the number of new visits to a website during a day and the condition 410 C is that only new visits that come from Paris should be considered.
- the time series 410 D includes a time series ID 420 A and one or more time series updates 420 B, 420 C and each time series update includes one or more pairs of (time, value) 430 A wherein the “time” parameter corresponds to a particular day and the “value” parameter corresponds to a particular number of new visits from Paris during that day.
- time series including multiple updates is provided below in connection with FIG. 6B .
- each source may be characterized by hundreds of metric and dimension attributes in the hits database 155 .
- Different combination schemes of the metric and dimension attributes may produce thousands of possible time series. From a web analyst's perspective, not every possible time series is important enough to justify a spot in the time series database 175 .
- each (condition-free or conditioned) time series stored in the time series database 175 is generated because it may carry information of interest to many web analysts.
- a web master of a website is allowed to define his or her own new metric or dimension attributes or customize the existing metric or dimension attributes to have a better characterization of the traffic to the website.
- the new or customized attributes are additional sources for generating time series data for event detection using the invention disclosed in this application.
- a more detailed description of how to define new or customize existing attributes can be found in a pending application entitled “Extensible custom variables for tracking user traffic” U.S. Ser. No. 12/907,953 filed Oct. 20, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- the time series in the data structure 400 are derived from the aggregated data in the data structure 300 of FIG. 3 . If a time series corresponds to the aggregated metrics of an entire source free of any precondition, the condition for this time series in the data structure 400 does not exist or is none. In this case, the time series is also referred to as a “condition-free” time series. If a time series corresponds to the aggregated metrics of the source with one or more conditions, the same conditions used for aggregating the web traffic data are also the conditions in the data structure 400 for the corresponding time series. In this case, the time series is also referred to as a “conditioned” time series.
- a source has a number (e.g., 10) of condition-free time series including the metrics like visits, pageviews, bounce rate, pages/visit, new visits, and average time on site, etc.
- the source may have more (e.g., 100) conditioned time series, each having a unique set of conditions for filtering out data that does not meet any of the predefined conditions.
- the time series gathering servers 170 may need to access the hits database 155 to build the time series directly on top of the hits data or even the raw web traffic data from the logfiles 130 or the Javascript code of a client assistance 114 that monitors the user activities at a web page.
- the time series gathering servers 170 can send a request to the aggregation servers 160 for aggregating the hits data according to the time series definition and return the aggregated data to the time series gathering servers 170 .
- time series database 175 does not include every possible time series that can be derived from a website's hits data, it is a challenge for the time series database 175 to host so many time series related to different sources.
- some data quantization and compression techniques may be employed to keep the time series storage relatively small. For example, a value in the time series database 175 is rounded and stored in the form of an expression like a*2 b , where the parameter “a” is encoded with a small number (e.g., 5) of bits and the parameter “b” can have more bits such that the difference between the value and the expression is as small as possible.
- This data quantization scheme is acceptable as long as the loss of precision does not defeat the purpose of detecting those events of potential interest.
- each value at a particular date may be a very large number (e.g. three or four digits) but the difference between two consecutive dates may be much smaller (e.g., only two digits).
- v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , etc. one way of saving the storage space in this situation is to calculate the difference between two consecutive values and store the differences like v 2 ⁇ v 1 , v 3 ⁇ v 2 , etc. in the time series database 175 as long as the base value v 1 is available for reconstructing the actual values when needed.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a data structure that stores events of potential interest detected in the time series data in accordance with some embodiments.
- the events data stored in the data structure 500 also has a hierarchical structure.
- the top level of the hierarchy corresponds to different sources 500 A, 500 B (e.g., different web sites), each source having a unique source ID 510 A.
- the source ID 510 A may be the same as the source ID 310 A in the aggregates database 165 and the source ID 410 A in the time series database 175 for the same source.
- Each event 510 B is associated with an event ID 510 C, a metric 520 A, one or more conditions 520 B, a pair of (time, value) 520 C wherein the value is the actual value for that time period, a pair of (minimum, maximum) 520 D wherein the minimum and maximum values are usually determined through one or more statistical models, a significance factor 520 E that indicates the interest level of this event to a web analyst, etc.
- a significance factor 520 E that indicates the interest level of this event to a web analyst, etc.
- time series gathering servers 170 for updating the time series database 175
- event detection servers 180 for updating the events database 185 .
- the initial setup of the analytics system 140 is completed and different components within the system 140 are in a normal operation mode.
- FIG. 6A is a flow chart of a process for updating the time series data using the aggregated data updates in accordance with some embodiments.
- the time series gathering servers 170 receive one or more aggregated data updates ( 610 ).
- an aggregated data update provides information about the user activities at one or more websites during the recent predefined time interval.
- the update may include a number of visits to a particular website or any other aggregated metrics that have been collected in the time series database 175 .
- the invention of this application is not limited to web traffic data. In fact, it can be used to identify or predict anomalies in almost any type of time series data.
- the updates are pulled out of the aggregates database 165 by the time series gathering server 170 .
- the aggregation servers 160 push the updates to the time series gathering servers 170 for further processing.
- the time series gathering servers 170 identify the time series in the database 175 for updating ( 620 ).
- the time series data in the time series database 175 are organized under different sources as different sets of metrics and conditions.
- the time series gathering servers 170 collect the aggregated data updates corresponding to different time series and then apply each of them to a corresponding time series in the database 175 .
- the metric and dimension attributes associated with different updates are part of the key for identifying the corresponding time series in the database 175 .
- the data structure of the aggregated data updates is similar to the data structure 300 in FIG. 3 .
- the time series gathering servers 170 For each source ID in the update, the time series gathering servers 170 find the corresponding entry in the data structure 400 in FIG. 4 that has the same source ID. Next, the time series gathering servers 170 update the identified time series using the data entries in the update ( 630 ) and consolidates the time series updates if predefined conditions are met ( 640 ).
- FIG. 6B is a block diagram of an exemplary process for updating a time series on a weekly basis in accordance with some embodiments.
- the updates to the time series database 175 happen on a daily basis and a time series consolidation process occurs every week.
- the time series 650 includes only one time series update 650 - 0 .
- the time series update 650 - 0 includes a plurality of (time, value) pairs, one pair per day and each value corresponding to an actual value for that day.
- the oldest entry of these (time, value) pairs may be dated a long time (e.g., two years) back and the newest entry (T N , V N ) is generated this Sunday.
- each time series is used for predicting one or more values at a future time under different prediction models.
- the daily time series are summed on a weekly basis to form a weekly time series, which may be further summed on a monthly basis to a monthly time series.
- both the weekly time series and the monthly time series are typically smoother than the corresponding daily time series during the same time period. As shown in FIGS. 11A to 11C , this could result that an anomaly identified in the daily time series does not have an anomaly in the corresponding week of the weekly time series or the corresponding month of the monthly time series.
- the time series gathering servers 170 receive a time series update 650 - 1 .
- this update is stored as a separate time series update entry 420 C in the data structure 400 without being combined with the time series update 650 - 0 . By doing so, it is convenient for the servers 170 to add and access new entries into the data structure 400 . This process repeats every day and a new time series update 650 - 2 to 650 - 6 are added to the time series 650 until the next Sunday.
- the time series gathering servers 170 Upon receiving a new update entry (T N 7 , V N17 ) on the next Sunday, the time series gathering servers 170 determine that it is time to consolidate the time series updates accumulated during the past week. In some embodiments, the time series gathering servers 170 follows the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule by eliminating the oldest seven (time, value) pairs ranging from (T 0 , V 0 ) to (T 6 , V 6 ) from the time series 650 and combining the newest seven (time, value) pairs ranging from (T N1 , V N 11 ) to (T N17 , V N17 ) with the time series 650 to form a new time series 655 that includes only one time series update 655 - 0 .
- FIFO first-in-first-out
- the time series gathering servers 170 maintain a sliding time window on a fixed length of time series data when determining the existence of any events of potential interest. It should be noted that the method of updating time series as described above in connection with FIG. 6B is for illustrative purposes. There are many other ways of managing the time series that are known in the art.
- an event of potential interest has a practical, meaningful value only if the corresponding web site has received a sufficient number of visits from a broad scope of visitors for a certain time period. For example, if a website only receives a handful (e.g., less than 10) of visits per day, a small, insignificant variation of user activities (e.g., an increase of daily visits from 10 to 30) could result in a false-alarm-like event of potential interest being detected by the event detection servers 180 . Too many false-alarm-like events of potential interest would likely make the actual events of interest less visible to the web analyst.
- the time series gathering servers 170 may set a threshold such that no time series is generated for a website until the website's associated web analytics data reaches the threshold.
- the threshold can be that a website receives at least 100 visits per day or 50 visits from distinct IP addresses. This lower-bound on the generation of time series reduces not only the statistical noise level of the detected events of potential interest but also the storage needed for storing the time series.
- the event detection servers 180 are responsible for identifying events of potential interest therein and populating the identified events in the events database 185 .
- the event detection servers 180 are responsible for identifying events of potential interest therein and populating the identified events in the events database 185 .
- model-based and (ii) rule-based two different ways of detecting events are at least (i) model-based and (ii) rule-based two different ways of detecting events, which will be described in more detail below.
- FIGS. 7A and 7B are flow charts of a model-based process for detecting events of potential interest in a time series in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, this process occurs periodically (e.g. every night). In some other embodiments, this process is performed in response to a user request from a client 110 .
- the event detection servers 180 work on the time series at a predefined time. After identifying and extracting a time series and its recent update from the time series database 175 ( 710 ), the event detection servers 180 make predictions for the time series using a plurality of prediction models.
- the event detection servers 180 have a time series of the last N days of numbers of visits to a website and the number of visits for the current day. Whether the number of visits for the current day is high or low enough to be qualified as an event of potential interest, the event detection servers 180 need to determine the trend of the number of visits at the website and use the trend to estimate a predicted number of visits for the current day using the time series of the last N days of numbers of visits (note that the value of N may vary for different forecasting models). Although many statistical models can be used to making the prediction. Two types of modeling techniques are described herein for illustration: (i) linear regression; and (ii) Holt-Winters exponential smoothing.
- linear regression is an approach of modeling a linear relationship between a dependent variable y and one or more independent variables x 1 , x 2 . . . , x n , such that the linear model's unknown parameters can be estimated from the observed data.
- a numerical solution to the matrix of linear equations can determine the two parameters ⁇ and ⁇ .
- ⁇ and ⁇ the estimated ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ and ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ .
- an estimated range of the number of visits at a given date using linear regression can be expressed as follows: [ v j ⁇ s j ,v j +s j ] where s j represents the variance of the prediction using linear regression.
- exponential regression is an approach that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to the past observations as they get older.
- one form of exponential smoothing i.e. single exponential smoothing
- w 0 ⁇ v 0 , w i ⁇ v i +(1 ⁇ ) w i-1
- the parameter ⁇ helps to define the amount of weight given to a past observation.
- the weight given to the observation at the k th day in the past from the current date is expressed as: ⁇ (1 ⁇ ) k-1
- double exponential smoothing another form of exponential smoothing (i.e., double exponential smoothing) is used for making the forecasting to capture a trend in the time series, if there is any.
- the parameter ⁇ is set to be no greater than the parameter ⁇ .
- other non-linear statistical modeling schemes such as the triple exponential smoothing may be used to take care of the seasonality (also known as periodicity) in the time series data, which feature is typically prominent when a long time series is used for forecasting and the time series itself demonstrates some cyclic patterns.
- the seasonality also known as periodicity
- some websites such as a weather forecasting website usually receive more traffic every Friday of each week because many visitors are interested in learning the weather condition during the weekend. In this case, the number of visits to the website may show a fluctuating pattern on a weekly basis and the triply exponential smoothing may be more appropriate for capturing the trend accurately.
- the number of past observations or actual data samples used for predicting the future value affects the predicted value's sensitivity to the recent changes of the actual data samples.
- three time-window lengths i.e., 4 days, 21 days, and 56 days, are chosen as the numbers of past observations used for making separate predictions so as to capture both the recent changes of the actual samples and the long-term trends using different predictions if the predicted values are daily-based or weekly-based. If the predicted values are monthly-based, the three time-window lengths are respectively, 0.5 month, 3 months, and 8 months according to some embodiments.
- the length of a time window used for predicting a value at a future time determines whether the predicted value is more or less likely to be affected by a recent fluctuation in the time series.
- a prediction model that uses a longer time window considers more data samples into the past for forecasting a value in the future. This effect is similar to a low-pass filter such that the predicted outcome is less sensitive to the recent fluctuation in the time series and it is more likely to capture the trend in the time series.
- a prediction model based on a short time window uses fewer data samples to make the prediction and the predicted result is usually more sensitive to the recent fluctuation in the time series.
- a combination of the predicted values based on the different lengths of time series may result in a more reliable prediction that takes into account both the long-term and short-term features in the time series.
- the event detection servers 180 make nine predictions using the two modeling techniques and the three different lengths of time windows.
- three out of the nine forecasted models are derived from linear regression and the other six models are from double exponential smoothing because three possible values ⁇ x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ⁇ , which are ranked in a monotonically increasing order, are candidates for each of the two parameters ⁇ and ⁇ .
- ⁇ is set to be no greater than ⁇ .
- the event detection servers 180 compare the actual value of the current date with each of the six predictions ( 720 ). Based on the comparison result, the event detection servers 180 determine whether an event of potential interest is detected or not ( 740 ). For each determined event, the event detection servers 180 also give it a significance factor that indicates how unlikely the event is ( 750 ) and stores the event in the events database 185 ( 760 ). In general, the more unlikely the event is, the more interested the web analyst may be.
- the web analyst would probably like to investigate the cause behind this jump and find out, e.g., whether it relates to a potential hacker's attack or a successful commercial promotion that immediately preceded the event.
- the analytics system 140 presents to a user such as a web analyst a highly-reliable “roadmap,” with which the web analyst can quickly “plow” through a large amount of web traffic data and derive information valuable for improving the quality of service offered by the website.
- the event detection servers 180 then return to select the second model, [500, 154]. This time, the comparison indicates that the actual number 618 is within the scope of the second model ( 730 - 1 , yes) and the event detection servers 180 then go ahead working the next model under the last model is processed ( 730 - 3 , yes).
- three out of the six models i.e., [500, 154], [588, 112], and [693, 87] are satisfied by the actual number 618 and three other models, i.e. [344, 15], [402, 23], and [389, 73] are not satisfied by the actual number 618.
- the event detection servers 180 determine that the actual number of visits 618 is an event of potential interest ( 740 - 2 ) and chooses a significance factor for the event ( 740 - 3 ).
- the significance factor of an event is the significance factor of one of the unsatisfied prediction models such that (i) the actual number is more likely to satisfy this prediction model than any other unsatisfied prediction models and (ii) the actual number would satisfy more than half of all the prediction models by satisfying this prediction model and therefore no longer qualify as an event.
- the event detection servers 180 also use the models to predict the minimum and maximum of the expected value for that particular time period ( 740 - 4 ). This value gives a user a range of a normal value for that time period had there been no anomalous user activities.
- the predicted metric values according to different models are ordered by their magnitudes. For example, 10 models result in a sequence of 10 predicted values. Among the 10 predicted values, the second to the lowest value is chosen to be the minimum of the expected value and the second to the highest value is chosen to be the maximum of the expected value if the actual value is outside the range defined by the pair of (minimum, maximum). Otherwise, no minimum or maximum values are available for the corresponding event.
- rule-based event detection Compared with the model-based event detection that requires little user interaction, the rule-based event detection described below provides an end user with more control on what kind of user activities may be potentially “interesting” or valuable. Since these two approaches are often complimentary to each other, they may provide better outcomes if used in combination.
- FIG. 7C is a flow chart of a rule-based process for detecting events of potential interest in a time series in accordance with some embodiments.
- the event detection servers 180 identify one or more alert rules ( 770 ) in the alert rules database 195 .
- the event detection servers 180 query the alert rules database 195 for any alert rules that may be applicable to the time series associated with the data source.
- the alert rules database 195 stores a plurality of user-specified event triggering conditions that different users enter through a graphical user interface at a client 110 , an example of which is described below in connection with FIG. 12E .
- the alert rules may be stored in the same database as the dataset segment schemes supported by the analytics system 140 .
- the event detection servers 180 select one of the identified alert rules ( 772 ) and apply the alert rule to the time series database 175 to identify those time series, if any, that satisfy the alert rule ( 774 ) and store them in the events database 195 as trigging events ( 778 ). For example, if the time series is a sequence of numbers of visits from visitors in China, the application of an alert rule that triggers an event if the visits from China increase by 10% would be appropriate (although the time series may fail to trigger such event if the recent time series update does not show at least 10% increase of visits). In contrast, another alert rule that triggers an event if the visits from Brazil drop 5% would not be applicable.
- the event detector servers 180 repeat the aforementioned process until the last alert rule associated with the data source has been processed ( 780 , yes). In some embodiments, these triggering events will be shown to a user through a graphical user interface per the user's request. In some other embodiments, the analytics system 140 also notifies the user of the triggering event through other communication channels such as email, text messaging, voicemail, etc.
- the aforementioned description focuses primarily on how the analytics system 140 detects events of potential interest in the collected web analytics data through data aggregation and time series data analysis.
- the following description shifts its focus on how the events of potential interest are served to the users of the analytics system 140 in a client-server environment like the one shown in FIG. 1B .
- FIGS. 8A and 8B are flow charts illustrating how the analytics system prepares and serves a report of events of interest in response to a user request in accordance with some embodiments.
- a user submits a request for viewing an event report for a particular web site.
- the client 110 Upon receipt of the user request ( 802 ), the client 110 generates a request for the event report to the analytics system 140 ( 814 ).
- the client request is an HTTP request.
- the query processor 190 in the analytics system 140 transforms the client request into one or more queries to the events database 185 and submits them to the database ( 810 ).
- the events database 185 identifies the corresponding events data records (if any) ( 814 ) and returns them to the query processor 190 for preparing a response to the client request ( 816 ).
- the request from the client 110 includes a range of dates and a sensitivity level for querying the events database ( 814 - 1 ).
- the events database 185 chooses one of the dates for further processing ( 814 - 2 ).
- the further processing includes retrieving events associated with the chosen date ( 814 - 3 ); identifying and counting the events whose respective significance factors are at least equal to or higher than the user-specified sensitivity threshold ( 814 - 4 ); and generating a dataset segment scheme for event identified event ( 814 - 5 ).
- the events database 185 After looping through all the dates ( 814 - 6 , yes), the events database 185 returns the information about the identified events to the query processor 190 .
- the query processor 190 it compiles an event report using the events information returned from the events database 185 ( 818 ) and then returns the report to the client 110 ( 820 ). Upon receiving the event report ( 822 ), the client 110 displays the report to the user ( 824 ). Exemplary screenshots of the graphical user interface for displaying the event reports are described below in connection with FIGS. 11A to 11C .
- FIG. 9 is a block diagram of a client device used by, e.g., a web analyst, for requesting and rendering web analytics reports in accordance with some embodiments.
- the client 110 generally includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 902 , one or more network or other communications interfaces 904 , memory 912 , and one or more communication buses 914 for interconnecting these components.
- the communication buses 914 may include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between components.

- memory 912 and 1012 may store additional modules and data structures not described above.
- FIGS. 9 and 10 are intended more as functional descriptions of the various features of a client device and analytics system rather than a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein.
- items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated.
- some items shown separately in FIG. 10 like the query processor 190 and the server application 194 as well as items like the databases 155 to 195 could be implemented by one or more servers.
- the actual number of server computers used to implement the analytics system 140 , and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- FIGS. 11A to 11C are screenshots of graphical user interfaces that display daily, weekly, and monthly events of potential interest, respectively, in accordance with some embodiments.
- FIG. 11A depicts a daily alerts graphical user interface 1102 during a 30-day period from Sep. 15, 2009 to Oct. 15, 2009.
- the user interface by default displays the daily alerts when the user clicks the entry 1100 .
- Below the daily visits curve 1101 is a bar chart 1104 illustrating the respective total number of events of potential interest during the 30-day period, each day occupying one clickable spot in the bar chart 1104 .
- the user interface automatically focuses on the entry on the far right of the bar chart, which corresponds to the current date, Oct. 15, 2009. But a user can click on other parts of the bar chart 1104 to investigate the alert information for any other day within the last 30 days.
- the total number of events 1106 for the date of Oct. 15, 2009 (referred to as “alerts” in the figure) is zero.
- the analytics system 140 does not identify any anomalous user activity patterns for that day under the current sensitivity level 1112 .
- the custom alerts region 1108 which is associated with the “Custom Alerts” checkbox 1103 and used for displaying those alert rule-based events
- the automatic alerts region 1110 which is associated with the “Automatic Alerts” checkbox 1105 and used for displaying those model-based events, are both empty. Note that a de-selection of either checkboxes 1103 or 1105 removes the corresponding alert regions 1108 or 1110 from the graphical user interface.
- FIG. 11B depicts a weekly alerts graphical user interface 1120 for the past five weeks from Sep. 13, 2009 to Oct. 15, 2009, e.g., after a user selection of the “Weekly Alerts” link 1124 on the left of the user interface.
- the current week of Oct. 11-15, 2009 is highlighted in the user interface.
- a user can click on the bar chart below the curve 1122 to select another week of data. Note that there is no alert for the current week including Oct. 15, 2009 because it is not over yet and the forecasting of the present application is for the most recently completed week.
- the curve 122 which corresponds to roughly the same period of time, is smoother because, as explained above, the weekly summation of the daily data samples acts as a low-pass filter. As a result, the number of weekly alerts during each week is typically smaller than the sum of daily alerts during the same week. This also applies to the monthly alert described below in connection with FIG. 11C .
- This user interface is similar to the one shown in FIG. 11A except that the total numbers of data samples as shown in the curve 1122 drop from 30 (which corresponds to the last 30 days from Sep. 15, 2009 to Oct. 15, 2009) to 5 (which corresponds to the last five weeks from Sep. 13, 2009 to Oct. 15, 2009). In this example, the number of alerts for the week of Oct. 11-15, 2009 remains to be zero under the current sensitivity level.
- FIG. 11C depicts a monthly alerts graphical user interface 1140 for the past 12 months from Oct. 1, 2008 to Oct. 15, 2009, after a user selection of the “Monthly Alerts” 1144 on the left.
- This user interface is similar to the one shown in FIG. 11A except that the total numbers of data samples as shown in the curve 1142 drop from 30 to 12. In this example, the number of alerts for the month of Oct. 1-15, 2009 remains to be zero under the current sensitivity level.
- FIGS. 12A to 12E are screenshots of graphical user interfaces that displays information relating to events of potential interest in accordance with some embodiments.
- FIG. 12A depicts the same daily alerts 1102 shown in FIG. 11A but at a different date, Sep. 30, 2009.
- the number of alerts 1204 on Sep. 30, 2009 at the current sensitivity level 1212 is three.
- the custom alerts region 1206 is empty and all the three alerts are model-based automatic alerts.
- one of the alerts 1208 suggests a significant (83%) drop of bounce rate for visits that exit from a particular web page 1209 from the expected range of 34.26%-39.96% to 6.29%.
- a visual indication 1211 of the alert's significance factor is also shown in the same row, indicating how unlikely this alert is under a normal situation.
- Two alerts 1210 , 1214 are grouped together under the label “Visits.” Note that although these two alerts are both related to the number of visits to the website (in this case, www.googlestore.com), they have different conditions and therefore have different meanings.
- the alert 1210 indicates that the number of visits to the website that exit the website from the web page “www.googlestore.com/default.asp” during Sep. 30, 2009 increased more than 500% when compared with the median value derived from the multiple prediction models.
- the expected range from 0 to 458 is determined using the method described above in connection with FIGS. 7A and 7B .
- the alert 1214 indicates that the number of visits to the website that were referred to the website from the web page “www.google.com/intl/cn/about.html” during Sep. 30, 2009 increased more than 281% when compared with the median value derived from the multiple prediction models. This may be because that the referral web page has a link to the website www.googlestore.com and many users who visit Google's website found that link and then clicked it through.
- the reference value used for measuring the percentage may be the actual value of the immediately preceding time period, the averaged actual value derived from multiple time periods in the past, the mean of the expected range or other reference values that are well-known in the art.
- FIG. 12B depicts a graphical user interface 1220 when the user-selected date moves from Sep. 30, 2009 to Oct. 14, 2009. Note that the number of alerts for the new dates increases to 20. Moreover, one of the 20 alerts is a custom alert 1226 called “revenue decrease.” A user selection of the edit link 1228 brings up the definition of the custom alert as shown in FIG. 12E . According to the definition, this alert is triggered when the revenue from all traffic to the website drops more than 10% from the same day of the previous week. In other words, the revenue on Oct. 14, 2009 is less than 90% of the revenue on Oct. 7, 2009.
- FIG. 12C depicts the same user interface after a user selection of the curve link 1248 next to the first automatic alert 1244 , which indicates a dramatic increase of goal conversion rate of the total traffic.
- the rate was almost zero for the entire month until a sudden jump on Oct. 14, 2009.
