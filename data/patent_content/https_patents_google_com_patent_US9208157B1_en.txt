Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to web-based video display and specifically to software tools and methods for spam detection for online user-generated videos.
- Sharing of video content on websites has become a worldwide phenomenon, supported by dozens of websites. On average, hundreds of thousands of new videos are posted every day to various video hosting websites, and this number is increasing, as the tools and opportunities for capturing video become easy to use and more widespread. Many of these video-hosting websites also provide viewers with the ability to search for a video of interest. It is estimated that in 2006, there were over 30 billion views of user generated video content worldwide.
- Users who upload videos onto the video hosting websites are able to add descriptions and keywords (also called tags) related to their video. These descriptions and keywords are stored as metadata associated with the video.
- the metadata is indexed, and thus allows viewers to search for videos of interest by entering keywords and phrases into a search engine on the video hosting website.
- Some user attempt to intentionally misrepresent the content of their video, so that their videos appear more often in the search results, and thus are seen by more viewers.
- These users employ various methods—sometimes called “spamdexing” or “keyword stuffing”—to manipulate the relevancy or prominence of their video in the search results, for example, by stuffing their descriptions with popular words or phrase in order to target these popular queries. This results in making it more difficult for viewers to find videos that actually related to the viewer's interests, as expressed in their keyword searches.
- a system, a method, and various software tools enable a video hosting website to automatically identify posted video items that contain spam in the metadata associated with a respective video item.
- a spam detection tool for user-generated video items is provided that facilitates the detection of spam in the metadata associated with a video item.
- a video item along with its associated metadata, is stored in a video database.
- the metadata is examined and a number of unique words in the metadata associated with a video item is determined. If the number of unique words exceeds a predetermined threshold, the video item is removed from the video database. Alternately, the video item remains and portions of metadata identified as spam are used to adjust ranking.
- a video item is stored in a video database and the metadata associated with the video items is processed by a concept clustering algorithm to determine the number of concepts in the associated metadata.
- the determination of whether the item contains spam is based on the number of concepts contained in the metadata. Additionally, the determination of whether the item contains spam can be based on the combination of unrelated concepts contained in the metadata.
- a video item is stored in a video database and a process determines how many times the video item appears as a search result in the most frequent search queries received by the video hosting site.
- a set of most frequent search queries is established.
- the frequency of the appearance of the video item as a result of the set of top queries is also determined.
- the video item is removed from the video database.
- the video item remains and portions of metadata identified as spam are used to adjust ranking.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system architecture for providing spam detection for uploaded video content in accordance with one embodiment.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method of processing video items to be displayed on a video hosting website in accordance with one embodiment.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a process for detecting spam on user-generated videos in accordance with one embodiment.

- a video hosting server 100 includes a front end server 140 , a video search server 145 , a user database 150 , a video server 110 , an ingest server 115 , a video database 190 , a spam filter module 120 , and an indexing server 130 .
- Many conventional features, such firewalls, load balancers, application servers, failover servers, site management tools, and so forth are not shown so as not obscure the features of the system.
- a suitable server 100 for implementation of the system is a server or servers of the YOUTUBETM website, found at www.youtube.com; other video hosting sites are known as well, and can be adapted to operate according the teaching disclosed herein.
- web site and “server” represents any method of uploading and downloading content and is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the HTTP protocol.
- functions described in one embodiment as being performed on the server side can also be performed on the client side in other embodiments if appropriate.
- the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together.
- Each of the various servers is implemented as server program executing on server-class computer comprising a CPU, memory, network interface, peripheral interfaces, and other well known components.
- the computers themselves preferably run an open-source operating system such as LINUX, have generally high performance CPUs, 1G or more of memory, and 100G or more of disk storage.
- LINUX open-source operating system
- other types of computers can be used, and it is expected that as more powerful computers are developed in the future, they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here.
- the functionality implemented by any of the elements can be provided from computer program products that are stored in tangible computer accessible storage mediums (e.g., RAM, hard disk, or optical/magnetic media).
- a client 170 executes a browser 171 , and can connect to the front end server 140 via a network 180 , which is typically the Internet, but may also be any network, including but not limited to any combination of a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a mobile, wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network. While only a single client 170 and browser 171 are shown, it is understood that very large numbers (e.g., millions) of clients are supported and can be in communication with the website 100 at any time.
- the browser 171 can include a video player (e.g., FlashTM from Adobe Systems, Inc.), or any other player adapted for the video file formats used in the site 100 .
- a user can access a video from the site 100 by browsing a catalog of videos, conducting searches on keywords, reviewing playlists from other users or the system administrator (e.g., collections of videos forming channels), or viewing videos associated with particular user group (e.g., communities).
- a browser 171 can also access a video file indirectly, via an embedded video 177 that is accessed via an embedded hyperlink in a third party website 175 .
- Users of client 170 can also search for videos based on keywords, tags or other metadata. These requests are received as queries by the front end server 140 and provided to the video search server 145 , which then searches the video database 190 for videos that satisfy the queries.
- the video search server 145 supports searching on any fielded data for a video, including its title, description, tags, author, category, and so forth.
- Users of the client 170 and browser 171 can upload content (which can include, for example, video, audio, or a combination of video and audio) to site 100 via network 180 .
- the uploaded content is processed by an ingest server 115 , which processes the video for storage in the video database 190 . This processing can include format conversion (transcoding), compression, metadata tagging, and other data processing.
- An uploaded content file is associated with the uploading user, and so the user's account record is updated in the user database 150 as needed.
- each uploaded video is assigned a video identifier (id) when it is processed by the ingest server 115 .
- the video database 190 is used to store the ingested videos.
- the video database 190 stores video content and associated metadata, provided by their respective content owners.
- the audio files are can be encoded at .mp3 files at 64 kbps, mono, 22.1 KHz, or better quality (e.g., 128 kbps, stereo, 44.2 KHz).
- the metadata for each audio files includes an ISRC (or custom identifier), artist, song title, album, label, genre, time length, and optionally geo-restrictions that can be used for data collection or content blocking on a geographic basis.
- the spam filter module 120 processes metadata associated with each video stored in the video database 190 . Metadata associated with each stored video is analyzed in order to determine whether the video and/or its related description contains spam. Various methods to detect spam are further described below.
- the spam filter module 120 is part of the indexing server 130 and prepares the data for a given video to be uploaded.
- the indexing server 130 indexes the video and its metadata into an index.
- the indexing server 130 acts with the spam filter module 120 to check for spam in the metadata of the video.
- the ingest server 115 acts with the spam filter module to check for spam in the metadata of the video.
- FIG. 2 is a data flow diagram illustrating a method of processing video items uploaded to a video hosting website in accordance with one embodiment.
- a video item 202 is uploaded by a user on a video hosting website.
- the video item 202 contains video content and associated metadata, such as a description of the video content, tags, keywords or phrases, and tokens.
- the video item 202 and its related metadata is uploaded into a video database 190 .
- the video item 202 can also stored in a second video database 210 to be processed for spam detection.
- the video is pre-processed and the associated metadata is processed, wherein the tags, description, title, and other information associated with the video and included in the metadata is combined 220 .
- the metadata is processed for the presence of spam by the spam filter module 120 . If it is determined that the video item's metadata contains spam, the video may be removed from the video database 190 . If it is determined that the video item is free of spam, the video is indexed 130 . In some embodiments, if it is determined that the video item contains spam, the video is marked for removal at a later time. In some embodiments, if it is determined that the video item contains spam, the portion(s) of metadata identified as spam are recorded.
- the method includes an indexing server 130 that indexes the video and its metadata.
- the spam detection process is performed at the time of indexing.
- the spam filter module 120 is part of the indexing server 130 and is processed for the presence of spam content before being stored in the video database 190 .
- a video item is initially stored in video database 190 , but is removed if the video's metadata is later determined to contain spam.
- the video item is not added to the video database, and is not available for viewing, until it has been checked for spam.
- the video item is first added to the index and made available for viewing and is later checked for spam. This situation occurs, for example, when existing videos on a video viewing website are spam-checked after the are made available.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a process for detecting spam metadata on user-generated videos in accordance with one embodiment.
- some number of video items are stored in stored in the video database being operated upon (either database 190 or 210 ). Accordingly, the metadata for a video item is retrieved 302 from the database.
- the video item includes metadata such as a description of the video item, tokens, keywords, key phrases or tags.
- the metadata of the video item is processed by a concept clustering process to determine 304 a number of concepts present in the metadata associated with a video item.
- concept clustering process There are a large variety of concept clustering process that can be used for this implementation, and the present invention is not limited to any particular one.
- Concept clustering process that may be used in this regard is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,231,393, “Method and Apparatus for Learning a Probabilistic Generative Model for Text,” which is herein incorporated by reference.
- the concept clustering process can determine for any given textual input a number of concept clusters.
- the determination of whether the metadata of a particular video item is spam is based on the number of concepts in the metadata with respect to a predetermined threshold.
- the threshold is based on the distribution and average number of concept clusters in a sample of video item's metadata that is determined not to be spam.
- the threshold can be set as the value that is a particular percentile value (e.g., 90 th ) in the distribution, or some multiple of the mean number or some number (e.g., six) standard deviations above the mean number. For example, if the average number of concepts in good (i.e., non-spam) metadata is four, then the threshold can be established as five times this value, or 20 concept clusters.
- a particular percentile value e.g., 90 th
- the mean number e.g., six
- the presence of spam content may be based on measure of unrelated concepts (“MUC”) in the metadata of a given video item.
- MUC unrelated concepts
- the degree to which the concepts in the metadata are related to each other can also be determined based on the underlying representation of the clusters (e.g. vector representation).
- the degree to which concepts in the metadata are related can also be described as the “distance” between clusters of the metadata.
- the MUC for a given video item can be a number of unrelated clusters, the average distance (or relatedness) of the clusters, or the maximum distance between any two clusters, or other variations.
- a threshold for the MUC value is based on analysis of the distribution and average value for good metadata.
- the threshold can be set as a particular percentile value (e.g., 90 th ) in the distribution, or as the value that is a multiple of the mean number of unrelated concepts or some number (e.g., six) standard deviations above the mean number.
- the video item is removed from the video database 308 (or alternatively, marked for later removal), or alternatively, not indexed or placed in the database.
- Certain embodiments of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of a method. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention can be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, can be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by a variety of operating systems.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
