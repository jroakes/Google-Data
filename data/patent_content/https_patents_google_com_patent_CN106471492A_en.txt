The accuracy of the action data of card resource, and carrying out scoring to the resource in response to inquiry, ranking or both when, will
Checking is taken into account.
It is described in more detail below these features and supplementary features.
Example Operating Environment
Fig. 1 is wherein the action of resource to be verified with the block diagram of index and the example context 100 searched for.Such as interconnect
The computer network 102 of net connects publisher website 104, user equipment 106 and search system 110.
Publisher website 104 issues resource 105.Described resource includes web page resources and locally applied resource.Publisher's net
Stand and 104 be associated with domain and by the trust server of one or more of one or more positions.One example publisher net
Station is the set of the web page resources 105 being formatted with HTML (HTML), and it can comprise text, image, many matchmakers
Internal appearance and programming element.
Web page resources can be provided by the publisher website 104 on computer network 102 and have resource ground
Any data of location such as URL (URL).Internet resources can be html page, image file, video
File, audio file and feeding source etc..Webpage can include embedded information such as metamessage and hyperlink, and/or
Embedded instruction such as client-side script.
Another type of resource publisher is the application publisher providing locally applied resource.Locally applied specially set
Meter is to run in special user equipment operating system and machine firmware.As used in this description, " example environments " are
Locally applied interior display environment, and wherein display content, text, image etc..Example environments are exclusively used in specific local
Application, and this locally applied specific operation system being exclusively used in user equipment 106.Example environments and the web resource being rendered
Difference be, example environments locally applied interior generate and be exclusively used in that this is locally applied, and web page resources can be
Render in the compatible any browser of web page resources, and the operating system independent of user equipment.
User equipment 106 is to be asked and to be received web page resources and locally applied resource by computer network 102
Electronic equipment.Exemplary user equipment 106 includes personal computer, mobile communication equipment and tablet PC.
In order to search for including web resource and the locally applied resource 105 of the two, search system 110 accesses web index 112.
Web index 112 is the index of resource 105, and it is for example set up by capturing publisher website 104 and resource 105.
User equipment 106 submits search inquiry to search system 110.In response to each inquiry, search system 110 accesses rope
Draw 112 to identify the resource related to this inquiry.For example, search system 110 can be respectively with web resource Search Results and local
The form identification resource of application searches result.Search Results are once generated, and are provided to receive the user equipment of inquiry
106.
Web resource Search Results are by identification web resource and to provide the search system of the information meeting particular search query
The data of 110 generations.The web resource Search Results of resource can include web page title, one section of text from Resource Access and
The URL of the URLs of resource such as webpage.Locally applied Search Results are specified locally applied and can be included referring to
" deep linking " of fixed locally applied specific environment example, and this deep linking is configured such that locally applied instantiation
Specified example environments.For example, the selection to locally applied Search Results is so that locally applied startup is (if be arranged on
On user equipment 106) and build environment example, for example locally applied particular user interface, it is in the form of screenshot capture
Application searches result is quoted.For example, application searches result can include describing the screenshot capture of the example of example environments, and
And the selection of locally applied Search Results made locally applied present similar to the interface shown in screenshot capture, example to user
As, the difference between example environments and screenshot capture may by being associated with user, may be used to create a log assembly that this screen
When the different settings of the locally applied setting of sectional drawing cause.
The action of index resource
As described above, user it is frequently desirable to allowing their user equipment execution action, or can preferably may be supplied
Should there is the resource of execution specific action.For example, user " can listen Brandenburg Concertos (Listen to input inquiry
Brandenburg Concertos.)”.Search system 110 can detect by moving that this inquiry is specified according to this inquiry lexical item
Make, i.e. play the media recording of one or more of Brandenburg Concertos on a user device so that user
This media can be heard.Resource therefore, it is possible to execute this action will be the most useful to user.
Similarly, user is it may be desirable to the dinner making specific evening is subscribed.This user can tell order [to City
Diner makes 7 points of reservation tomorrow evening (Make reservation for City Diner for tomorrow
evening at seven)].User equipment can operable to convert speech into text and the text be supplied to search
System 110.In some instances, voice can be supplied to search system 110 or another system by user equipment, and this search
System converts speech into text.When another system converts speech into text, text is supplied to search by this another system
System 110.And then, search system 110 can detect the action specified by this inquiry, is subscribed at City Diner.
The process that these are inputted is executed to detect desired action by query processor 111.Query processor 111 is permissible
Realize any suitable Query Processing Algorithm to process inquiry to detect action.For example, query processor 111 can be realized detecting
The natural language processor of action invocation etc..Similarly, query processor 111 can realize CFG, its utilization
The terminal symbol corresponding with the argument of specific action and this action and nonterminal symbol to parse this specific action.Also can use
Other Query Processing Techniques.
But although search system 110 can determine that specific input can be serviced well by the execution of action,
But the action that resource is supported may advantageously can not be identified by the subject content of resource, for example, when resource causes generation dynamic
When making but not including the description to action.Therefore, search system 110 is processed and rope to the action data 114 of resource 105
Draw.This action data describes the action that each resource is supported, wherein each action is can be set by the user of process resource
The action of standby execution.Action data be define the action that description specific resources support, how call action, the parameter of action, with
And the structural data of the vocabulary of information of other action correlation.For example, restaurant application can have including action data 114
Application inventory, described action data 114 describes the type of action being executed by this application<AT>, action parameter<AP>Or each is dynamic
Make the action output of type AT, each type of action AT<AO>, other action correlation functions.
An example of action data is realized in Schema.org action.For example, for music service
For the web resource 105 of Example_Player.com, based on the net for Brandenburg Concertos can be play
The example action data of the Schema.Org action vocabulary of page can have following form：
For webpage, action data can be provided with markup language form.For application, action data can be used as should
There is provided with a part for inventory or with the metadata of some other forms.Additionally, when realizing action data it is also possible to make
With the other vocabulary conventions different from above example.
Finally, in some described institutes, action data itself can be executed by user equipment, and its own may cause to
The specified action of user equipment execution.Therefore, action data not necessarily needs to be metadata, and also can be including so that using
Family equipment is able to carry out the data of the necessary instruction of action, and for example, action data may be at the foot that user equipment is able to carry out
This form.
Action data can be created by the publisher of resource.For specific resources, publisher will define the dynamic of resource support
The type of action made, the content that presented by this action are if any and the further feature related to the execution of action.
As described below, search system 110 can be indexed to action data, and for each resource it is possible to verify that action data
Correctly describe the action being executed by resource.
Fig. 2 is the flow chart for the instantiation procedure 200 that the action data of resource is indexed.Process 200 can be
Realize in search engine 110.The operation of process 200 is described with reference to Fig. 1.
Process 200 receives the action data of the action that description is supported by each resource for each resource in multiple resources
(202).For example, it is possible to provide action data in the period that crawls of resource to search system 110, or publisher can be by action
Data submits to search system together with corresponding resource.
For each resource, process 200 determines the action class of each action that this resource is supported according to action data
Type (204).For example, index 120 processes action data to identify the corresponding action data defining type of action.Action class
The example of type includes：The listen of its generation audio frequency broadcasting of " listening (listen) " action, " viewing (watch) " action
Its generate video playback, " install (install) " action its software is installed or executes some other installation processes, " pre-
Order (reserve) " its generation reservation of action etc..Each type of action has right according to action data pattern (schema)
The type label answered.
For each resource, process 200 determines the action ginseng of each action that this resource is supported according to action data
Number (206).For example, index 120 processes action data to identify the corresponding action ginseng to list for each type of action
Number, or if action parameter is not listed, then access action data pattern to determine the parameter type needed for this action.In order to
Illustrate, if " listening " action is automatic playback action, action parameter can include the URL of audio file.Similarly, for
" making a reservation for " action, parameter can include URL, number, the title subscribed, date and the time of booking service.
For each resource, process 200 is in the index that can be searched for by search engine to the action data of resource, action class
Type and action parameter are indexed (208).For example, as Fig. 1 institute figure is described, index 112 will be by one or more key ropes
The action data drawing is stored in association with the other data indexing for resource 112.Any suitable Index process and pattern
Can be used for action data 114 is indexed.
Checking resource action
In some embodiments, search system 110 verifies the accuracy of the action data of resource.Different from itself not
The subject content of the resource of execution action it is necessary to observe the behavior of user equipment or the virtual emulation of user equipment, with verify by
The action of resource execution is consistent with the action data of description action, and verifies that action is performed correctly.
One instantiation procedure of checking action is described with reference to Fig. 3, Fig. 3 is the instantiation procedure of the action for verifying resource
300 flow chart.Process 300 can be realized in search engine 110, is such as realized by action processor 130.Action processor
130 can be the data processing equipment of one or more of data communication computer, and runs operating system is imitated
Execution is applied and will be rendered and process webpage by genuine operation system simulated device thereon.Except checking is called to action
Outside, process 300 is it is possible to verify that action executes not correctly and mistakenly.Any suitable instrumentation and corresponding manager
(handler) signal to monitor mistake, time-out and other condition and instruction baulk or mistake can be used reality
Existing operation described below.
For each resource, process 300 determines whether the user equipment of process resource is appropriately carried out by the action of resource
The action (302) of data description.For example, action processor 130 can monitor instantiation and execute failure.This can include：Really
Determine whether resource causes the instantiation on user equipment to fail, such as cause user application crash or cause application crashes or freeze
Deng.Equally, time-out and link failure can also be interpreted instantiation failure.For example, the action data of resource can indicate this
Resource will cause the specific record of played；If however, user equipment sends for the file of record or asking of data
Ask, and the address that there occurs time-out or be sent to ask cannot be resolved it is determined that instantiation fails.Otherwise, action
Processor 130 determines that resource causes user equipment to be successfully executed action.
For the user equipment causing process resource be appropriately carried out by resource action data description action each
Resource, process 300 determines that this resource is passed through to verify (304).On the contrary, for the user equipment not causing process resource correctly
Each resource of the action that execution is described by the action data of resource, process 300 determines this resource not verified (306).
Process 300 is indexed (308) to the determination of the checking of each resource in the index.In some embodiments,
The checking data of resource can be used to be based in part on the ability of resource support action and be arranged determining whether resource is qualified
Name.In some embodiments, it is based in part on action data only to carry out ranking to by the resource of checking.Such as automatically open
Dynamic application with execute action or in response to the selection to the Search Results being linked to resource execution action automatically other operations
Checking (positive verification) certainly can be subject to.
Even if user equipment performs action really, action processor 130 can also execute the additional examination for checking.
These additional examinations may involve verifying that the operation that action executing is associated with its type, and verify and be properly generated times
The output what is specified.For example, if action is designated as " viewing " action, and perform " listening " action as an alternative, even if then
Action is listened mistakenly not execute, this resource can not also be passed through to verify.This is because the type of action " listening " observed
Mismatch the type of action " viewing " specified.
Type of action coupling between specified type of action and observed type of action is only that an example is moved
Verify.Another type of checking is the content matching of process 400 description with reference to Fig. 4.Process 400 can be in search engine
Realize in 110, such as realized by action processor 130.
Process 400 determines the content type being designated as providing by the execution of this action according to action data
(402).For example, in some embodiments, content type can given content be audio frequency, video or certain other type
Content.In the modification of these embodiments, content type can be more specific, and the theme of such as given content is for example specific
Artist, specific program or specific file.
Process 400 determines, according to the execution of action, the content type (404) that the execution of action is provided.For example, action
Processor 130 can receive the metadata of the content type that description is provided, and by specified by this metadata and action data
Content type be compared.
Process 400 determines based on content type whether the user equipment of process resource has been appropriately carried out action data institute
The action (406) of description.For example, if content type, the content of request or both coupling, action processor 130 is true
The user equipment determining process resource is appropriately carried out the action that described by action data.On the contrary, if content type, request upper
Hereafter or both mismatch, then action processor 130 determine process resource user equipment be not appropriately carried out by action number
Action according to description.
Ranking is carried out to resource based on action
Once resource and action data are indexed in index 112, then the resource passing through checking can be partly according to it
The action that executes come ranked.This allows search system 110 can highly meet the needs of user in the execution of action
The execution of such as action is had high likelihood and manifests under the situation of the needs being associated with search inquiry of user to meet
(surface) execute the resource of specific action.Fig. 5 is for resource being carried out with the instantiation procedure of ranking based on type of action
500 flow chart.Process 500 can be realized in search engine 110.
Process 500 determines the type of action (502) related to this inquiry according to the lexical item of inquiry.As described above, inquiry
Can be imported in search interface, and search system 110 can have query processor 111, its by action with checking oneself
The ad hoc inquiry language ask is associated.Under other situations, process or service can be based on can be derived from user view
Order and to generate inquiry, for example, user can say order [making 7 points of reservation tomorrow evening to City Diner].
For each resource, process 500 is based on type of action associated with the query, and the action data according to resource is determining
Action score value, wherein action score value are the tolerance (504) of the ability of action that resource executes type of action.For example, action scoring
Device 140 passes through the resource scoring of checking to each.In some embodiments, action score value can be binary system score value, wherein
First value instruction resource executes the action of type of action, and second value indicates that resource is not carried out the action of type of action.?
In other embodiment, action score value can be the continuous score value in the upper bound and lower bound, and action score value is higher, and resource executes
The ability of type of action is higher.
The ability of resource execution action can be based in part on user and call the step needed for this action.For example it is not necessary to
The resource to execute action from the input of user can have more dynamic than the resource needing user's confirmation or user profile to execute
The higher action score value of resource made.
Action score value can also be and depends on inquiry.For example, it is possible to for each resource corresponding with type of action
Determine the action parameter of the type of action needed for action of execution type of action.Equally, also determine the action ginseng with type of action
The parameter value that number matches.Then, the parameter that action score value can be matched based on the action parameter with type of action in inquiry
The number of the parameter value that the action parameter with type of action being lacked in the number of value and inquiry matches.For example it is only necessary to
Inquiring about specified parameter ratio can need specified parameter value in inquiry and adds come the resource to execute specific action
Parameter value has higher action score value come the resource to execute this action.
Process 500 is based in part on corresponding action score value and in order resource to be carried out ranking (506).Resource overall
The factors such as the authority of each of resource, the quality of resource can be taken into account by ranking.For having action score value
Resource it is also possible to when ranking is carried out to resource consideration action score value.
Additional embodiments details
In some embodiments, action data can be used for assisting user to provide information such as action parameter
Value, for carrying out call action using resource.Fig. 6 is the instantiation procedure 600 for assisting user's call action using resource
Flow chart.Process 600 can be realized in search engine 110.
Process 600 determines the type of action (602) related to search inquiry according to the lexical item of inquiry.This step similar to
Above step 502.For example, for order [making 7 points of reservation tomorrow evening to City Diner], type of action is permissible
It is " reservation ".
Process 600 determines, according to the lexical item of inquiry, the parameter value (604) that the action parameter with type of action matches.Example
As, query processor 111 or action scorer 140 can determine the parameter needed for the action of execution type of action according to inquiry
Value.For example, for type of action " reservation " it may be necessary to " restaurant name (restaurant name) ", " party title
(party name) ", the parameter of " guest's number (number of guests) ", " date (date) " and " time (time) "
Value.In this example, the parameter value matching with parameter type is " City Diner " for " restaurant name ", for " date "
It is " tomorrow ", be " at 7 points in evening " for " time ".The parameter value lacking is " guest's number " and " party title ".
Process 600 is provided for additional parameter to user equipment based on the unmatched action parameter of parameter value with inquiry
The request (606) of value.For example, action scorer 140 can send for guest's number and title of meetting to user equipment 106
Request.In order to illustrate, user equipment can show message " I can attempt to subscribe the City Diner of 7 points of tomorrow evening for you,
But I needs meet title and guest's number, you are able to tell that I meets title and guest's number？" and then, user equipment will
It is in input pattern with receiving data, such as in the form of phonetic entry or touch input.
In modification preferably, if for example parameter value can use, some supplemental characteristics can be automatically provided.Example
As when preengaging taxi, the position of user can be automatically provided.Equally, when reservation is subscribed, can automatically provide user's
Name.
The systematic collection being discussed here with regard to user personal information or can utilize personal information situation under,
Can provide a user with that chance carrys out control program or whether feature collects user profile (for example, with regard to the social networkies of user, society
Friendship action or the current location of activity, occupation, the preference of user or user), or control whether and/or how from content
Server receives content that may be more relevant with user.Furthermore, it is possible to a kind of or many before storing or using some data
Kind of mode is processing these data so that personal recognizable information is removed.For example, it is possible to process to the identity of user,
So that cannot determine that the individual of user can recognize that information, or can be by user geographical position in the case of obtaining positional information
Vague generalization (for example arriving city, postcode or state rank) is so that the ad-hoc location of user cannot be determined.Therefore, user is permissible
Control content server is collected and the mode using the information with regard to user.
