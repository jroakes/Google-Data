Definitions
- the disclosure relates generally to broadband wireless access communication systems, and more particularly to base station quantization in a broadband wireless access communication system.
- WiMAX In WiMAX (IEEE 802.16), two principle communication wireless network nodes are defined including a Base Station (BS) and a Mobile Station (MS). WiMAX offers an open standard and support to quality of service (QoS) for different categories of services.
- QoS quality of service
- the communication between the BS and MS is through an uplink channel and a downlink channel.
- MIMO systems may employ beamforming techniques to compensate for channel conditions and for increasing signal-to-noise (SNR) levels at the MS.
- SNR signal-to-noise
- indices from a codebook of beamforming vectors or matrices known by both the BS and MS are determined at the MS and recommended to be used by the BS in the beamforming technique.
- CBF codebook-based feedback
- the MS indicates the optimum precoding matrix (from the predefined codebook) to the BS via a feedback channel (e.g., the uplink channel).
- the codebook size increases significantly with the number of transmit antennas at the BS and may even increase with the number of transmitted data streams.
- DCOVF Direct covariance feedback
- ULCS uplink channel sounding
- Dedicated pilots will limit the channel estimation performance at the MS because the MSs can only use the small subset of the total number of pilot symbols that are beamformed for that MS (this is opposed to broadcast pilots where all pilots can be used for channel estimation).
- dedicated pilots may be restricted in usage due to other constraints imposed by the control channel, or other pilot signals such as the midamble, etc.
- the MS may employ an uplink channel to send a sounding waveform to a BS; a feedback channel to send DCOVF or other feedback, or even normal uplink traffic; a feedforward channel to receive from the BS codebook weights derived from the sounding waveform (or from any other feedback that is being used including normal uplink traffic, DCOVF, etc.); a receiver to receive communication from the BS; and a processor to detect beamformed data from the received communication and received codebook weights from the BS.
- the BS processes the sounding waveform, the DCOVF, or regular uplink traffic from the MS to determine codebook weights on groups of subcarriers. Additionally, the BS transmits the beamformed payload and broadcast pilots to the MS.

It should be appreciated that the example BS or MS 200 shown in the block diagram of FIG. 2 represents only one functionally descriptive example of many potential implementations.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of a broadcast pilot format 400 that may be employed in the downlink of an OFDM system.

- the broadcast pilot pattern continues in time for at least the duration of the downlink frame (and possibly further forward or back in time) and also continues in frequency for the entire bandwidth of the OFDM system.
- pilot symbols are available to all MSs that have data assigned on any subset of the data carrying subcarriers in the frame or in fact any mobile in the system.
- the availability of pilot symbols that span the entire bandwidth and the entire frame in time provide an improvement in channel estimation to pilot symbols that are available only on a small portion of the downlink (e.g., dedicated pilots that are only for the mobile assigned data on a small subset of the downlink frame).
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of an arrangement 300 for BS quantization in accordance with a possible embodiment of the invention.
- the arrangement 300 illustrates the exchanging of messages between a BS 110 and a MS such as station 120 - 140 in wireless communication system 100 .
- the communication system may include a multi-antenna transmitter 360 and a multi-antenna receiver 370 that communicate via an OFDM MIMO air interface 365 , although the embodiments are not limited in this respect.
- the BS 110 and the MS 120 may include elements similar to existing communication devices such as coding/modulation or detection/demodulation logic, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)/Inverse FFT logic, and/or other components as suitably desired.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- the BS 110 through transmit antennas 360 sends a message to MS 120 requesting the mobile to sound.
- the MS 120 through a feedback apparatus 310 responds to the BS 110 with a sounding waveform.
- a feedback channel 315 transports the sounding waveform to BS 110 .
- the sounding waveform comprises pilot symbols that are potentially known a-priori to the BS (as in uplink channel sounding or ULCS).
- the sounding waveform may contain analog data derived from the estimates of the channel.
- the analog data may include raw coefficients of the channel (as in direct coefficient feedback or DCF), entries of a spatial covariance matrix (as in direct covariance feedback or DCOVF), coefficients of the singular vectors of the spatial covariance matrix etc.
- the sounding waveform is transmitted from the MS 120 to the BS 110 over the feedback channel 315 using one or more transmit antennas at the MS 120 and one or more receive antennas at the BS 110 .
- the received sounding waveform from one or more MSs is processed in codebook processor 320 and a set of precoding weights 325 is chosen from a codebook by the BS 110 .
- Codebook processor 320 is used to determine codebook weights on one or more groups of subcarriers. Codebook processor 320 may perform one or more of the following procedures on the received sounding waveform: quantization using a codebook, estimation of the uplink channel, conversion of the uplink channel estimates to downlink channel estimates, filtering in time and/or frequency of the sounding waveform or a transformation thereof.
- the codebook can be designed using several techniques known in the art, including techniques in D. J. Love, R. W. Heath, Jr., and T. Strohmer, “ Grassmannian Beamforming for Multiple - Input Multiple - Output Wireless Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Information Theory October 2003.
- the conversion of the uplink channel estimates to downlink channel estimates is a step that may be required in Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems in which the BS estimates an uplink channel response from UL sounding waveform transmitted by the MS.
- TDD Time Division Duplex
- the UL and DL multipath channel responses are assumed to be equivalent (an assumption of UL and DL reciprocity, which holds when the UL and DL are on the same frequency band (TDD)).
- Converting the estimated uplink channel response to an estimated downlink channel response may involve computing reciprocity calibration coefficients that are used to compensate for the non-reciprocal effects of the RF transceiver hardware at the BS.
- Codebook processor 320 can be programmed to compute parameters from the uplink waveform such as direction of arrival, an array response vector, a set of eigenbeamforming weights, and a set of array calibration coefficients.
- input stream 350 is modulated and coded by mod/code 355 and weighted by precoding weights 325 before being fed to the multiple transmit antennas 360 .
- Multiplying an input stream 350 by precoding weights 325 , where the transmit weights are based on at least a partial channel response, is one example of tailoring a spatial characteristic of the transmission. Methods for determining the transmit weights from the channel response are known in the art.
- the signals transmitted from the multiple transmit antennas 360 propagate through a MIMO air interface 365 and are received by multiple receive antennas 370 .
- the signals may include broadcast pilots, payload transmission that has preferably been beamformed, and control data.
- the signals received on the multiple receive antennas 370 are processed by receive channel estimation 340 using the codebook index received via a feedforward channel 330 to produce the output symbol stream 345 .
- the feedforward channel 330 may be transmitted over the air using one or more transmit antennas 360 and received using one or more receive antennas 370 .
- An alternative operation requires no feedback request from the BS 110 but instead the BS 110 utilizes normal uplink traffic from the MS 120 to determine the codebook index (i.e., precoding weights) to use for transmission.
- the BS operating in a TDD system may estimate an UL channel response from the normal uplink traffic and convert that estimated UL channel response to a downlink channel response estimate (for example by leveraging reciprocity calibration coefficients as discussed earlier), and the codebook index is then computed based upon the estimated channel response.
- the BS may compute the codebook index based on combinations of the signals received on the UL and the reciprocity calibration coefficients.
- the BS operating in either an FDD or TDD system may compute one or more direction of arrival (DOA) estimates for the multipath of the MS UL channel response.
- DOA direction of arrival
- the codebook index is computed based on one or more DOA estimates and potentially one or more reciprocity calibration coefficients.
- the codebook index is sent from the BS 110 via a feedforward channel 330 to the MS 120 .
- the base station computes one or more DOA estimates of the MS UL channel response and instead of finding a codebook index based on the DOA estimates and feeding forward the codebook index, the base feeds forward the DOA estimate itself.
- the mobile then can use the DOA estimates, channel estimates obtained from the broadcast pilots, and knowledge of how the base computes transmit weights from the DOA estimates to determine the composite downlink channel.
- the feedforward channel 330 may take various forms and the invention is not limited to one form.
- One example of a feedforward channel 330 is simply a bit stream that indicates a codebook index.
- Another example of a feedforward channel 330 would be analog feed forwarding of the codebook weights.
- Yet another example of a feedforward channel 330 could be the feed forwarding of other parameters (such as DOAs) that can be used by the mobile to determine its codebook weights.
- FIG. 5 is an illustration of process 500 performed at the BS 110 in accordance with a possible embodiment of the invention.
- the process begins with a send message 510 from the BS 110 requesting that the MS 120 sound or provide other feedback such as direct covariance feedback (DCOVF).
- the BS 110 sends a message 510 to MS 120 to sound.
- the BS 110 and the MS 120 to cooperate in the exchange of information through sounding. For example, the BS simply generates and transmits a message assigning an MS a time-frequency resource and a sounding waveform or through variations of the uplink channel sounding methodology.
- the Uplink channel sounding (ULCS) methodology of IEEE 802.16e may be modified to include instructions for the optional direct transmission of DL channel coefficients for a plurality of subcarriers or direct transmission of covariance matrix entries or direct transmission of singular vector entries as part of the sounding waveform.
- the modification consists of an additional field in the UL_Sounding_Command_IE( ), which is a message that the BS may configure and transmit to a BS for the purpose of indicating or instructing whether or not the channel coefficients are to be transmitted along with the sounding waveform in the sounding zone.
- the UL_Sounding_Command_IE( ) message is defined in Section 8.4.6.2.7 of IEEE 802.16e.
- the sounding waveform specified by the Sounding Command enables the BS to estimate the uplink (UL) channel, which the BS then uses to estimate the downlink (DL) channel coefficients being sent by the BS in the feedback portion of the sounding waveform. These estimated DL channel coefficients can then be used by the BS to perform closed-loop transmission.
- control passes to step 520 for further processing.
- the BS receives a reply from the MS in the form of an uplink waveform or a sounding waveform.
- the base station determines communication parameters based on the uplink waveform or the sounding waveform.
- the BS 110 uses the sounding waveform to estimate an uplink channel.
- the uplink channel is then converted to a downlink channel for estimating the codebook weights or other communication parameters such as DOAs.
- the BS 110 does not transmit a send message to the MS 120 requesting a sounding waveform. Instead, the BS 110 may use the normal uplink traffic to determine the communication parameters including the codebook weights, codebook weighting index, or other parameters such as DOAs. In either mode of operation, the BS 110 signals the codebook weights 570 or other communication parameters to the MS 120 using a feedforward mechanism.
- BS 120 sends broadcast pilots 560 and beamformed payload transmission 550 using the downlink channel to the MS.
- the beamformed payload transmission 550 may take various forms such as single stream beamforming where the codebook weight is a vector, multiple stream beamforming where the codebook weight is a codebook matrix where each column of the matrix corresponds to a different data stream, or multiple stream beamforming where two or more codebook weight vectors are used to create two or more beamformed data streams.
- Other forms of the beamformed payload transmission 550 are also possible such as using two (or more) codebook weight vectors (or two or more columns from a codebook matrix) to create two or more spatial streams that are coded (along with the data payload) using space-time or space-frequency block coding as is known in the art.
- the MS receives the codebook weights, the broadcast pilots, and the beamformed payload transmission.
- the MS has a feedback channel and a feedforward channel with potentially different modulation methods and/or bandwidths. It should be noted that feedforward and feedback channel need not be discrete channels but could be the downlink and the uplink of a communication system that uses the same modulation method (e.g., OFDM) with the same bandwidth.
- modulation method e.g., OFDM
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of process 600 for MS processing of codebook index and broadcast pilots received from a BS in accordance with a possible embodiment of the invention.
- Process 600 begins with the MS 120 receiving inputs from the BS 110 such as beamformed payload transmission 610 , codebook weights 620 or codebook index (or other communication parameters such as DOAs as described above), and broadcast pilots 630 . It should be noted that these inputs need not arrive in any particular order, time frame, or channels.
- the MS can run a multi-source channel estimator on the received pilot signals 630 to determine broadcast channel estimates.
- the broadcast channel estimates 640 and the codebook weights (index) 620 or other communication parameters are then used to determine composite channel estimates 650 .
- the composite channel estimates 650 may simply be the channel estimates that are weighted to the BS precoding weights as signaled by quantization values fed forward by BS 110 .
- the composite channel estimates 650 and the beamformed data 610 or beamformed payload transmission are used to detect the beamformed data 660 encapsulated in the transmission.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of process 700 at the MS for determining codebook index in accordance with a possible embodiment of the invention.
- Process 700 begins at step 710 with the receipt of broadcast pilots from the BS.
- the broadcast pilots are used to determine the channel estimates to each of the transmit antennas.
- the MS can run a multi-source channel estimator on the received broadcast pilot signals to determine channel estimates.
- the Beamformed payload 730 received from the BS is then used to determine the codebook index in step 740 . This blind determination of the codebook index can be accomplished by comparing the beamformed payload 730 to the composite channel for each of the possible codebook indices.
- the determination of the codebook index can be accomplished by comparing the decoded beamformed payload 730 for each composite channel for all possible codebook indices and choosing the codebook index as the one that properly decoded the data (e.g., by comparing cyclic redundancy codes or by choosing the one with the lowest MSE to the estimated symbols).
- An alternative form of blind detection at the MS can be done with DOA beamforming.
- the BS uses ULCS, DCOVF, or normal uplink traffic to determine the DOA of the MS.
- the BS uses this DOA to beamform the DL data (i.e., the beamformed payload 730 ) but does not feed forward the DOA to the MS.
- the MS can then use the broadcast pilots to determine its DOA (e.g., using an a technique known in the art such as MUSIC) and then the MS can use that DOA along with knowledge of how the BS computes it transmit weights to determine the composite channel which is then used to decode the beamformed payload 730 .
- An alternative method for determining the DOAs is to quantize the DOAs to a small number of possible DOAs (e.g., 16 DOAs) and then the MS can blindly search using the corresponding transmit weights for each DOA in a similar manner to the blind codebook search described above.
- Still another alternate embodiment which is applicable to high speed operation when closed-loop operation may not work well, is for the MS and the BS to both use a fixed codebook known to both ends.
- the MS does not sound the uplink, but the BS uses some indication of the MS speed (e.g., the MS feeds back a speed indication or the BS estimates the speed from other uplink traffic) to determine that high speed operation of the precoding should be done.
- the BS will then transmit the beamformed payload with this fixed codebook where the codebook can be a vector or matrix.
- the BS can indicate that high speed operation is occurring by indicating to the MS using a one bit flag in the downlink control or feedforward channel.
- the MS can assume the BS is in this high speed operation if the speed is above some threshold. In any event, the MS would use the known codebook weight vector or matrix along with the channel estimates derived from the broadcast pilots to determine the composite channel which can then be used to decode the beamformed payload.
