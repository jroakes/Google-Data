Definitions
- a core network operator typically provides telecommunication services to mobile stations throughout a network.
- a network is a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) that includes a core network and base stations.
- the base stations collectively form a Radio Access Network (RAN) connected to the network.
- RAN Radio Access Network
- a mobile station may establish a connection to the core network via a cell (e.g., a base station, a serving cell) of the PLMN.
- a cell e.g., a base station, a serving cell
- CA carrier aggregation
- the mobile station's capabilities message transmitted to the network during the ATTACH procedure has also considerably increased in size.
- the transmission of a capabilities message that includes the CA parameter combinations often takes longer to complete because of reduced network throughput. Due to guard times implemented by many network operators, a connection with the mobile station may be dropped during the ATTACH procedure when a complete capabilities message is not received from the mobile station inside of the guard time. Additionally, after multiple failed ATTACH procedures, the mobile station will block the PLMN from subsequent ATTACH procedures for a length of time. As such, mobile stations with poor network coverage are often unable to complete an ATTACH procedure with a PLMN or may be blocked from reattempting an ATTACH procedure for a length of time, during which network service of the mobile station may be impaired or denied.
- a user equipment performs a method that includes searching, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a predefined duration of time. The method then determines that the PLMN blocked from registration is blocked due to a signal-related condition of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN. The method also includes determining, during the predefined duration of time, that the signal-related condition of the connection between the UE and the cell of the PLMN has improved. In response to the improvement of the signal-related condition, the method unblocks the PLMN from registration. The method then transmits, to the cell of the PLMN, a request for registration with the PLMN that is unblocked to enable registration with the PLMN before expiration of the predefined duration of time.
- a user equipment performs a method that includes transmitting to a cell of a PLMN, a first request for registration with the PLMN. The method then detects a failure of the first request for registration with the PLMN during a stage of sending a UE capability message. The method includes determining that a signal-related characteristic for communicating with the cell of the PLMN fails to meet a threshold and identifying the PLMN registration failure as based on the signal-related characteristic. The method then determines, during the duration of time, whether the signal-related characteristic for communicating with the cell of the PLMN has remained the same, improved, or deteriorated. In response to the determination of the signal-related characteristic, the method uses fewer or more CA combination in UE capability message during the next request for registration with the PLMN. If signal conditions improve significantly, the UE may make another attempt for registration before expiration of the duration of time.
- a user equipment includes a transceiver operably coupled with one or more antennas, a hardware-based processor associated with the transceiver, and computer-readable storage media storing instructions that are executable by the hardware-based processor of the UE.
- the instructions can be executed to implement a PLMN manager, which is configured to direct the user equipment to search, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a predefined duration of time.
- the PLMN manager determines that the PLMN blocked from registration is blocked due to a signal-related condition of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN.
- the PLMN manager determines, via the transceiver and during the duration of time, that the signal-related condition of the connection between the UE and the cell of the PLMN has improved. In response to the improvement of the signal-related condition, the PLMN manager unblocks the PLMN from registration. The PLMN manager then transmits, via the transceiver and to the base station of the PLMN, a request for registration with the PLMN that is unblocked to enable registration with the PLMN before expiration of the predefined duration of time.

- a cellular network such as a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) through a communication link or “connection” with a base station or serving cell of the network.
- PLMN Public Land Mobile Network
- the user equipment (UE) may register with the PLMN, such as through an ATTACH procedure or Tracking Area Update (TAU).
- TAU Tracking Area Update
- the network will inquire regarding wireless communication capabilities of the UE.
- the UE may respond to the network with its wireless communication capabilities (e.g., UE capability message) to enable communication between the UE and the network.
- CA carrier aggregation
- UEs and PLMNs offer increased bandwidth through carrier aggregation (CA), which enables a UE to use multiple channels to communicate data with the network.
- CA carrier aggregation
- these UEs also communicate various combinations of CA parameters, such as carriers, bands, and bandwidths, to the network as part of their UE capabilities message.
- a connection e.g., radio resource control (RRC) connection
- RRC radio resource control
- a UE may only make five registration attempts before the PLMN is blocked by being added to a temporary forbidden PLMN list for duration of time (e.g., 12 minutes per a T3402 timer). As such, the UE may block a preferred PLMN due to previously poor network conditions, which may cause a denial of service or impair service for a substantial duration of time. In some cases, the PLMN remains blocked through the duration of time (e.g., 12 minutes) despite the UE moving back to good network coverage or network conditions improving, which may further frustrate a user of the UE.
- duration of time e.g. 12 minutes
- aspects of adaptive PLMN management may adaptively unblock a PLMN when signaling conditions of a UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with better network coverage.
- the UE may register with a PLMN more quickly than permitted by conventional techniques that lack any provision for unblocking.
- the UE may register with the PLMN after moving out of a poor signaling area (e.g., poor network conditions) without waiting for an entire duration of time as specified by various communication specifications for PLMNs on a forbidden list (e.g., 12 minutes).
- a UE receives coverage from only one cell of a PLMN and that cell may support only Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service without support for legacy access technologies.
- LTE Long-Term Evolution
- the UE would typically block the PLMN and prevent the UE from receiving any voice or circuit-switched services (e.g., legacy services) on the LTE service for substantial length of time (e.g., 12 minutes).
- the UE may attempt registration more quickly (e.g., less than the full 12 minutes) once network conditions of the UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with moderate or good network coverage.
- the UE may be able to attempt registration based on expiration of a periodic better system reselection (BSR) timer (e.g., 90-120 seconds).
- BSR system reselection
- aspects of adaptive PLMN management may enable registration with a PLMN more quickly, such as when signaling conditions improve.
- a UE capability manager may modify UE capability information to increase a probability of successful registration in marginal network conditions (e.g., weak signal areas) and without affecting UE capabilities in good signal conditions.
- marginal network conditions e.g., weak signal areas
- a UE may receive coverage from only one cell of a PLMN and that cell may support only Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service without support for legacy access technologies.
- LTE Long-Term Evolution
- the UE may be prevented from receiving any voice or circuit-switched services on the LTE service for a substantial length of time in response to multiple failed registration attempts.
- the UE may instead be able to register with a reduced or minimal set of UE capabilities, which enable the UE to receive voice and data services through the LTE service. Additionally, by acquiring the LTE service (or other third generation (3G) service), the UE is precluded from scanning for legacy services (e.g., second generation (2G) service) for fallback services, enabling the UE to conserve time and power.
- legacy services e.g., second generation (2G) service
- a PLMN manager of a user equipment searches, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a duration of time and determines that the PLMN is blocked from registration due to a signal-related condition (e.g., poor signal coverage or poor signal area) of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN.
- the PLMN manager determines, during the duration of time, that the signal-related condition between the UE and the cell of the PLMN has improved.
- the PLMN manager unblocks the PLMN.
- the UE may reattempt registration with the unblocked PLMN at least once before the duration of time expires, which may allow the UE to register more quickly and reestablish network services.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment 100 in which various aspects of adaptive Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) management for varying network conditions can be implemented.

Abstract
The present disclosure describes apparatuses and techniques of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. In some aspects, a PLMN manager of a user equipment (UE) searches, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a duration of time and determines that the PLMN is blocked due to a signal-related condition with a cell of the PLMN (e.g., weak signal). The PLMN manager then determines, during the duration of time, that the signal-related condition between the UE and the cell has improved. In response to the improvement, the PLMN manager unblocks the PLMN before expiration of the duration of time. By so doing, the UE may reattempt registration with the unblocked PLMN at least once before the duration of time expires, which may allow the UE to register more quickly and reestablish network services.
Description
- The proliferation of wireless communication technology has greatly increased the number of devices that are able to access remote data or other services through wireless networks. For wide-area networks, such as cellular networks, a core network operator typically provides telecommunication services to mobile stations throughout a network. One example of a network is a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) that includes a core network and base stations. The base stations collectively form a Radio Access Network (RAN) connected to the network. To communicate wirelessly with the network, a mobile station may establish a connection to the core network via a cell (e.g., a base station, a serving cell) of the PLMN.
- During an ATTACH procedure to establish this connection, the network will inquire regarding wireless communication capabilities supported by the mobile station. For successful attachment with the PLMN, the mobile station needs to respond to the network with its capabilities that include supported frequency bands and other parameters of wireless communication. For increased data rates, some mobile stations and networks implement carrier aggregation (CA), which allows a mobile station to use multiple channels to communicate data with the network. To enable carrier aggregation, the mobile station also communicates various combinations of CA parameters, such as carriers, bands, and bandwidths, to the network as part of its capabilities for wireless communication.
- As networks deploy more CA-capable cells with multiple bands, however, the number and size of CA parameter combinations supported by many mobile stations have grown substantially. With this increase in the number and size of CA parameter combinations, the mobile station's capabilities message transmitted to the network during the ATTACH procedure has also considerably increased in size. In cases of poor network coverage or weak signal strength, the transmission of a capabilities message that includes the CA parameter combinations often takes longer to complete because of reduced network throughput. Due to guard times implemented by many network operators, a connection with the mobile station may be dropped during the ATTACH procedure when a complete capabilities message is not received from the mobile station inside of the guard time. Additionally, after multiple failed ATTACH procedures, the mobile station will block the PLMN from subsequent ATTACH procedures for a length of time. As such, mobile stations with poor network coverage are often unable to complete an ATTACH procedure with a PLMN or may be blocked from reattempting an ATTACH procedure for a length of time, during which network service of the mobile station may be impaired or denied.
- This disclosure describes apparatuses and techniques of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. In some aspects, a user equipment performs a method that includes searching, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a predefined duration of time. The method then determines that the PLMN blocked from registration is blocked due to a signal-related condition of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN. The method also includes determining, during the predefined duration of time, that the signal-related condition of the connection between the UE and the cell of the PLMN has improved. In response to the improvement of the signal-related condition, the method unblocks the PLMN from registration. The method then transmits, to the cell of the PLMN, a request for registration with the PLMN that is unblocked to enable registration with the PLMN before expiration of the predefined duration of time.
- In other aspects, a user equipment performs a method that includes transmitting to a cell of a PLMN, a first request for registration with the PLMN. The method then detects a failure of the first request for registration with the PLMN during a stage of sending a UE capability message. The method includes determining that a signal-related characteristic for communicating with the cell of the PLMN fails to meet a threshold and identifying the PLMN registration failure as based on the signal-related characteristic. The method then determines, during the duration of time, whether the signal-related characteristic for communicating with the cell of the PLMN has remained the same, improved, or deteriorated. In response to the determination of the signal-related characteristic, the method uses fewer or more CA combination in UE capability message during the next request for registration with the PLMN. If signal conditions improve significantly, the UE may make another attempt for registration before expiration of the duration of time.
- In yet other aspects, a user equipment includes a transceiver operably coupled with one or more antennas, a hardware-based processor associated with the transceiver, and computer-readable storage media storing instructions that are executable by the hardware-based processor of the UE. The instructions can be executed to implement a PLMN manager, which is configured to direct the user equipment to search, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a predefined duration of time. The PLMN manager determines that the PLMN blocked from registration is blocked due to a signal-related condition of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN. The PLMN manager then determines, via the transceiver and during the duration of time, that the signal-related condition of the connection between the UE and the cell of the PLMN has improved. In response to the improvement of the signal-related condition, the PLMN manager unblocks the PLMN from registration. The PLMN manager then transmits, via the transceiver and to the base station of the PLMN, a request for registration with the PLMN that is unblocked to enable registration with the PLMN before expiration of the predefined duration of time.

FIG. 14 illustrates an example configuration of a wireless communication processor that may implement various aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. - User equipment accesses a cellular network, such as a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) through a communication link or “connection” with a base station or serving cell of the network. As part of establishing or maintaining the connection, the user equipment (UE) may register with the PLMN, such as through an ATTACH procedure or Tracking Area Update (TAU). When a UE attempts registration with the PLMN (network), the network will inquire regarding wireless communication capabilities of the UE. For successful registration, the UE may respond to the network with its wireless communication capabilities (e.g., UE capability message) to enable communication between the UE and the network. Some UEs and PLMNs offer increased bandwidth through carrier aggregation (CA), which enables a UE to use multiple channels to communicate data with the network. To enable carrier aggregation with a network, these UEs also communicate various combinations of CA parameters, such as carriers, bands, and bandwidths, to the network as part of their UE capabilities message.
- As networks deploy more CA-capable cells with multiple bands, however, the number and size of CA parameter combinations supported by many of the UEs have grown substantially. With this increase in quantity and size of CA parameter combinations, the UE's capability message transmitted during registration with the PLMN has also increased in size considerably. In cases of poor network coverage or weak signal strength, transmission of a UE capability message that includes the CA parameter combinations often takes longer to complete due to reduced network throughput. Due to guard times implemented by many network operators, a connection (e.g., radio resource control (RRC) connection) with the UE may be released by the network during registration if a complete UE capability message is not received inside of the guard time. After registration fails or the connection is released, the UE is forced to reattempt registration through another ATTACH procedure. Per conventional techniques of PLMN selection, a UE may only make five registration attempts before the PLMN is blocked by being added to a temporary forbidden PLMN list for duration of time (e.g., 12 minutes per a T3402 timer). As such, the UE may block a preferred PLMN due to previously poor network conditions, which may cause a denial of service or impair service for a substantial duration of time. In some cases, the PLMN remains blocked through the duration of time (e.g., 12 minutes) despite the UE moving back to good network coverage or network conditions improving, which may further frustrate a user of the UE.
- This disclosure describes apparatuses and techniques of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. As described, aspects of adaptive PLMN management may adaptively unblock a PLMN when signaling conditions of a UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with better network coverage. Generally, as a result of adaptive PLMN unblocking, the UE may register with a PLMN more quickly than permitted by conventional techniques that lack any provision for unblocking. In some cases, the UE may register with the PLMN after moving out of a poor signaling area (e.g., poor network conditions) without waiting for an entire duration of time as specified by various communication specifications for PLMNs on a forbidden list (e.g., 12 minutes).
- By way of example, in some scenarios, a UE receives coverage from only one cell of a PLMN and that cell may support only Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service without support for legacy access technologies. When poor network conditions (e.g., poor signaling) cause the UE to block the PLMN, the UE would typically block the PLMN and prevent the UE from receiving any voice or circuit-switched services (e.g., legacy services) on the LTE service for substantial length of time (e.g., 12 minutes). By implementing aspects of adaptive PLMN management, the UE may attempt registration more quickly (e.g., less than the full 12 minutes) once network conditions of the UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with moderate or good network coverage. Generally, for a global UE with legacy support, the UE may be able to attempt registration based on expiration of a periodic better system reselection (BSR) timer (e.g., 90-120 seconds). As such, aspects of adaptive PLMN management may enable registration with a PLMN more quickly, such as when signaling conditions improve.
- This disclosure also describes apparatuses and techniques of adaptive UE capability management for marginal network conditions. In some aspects, a UE capability manager may modify UE capability information to increase a probability of successful registration in marginal network conditions (e.g., weak signal areas) and without affecting UE capabilities in good signal conditions. As noted, in some scenarios a UE may receive coverage from only one cell of a PLMN and that cell may support only Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service without support for legacy access technologies. In these scenarios, the UE may be prevented from receiving any voice or circuit-switched services on the LTE service for a substantial length of time in response to multiple failed registration attempts. By implementing aspects of adaptive UE capability management, the UE may instead be able to register with a reduced or minimal set of UE capabilities, which enable the UE to receive voice and data services through the LTE service. Additionally, by acquiring the LTE service (or other third generation (3G) service), the UE is precluded from scanning for legacy services (e.g., second generation (2G) service) for fallback services, enabling the UE to conserve time and power.
- In various aspects, a PLMN manager of a user equipment searches, as part of a registration procedure, a data repository of PLMN information that includes a PLMN blocked from registration for a duration of time and determines that the PLMN is blocked from registration due to a signal-related condition (e.g., poor signal coverage or poor signal area) of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN. The PLMN manager then determines, during the duration of time, that the signal-related condition between the UE and the cell of the PLMN has improved. In response to the improvement, the PLMN manager unblocks the PLMN. By so doing, the UE may reattempt registration with the unblocked PLMN at least once before the duration of time expires, which may allow the UE to register more quickly and reestablish network services.
- While any number of different environments, systems, devices, and/or various configurations can implement features and concepts of the described techniques and apparatuses for adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions, aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions are described in the context of the following example environment, devices, configuration, systems, and methods.

base stations 108 through 112 (e.g., serving cells) collectively form respective Radio Access Networks (RANs) for thePLMN 104 and thePLMN 106. The RANs are illustrated inFIG. 1 as an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network 120 (E-UTRAN 120) and a New Radio RAN 122 (NR RAN 122).

UE 102 includes one ormore antennas 214, a radio frequency front end 216 (RF front end 216), and at least onetransceiver 218 for communicating withbase stations 108 through 114 of thePLMNs UE 102 may be implemented in whole or part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of theUE 102. - The transceiver(s) 218 may include one or more of an LTE transceiver, a 5G NR transceiver, other types of transceivers are configured to operate on a wide area network or cellular network, and/or another transceiver(s). The RF
front end 216 of theUE 102 can couple or connect the transceiver(s) 218 to theantennas 214 to facilitate various types of wireless communication, such as acquiring and maintaining a connection with one of thebase stations 108 through 114 of thePLMN 104 orPLMN 106. For example, thePLMN manager 144 of theUE 102 may utilize a connectivity scan to search for network cells (e.g., base stations) of thePLMN 104 and/thePLMN 106 that are available for acquisition. Theantennas 214 of theUE 102 may include an array of multiple antennas that are configured similarly or differently from each other. Theantennas 214 and the RFfront end 216 can be tuned to, and/or be tunable to, one or more frequency bands defined by wireless communication standards and implemented by the transceiver(s) 218 of theUE 102. - The
UE 102 may also include one ormore sensors 220, which enable theUE 102 to sense various properties, variances, stimuli, or characteristics of an environment in whichUE 102 operates. For example, thesensors 220 may include various motion sensors, radar sensors, ambient light sensors, acoustic sensors, capacitive sensors, infrared sensors, temperature sensors, or magnetic sensors. Alternatively or additionally, thesensors 220 may enable interaction with, or receive input from, a user ofUE 102, such as through touch sensing or proximity sensing. In some aspects, theUE 102 orPLMN manager 144 can monitor asensor 220, such as to receive input or feedback via one of thesensors 220. Data provided by thesensors 220 is accessible to other entities of theUE 102, such as thePLMN manager 144. Although not shown, thesensors 220 may also include a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, gyros, accelerometers, magnetometers, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), internal/external device temperature sensors, resistive touch sensors, or input sensing-logic associated with hardware switches (e.g., keyboards, snap-domes, or dial-pads), and so on. - In some aspects, the
PLMN manager 144 orUE capability manager 146 can determine a motion state of theUE 102, such as a stationary state of no movement or a mobility state in which the UE is moving. For example, an accelerometer or gyroscope can sense movement or orientation of theUE 102 in any suitable aspect, such as in one-dimension, two-dimensions, three-dimensions, multi-axis, combined multi-axis, and the like. Alternatively or additionally, a positional sensor, such as a GNSS, may indicate a distance traveled, rate of travel, or an absolute or relative position of theUE 102. Capacitive or proximity sensors may indicate that a position of theUE 102 is static or changing with respect to a user (e.g., holding or reorienting the UE). Further, other environmental sensors may indicate an internal or external temperature of theUE 102, as well as humidity. As such, thePLMN manager 144 or theUE capability manager 146 may access data from thesensors 220 and alter, based on the sensor data (e.g., motion, orientation, temperature, proximity), UE capability information or PLMN status (e.g., blocked or forbidden to unblocked) of theUE 102 in accordance with one or more aspects of adaptive connection management. - The
UE 102 also includes processor(s) 222 and computer-readable storage media 224 (CRM 224). The processor(s) 222 may be a single core processor or a multiple core processor composed of a variety of materials, such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectric, copper, and so on. The computer-readable storage media 224 is configured as storage, and thus does not include transitory signals or carrier waves. TheCRM 224 may include any suitable memory or storage device such as random-access memory (RAM), static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile RAM (NV-RAM), read-only memory (ROM), or Flash memory usable to storedevice data 226 of theUE 102. - The
UE data 226 may include user data, multimedia data, beamforming codebooks,applications 228, user interface(s) 230, and/or an operating system of theUE 102, which are executable by processor(s) 222 to enable user-plane communication, control-plane signaling, and user interaction with theUE 102. The user interface 230 can be configured to receive inputs from a user of theUE 102, such as to receive input from a user that may define and/or facilitate one or more aspects of adaptive PLMN management. The user interface 230 can include a graphical user interface (GUI) that receives the input information via a touch input. In other instances, the user interface 230 includes an intelligent assistant that receives the input information via an audible input or speech. Alternatively or additionally, the operating system of theUE 102 may be maintained as firmware or an application on theCRM 224 and executed by the processor(s) 222. - The
CRM 224 also includes aPLMN manager 144,PLMN information 232, aUE capability manager 146, andUE capability information 234. In some cases, theUE 102 or thePLMN manager 144 accesses thePLMN information 232 to search for PLMNs (e.g., known or preferred PLMNs) or to obtain information for a PLMN. ThePLMN information 232 may be implemented as one or more data repositories, lists, or databases of information for various PLMNs, such asPLMN 104 andPLMN 106. ThePLMN information 232 may include an acquisition database of identifiers of previously acquired cells or PLMNs. ThePLMN information 232 may also include a temporary forbidden PLMN list of one or more PLMNs blocked from registration. Generally, PLMNs with which registration fails a predefined number to times (e.g., five failed registration attempts) are placed on the temporary forbidden PLMN list. A PLMN may remain on the temporary forbidden PLMN list until a timer (e.g., a T3402 timer) expires. In some cases, the timer is set for a predefined duration of time (e.g., 12 minutes) or configured based on a time parameter provided by a wireless network operator. - The
UE capability information 234 may include parameters or other information regarding wireless communication capabilities of theUE 102, such as supported profiles, carriers, bands, layer configurations, radio access technologies (RATs), or the like. In some aspects, theUE capability information 234 also includes carrier aggregation (CA) information that describes CA band combinations supported by theUE 102. Generally, the CA band combinations include a configuration name (e.g., CA_1C (B1+B1)), a CA type (e.g., intra-band or inter-band), a number of carrier components, frequency bands (e.g., LTE bands), a maximum aggregated bandwidth, or the like. In various aspects, theUE capability manager 146 may modify or reduce a number of CA band combinations of a UE capability message effective to reduce a size or length of the UE capability message. By so doing, theUE capability manager 146 may increase the probability of successful registration with a PLMN over a low throughput connection with a base station or cell of the PLMN, such as in poor signaling conditions or poor cell coverage. - In some aspects, the
PLMN manager 144 or theUE capability manager 146 can be implemented with machine learning or a machine-learned model that is trained to receive input data of one or more types (e.g., network- or signal-related characteristics) and, in response, provide output data of one or more types (e.g., modified UE capability information messages, signal-related thresholds, or timers). For example, any of the thresholds used or determined by thePLMN manager 144 and/or CA band combination reductions of theUE capability manager 146 can be derived from machine learning algorithms with data collected by theUE 102 while in the field or environment of use. - In some implementations, the input data can include one or more features that are associated with an instance of a
UE 102, such as a current external temperature, internal temperature (e.g., of the UE), humidity, UE orientation, UE mobility state, active antenna(s), blocked antenna(s), signal-related parameters, a number of failed registration attempts, sizes of previously successful UE capability messages with reduced CA combinations, or the like. In some implementations, the one or more features associated with the instance or example can be organized into a feature vector. In some implementations, the output data can include one or more predictions or inferences. Thus, given features associated with a particular instance of theUE 102 orPLMN manager 144, a machine-learned model can output a prediction or adjustment for such instance based on the features, which may include adaptive signal-related thresholds (e.g., for signaling conditions), adaptive CA band combination reduction for UE capability messages, adaptive parameters for PLMN unblocking, or the like. - By way of example, the machine-learned model can be or include one or more of various different types of machine-learned models. In particular, in some implementations, the machine-learned model can perform classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, recommendation generation, and/or other tasks. In some implementations, the machine-learned model can provide output data in the form of one or more recommendations, adjustments, or alterations. In some cases, the machine-learned model is included in or embodied in the
PLMN manager 144 or theUE capability manager 146 of aUE 102. - As an example, given input data that describes previous outcomes for certain entities (e.g., a score, ranking, signal strength, or rating indicative network connection quality), the machine-learned model can output a suggestion or recommendation of one or more additional entities or parameters that, based on the previous outcomes, are expected to have a desired outcome, such as quicker network registration when moving to a good signal area or successful registration with a PLMN in a poor signal area using modified UE capability messages. As one example, given previously successful registration with modified UE capability messages (e.g., how many CA combinations were previously removed for successful registration), a UE capability manager can output a suggestion or recommendation for how many or which CA combinations to remove from a UE capability message to reduce a size of the message such that registration with the PLMN is likely to succeed in a poor signal area.
- Aspects and functionalities of the
UE 102 may be operated via operating system controls presented through at least one application programming interface 236 (API 236). In some aspects, thePLMN manager 144, theUE capability manager 146, or an application of theUE 102 accesses an API 236 (or an API service) of theUE 102 to control aspects and functionalities of the user equipment ortransceivers 218. For example, thePLMN manager 144 can access low-level network enable/connection settings of theUE 102 to implement aspects of adaptive PLMN management, such as to identify (e.g., flag) a blocked PLMN as being blocked due to signal-related conditions (e.g., low received signal strength), verify or recheck the signal-related condition, or unblock the PLMN. TheCRM 224 of theUE 102 may also include a user equipment manager (not shown), which can be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of theUE 102. In at least some aspects, the user equipment manager configures the RFfront end 216 and/or the transceiver(s) 218 to implement the techniques for adaptive PLMN management as described herein. - The
UE 102 also includes adisplay 238 for displaying and/or providing information to a user. For example, through thedisplay 238, theUE 102 may provide the user with information regarding available network cells, a connection status of the UE 102 (e.g., performing an ATTACH or TAU procedure), enable user-initiated cell reselection, an indication of a blocked PLMN timer, an indication that network capabilities are reduced yet functional, or the like. Based on such information, a user may choose, through the user interface 230, to initiate a registration procedure, attempt to resend a UE capability message with increased CA band combinations, or adjust thresholds and/or offsets by which a connection is determined as poor (e.g., received signal power less than −117 to −120 dBm) or good (e.g., received signal power equal to or greater than −110 dBm). -
FIG. 3 illustrates a device diagram 300 of anexample base station 302, which may represent or correspond to one of thebase stations 108 through 114 as described with reference toFIG. 1 . Thebase station 302 of the example device diagram 300 may include additional functions, components, and/or interfaces that are omitted fromFIG. 3 for the sake of clarity or visual brevity. In the device diagram 300, thebase station 302 is generally illustrated as a single network node (e.g., a gNode B or serving cell). The functionality of thebase station 302 and/orbase stations 108 through 114 may be distributed across multiple network nodes or devices and may be distributed in any fashion suitable to perform the functions described herein. - The
base station 302 includesantennas 304, a radio frequency front end 306 (RF front end 306), and one ormore transceivers 308 for communicating with or providing connections for theUE 102. The RF front end 306 of thebase station 302 can couple or connect the transceiver(s) 308 to theantennas 304 to facilitate various types of wireless communication. Theantennas 304 of thebase station 302 may include an array of multiple antennas that are configured similar to or differently from each other. Theantennas 304 and the RF front end 306 can be tuned to, and/or be tunable to, one or more frequency band defined by communication standards and implemented by the transceiver(s) 308. - The
base station 302 also includes processor(s) 310 and computer-readable storage media 312 (CRM 312). The processor(s) 310 may be a single core processor or a multiple core processor composed of a variety of materials, such as silicon, poly silicon, high-K dielectric, copper, and so on. TheCRM 312 may include any suitable memory or storage device such as RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NV-RAM, ROM, or Flash memory usable to store base station data 314 of thebase station 302. The base station data 314 may include network scheduling data, radio resource management data, beamforming codebooks, applications, and/or an operating system of thebase station 302, which are executable by processor(s) 310 to enable communication with theUE 102. - The
CRM 312 also includes network connection parameters 316 and abase station manager 318. In some aspects, the network connection parameters 316 are predefined or configured by a wireless network provider to specify or indicate one or more parameters or thresholds useful by user equipment to register (e.g., ATTACH or TAU) with a network cell or base station of a wireless network. For example, the network connection parameters may specify, for one or more network cells (e.g., base stations), available frequency bands, timer settings, frequency band priority, minimum signal strength for network cell connection, minimum bit- or packet-error rates for maintaining a connection, or the like. As described herein, theUE 102 may receive network connection parameters 316 from thebase station 302 or alter the network connection parameters 316 in accordance with one or more aspects. Alternatively or additionally, theUE 102 may be preconfigured with network connection parameters 316 or receive the network connection parameters 316 via a different data interface, such as a WLAN or a wireless personal area network (WPAN). - In some aspects, the
base station manager 318 configures thetransceivers 308 for communication with theUE 102 or for communication with a core network. Thebase station 302 includes aninter-base station interface 320, such as an Xn and/or X2 interface, which thebase station manager 318 configures to exchange user-plane and control-plane data between another base station (e.g.,base station base station 302 with theUE 102. Thebase station 302 also includes acore network interface 322 that thebase station manager 318 can configure to exchange user-plane and control-plane data withcore network core network interface 322 may include interfaces such as the NG2 interface, NG3 interface, and/or S1 interface as described herein with reference toFIG. 1 . Alternatively or additionally, the components of thebase station 302, such as thebase station manager 318, may be implemented in whole or part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of thebase station 302. -
FIG. 4 illustrates a diagram of an examplenetwork protocol stack 400 stack through which a UE may communicate with entities of a PLMN in accordance with one or more aspects. Generally, the network protocol stack 400 (stack 400) characterizes a communication system of theexample environment 100, in which theUE 102 communicates with entities, such as cells or core networks, of thePLMNs - In this example, the
network protocol stack 400 includes a user plane 402 and acontrol plane 404. Upper layers of the user plane 402 and thecontrol plane 404 share common lower layers in thenetwork protocol stack 400. Wireless devices, such as theUE 102 or thebase stations 108 through 114, implement each layer as an entity for communication with another device using respective protocols defined for the layer. For example, aUE 102 uses an RRC entity to communicate to a peer RRC entity in abase station 108 using an appropriate RRC protocol or RRC connection. - The shared lower layers include a physical layer 406 (PHY layer 406), a media access control layer 408 (MAC layer 408), a radio link control layer 410 (RLC layer 410), and a packet data convergence protocol layer 412 (PDCP layer 412). Generally, the
physical layer 406 provides hardware specifications for devices that communicate with each other and theMAC layer 408 specifies how data is transferred between devices. TheRLC layer 410 may provide data transfer services to higher layers in thenetwork protocol stack 400 and thePDCP layer 412 provides data transfer services to higher layers in thenetwork protocol stack 400. - Above the
PDCP layer 412, thenetwork protocol stack 400 of the wireless network splits into the user plane 402 and thecontrol plane 404. Layers of the user plane 402 include an Internet Protocol layer 414 (IP layer 414), atransport layer 416, and anapplication layer 418, which transfers data using thewireless connection IP layer 414 specifies how the data from theapplication layer 418 is transferred to a destination node. Thetransport layer 416 may verify that data packets intended to be transferred to the destination node reached the destination node, using either transmission control protocol (TCP) or user datagram protocol (UDP) for data transfers by theapplication layer 418. In some implementations, the user plane 402 may also include a data services layer (not shown) that provides data transport services to transport application data, such as IP packets including web browsing content, video content, image content, audio content, or social media content, and so forth. - The
control plane 404 includes a radio resource control layer 420 (RRC layer 420) and a non-access stratum layer 422 (NAS layer 422). TheRRC layer 420 establishes and releases radio connections and radio bearers, broadcasts system information, or performs power control. For example, during registration with one ofPLMN 104 orPLMN 106, theUE 102 may request an RRC connection by sending an RRC Connection Request message to one ofbase stations 108 through 114 (e.g., an eNB or cell) with an establishment cause field (e.g., “mobile originating signaling” value) to request an ATTACH, a DETACH, or perform a TAU. TheUE 102 may then use the RRC connection to initiate registration with thePLMN 104 or thePLMN 106, such as by transmitting an ATTACH request message or TAU message to a network core via theNAS layer 422. As noted, poor cell coverage or weak signal for the connection may result in failure of a registration attempt, which may be detected as a release of the RRC connection by the network or a registration failure due to lower layer causes (e.g., radio link failure) or the like. - The
NAS layer 422 provides support for mobility management and packet data bearer contexts between theUE 102 and entities or functions in the core network, such as theMME 140 of theEPC 124 or theAMF 142 of the5GC 126. In theUE 102, each layer in both the user plane 402 and thecontrol plane 404 of thenetwork protocol stack 400 interacts with a corresponding peer layer or entity in a cell, a core network entity or function, and/or a remote service, to support user applications and control operation of theUE 102 in theRAN 120 orRAN 122. -
FIG. 5 illustrates a diagram of example registration states 500 between which a UE may transition during a network ATTACH procedure or TAU procedure. As described with reference toFIG. 4 , to communicate with a wireless network, theuser equipment 102 utilizes an RRC procedure to establish a radio connection to the network via a cell (e.g., a base station, a serving cell). Upon establishing the radio connection to the network via one of thebase stations 108 through 114, theUE 102 enters a connected mode (RRC connection) in which the radio connection with the base station is active. While connected to the network through the active RRC connection, the UE can initiate a registration procedure to register with the network, such as one of thePLMN 104 or thePLMN 106. For the sake of clarity or visual brevity, the example registration states 500 do not include all possible UE states or transitions, thus theUE 102 may transition to or from other states (or sub-states) that are not shown inFIG. 5 . - Generally, the
UE 102 may enter or maintain a registeredstate 502 through a registration procedure, such as an initial ATTACH procedure or TAU procedure. As shown inFIG. 5 , aUE 102 in a deregisteredstate 504 may request an ATTACH at 506 and enter a registration initiatedstate 508. From the registration initiatedstate 508, theUE 102 may complete registration with the network if the ATTACH request is accepted by the network at 510 (e.g., registration successful), in response to which theUE 102 enters the registeredstate 502. Alternatively, an ATTACH failure at 512 may return theUE 102 to the deregisteredstate 504. The ATTACH failure may occur during or after transmission of a UE capability message to the network (e.g., as part of the ATTACH request) during the ATTACH procedure. In some aspects, thePLMN manager 144 orUE capability manager 146 determines that the ATTACHfailure 512 is associated with or caused by low throughput or a signal-related condition (e.g., weak signaling or poor network/cell coverage). For example, theUE capability manager 146 may determine that an amount of time between transmission of a UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., three seconds). Alternatively or additionally, thePLMN manager 144 orUE capability manager 146 can compare a signal-related characteristic (e.g., reference signal receive power (RSRP) or reference signal receive quality (RSRQ)) to a threshold (e.g., −120 dBm) to determine if the ATTACH failure is due to a signal-related condition (poor signal strength). - For a TAU, a
UE 102 in the registeredstate 502 may request a TAU at 514 and enter a TAU initiatedstate 516. From the TAU initiatedstate 516, theUE 102 may complete registration with the network if the TAU request is accepted by the network at 518, in response to whichUE 102 enters or returns at the registeredstate 502. Alternatively, a TAU failure at 520 causes theUE 102 to enter the deregisteredstate 504. In some aspects, thePLMN manager 144 orUE capability manager 146 determines that theTAU failure 520 is associated with or caused by low throughput or a poor signaling condition. For example, the UE capability manager may determine that an amount of time between transmission of a UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., two to four seconds). Alternatively or additionally, thePLMN manager 144 orUE capability manager 146 can compare a signal-related characteristic (e.g., RSRP or RSRQ) to a threshold (e.g., −117 dBm) to determine if the TAU failure is due to a signal-related condition (e.g., poor signaling). -
Example method 600 andexample methods 800 through 1100 are described with reference toFIG. 6 throughFIG. 11B in accordance with one or more aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. Generally,method 600 andmethods 800 through 1100 illustrate sets of operations (or acts) performed in, but not necessarily limited to, the order or combinations in which the operations are shown herein. Further, any of one or more of the operations may be repeated, combined, reorganized, omitted, or linked to provide a wide array of additional and/or alternative methods. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to examplewireless network environment 100 ofFIG. 1 , example devices ofFIGS. 2 and 3 , example systems ofFIGS. 12 through 14 , and/or entities detailed inFIG. 1 , reference to which is made for example only. The techniques and apparatuses described in this disclosure are not limited to embodiment or performance by one entity or multiple entities operating on one device. -
FIG. 6 illustrates anexample method 600 for PLMN registration in accordance with one or more aspects. Generally, themethod 600 may implement adaptive UE capability management or adaptive PLMN management to enable registration with a PLMN in varying (e.g., improving) or marginal (e.g., poor signaling) network conditions. In some aspects, operations of themethod 600 are implemented by or with aPLMN manager 144,UE capability manager 146,PLMN information 232, and/orUE capability information 234 of theuser equipment 102. - At 602, a UE initiates registration with a public land mobile network (PLMN). The registration with the PLMN may include an ATTACH request or tracking area update (TAU) request. In some cases, the ATTACH request or TAU request includes a UE capability message of bands, radio access technologies (RATs), and/or carrier aggregation (CA) band combinations supported by the UE. Alternatively or additionally, the registration may include establishing an RRC connection with a cell or base station of the PLMN.
- By way of example, consider
FIG. 7 , which illustrates an example message sequence diagram for PLMN registration in accordance in one or more aspects. Here, assume that theUE 102 is attempting to register with thebase station 110 of thePLMN 104 to access network services. In order to register, theUE 102 sends an RRCconnection request message 702 to the base station 110 (eNB or cell) of thePLMN 104. TheUE 102 then receives an RRCconnection setup message 704 from thebase station 110 that includes radio resource configuration information (not shown). With the radio resource configuration information provided by thebase station 110, the UE establishes theRRC connection 706 and may send an RRC connection complete message 708 (e.g., if sent separate from an ATTACH request or TAU request). - With reference to
FIG. 7 , theUE 102 then sends a request for registration, such as an ATTACH request message or TAU request message at 710 using theactive RRC connection 706. The ATTACH request message or the TAU request message sent to the base station also includes aUE_Capabilitylnformation message 712 that describes the bands, radio access technologies (RATs), and/or carrier aggregation band combinations supported by the UE. As noted, theUE_Capabilitylnformation message 712 may be of considerable size due to a number of carrier aggregation band combinations supported by theUE 102. - Returning to
FIG. 6 , the UE detects a failure of the registration with the PLMN at 604, which may include failure of an ATTACH request or failure of a TAU request. The registration failure may include a release of the RRC connection, radio link failure, or failure due to a lower layer cause. In some cases, the UE may determine that an amount of time between transmission of a UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., three seconds). This may indicate that the UE was unable to successfully transmit the entire UE capability message to the network within a guard time. In the context of the present example, the ATTACH request or TAU request failure is detected at 714 when anRRC release message 716 is received from thebase station 110 and the RRC connection is released at 718 by theUE 102. - At 606, the UE determines that the registration failure is due to a signal-related condition of a connection with a cell of the PLMN. The UE may measure or monitor a signal-related characteristic of the connection with the cell of the PLMN. In some cases, the UE compares the signal-related characteristic to a threshold (e.g., −110 dBm, −115 dBm, or −120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., poor signaling) or network conditions (e.g., poor or marginal conditions) associated with the cell of the PLMN. The signal-related characteristic may include one or more of a received signal strength, a received signal quality, a reference signal receive power, a reference signal receive quality, a received signal strength indicator, a carrier-to-interference ratio, a signal-to-noise ratio, a bit-error rate, or a packet-error rate.
- At 608, the UE implements adaptive UE capability management in response to the determination regarding the signal-related condition. Generally, the UE may implement adaptive UE capability management in response to determining that the registration failure is due to or associated with poor signaling, marginal network conditions, or poor coverage provided by the cell. In some aspects, the UE predicts (e.g., through machine learning) or estimates a number of CA band combinations that can be successfully transmitted to the network, such as based on CA band combinations sent in previously successful registration attempts.
- The UE then reduces or removes CA information (e.g., one or more combinations of CA bands) from the UE capability message to provide a modified capability message that is smaller in size. In some cases, the CA information is reduced based on the prediction or estimate by the UE. In other cases, reductions of the CA information may be predetermined, such as by half for each iteration of reattempted registration. By so doing, the UE may increase chances of successful registration with a PLMN when reattempting registration with the modified capability message. Continuing the ongoing example, the
UE 102 implements adaptive UE capability management at 720 to reduce an amount of CA information in theUE_CapabilityInformation message 712, which decreases the size of the message. - At 610, the UE reattempts registration with the PLMN using the modified UE capability message. This may include transmitting another ATTACH request or TAU request with the modified UE capability message that includes a reduced number or subset of CA information. The UE may reattempt registration multiple times up to a threshold for a number of maximum attempts or failures (e.g., five attempts or failures). With each iteration of adaptive UE capability management, the UE may remove additional CA information with each registration reattempt. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may remove all CA information from the registration request, such as on a final attempt for registration (e.g., fifth attempt).
- With reference to
FIG. 7 ,UE 102 reattempts registration at 722 for an ATTACH or TAU with thePLMN 104. To do so, theUE 102 may reestablish the RRC connection 706 (if needed) and send another ATTACH request or TAU request. The ATTACH request or TAU request of the registration reattempt includes the modified UE_Capabilityinformation message with a subset or fewer carrier aggregation band combinations than previous requests. As noted, theUE 102 may repeat multiple iterations of adaptive UE capability management, such that subsequent registration requests include fewer and fewer CA band combinations to iteratively improve the probability of successful registration. - Returning to
FIG. 6 , themethod 600 may proceed to 612 at which registration is accepted by the PLMN or proceed to 614 is registration is unsuccessful. At 612, the successful registration can be a result of reattempting registration with modified UE capability messages that include reduced or removed CA information. Generally, adaptive EU capability management may enable user equipment to complete registration using modified UE capability messages in marginal or poor signaling conditions, which typically prevent registration due to low connection throughput. - At 614, the UE determines that registration has failed with a maximum number of attempts. In some aspects, in response to the maximum number of attempts, the PLMN is blocked from registration by adding the PLMN to a temporary PLMN forbidden list. In the context of the present example, the
UE 102 determines that a registration (ATTACH/TAU) attempt count is exceeded at 724. - At 616, the UE implements adaptive PLMN management m response to the determination regarding the network conditions and registration failures. As noted, the PLMN may be blocked from registration for a duration of time after multiple failed registration attempts. Here, the UE may search for cells available or preferred PLMNs or monitor network conditions with the PLMN while blocked. Continuing the ongoing example, the
UE 102 implements adaptive PLMN management at 726 after the attempt count is exceeded and the PLMN is placed on the temporary forbidden PLMN list. - At 618, the UE unblocks the PLMN for reattempting registration in response to an improvement in the network conditions. As described, the UE may adaptively unblock the PLMN when signaling conditions of a UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with improved network coverage. As a result, the UE may register with a PLMN more quickly than permitted by conventional techniques. In some cases, the UE can register with the PLMN after moving out of a poor signaling area (e.g., poor network conditions) without waiting for an entire duration of time as specified by various communication specifications for PLMNs on the forbidden list (e.g., 12 minutes). Concluding the present example, the UE reattempts registration by returning to 722, which the UE may attempt to do until the attempt/failure count is exceeded again and the PLMN is re-blocked.

FIG. 8 illustrates anexample method 800 of adaptive UE capability management for marginal network conditions. Generally, themethod 800 reduces an amount of carrier aggregation (CA) information in a UE capability message for registration in poor network conditions. In some aspects, operations of themethod 800 are implemented by or with aPLMN manager 144,UE capability manager 146,PLMN information 232, and/orUE capability information 234 of theuser equipment 102. - At 802, a UE transmits, to a base station, a UE capability message as part of a request for registration with a PLMN. The request for registration may include an ATTACH request or TAU request for the PLMN. In some cases, the ATTACH request or TAU request includes a UE capability message of bands, radio access technologies (RATs), and/or carrier aggregation (CA) band combinations supported by the UE.
- At 804, the UE detects failure of the registration with the PLMN. The failure of the registration may include failure of the ATTACH request or failure of the TAU request. The failure of the registration with the PLMN may include a release of the RRC connection, radio link failure, or failure due to a lower layer cause. In some cases, the UE may determine that an amount of time between transmission of a UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., three seconds).
- At 806, the UE determines that a signal-related condition for communicating with the base station of the PLMN fails to meet a predefined threshold. The UE may compare the signal-related characteristic to the predefined threshold (e.g., −110 dBm, −115 dBm, or −120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., poor signaling) or network conditions (e.g., poor or marginal conditions) associated with the cell of the PLMN. From the determination operation of 806, the
method 800 can proceed tooperation 808 and/oroperation 810, such as when a maximum number of registration attempts have not yet been made. Alternatively, themethod 800 may proceed fromoperation 806 tooperation 812, such as when the UE determines that a next registration attempt is a last registration attempt before the maximum number of registration attempts will be met. - At 808, the UE reduces an amount of CA information in the UE capability message. The UE may reduce the amount of the CA information in response to the determination that the signal-related condition for a connection with the base station is poor (e.g., weak signal coverage). Generally, reducing the amount of CA information in the UE capability message includes removing a number of CA band combinations from the UE capability message. In some cases, the UE predicts (e.g., through machine learning) or estimates a number of CA band combinations that can be successfully transmitted to the network, such as based on CA band combinations sent in previously successful registration attempts. These CA band combinations may then be removed to reduce a size of the UE capability message.
- At 810, the UE reattempts registration with the PLMN using the UE capability message with reduce CA information. This may include transmitting another ATTACH request or TAU request at
operation 802 with the modified UE capability message that includes a reduced number or subset of CA information. If the reattempt at registration is successful, the UE may then access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may reattempt registration multiple times up to a threshold for a number of maximum attempts or failures (e.g., five attempts or failures). With each iteration of adaptive UE capability management, the UE may remove additional CA information with each registration reattempt. As such, themethod 800 may repeatoperations 802 through 810 until a maximum number of registrations are attempted. During a last iteration, themethod 800 may proceed fromoperation 806 tooperation 812 in response to the UE determining that the next registration attempt is the last registration attempt before the maximum number of registration attempts will be met. - At 812, the UE removes, in response to multiple registration failures, the CA information from the UE capability message. For example, as a last attempt to register with the PLMN the UE may remove any remaining CA band combinations from the UE capability message to minimize a size of the message and further increase the likelihood of successful registration with the network. In such a case, the UE capability message may include minimal UE capabilities that include frequency bands and RATs supported by the UE.
- At 814, the UE reattempts registration with the PLMN using the UE capability message from which the CA information is removed. This may include transmitting another ATTACH request or TAU request at
operation 802 with the modified UE capability message that includes minimal or no CA information. If the registration is successful, the UE may then access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively, if registration is unsuccessful, the UE may block the PLMN and implement adaptive PLMN management to enable quick reattach when network conditions improve. -
FIG. 9 illustrates an example method of altering carrier aggregation (CA) information useful for PLMN registration in accordance with one or more aspects. Generally, themethod 900 detects registration (e.g., ATTACH request or TAU request) failure due to poor signal coverage during a UE capability inquiry stage and gradually reduces UE capability information in subsequent registration reattempts. In some aspects, operations of themethod 900 are implemented by or with aPLMN manager 144,UE capability manager 146,PLMN information 232, and/orUE capability information 234 of theuser equipment 102. - At 902, a UE transmits, to a cell of a PLMN, UE capability information as part of registration with PLMN. The UE capability information may be included with an ATTACH request or TAU request sent to the PLMN. Generally, the ATTACH request or TAU request may a UE capability message of bands, radio access technologies (RATs), and/or carrier aggregation (CA) band combinations supported by the UE.
- Optionally at 904, the UE detects a signal-related condition of the cell. In some cases, the UE compares the signal-related characteristic (e.g., RSRP or RSRQ) to the predefined threshold (e.g., −110 dBm, −115 dBm, or −120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., poor signaling) or network conditions (e.g., poor or marginal conditions) associated with the cell of the PLMN.
- At 906, the UE detects a release of a radio resource control (RRC) connection with the base station. The release of the RRC connection may be detected after transmission of the UE capability information to the cell of the PLMN. Alternatively or additionally, a lower layer failure may cause failure of the registration or loss of the RRC connection with the cell of the PLMN.
- At 908, the UE determines that a duration of time between transmission of the UE capability information and release of the RRC connection meets a threshold. For example, the UE may determine that an amount of time between transmission of a UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than three seconds (or another guard time). This may indicate that the UE was unable to successfully transmit the entire UE capability message to the network within a guard time.
- From the RRC release operation of 908, the
method 900 can proceed tooperation 910 and/oroperation 912, such as when a maximum number of registration attempts have not yet been made. Alternatively, themethod 900 may proceed fromoperation 908 tooperation 914, such as when the UE determines that a next registration attempt will meet a threshold for a maximum number of registration attempts. - At 910, the UE determines a number of CA combinations to remove from the UE capability message. In some cases, the UE determines or predicts (e.g., through machine learning) a number of CA band combinations that can be successfully transmitted to the network, such as based on a number or size (e.g., number of bytes) of CA band combinations sent in previously successful registration attempts. Alternatively, the EU may remove a predetermined portion, ratio, or fraction of the CA combinations from the UE capability message with each iteration of
operation 910. - At 912, the UE removes the determined number of CA combinations from the UE capability information. The
method 900 may then return tooperation 902 at which the UE reattempts registration with the PLMN using the UE capability information with fewer CA combinations. If the reattempt at registration is successful, the UE may then access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively, themethod 900 may perform additional iterations ofoperations 902 through 912 until a maximum number of registrations are attempted. - At 914, the UE determines that a next registration attempt will meet a threshold for a maximum number of registration attempts. In other words, the UE determines that a next reattempt for registration will be a last attempt before the PLMN is blocked for a duration of time.
- At 916, the UE removes the remaining CA combinations from the UE capability message. For example, as a last attempt to register with the PLMN the UE may remove any remaining CA band combinations from the UE capability message to minimize a size of the message and further increase the likelihood of successful registration with the network. The UE then reattempts registration with the PLMN using the UE capability message from which the CA information is removed. If the last attempt at registration is successful, the UE may then access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively, if registration is unsuccessful, the UE may implement adaptive PLMN management once the PLMN is blocked.

FIG. 10 illustrates anexample method 1000 of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. Generally, themethod 1000 unblocks a PLMN identified as being blocked for a signal-related condition when the signal-related condition improves. In some aspects, operations of themethod 1000 are implemented by or with aPLMN manager 144,UE capability manager 146,PLMN information 232, and/orUE capability information 234 of theuser equipment 102. - At 1002, a UE transmits, to a cell, a request for registration with a PLMN. The request for registration may include an ATTACH request or TAU request for the PLMN.
- At 1004, the UE detects failure of the registration with the PLMN. The failure may include failure of an ATTACH request or failure of a TAU request. In some cases, the registration failure includes a release of the RRC connection, radio link failure, or failure due to a lower layer cause.
- At 1006, the UE determines that the request for registration meets a threshold for a maximum number of registration attempts. In other words, the UE determines that a maximum number of registration attempts have been made before the PLMN is blocked for a duration of time.
- At 1008, the UE blocks the PLMN for registration for a predefined duration of time. To block the PLMN, the UE may add the PLMN to a temporary forbidden PLMN list, which is configured to block the PLMN for predefined duration of time (e.g., 12 minutes per a T3402 timer).
- At 1010, the UE determines that a signal-related characteristic for communicating with the cell of the PLMN fails to meet a predefined threshold. The UE may compare the signal-related characteristic to the predefined threshold (e.g., −110 dBm, −115 dBm, or −120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., poor signaling) or network conditions (e.g., poor or marginal conditions) associated with the cell of the PLMN.
- At 1012, the UE identifies the blocked PLMN as being blocked based on the signal-related characteristic. In some cases, the blocked PLMN is flagged, labeled, or identified in a PLMN database as being blocked based on a signal-related condition, such as poor signaling. Alternatively or additionally, this may enable the UE to track or monitor the PLMN on the temporary forbidden PLMN list as a candidate PLMN for attachment when network conditions change or improve.
- At 1014, the UE detects an improvement in the signal-related characteristic for the blocked PLMN. The UE may monitor or measure signal-related characteristics while the PLMN is blocked for the duration of time. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may periodically check network conditions to determine if the signal-related characteristic has improved. For example, a better system reselection (BSR) timer or other UE specific events may trigger a cell scan in which the UE may detect improvements or differences in respective signal-related characteristics of one or more cells.
- At 1016, the UE unblocks the PLMN prior to expiration of the predefined duration of time. Generally, the UE unblocks the PLMN to enable another attempt at registration with the PLMN. In some cases, the UE unblocks the PLMN when the UE moves to an area with moderate or good network coverage. In some aspects, the detection of improved network conditions or unblocking may occur responsive to a UE specific event that occurs during the duration of time for which the PLMN would normally be blocked. As such, adaptive PLMN unblocking may enable a reattempt for registration sooner and/or with greater frequency. For example, in the case of a 120 second BSR timer, the UE may check signal conditions and/or reattempt registration (with 5 attempts) every two minutes, or six times within 12 minutes of the length of a typical temporary PLMN forbidden list timer.
-
FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate anexample method 1100 of adaptive PLMN unblocking in varying network conditions. Generally, themethod 1100 unblocks a blocked PLMN that is flagged for poor network conditions when the PLMN meets network conditions (e.g., signal strength improves). In some aspects, operations of themethod 1100 are implemented by or with aPLMN manager 144,UE capability manager 146,PLMN information 232, and/orUE capability information 234 of theuser equipment 102. - At 1102, the UE detects an ATTACH/TAU failure with a PLMN. The ATTACH may be an initial ATTACH or the TAU may be a periodic TAU. At 1104, the UE determines whether the ATTACH failure is a maximum or last registration failure that results in blocking of the PLMN. At 1106, if the ATTACH failure is not a maximum registration failure (False), the UE takes no further action with respect to blocking the PLMN with which the ATTACH failure is detected. The UE may reattempt registration with the PLMN by transmitting another ATTACH request or another tracking area update request.
- At 1108, if the ATTACH failure is a maximum registration failure (True), the UE blocks the PLMN by adding the PLMN to a temporary PLMN forbidden list. The PLMN may remain on the temporary PLMN forbidden list until a T3402 timer expires, at which point the PLMN may be removed from the PLMN forbidden list automatically.
- At 1110, the UE determines whether network conditions between the UE and the base station of the PLMN are poor (e.g., poor signal coverage). The UE may compare the signal-related characteristic to the predefined threshold (e.g., 110 dBm, −115 dBm, or −120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., poor signaling) or network conditions (e.g., poor or marginal conditions) associated with a cell of the PLMN. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may determine that signaling conditions are poor in response to a release of the RRC connection, radio link failure, or registration failure due to a lower layer cause. At 1112, if the network conditions are not poor (False), the UE takes no further action with respect to flagging or labeling the blocked PLMN on the temporary PLMN forbidden list. In some cases, the UE waits until the timer of the PLMN forbidden list expires before reattempting registration with the PLMN.
- At 1114, the UE flags the PLMN on the temporary forbidden list as blocked due to poor network conditions. By so doing, the UE may track or monitor the PLMN while on the temporary PLMN forbidden list. From
FIG. 11A , themethod 1100 proceeds toFIG. 11B where the operations of themethod 1100 continue as shown at 1116. - At 1118, the UE initiates a new registration procedure. The registration procedure may be initiated in response to user selection, a better system reselection (BSR) procedure, a UE specific procedure, or the like. At 1120, the UE performs a PLMN search through an acquisition database of locally stored PLMN information, such as for preferred or previously associated PLMNs. In some cases, the PLMN search is performed in response to initiation of the new registration procedure or better cell reselection procedure.
- At 1122, the UE reviews the search results of the PLMN search for searched cells that may be associated with the PLMN blocked for poor network conditions. At 1124, if the search cells do not serve the blocked PLMN (False), the UE takes no further action with respect to those cells. At 1126, if the network conditions (e.g., signal strength) of the searched cells of the blocked PLMN meet a threshold for reattempting the ATTACH on the blocked PLMN, then the UE unblocks the PLMN for registration before removal from the temporary PLMN forbidden list before expiration of the time. In other words, the UE will temporarily unblock the PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list and will reinitiate an ATTACH or TAU registration procedure. At 1126, if the searched cells do not meet the threshold for reattempting registration, the
method 1100 takes no further action with respect to the blocked PLMN. Alternatively, if no PLMNs are found during the search, the UE may perform a full band PLMN search. - At 1132, the UE successfully registers with the PLMN. The UE may then access network services or resources, and the T3402 timer of the temporary PLMN forbidden list will be stopped. Alternatively at 1134, the UE returns the PLMN to the temporary PLMN forbidden list if the registration is not successful. In some cases, the timer of the temporary PLMN forbidden is not reset and the UE may unblock the PLMN multiple times (e.g., returning to operation 1118) before the expiration of the list timer.

electronic device 1200 also includes one ormore memory devices 1212 that enable data storage, examples of which include RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NV-RAM, ROM, erasable programmable ROM (EPROM), Flash memory, and a disk storage device. Any or all of thememory devices 1212 may enable persistent and/or non-transitory storage of information, data, or code, and thus do not include transitory signals or carrier waves in the general context of this disclosure. For example, the memory device(s) 1212 provide data storage mechanisms to store thedevice data 1204 and other types of data (e.g., user data). Thememory device 1212 may also store anoperating system 1214, firmware, and/ordevice applications 1216 of the electronic device as instructions, code, or information. These instructions or code can be executed by theprocessor 1208 to implement various functionalities of the electronic device, such as to provide a user interface, enable data access, or manage connectivity with a wireless network. In this example, thememory device 1212 also stores processor-executable code or instructions for providing respective instances of aPLMN manager 144 andUE capability manager 146, which may be implemented similarly to or differently from the PLMN manager or UE capability manager described with reference toFIGS. 1-11 . The memory device also includes PLMN information 232 (e.g., acquisition database) and UE capability information, which may be accessed by the PLMN manager or UE capability manager to implement aspects described throughout the disclosure. - As shown in

As such, aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions as described herein can be implemented by, or in conjunction with, theelectronic device 1200 ofFIG. 12 . -
FIG. 13 illustrates an example system on chip (SoC) that may implement aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. TheSoC 1300 may be embodied as or within any type ofUE 102, user equipment, user device, apparatus, other device, or system as described with reference toFIGS. 1-12 to implement adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions.

chip 1300 includes one ormore processor cores 1310, which process various computer-executable instructions to control the operation of the system onchip 1300 and to enable techniques for adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. Alternatively or additionally, the system onchip 1300 can be implemented with any one or combination of hardware, firmware, or fixed logic circuitry that is implemented in connection with processing and control circuits, which are generally shown at 1312. Although not shown, the system onchip 1300 may also include a bus, interconnect, crossbar, or fabric that couples the various components within the system onchip 1300. - The system on
chip 1300 also includes a memory 1314 (e.g., computer-readable media), such as one or more memory circuits that enable persistent and/or non-transitory data storage, and thus do not include transitory signals or carrier waves. Examples of thememory 1314 include RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NV-RAM, ROM, EPROM or Flash memory. Thememory 1314 provides data storage for thesystem data 1306, as well as forfirmware 1316,applications 1318, and any other types of information and/or data related to operational aspects of the system onchip 1300. For example, thefirmware 1316 can be maintained as processor-executable instructions of an operating system (e.g., real-time OS) within thememory 1314 and executed on one or more of theprocessor cores 1310. - The

Alternatively or additionally, theUE capability manager 146 may reduce or remove carrier aggregation information from a UE capability message to increase a probability of successful registration with a PLMN. ThePLMN manager 144 and/orUE capability manager 146 of the wireless communication processor may be implemented, in whole or in part, through hardware or firmware. - Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when devices, systems, applications, and/or features described herein may enable collection of user information, such as one or more of wireless link metrics, connection duration information, average connection length, signal quality/strength information, network identity information, network basic service set identifier (BSSID) information, recently utilized wireless communication bands/channels, a user's preferences, a user's current location, if the user has communicated content or information with a server, or the like.
- In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. For example, a user's geographic location may be generalized or randomized about where location information is obtained (such as to a city, postal code, or state/province level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control(s) over what information is collected about the user, one or more devices of the user, how that information is used, and/or what information is provided to the user.
- Although aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions have been described in language specific to features and/or methods, the subject of the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or methods described. Rather, the specific features and methods are disclosed as example implementations of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions and other equivalent features and methods are intended to be within the scope of the appended claims.
