Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to digital data processing and, in particular, to using data that represents previously submitted user queries to accentuate search results.
- Internet search engines aim to identify documents or other items that are relevant to a user's needs and to present the documents or items in a manner that is most useful to the user. Such activity often involves a fair amount of mind-reading inferring from various clues what the user wants. Certain clues may be user specific. For example, knowledge that a user is making a request from a mobile device, and knowledge of the location of the device, can result in much better search results for such a user.
- Clues about a user's needs may also be more general. For example, search results can have an elevated importance, or inferred relevance, if a number of other search results link to them. If the linking results are themselves highly relevant, then the linked-to results may have a particularly high relevance. Such an approach to determining relevance may be premised on the assumption that if authors of web pages felt that another web site was relevant enough to be linked to then web searchers would also find the site to be particularly relevant. In short, the web authors “vote up” the relevance of the sites.
- This specification describes technologies relating to ranking search results.
- one or more aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in one or more methods for processing query information.
- the methods include receiving documents responsive to a query, each document having an associated score indicative of the document's relevance to the query.
- the methods include determining, for a plurality of the associated scores, a distribution of the scores along a dimension that measures trustworthiness of the scores.
- the methods include reducing each of one or more of the plurality of associated scores by an amount determined based on the score's respective trustworthiness among an arrangement of scores in the distribution.
- the methods also include ranking the documents to account for the reduced scores.
- Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the distribution may be a frequency distribution and the amount may be determined based on a distance between a lowest and a highest score in the distribution and the score's trustworthiness.
- the amount may be determined based on a number of intervals in the distribution and the score's trustworthiness.
- the amount may be determined based on a shape of the distribution and the score's trustworthiness.
- Each of the associated scores may include one or more score components. Reducing each of one or more of the plurality of associated scores by the amount may include reducing a first score component for each score.
- the first score component may represents an amount added to an information retrieval score for an associated document.
- the methods may also include providing the ranked documents to a client.
- the score's respective trustworthiness may be determined by a metric that calculates a degree of trustworthiness for the score. Trustworthiness of a score may be based on a language of the score's associated document. Trustworthiness of a score may be based on the similarity between the query and a previous query. Trustworthiness of a score may based on a country from which the query was submitted and the country in which the documents were created.
- Search result quality can be improved.
- Search result scores can be modified based on differences in the reliability of the source of the scores.
- FIG. 1 shows an example information retrieval system.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example information retrieval system and components.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an information retrieval search session.
- FIG. 7 is diagram illustrating an adjustment of search rankings and dimensional information.
- FIG. 9 shows a flowchart that represents operations of an accentuator.
- FIG. 11 shows a schematic diagram of an example computer system.
- the server-side query signal 1010 b is received by the search engine 1030 .
- the search engine 1030 uses the information within the user query 1015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 1030 can include an indexing engine 1020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus, and the index information for the documents in the corpus can be stored in an index database 1022 .
- This index database 1022 can be accessed to identify documents related to the user query 1015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- the search engine 1030 can include a ranking engine 1052 to rank the documents related to the user query 1015 .
- the ranking of the documents can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance.
- a document is linked to (e.g., is the target of a hyperlink) by many other relevant documents (e.g., documents that also contain matches for the search terms)
- it can be inferred that the target document is particularly relevant. This inference can be made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they can be considered more relevant, and the first document can be considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants. The technique is exemplified in some systems that treat a link from one web page to another as an indication of quality for the latter page, so that the page with the most such quality indicators is rated higher than others. Appropriate techniques can also be used to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the relevance of a page.
- the ranking engine 1052 can receive an additional signal from a rank modifier engine 1056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the documents.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 provides one or more prior models, or one or more measures of relevance for the documents based on one or more prior models, which can be used by the ranking engine 1052 to improve the search results' ranking provided to the user 1002 .
- a prior model represents a background probability of document result selection given the values of multiple selected features, as described further below.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can perform one or more of the operations described below to generate the one or more prior models, or the one or more measures of relevance based on one or more prior models.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 may be provided to the rank modifier engine 1056 for improving the ranking of documents.
- one or more dimensions associated with a search requestor may be identified and used to adjust rankings of search results.
- the search engine 1030 can include an accentuator 1058 that may implement one or more identification and adjustment techniques.
- the dimensions may be representative of characteristics associated with the search requestor.
- Such characteristics can include location of the requestor (e.g., country, region, state, city, etc.), language (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.), demographics (e.g., gender, age, etc.), areas of interest (e.g., sports, movies, etc.), and personal traits (e.g., profession, level of education, etc.), to name a few examples.
- Characteristics may be provided by the search requestor, or may be inferred by analyzing data related to the search request or a series of search requests, or determined in some other manner. Additionally, information related to interactions between the search requestor and search results (e.g., click data, query refinement, etc.) may be used to adjust the dimensions and to adjust search result rankings.
- the dimensions of a user may be ordered based on which dimensions are most likely to produce good search results. For example, some dimensions may be considered inherently more accurate (e.g. profession may be considered a better indicator than level of education). In other scenarios, one dimension may be determined to have a stronger influence on a particular query (e.g. gender may have a strong influence on the query “village”). In some arrangements, dimensions may be ranked based on the amount of information there is supporting the dimension. For example, dimensions which influence a broad range of queries may be considered superior to dimensions which influence fewer queries. In other arrangements, all dimensions may be used to influence search results.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system. These components can include an indexing engine 2010 , a scoring engine 2020 , a ranking engine 2030 , a rank modifier engine 2070 , and an accentuator 2080 .
- the indexing engine 2010 can function as described above for the indexing engine 1020 .
- the scoring engine 2020 can generate scores for document results based on many different features, including content-based features that link a query to document results, and query-independent features that generally indicate the quality of document results.
- the content-based features can include aspects of document format, such as query matches to title or anchor text in an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) page.
- the query-independent features can include aspects of document cross-referencing, such as a rank of the document or the domain.
- the particular functions used by the scoring engine 2020 can be tuned, to adjust the various feature contributions to the final IR score, using automatic or semi-automatic processes.
- a tracking component 2050 can be used to record information regarding individual user selections of the results presented in the ranking 2040 .
- the tracking component 2050 can be embedded JavaScript code included in a web page ranking 2040 that identifies user selections (clicks) of individual document results and also identifies when the user returns to the results page, thus indicating the amount of time the user spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 2050 can be a proxy system through which user selections of the document results are routed, or the tracking component can include pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- Other implementations are also possible, such as by using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) clicked by the user.
- the recorded information can be stored in the result selection log(s) 2060 .
- the recorded information can include log entries that indicate, for each user selection, the query (Q), the document (D), the time (T) on the document, the language (L) employed by the user, and the country (C) where the user is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- the components shown in FIG. 2 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations.
- the scoring engine 2020 and the ranking engine 2030 can be merged into a single ranking engine, such as the ranking engine 1052 of FIG. 1 .
- the accentuator 2080 , the rank modifier engine 2070 and the ranking engine 2030 can also be merged, and in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of document results after a query.
- a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example information retrieval system.
- a server system 3050 includes an indexing engine 3060 and a scoring/ranking engine 3070 .
- a client system 3000 includes a user interface for presenting a ranking 3010 , a tracking component 3020 , result selection log(s) 3030 and a ranking/rank modifier engine/accentuator 3040 .
- the client system 3000 can include a company's enterprise network and personal computers, in which a browser plug-in incorporates the ranking/rank modifier engine/accentuator 3040 .
- the scoring/ranking engine 3070 can return the search results along with either an initial ranking or the actual IR scores for the results.
- the browser plug-in can then re-rank the results locally based on tracked page selections for the company-specific user base.
- FIG. 4 operations of an exemplary set of search sessions of an exemplary information retrieval system 4000 are illustrated. Similar to the systems shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 , the information retrieval system 4000 shown in FIG. 4 can provide relevant results for search queries. For example, similar to client device 1004 (shown in FIG. 1 ), client side systems 4010 a , 4010 b , 4010 c and 4010 d can enable users to enter search queries and interact with search results. Also, similar to server system 1014 (also shown in FIG. 1 ), a server side system 4002 can process search queries and generate search results that are correspondingly provided to any of the client side systems 4010 a - d . Being scalable, more or fewer client side systems and server side systems may be included in the information retrieval system 4000 .
- Any of the results interfaces 4018 a - d may be provided by one or more output devices (e.g., video display, audio playback system, etc.).
- Various types of equipment may be included in the server side system 4002 to access, process, and store content.
- one or more servers represented by a server 4004
- one or more data stores represented by a data store 4006
- One or more communication techniques may be implemented for exchanging data among the client side systems 4010 a - d , the server side system 4002 , and other data sources (not shown).
- one or more networking techniques may be used to provide communication through a network 4008 (e.g., the Internet) such as wired or wireless (or a combination of wired and wireless) connections.
- a user may interact with the results by clicking one or more links, for example, based on associated information (e.g., text descriptions, media, etc.).
- Click data which may be represented by selecting a link, visiting a resource (e.g., a web page) associated with a selected link for an amount of time (e.g., five seconds, one minute, five minutes, etc.), or other type of user interaction may be collected during a search session.
- Lack of user interactions, for example, proceeding to another set of search results without selecting a link may be collected and stored.
- a web browser cookie may be maintained by any of the client systems 4010 a - d that represents the collected information or a portion of the information.
- collected information may represent one or more dimensions representative of characteristics associated with a user of any of the client side systems 4010 a - d . By identifying the particular user dimensions or dimensions commonly shared among multiple users, this information could be used to assist subsequent searches during the same search session or during future search sessions. If a group of users commonly sharing a particular dimension are found to generally prefer a particular query result (e.g., based on click data, interactions with results, etc.), for example, the information retrieval system may associate the result preferences with the dimension.
- statistics e.g., counts, averages, time-related data, etc.
- the statistics may be used to modify search result rankings for users associated with the dimensions, for example.
- a user locality may be determined from a domain specified by a user. If a user specifies a search domain such as “google.co.uk”, for example, an inference may be made that the user is from the United Kingdom. As another example, a user locality may be determined by identifying information (e.g., an IP address) associated with a user device. A user language may be determined by cross-referencing provided search query terms with various language dictionaries, for example. In another example, a user language may be determined by referencing a browser's language setting.
- Dimensions such as demographics (e.g., gender, age, etc.) and other traits (e.g., profession, level of education, etc.), for example, may be inferred by examining search queries and interactions from a search session. For example, it may be surmised that a user providing search queries including medical terminology (as opposed to common terminology) and interacting with search results of a technical nature (e.g., medical journal articles, etc.) may be a member of the medical profession. Additionally, particular words and spelling patterns may be detected for identifying user dimensions. For example, such words and spelling patterns may be indicative of a particular nationality (e.g., using the spelling “color” vs. “colour” may indicate an American nationality). As another example, frequent correct or incorrect spelling may be indicative of a high or low level of education. Such inferences may be used to identify one or more dimensions associated with the user and the identified dimensions may be used to provide more relevant search results to the user, for example.
- demographics e.g., gender, age, etc.
- a search session may be initiated by a query being provided by a user.
- a search session is initiated by a search query 4012 a (e.g., “football”) being entered via the query interface 4014 a of the client side system 4010 a .
- the search query 4012 a and dimensional information associated with a user may be sent to the server side system 4002 via the network 4008 .
- the server side system 4002 can process the search query 4012 a and related information, for example by using one or more software modules (e.g., a search engine) executed by the server 4004 .
- a set of search results 4016 a may be presented to the user via the results interface 4018 a .
- the search results 4016 a (and search results 4016 b - d ) are shown as graphical representations, however, other representations (e.g., text, links, etc) may be shown individually or in combination with the graphics.
- a user of the client side system 4010 b may initiate a search session by entering a search query 4012 b (e.g., “football”) via the query interface 4014 b .
- a search query 4012 b e.g., “football”
- the search query 4012 b and dimensional informational associated with the user may be sent to the server side system 4002 via the network 4008 .
- the server side system 4002 can process the search query 4012 b and related information, and as shown by process arrows 4022 and 4032 , search results may be sent to the client side system 4010 b via the network 4008 .
- a set of search results 4016 b may be presented to a user via the results interface 4018 b.
- the information retrieval system 4000 may initially provide similar query results (e.g., 4016 a , 4016 b ) based on similar search queries (e.g., 4012 a , 4012 b ).
- similar search queries e.g., 4012 a , 4012 b
- multiple search result categories e.g., Association football or soccer, Gridiron or American football, etc.
- a search query e.g., “football”
- a user associated with one or more identified dimensions may be determined to generally prefer a particular search result or search result category.
- the user of client side system 4010 a may be identified as being associated with a dimension 4050 (e.g., a location in the United States).
- the user of client side system 4010 a in this example may interact with the search results 4016 a (e.g., by selecting a particular result, by viewing information associated with the selected result for a certain amount of time, by scrolling through the results, by proceeding to another set of search results, etc.).
- the user of client side system 4010 a may select a query result link related to American football.
- data related to the interaction may be sent to the server side system 4002 via the network 4008 .
- the user of client side system 4010 b may be associated with a dimension 4060 (e.g., a location in England).
- the user of client side system 4010 b in this example may interact with the search results 4016 b .
- the user of client side system 4010 b may select a query link related to Association football (soccer).
- data related to the interaction in addition to information associated with the identified dimension 4060 (e.g., a location in England), may be sent to the server side system 4002 via the network 4008 .
- One or more techniques may be implemented to associate an identified user dimension with preferred search results.
- the information retrieval system 4000 may track preferred search results for search requestors (e.g., users) relative to one or more dimensions associated with the search requestors to produce one or more metrics. Upon the metric reaching a defined value, for example, one or more preferred search results may be determined for a search query provided by a search requestor associated with an identified dimension.
- server side system 4002 may store information related to a search result preference (e.g., a preference for American football) based on a search query (e.g., search query 4012 a , “football”) provided by a search requestor (e.g., the user of client side system 4010 a ) associated with an identified dimension (e.g., dimension 4050 , a location in the United States).
- a search result preference e.g., a preference for American football
- search query 4012 a e.g., search query 4012 a , “football”
- a search requestor e.g., the user of client side system 4010 a
- an identified dimension e.g., dimension 4050 , a location in the United States
- the server side system 4002 may store information related to a search result preference (e.g., a preference for Association football) based on a search query (e.g., search query 4012 b , “football”) provided by a search requestor (e.g., the user of client side system 4010 b ) associated with another identified dimension (e.g., dimension 4060 , a location in England).
- a search query e.g., search query 4012 b , “football”
- another identified dimension e.g., dimension 4060 , a location in England.
- Metrics e.g., counts, percentages, weightings, etc.
- a count may be maintained for search results (e.g., results related to American football) preferred by search requestors associated with an identified dimension (e.g., a location in the United States) for a particular search query (e.g., “football”). Similar counts may be maintained for search results (e.g., results related to Association football) preferred by search requestors associated with other dimensions (e.g., a location in England). As such, multiple metrics may be produced (and maintained) for multiple identified dimensions, multiple search queries, and multiple search results, for example.
- search results e.g., results related to American football
- an identified dimension e.g., a location in the United States
- search query e.g., “football”.
- Similar counts may be maintained for search results (e.g., results related to Association football) preferred by search requestors associated with other dimensions (e.g., a location in England).
- multiple metrics may be produced (and maintained) for multiple identified dimensions, multiple search queries, and multiple search results, for example.
- a user of client side system 4010 c may provide a search query 4012 c (e.g., “football”) via the query interface 4014 c , which, similar to the user of client side system 4010 a , may reflect the location of the user. Also similar to client side system 4010 a , client side system 4010 c may be associated with one or more dimensions such as the dimension 4050 (e.g., a location in the United States).
- the dimension 4050 e.g., a location in the United States
- the search query 4012 c and dimensional information may be sent to the server side system 4002 via the network 4008 .
- the server side system 4002 can process the search query 4012 c and related information, for example by using one or more software modules (e.g., a search engine) executed by the server 4004 .
- an accentuator included in the search engine may identify one or more dimensions associated with the user of the client side system 4010 c (e.g., dimension 4050 , a location in the United States) and may adjust the ranking of search results based on metrics (e.g., counts, percentages, weightings, etc.) associated with the identified dimensions, provided search queries, preferred search results, etc.
- metrics e.g., counts, percentages, weightings, etc.
- information associated with the metrics may be retrievable from the data store 4006 for use by one or more software modules (e.g., the accentuator 1058 , shown in FIG. 1 ) to adjust the search results rankings.
- While one dimension may be used for adjusting query results, in some arrangements, multiple dimensions may be utilized for ranking results. Further, assigning priorities, weighting, and other techniques and methodologies may be used to distinguish and enhance one (or more) dimensions from another dimension (or multiple dimensions). For example, in some implementations, metrics associated with the language of a user may be given a higher priority compared to metrics associated with the location of a user. Similarly, temporal characteristics may be used as factors for adjusting query results. For example, in some implementations, query results associated with more recent information may be assigned a higher priority or assigned more weight than query results associated with less recent information. As shown by process arrows 4022 and 4042 , in this example, adjusted search results may be sent to the client side system 4010 c via the network 4008 .
- search results 4016 c may be presented to the user via the results interface 4018 c .
- Search results may be adjusted and presented in a manner which accentuates results determined to be relevant to users. For example, search results that reflect one or more dimensions of the users may be considered more relevant.
- the search results 4016 c may be adjusted such that the ranking of results pertaining to American football are generally increased and the ranking of results pertaining to other types of football are generally decreased or in some instances, actively suppressed.
- a user of client side system 4010 d may provide a search query 4012 d (e.g., “football”) via the query interface 4014 d .
- the client side system 4010 d or the user may be associated with dimension 4060 (e.g., a location in England).
- the search query 4012 d and dimensional information may be sent to the server side system 4002 for processing by using one or more software modules (e.g., a search engine).
- an accentuator included in a search engine may identify one or more dimensions associated with the user of the client side system 4010 d (e.g., dimension 4060 , a location in England). Upon identifying the dimension(s), the accentuator may adjust the ranking of search results, e.g., based on metrics associated with previously identified dimensions, provided search queries, and preferred search results. For example, the information retrieval system 4000 may determine that a predetermined number of search requesters associated with the identified dimension (e.g., dimension 4060 ) submitted a similar search query (e.g., “football”) and have shown a preference for a particular type of search result (e.g., results pertaining to Association football or soccer).
- a predetermined number of search requesters associated with the identified dimension e.g., dimension 4060
- a similar search query e.g., “football”
- Data store 5006 is representative of various types of information sources that may be in communication with the server 5004 .
- one or more storage devices e.g., hard drives, etc.
- servers, and computing device equipment may be directly or indirectly (e.g., via one or more networks) in communication with the server 5004 .
- a similar query may also result in an increased score, for example, if the previous user enters a query of “American football.”
- the score may be further based on information known about the user such as the user's language, geographic location, demographic information and recent search history. For example, a user who enters an English language query is likely to be more interested in English language search results. English search results may also be preferred in an English speaking country. In this case, otherwise identical resources typically receive a higher score if they are in English. These different factors are combined to create a single score.
- each factor of a score for a search result 5062 a - f may be associated with a trustworthiness factor or score which provides a measure of the reliability of the score.
- a trustworthiness factor or score which provides a measure of the reliability of the score.
- one query result 5062 b may have a relatively high score but a relatively low level of trustworthiness may be associated with that score, while another query result 5062 c may have a lower score but a higher confidence level.
- the initial query results 5060 may be sorted based on the score of the individual query results 5062 a - f . Once the trustworthiness of the score is taken into account, the scores may be adjusted and the ranking may change.
- the trustworthiness of a factor may be considered as a measurement of confidence that applying the factor is likely to improve the search results for the user.
- trustworthiness may be considered a measure of how likely results associated with a previous and similar query (e.g. “American Football” or “Futbol”) may also provide good results for the current query (e.g. “football).
- the similarity between current and previous queries may be measured using a similarity score.
- trustworthiness may be considered a measure associated with the origins a document (or other type of search result).
- a searcher located in the United States may have results returned that originate from the United States, other English speaking countries, or anywhere in the world. Generally, results from the same country are more likely to satisfy the user than results from other countries that share a common language (e.g., other English speaking countries) or results from the rest of the world. Scores may be adjusted commensurately.
- the trustworthiness of a factor may depend upon similarities shared among previous users and current users, e.g., based upon demographic information.
- Demographic information may include age, gender, race, income, education, computer type, browser type, employment status, location, and other similar factors.
- Each of these factors may produce their own individual measure or score of trustworthiness, which may or may not be further processed (e.g., aggregated). For example, search result selections of a previous user who is thirty-six years of age may be more likely to produce good results for a search initiated by a person thirty-four years of age than for a six year old individual.
- the individual query results 5062 a - f are scored individually and independently using several different criteria. Each criterion has a trustworthiness score associated with it; however, because the results are scored independent of one another the trustworthiness scores lack relative meaning. Therefore, the initial scores are made without regard to the trustworthiness associated with each of the criterion that contribute to the results. The results may be sorted based on the initial score. Once the query results 5060 are determined, the trustworthiness scores for each criterion are analyzed. Trustworthiness scores may be narrowly distributed, indicating an equal confidence in each score or trustworthiness scores may be widely distributed, indicating that scores from some criterion may be more reliable than other scores from the same criterion.
- the degree of distribution of trustworthiness scores may be determined using traditional methods. For example, the trustworthiness scores may be analyzed to determine a mean and a standard distribution of the score. In some arrangements, the standard distribution may be normalized. In general, a set of documents having a larger standard deviation of trustworthiness scores indicates a larger variation in the reliability of the scores. Similarly, a small standard deviation indicates that the trustworthiness of each score is similar. In some arrangements, the trustworthiness scores may be considered highly distributed if the difference between the most trustworthiness and the least trustworthy scores exceeds a threshold. In other arrangements, the distribution of the trustworthiness scores may be based on the number of intervals in the distribution, for example the number of binomial confidence intervals.
- the distribution of scores may be considered highly distributed based on the shape of the distribution curve, for example, a distribution curve which contains multiple peaks may be considered widely distributed, similarly a distribution curve with a long tail may be considered widely distributed. If the trustworthiness of the results is sufficiently distributed, that is there are items with relatively high trustworthiness and other items with relatively low trustworthiness, the portion of the result score associated with the criterion may be compared and adjusted. In a similar manner, the score may be modified to reflect the relative trustworthiness of multiple criteria.
- the individual query result 5062 b may have its score reduced to reflect the relative lack of confidence in criteria contributing to the score when compared to the other query results 5062 a, c - f .
- adjusted search results may be sent to the client side system 5010 via the network 5008 .
- search results 5016 containing the individual search results 5062 a - f may be presented to the user via the results interface 5018 .
- the search results may be presented in a manner which reflects the adjustments made on the server.
- individual query result 5062 b has been demoted and is presented in a less relevant position than query result 5062 c.

- a user may conduct an initial search session from one client and may conduct a subsequent search session from the same client or from another client.
- Interactions among the search engine 6030 and clients may be concurrently executed.
- the search engine 6030 may perform search operations (e.g., receiving search queries, determining matches (search results), identifying one or more dimensions, storing and retrieving data, etc.) for one client while also performing operations related to one or more other clients.
- a diagram 6000 illustrates identifying dimensional information from search queries. Such operations may be initiated by client 6010 submitting 6040 query that is provided to the search engine 6030 . Along with the query, additional information may also be provided to the search engine 6030 , for example, temporal information (e.g., time of day, day of week, month or season of year, proximity to events such as sporting competitions and elections, etc.) may be provided by a search requestor or client device in association with the search query. Such temporal information may be used to define or identify dimensional information associated with a user. For example, the gender of a user could be determined from the types of searches executed at a particular time of the day or evening. Selected search results may also factor into dimension identification.
- temporal information e.g., time of day, day of week, month or season of year, proximity to events such as sporting competitions and elections, etc.
- Operations of the search engine 6030 may include receiving 6042 the search query and determining 6044 results related to the provided query.

- dimensional information may be identified, associated with query information, and stored based upon provided queries and other user or client information.
- a diagram 7000 illustrates adjusting search rankings and dimensional information. For example, based upon identified dimensional information, the ranking of search results may be adjusted. Similarly, dimensional information may be adjusted, for example, based upon search results, user selections and other types of information. To illustrate such adjustments, initial operations of the client 6010 may include submitting 7002 a query to the search engine 6030 . Along with the query, additional information may be provided for assisting in search result identification and ranking.

- the dimensions may be identified using information related to provided search queries, dimensional information provided by a search requestor or client device, and provided temporal information.
- one or more dimensions may be associated with the recency of data indicative of search requestor behavior relative to previously submitted queries. For example, search results more recently preferred by users associated with one or more similar dimensions (e.g., a user of the client 6010 ) may be given additional weight or value as compared to search results preferred less recently.
- Further operations of the search engine 6030 include adjusting 8010 result ranking based on the identified dimensions.
- a flowchart 9000 represents some operations of an accentuator (such as the accentuator 1058 shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the operations may be executed by a single computing device (such as the server system 1014 shown in FIG. 1 ) that includes a search engine. In some arrangements, multiple computing devices may also be utilized.
- operation execution may be distributed among two or more sites (e.g., server system 1014 and client 1004 ).
- the accentuator 1058 may use search query data and identify one or more dimensions representative of characteristics (e.g., location, language, demographics, personal traits, etc.) associated with the search requestor.
- the accentuator 1058 may execute operations such as receiving 9002 data representative of one or more search queries.
- Search query data for example, may be included in one or more search sessions conducted by a search requestor (e.g., a client user).
- Various types of data may be associated with a search session, for example, data related to search queries, user characteristics, click data, and the like.
- operations may also include identifying 9004 ranked results from the search query. For example, the results may be identified and individually scored and ranked by an accentuator (e.g., the accentuator 1058 as shown in FIG. 1 ).
- Operations of the accentuator 1058 may also include identifying 9006 one or more associated dimensions.
- the dimensions may be representative of at least one characteristic associated with the search requestor associated with the search session.
- the dimensions may be associated with a requestor location, a user language, a user demographic (e.g., gender, age, etc.), a user trait (e.g., profession, level of education, etc.), etc.
- the dimensions may also be associated with or derived from one or more user interactions (e.g., click data, etc.).
- click data from previous search queries initiated by the requestor may represent user preferences and behavior that may be used for dimension identification.
- Characteristics of the collected data may also be utilized, for example, the particular time that data is collected may factor into identifying one or dimensions. For example, more recent search requestor behavior may receive greater weight or higher preference for identifying or using user dimensions. Similarly, in another example, more recent search results may receive greater weight or higher preference.
- operations may also include adjusting 9008 search results, for example, by using the identified dimensions.
- the adjustment may be indicative of search requestor behavior relative to previously submitted queries.
- search results adjustments may be based on one or more combinations of user dimensions. For example, two dimensions may be identified by a requestor in which one dimension may be associated with the language of the search requestor and another dimension may be associated with the geographical location of the requestor. Priorities or weights may be assigned to any of the dimensions. For example, one of the dimensions may be assigned a priority or a higher weight relative to one or more other dimensions (e.g., assigning language a higher weight as compared with location, etc.).
- operations may also include providing 9010 the adjusted search results.
- the search results may be provided to a client device (e.g., client 1004 a , shown in FIG. 1 ) used by a search requestor.
- a chart 10000 represents some additional operations of an accentuator (such as the accentuator 1058 shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the operations may be executed by a single computing device (such as the server system 1014 shown in FIG. 1 ) that includes a search engine. In some arrangements, multiple computing devices may also be utilized. Along with being executed at a single site (e.g., server system 1014 ), operation execution may be distributed among two or more sites (e.g., server system 1014 and client 1004 ).
- one operation of the accentuator may include adjusting 9008 search results. Such adjustments may be based upon information provided by one or more dimensions. To provide such adjustment capabilities, various types of operations may be provided. For example, operations may include increasing 10002 the rank of one or more search results. As another example, operations may include decreasing 10004 the rank of one or more search results. For a set of individually scored and ranked search results, the accentuator 1058 may increase or decrease the rank of a particular result based on an availability of result ranking data associated with a user dimension, for example.
- a specific ranking e.g., a ranking based on local data
- a general ranking e.g., a ranking based on global data
- the ranking of documents determined to be more relevant to users associated with one or more common dimensions may be generally increased and the ranking of document determined to be less relevant to users associated with one or more common dimensions may be generally decreased.
- Adjustments may be applied using a variety of methods (e.g., by applying multipliers, priorities, etc.).
- the accentuator 1058 may determine a distribution of trustworthiness scores and reduce a document's score based on its relative position within the distribution.
- a document with a relatively low trustworthiness score as compared to the other documents, would have its score decreased by a large amount.
- a document with a high trustworthiness score may not have its score adjusted at all. The adjusted document scores and used to adjust the relative position of the documents within the ranking.
- Operations of the accentuator 1058 may also include removing 10006 one or more search results, for example.
- operations may include adding 10008 one or more search results.
- the accentuator 1058 may remove or add particular search results based on the availability of result ranking data associated with a user dimension. For example, rankings based on global data may be blocked or filtered. Additionally, rankings based on results preference data (e.g., click data, etc.) associated with users identified with one or more common dimensions may be used in place of global ranking data.
