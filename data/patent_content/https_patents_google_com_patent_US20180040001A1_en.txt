- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for presenting information for paid versus organic views of video content items.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- This document describes methods, processes and systems for segmenting view information for video content items (e.g., video advertisements (or ads)) based on paid versus organic views.
- Paid views are video views that are associated with an advertisement, such as an advertisement for which a content sponsor pays for presentations of the advertisement.
- Organic views are views that occur as a result of direct navigation by a user to a hosting site for the video, without having linked there from an advertisement.
- the paid views can correspond to paid presentations of the video content item
- organic views can correspond to views of the associated video that occur directly, for example, through a video sharing environment.
- content sponsors e.g., advertisers who sponsored the ads
- the segmented view information can be filtered using various filters including, for example, demographics, location, time period (e.g., a range of dates/hours), and quartile (or dwell time while watching the video).
- a sponsor can receive information that provides a segmented view of paid versus organic views of a particular video content item that was viewed in June by teenage girls from Omaha.
- the information can also include quartiles for the views, e.g., the number of views that completed one-fourth of the video, one-half, three-quarters, or the entire video.
- view data that is identified for a video content item can be segmented.
- the segmented view data can create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views, e.g., whether the teenage girls' boots video was watched as part of a paid video ad or watched organically (unpaid) on a video hosting website.
- a user interface e.g., used by the sponsor of the video content item, can present the segmented view data.
- a filter can be applied to the segmented view data, and the filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data can be presented to the user.
- segmented view data can include one or more segments that reflect view statistics of paid versus organic views for at least one or more of the following: demographics, time period, location, or dwell time.
- filtering can also occur based on different video formats (e.g., search-result-embedded videos, selected-from-group videos, in-display videos, stream-embedded videos, or videos having other formats).
- video formats e.g., search-result-embedded videos, selected-from-group videos, in-display videos, stream-embedded videos, or videos having other formats.
- a sponsor can be presented with segmented paid versus organic view information for a particular video content item's views that occurred as a search-result-embedded video or in other format(s) specified by the sponsor.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for serving content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 (e.g., for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content), a video hosting site 111 (e.g., a website for uploading and watching videos), and a sponsor interface 130 for presenting information for paid versus organic views of video content items.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors (e.g., advertisers 108 ), publishers 109 , the content management system 110 , the video hosting site 111 , and the sponsor interface 130 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content sponsors (e.g., advertisers 108 ).
- the content management system 110 includes a paid view information collector 120 that collects view information corresponding to paid views of video content items.
- the view information can be obtained, for example, from the content management system 110 which can track user presentations of (and reactions to) video content items. For example, when a video content item (e.g., a video ad) is presented, information about views of the video ad can be collected and stored, e.g., in a store of view information 122 .
- view information can include demographic, time period, location and/or dwell time information corresponding to each view.
- Any view information related to users can be anonymized so that the privacy of the users is protected. For example, quasi-unique identifiers can be associated with users, but the actual identifying information of the users is not stored in the view information 122 .
- any identified user interactions can be generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users.
- the video hosting site 111 can provide access to and allow playing of videos that have been uploaded by anyone, including individuals, content sponsors, etc.
- the video hosting site 111 can include an organic view information collector 121 that collects view information corresponding to organic (or unpaid) views of video content items that occur, for example, on the video hosting site 111 .
- a particular video that a user can watch on the video hosting site 111 as an unpaid view can be the same video, for example, as one that is paid and is included as part of a video advertisement.
- the view information 122 can include information regarding whether each view of a video has occurred as part of a paid ad impression or if the view was organic, e.g., requested by a user and not associated with an advertisement.
- the view information 122 can include statistics related to the number of times the video content item was presented, the number of times it was viewed by a user, the number of times the user interacted with (e.g., clicked on) the video content item causing the user to land on a landing page associated with the video content item, costs associated with the video content item, and so on.
- the sponsor interface 130 includes a view information segregator 124 that segregates the collected view information relative to paid and organic views, e.g., using view information 122 .
- the sponsor interface 130 can then present the segregated view information, e.g., in a user interface, in one or more reports, and/or in other ways.
- the view information segregator 124 can segregate view information on an as-needed based, e.g., when the segregated information is requested for a user interface, report, etc. For example, real-time segregation can provide up-to-date information. In some implementations, segregation of the view information can occur on a scheduled basis (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.), and the information can be stored and ready-to-use, e.g., in a user interface that a content sponsor can use to review performance (e.g., number of views) of their video content items.
- a scheduled basis e.g., daily, hourly, etc.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, videos and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page or search results, in which content can be presented.
- These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title or video title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page or video, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- content items e.g., ads
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible video ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- search queries 116 are not used, the content management system 110 can use other ways of selecting content, e.g., selecting ads based on the format type of a particular ad slot.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive bids from content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction).
- the bids are amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for playing a video associated with a video ad.
- the bid can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for other activities such as a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- FIGS. 2A-2D show example sponsor interface screens 200 a - 200 d that provide segmented view information for paid versus organic views of video content items.
- the sponsor interface 130 can provide the sponsor interface screens 200 a - 200 d using information from view information 122 , including information for paid and organic views. Other user interface screens are possible.
- the sponsor interface 130 can provide segmented view information in other formats, e.g., reports, emails, etc.
- the sponsor interface screen 200 a displays segmented view information for a snowboarding video 202 .
- the view information includes a total number of views 204 (e.g., 15,000 views), a paid view count 206 (e.g., 7,000 paid views), and an organic view count 208 (e.g., 8,000 un-paid views).
- a time period 210 states that the view information corresponds to a time period that spans Aug. 3 to Sep. 17, 2010.
- the time period 210 can be used as a filter for limiting the view information to a user-specified subset of views.
- most views of the video 202 occurring during the time period 210 are associated with users in a particular demographic group 212 (e.g., males aged 18-25).
- the time period 210 can be a control that is used to select a time period to be used as a filter for one or more video content items.
- the time period 210 can be applied as a filter to the segmented view data, so that presenting the user with paid versus organic view information can include presenting one or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view in accordance with the time period filter.
- Other controls for selecting other filters are possible.
- a demographic filter can be used that presents one more filtered sub-segments that can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the demographic filter.
- demographic filters can include filters based on age, gender, income, marital status, education, etc.
- the sponsor can select one or more demographic filters to use in selecting and/or segmenting view information according to the selections.
- the filter can include a location filter.

- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for presenting information for paid versus organic views of video content items.
- the process 300 can be performed by one or more processors associated with the sponsor interface 130 .
- FIGS. 1 and 2A-2D are used to provide examples for steps of the process 300 .
- View data is identified for a video content item ( 302 ).
- the content management system 110 can identify one or more video content items for which paid and/or organic views have occurred.
- the content management system 110 can provide the view identification for the video content items to the paid view information collector 120 .
- the paid view information collector 120 for example, can set up buckets used by the view information 122 in preparation of collecting view information for the video content items, including information that identifies whether each view is a paid view or an organic view. The collection of view information can occur over time as each video content item is presented to potentially thousands or millions of users.
- the paid view information collector 120 can collect view information corresponding to paid views, e.g., views of the video content item that occur in association with a paid ad.
- the organic view information collector 121 can collect view information corresponding to organic views of the video content item, e.g., unpaid views of the associated video that occur on the video hosting site 111 .
- the collected view information can also include information regarding user actions that occur after the video content item is presented (e.g., dwell time, impressions, click-throughs, etc.).
- the view data is segmented to create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views ( 304 ).
- the view information segregator 124 can segregate the collected view information relative to paid versus organic views and provide totals relative to the video content item as a whole.

- One or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data are provided to the user ( 310 ).
- the sponsor interface screen 200 d can present view information upon which age and gender demographic filters have been applied.
- the table 272 and the graph 274 are segmented by age and gender in various ways. This filter-based segmentation is in addition to segmentation based on paid versus organic views.
- filtering can also occur based on video format.
- video formats can exist, including, but not limited to, a search-result-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided as part of a search result), a selected-from-group format (e.g., a video that is provided in response to a selection made from a slate of available videos), an in-display format (e.g., a video that is provided as a user-selectable thumbnail within a banner or other display), or a stream-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided before, during or after another content item in a stream).
- search-result-embedded format e.g., a video that is provided as part of a search result

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for identifying and presenting view information for a video content item. The method comprises identifying view data for a video content item, segmenting the view data to create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views, and presenting the segmented view data to a user.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Content item slots can be allocated to content sponsors through an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content. Some content items, such as video content items (e.g., video advertisements) can be viewed separately, or organically, e.g., without being associated with a paid advertisement.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for identifying and presenting view information for a video content item. The method comprises identifying view data for a video content item, segmenting the view data to create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views, and presenting the segmented view data to a user.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The method can further comprise applying a filter to the segmented view data and presenting one or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data to the user. The filter can be a demographic filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the demographic filter. The filter can be a location filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the location filter. The filter can be a time period filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the time period filter. The filter can be a quartile or dwell time filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the quartile or dwell time filter. The view data can include both paid view data for paid presentations of the video content item and organic view data for views of the video data directly through a video sharing environment. Presenting the segmented view data can include presenting the segmented view data in a graph. Presenting the segmented view data can include presenting the segmented view data in a tabular form. The method can further comprise further segmenting the segmented view data to include one or more segments that reflect view statistics of paid versus organic views for at least one or more of the following further segments comprising demographics, time period, location, or dwell time.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems that include a system for presenting segmented view data to a user. The system comprises a content management system that provides content items responsive to received requests. The content management system includes a paid view information collector that collects and identifies paid view data for a video content item including view information corresponding to paid views of the video content item. The content management system further includes a video hosting site that supports hosting, uploading and watching videos, the video hosting site including an organic view information collector that collects and identifies organic view data for a video content item including view information corresponding to organic views of the video content item. The content management system further includes a sponsor interface, displayable on a user device, for presenting the segmented view data to a user, the sponsor interface including a view information segregator that segments the collected and identified paid and organic view data to create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views of the video content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The view information segregator can further apply a filter to the segmented view data and present one or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data for use in the sponsor interface.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to identify view data for a video content item, segment the view data to create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views, and present the segmented view data to a user.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The computer program product further comprises instructions to apply a filter to the segmented view data and present one or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data to the user. The filter can be a demographic filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the demographic filter. The filter can be a location filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the location filter. The filter can be a time period filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the time period filter. The filter can be a quartile or dwell time filter, and presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the quartile or dwell time filter. The view data can include both paid view data for paid presentations of the video content item and organic view data for views of the video data directly through a video sharing environment. Presenting the segmented view data can include presenting the segmented view data in a graph. Presenting the segmented view data can include presenting the segmented view data in a tabular form. The computer program product further comprises instructions to further segment the segmented view data to include one or more segments that reflect view statistics of paid versus organic views for at least one or more of the following further segments comprising demographics, time period, location, or dwell time.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- This document describes methods, processes and systems for segmenting view information for video content items (e.g., video advertisements (or ads)) based on paid versus organic views. Paid views are video views that are associated with an advertisement, such as an advertisement for which a content sponsor pays for presentations of the advertisement. Organic views are views that occur as a result of direct navigation by a user to a hosting site for the video, without having linked there from an advertisement. For example, the paid views can correspond to paid presentations of the video content item, and organic views can correspond to views of the associated video that occur directly, for example, through a video sharing environment. Using the segmented view information, content sponsors (e.g., advertisers who sponsored the ads) can track the performance (e.g., views, etc.) of their video assets in both contexts. Further, the segmented view information can be filtered using various filters including, for example, demographics, location, time period (e.g., a range of dates/hours), and quartile (or dwell time while watching the video). For example, a sponsor can receive information that provides a segmented view of paid versus organic views of a particular video content item that was viewed in June by teenage girls from Omaha. The information can also include quartiles for the views, e.g., the number of views that completed one-fourth of the video, one-half, three-quarters, or the entire video.
- As an example, view data that is identified for a video content item (e.g., teenage girls' boots) can be segmented. The segmented view data can create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views, e.g., whether the teenage girls' boots video was watched as part of a paid video ad or watched organically (unpaid) on a video hosting website. A user interface, e.g., used by the sponsor of the video content item, can present the segmented view data. In some implementations, a filter can be applied to the segmented view data, and the filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data can be presented to the user. In some implementations, segmented view data can include one or more segments that reflect view statistics of paid versus organic views for at least one or more of the following: demographics, time period, location, or dwell time.
- In some implementations, filtering can also occur based on different video formats (e.g., search-result-embedded videos, selected-from-group videos, in-display videos, stream-embedded videos, or videos having other formats). As an example, a sponsor can be presented with segmented paid versus organic view information for a particular video content item's views that occurred as a search-result-embedded video or in other format(s) specified by the sponsor.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for serving content. Theexample environment 100 includes a content management system 110 (e.g., for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content), a video hosting site 111 (e.g., a website for uploading and watching videos), and asponsor interface 130 for presenting information for paid versus organic views of video content items. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors (e.g., advertisers 108), publishers 109, thecontent management system 110, thevideo hosting site 111, and thesponsor interface 130. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, and content sponsors (e.g., advertisers 108). - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 includes a paidview information collector 120 that collects view information corresponding to paid views of video content items. The view information can be obtained, for example, from thecontent management system 110 which can track user presentations of (and reactions to) video content items. For example, when a video content item (e.g., a video ad) is presented, information about views of the video ad can be collected and stored, e.g., in a store ofview information 122. - In some implementations, view information can include demographic, time period, location and/or dwell time information corresponding to each view. Any view information related to users can be anonymized so that the privacy of the users is protected. For example, quasi-unique identifiers can be associated with users, but the actual identifying information of the users is not stored in the
view information 122. Additionally, any identified user interactions can be generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users. - The
video hosting site 111 can provide access to and allow playing of videos that have been uploaded by anyone, including individuals, content sponsors, etc. In some implementations, thevideo hosting site 111 can include an organicview information collector 121 that collects view information corresponding to organic (or unpaid) views of video content items that occur, for example, on thevideo hosting site 111. In some implementations, a particular video that a user can watch on thevideo hosting site 111 as an unpaid view can be the same video, for example, as one that is paid and is included as part of a video advertisement. - The
view information 122 can include information regarding whether each view of a video has occurred as part of a paid ad impression or if the view was organic, e.g., requested by a user and not associated with an advertisement. In some implementations, theview information 122 can include statistics related to the number of times the video content item was presented, the number of times it was viewed by a user, the number of times the user interacted with (e.g., clicked on) the video content item causing the user to land on a landing page associated with the video content item, costs associated with the video content item, and so on. - In some implementations, the
sponsor interface 130 includes aview information segregator 124 that segregates the collected view information relative to paid and organic views, e.g., usingview information 122. Thesponsor interface 130 can then present the segregated view information, e.g., in a user interface, in one or more reports, and/or in other ways. - In some implementations, the
view information segregator 124 can segregate view information on an as-needed based, e.g., when the segregated information is requested for a user interface, report, etc. For example, real-time segregation can provide up-to-date information. In some implementations, segregation of the view information can occur on a scheduled basis (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.), and the information can be stored and ready-to-use, e.g., in a user interface that a content sponsor can use to review performance (e.g., number of views) of their video content items. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, videos and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page or search results, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title or video title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page or video, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible video ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. However, in applications in which search queries 116 are not used, thecontent management system 110 can use other ways of selecting content, e.g., selecting ads based on the format type of a particular ad slot. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive bids from content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for playing a video associated with a video ad. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for other activities such as a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. The selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. -
FIGS. 2A-2D show examplesponsor interface screens 200 a-200 d that provide segmented view information for paid versus organic views of video content items. In some implementations, thesponsor interface 130 can provide thesponsor interface screens 200 a-200 d using information fromview information 122, including information for paid and organic views. Other user interface screens are possible. In some implementations, thesponsor interface 130 can provide segmented view information in other formats, e.g., reports, emails, etc. - As an example, referring to
FIG. 2A , thesponsor interface screen 200 a displays segmented view information for asnowboarding video 202. The view information includes a total number of views 204 (e.g., 15,000 views), a paid view count 206 (e.g., 7,000 paid views), and an organic view count 208 (e.g., 8,000 un-paid views). In this example, atime period 210 states that the view information corresponds to a time period that spans Aug. 3 to Sep. 17, 2010. In some implementations, thetime period 210 can be used as a filter for limiting the view information to a user-specified subset of views. Further, in this example, most views of thevideo 202 occurring during thetime period 210 are associated with users in a particular demographic group 212 (e.g., males aged 18-25). - In some implementations, the
time period 210, for example, can be a control that is used to select a time period to be used as a filter for one or more video content items. For example, thetime period 210 can be applied as a filter to the segmented view data, so that presenting the user with paid versus organic view information can include presenting one or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view in accordance with the time period filter. Other controls for selecting other filters are possible. For example, a demographic filter can be used that presents one more filtered sub-segments that can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the demographic filter. In some implementations, demographic filters can include filters based on age, gender, income, marital status, education, etc. In some implementations, the sponsor can select one or more demographic filters to use in selecting and/or segmenting view information according to the selections. - In some implementations, the filter can include a location filter. For example, presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with geographic location information. In some implementations, geographic location information can include countries, states, counties, neighborhoods, or other geographic areas.
- In some implementations, the filter can include a quartile or dwell time filter. For example, presenting one more filtered sub-segments can include presenting both organic view data and paid view data in accordance with the quartile or dwell time filter.
- For example, dwell time quartile information 214 (e.g., categorized by quartiles) identifies the number of views associated with users who watched 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the video, respectively. In some implementations, dwell time quartiles can be used as a filter. In this example,
segmented quartile information 216 provides segmented quartile counts that are totaled for paid and organic views. - A
line graph 218 shows a comparison of paid versus organic views over time. For example, theline graph 218 provides a segmented view of view information (e.g., paid versus organic) in graphical form. In some implementations, other forms of graphs can be used (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, etc.). - The
snowboarding video 202 can be one of multiple videos that can appear on thesponsor interface screen 200 a. In some implementations, view totals 220 and 222 can provide total views (and other totals) for all filtered views, e.g., the 15,000 views for paid plus organic, and all views, respectively. In this example, the view totals 222 correspond to sums of filtered views (e.g., between Aug. 3 to Sep. 17, 2010) and un-filtered views (e.g., outside of that time period). - In some implementations, additional statistics can be provided. For example, paid
view statistics 224 can include statistics associated with impressions, clicks, and a click-through ratio (CTR) that correspond to the paidview count 206. -
FIG. 2B shows an examplesponsor interface screen 200 b that displays segmented view information for videos 230 a-230 e. For example, paidview information 232 a provides counts of paid views for thevideo 230 a, including a total paid view count and dwell time quartiles. In another example,organic view information 234 a provides counts of organic (un-paid) views for thevideo 230 a, including a total organic view count and dwell time quartiles.Totals 236 a, for example, provide totals of the paidview information 232 a and theorganic view information 234 a. For thevideo 230 e, totals 236 e, for example, provide totals of paidview information 232 e andorganic view information 234 e. In these examples, no time period filter or other filters are used. - A grand totals line 238 can provide totals corresponding to all videos, including totals for paid and organic views. For example, the grand totals line 238 can provide segmented totals of the segmented view information for videos 230 a-230 e and videos not shown in
FIG. 2B but included in the totals (e.g., scrolled off the screen). In some implementations, paid and organic subtotals (not shown onFIG. 2B ) can be used to provide subtotals across all videos, segmented by paid versus organic. -
FIG. 2C shows an examplesponsor interface screen 200 c that displays segmented view information for videos 250 a-250 c. For example, paidview information 252 provides counts of paid views for thevideo 250 b, including a total paid view count and dwell time quartiles. In another example,organic view information 254 provides counts of organic (un-paid) views for thevideo 250 b, including a total organic view count and dwell time quartiles.Totals 256, for example, provide totals of the paidview information 252 and theorganic view information 254. - In the example shown for videos 250 a-250 c, a
time period filter 257 is used to limit the displayed view information, for example, to a views associated with a time period from Aug. 1-7, 2011. Aline graph 258 also uses the time period range specified by thetime period filter 257 to present filtered view information, as well as according to a selected graph type 260 (e.g., “Views”). Other selections for thegraph type 260 can include, for example, “Paid Views,” “Non-paid Views” (e.g., for organic views), and “All Views” (e.g., for displaying two graph lines, one each for paid versus organic views, as shown for theline graph 218 ofFIG. 2A .). -
FIG. 2D shows an examplesponsor interface screen 200 d that displays segmented view information for avideo 270. For example, thesponsor interface screen 200 d can simultaneously display segmented view information in a table 272 and agraph 274. The segmented view information in the table 272 and thegraph 274 is filtered based on a current setting (e.g., demographic) of afilter control 276. As a result, the view information in the table 272 and thegraph 274 is segmented by demographic information in addition to whether the views are paid versus organic. In this example, the demographic filtering filters by age and gender. - For example, in the table 272, segmented view data for views associated with the
video 270 is presented in tabular form. View information in the table, for example, corresponds to organic views and to views associated with three paid ads (e.g.,Ad 1,Ad 2 and Ad 3) which are ads associated with a campaign 278 (e.g., Campaign 1). As a result, the table 272 includes separate lines 280 a-280 d showing view information forAd 1,Ad 2,Ad 3 and organic views, respectively. A totalsline 282 provides totals for the separate lines 280 a-280 d, where the totals correspond to the overall views for thevideo 270. - The
graph 274 includesbars 284 that represent the number of male and female views for eachage group 286 within the selected age demographic. The lengths of thebars 284 correspond to the number of views by age group in the table 272. Male/female totals 288 in the table 272 correspond to total views segmented by gender and based on male/female view totals on each of the separate lines 280 a-280 d. Apie chart 290, indicating a male/female percentage split of views, is based on total male and female views (e.g., 27,500 and 22,500) for thevideo 270 that appear on thetotals line 282. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for presenting information for paid versus organic views of video content items. Theprocess 300 can be performed by one or more processors associated with thesponsor interface 130.FIGS. 1 and 2A-2D are used to provide examples for steps of theprocess 300. - View data is identified for a video content item (302). For example, the
content management system 110 can identify one or more video content items for which paid and/or organic views have occurred. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can provide the view identification for the video content items to the paidview information collector 120. In some implementations, the paidview information collector 120, for example, can set up buckets used by theview information 122 in preparation of collecting view information for the video content items, including information that identifies whether each view is a paid view or an organic view. The collection of view information can occur over time as each video content item is presented to potentially thousands or millions of users. As an example, the paidview information collector 120 can collect view information corresponding to paid views, e.g., views of the video content item that occur in association with a paid ad. The organicview information collector 121, for example, can collect view information corresponding to organic views of the video content item, e.g., unpaid views of the associated video that occur on thevideo hosting site 111. The collected view information can also include information regarding user actions that occur after the video content item is presented (e.g., dwell time, impressions, click-throughs, etc.). - The view data is segmented to create a segmentation that compares paid views versus organic views (304). As an example, the
view information segregator 124 can segregate the collected view information relative to paid versus organic views and provide totals relative to the video content item as a whole. In some implementations, theview information segregator 124 can accessview information 122 for each of the paid and organic views. - The segmented view data is presented to a user (306). For example, the
sponsor interface 130 can present the segmented information in any of thesponsor interface screens 200 a-200 d, in a report, or in other ways. - A filter is applied to the segmented view data (308). As an example, the
view information segregator 124 can use one or more filters (e.g., demographics, time period, location, or dwell time) to create sub-segments of the view information that is already segmented based by paid versus organic views. - One or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data are provided to the user (310). As an example, referring to
FIG. 2D , thesponsor interface screen 200 d can present view information upon which age and gender demographic filters have been applied. Specifically, the table 272 and thegraph 274 are segmented by age and gender in various ways. This filter-based segmentation is in addition to segmentation based on paid versus organic views. - In some implementations, filtering can also occur based on video format. Different types of video formats can exist, including, but not limited to, a search-result-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided as part of a search result), a selected-from-group format (e.g., a video that is provided in response to a selection made from a slate of available videos), an in-display format (e.g., a video that is provided as a user-selectable thumbnail within a banner or other display), or a stream-embedded format (e.g., a video that is provided before, during or after another content item in a stream). Other formats are possible. Each format can provide a different context in which the video content item is presented. By way of example, search-result-embedded videos can include videos that consist of a user-selectable thumbnail image or icon that appears inside a search result. Selected-from-group videos can include videos that result from user selection of a single thumbnail from a group (or slate) of thumbnails of videos. In-display videos can include videos that appear as a user-selectable thumbnail in a banner (e.g., at the top of a web page) or in some other type of display. Stream-embedded videos can include short (e.g., 15-second, 30-second, etc.) videos that play before, during or after other video content (e.g., referred to as “pre-rolls,” “mid-rolls,” or “post-rolls”). Other formats are possible, and the methods, systems, user interfaces, etc. that are described in this document can be adapted for the other formats, including formats that apply to mobile devices.
- One or more filtered sub-segments of the segmented view data are presented to the user (310).
- While reference is made to paid versus organic segmentations of the view data, other segmentations are possible. For example, the systems and methods proposed could be used to segment views from multiple different serving sources (e.g., from different content delivery systems). Other segmentations are possible.
