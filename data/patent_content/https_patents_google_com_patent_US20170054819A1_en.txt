- the present disclosure generally relates to increasing activity of users on websites and web applications, and, in particular, to improving user experience based on the user's activity.
- Internet users utilize the Internet for different purposes and in different manners, and exhibit many different behaviors and preferences. For example, on a social networking application, some users like to post new content, others prefer to react to content that others have posted (e.g., commenting on posted content, reposting content, or showing approval of posted content), and others enjoy consuming content without contributing any additional content. Furthermore, many Internet users may display a combination of these or other activities and may engage in these activities to varying degrees.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to a method executed on one or more computing devices for categorizing users based on online social activities in a social network, the method comprising analyzing, using the one or more computing devices, behavior data of one or more online social activities for a plurality of users, generating, using the one or more computing devices, user activity log data for the plurality of users, wherein the user activity log data is generated based on the analysis of the behavior data for the plurality of users, determining, using the one or more computing devices, a plurality of behavioral categories based on the activity log data for the plurality of users, each behavioral category of the plurality of behavioral categories being defined by a set of values corresponding to the one or more online social activities in the behavior data, and associating at least one user of the plurality of users with one behavioral category of the plurality of behavioral categories based on the set of values defining the one behavioral category and user activity log data associated with the at least one user.

- the system may utilize an algorithm to categorize the users.
- the algorithm may utilize statistical modeling to identify different user behaviors, then analyze the distributions associated with each of the different behaviors across all users, and break down the distributions into segments. Part of the analysis may include determining the thresholds in the distributions, e.g., the points in the distributions where states change, e.g., from very active to moderately active, and from moderately active to inactive. Therefore, the algorithm may analyze the users to identify clusters to determine the different behaviors, and then analyze the users within each of the identified clusters to determine the different categorizations into which users fit.
- the system may be able to provide customized user experiences, encourage desired user activities in particular users, design more fitting features for users, and enable system administrators to better understand the users. For example, the system may display and provide more promotional materials and/or different features to users who do not share much or any content such that they may contribute more content and may react more to the content of other users. In another example, the system may analyze users who share a lot of content to determine what makes them share more content than other users and/or may provide them with features that make these users consume more, e.g., react to the content of other users. In one aspect of this disclosure, in addition to categorizing users, the system may track the movement of users among categories, to better understand what influences the behaviors of the users. The system may also determine how users from different categories react to a certain feature.

- the process for categorizing users based on users' activities in a network may include input processing, data processing, and output processing.
- input processing includes obtaining and analyzing behavior data for a plurality of users in the network ( 202 ).
- behavior data may correspond to one or more social activities of the users in the network.
- Input processing also includes generating user activity logs for the users ( 204 ).
- obtaining the behavior data may include extracting data from user logs or taking existing raw data. The data may be collected over a period of time and may have associated time and date, which may be utilized generating the user activity logs.
- Generating the user activity logs may include transforming each user activity log (e.g., data of a user's activity over time) into a structured file, which may include, for example, instances of incoming and outgoing information sharing and the corresponding timestamp (e.g., time and date).
- input processing may, for example, track the posting, reading, commenting, and approval indications of a number of users of a social networking application for a period of time (e.g., 7 days) and generate a user behavior log with these behaviors for each user.
- Data processing includes determining a plurality of behavioral categories based the users' activity logs for the plurality of users in the network ( 206 ).
- each behavioral category may be defined by a set of values corresponding to the one or more social activities in the user activity logs.
- other user data e.g., user profiles
- data processing may utilize statistical evaluations to generate the behavioral categories. For example, a clustering algorithm (e.g., a K-means clustering algorithm) may be utilized to divide a set of observations (e.g., the user activity logs) into subsets or clusters (e.g., categories) so that the observations in each cluster are similar in some sense, as illustrated in the example of FIG. 3 .
- a clustering algorithm e.g., a K-means clustering algorithm
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example categorization of users in a social network, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure.
- activity log data of users of the social network may be defined by a set of values.
- the values corresponding to each of the users is plotted and a clustering algorithm is used to generate one or more clusters, e.g., clusters 302 , 304 , and 306 .
- clusters 302 , 304 , and 306 e.g., clusters 302 , 304 , and 306 .
- clusters 302 , 304 , and 306 e.g., clusters 302 , 304 , and 306 .
- users who exhibit similar behaviors within a specific online activity get clustered together, thus defining a behavioral category associated with the corresponding online activity.
- the users of the social network get divided into two clusters corresponding to two behavioral categories associated with the online activity.
- a threshold value is determined as a dividing point between the two categories, where a user is associated with the first behavioral category if the value associated with the user for the corresponding online activity falls below the threshold value, and associated with the second behavioral category if the value associated with the user for the corresponding online activity is equal to or greater than the threshold value.
- the users of the social network get divided into more than two clusters corresponding to more than two behavioral categories associated with the online activity.
- the values representing the online activity are divided into three categories based on the clustering behavior of the values.
- behavior categories are determined for the associated online activity, and the behavior categories are defined by threshold values 303 and 305 .
- Subsequent analysis of user behavior for the corresponding online activity results in categorizing the user's activity into one of the behavioral categories relative to threshold values 253 and 255 .
- the statistical evaluation may evaluate the behavior characteristics and frequency of the behavior, then draw the lines that define the thresholds for each behavior to identify two or more categories (or clusters) of similar users, e.g., very active commenter or power user and moderate commenter or ordinary user. Generating behavioral categories may also depend on user-defined thresholds, in addition to the statistical evaluation. For example, users who have more than a certain number of shares in a social network may be identified as power users.
- a user's profile on the social network may be evaluated, along with sharing behavior to determine several attributes of the user.
- the user profile information may include, for example, the amount of information a user has filled on his or her profile and the audience (e.g., the public, a personal network, or an extended network) to which the user makes the profile information available.
- the profile data may also include any of the data listed in the user's profile as well as the user's settings for the social networking application.
- Other information that may be evaluated in this illustrative example may be the amount of online sharing that occurs during a time period (e.g., posts, media types, comments, adding friends, and the like).
- the content of the sharing e.g., media type, text length, etc.
- amount of incoming feedback e.g., comments that a user receives
- the statistical evaluation may also include determining whether the data distributions are appropriate (e.g., skewed, uniform, long-tailed, etc.) and the relationship between the individual variables. This information regarding the distributions may be utilized in evaluating the output during output processing, described below.
- data processing also includes associating each of the users with at least one of the determined behavioral categories ( 208 ).
- the association of a user with a behavioral category may be based on the set of values defining the one behavioral category and the user's activity log. In this manner, each user may be classified into at least one of the behavioral categories.
- Output processing includes adjusting the content of the network utilizing the categorization information ( 210 ). Adjusting the content may include, for example, utilizing the categorization information to customize content for each user based on the category to which the user is assigned. For example, the system may present messages that encourage certain activities (e.g., posting or commenting) to users in a category associated with low activity or, for a user in a category associated with high activity of a certain type (e.g., posts or reposts), the system may present rank content in a user's information stream differently to encourage the user to share or repost certain content.
- activities e.g., posting or commenting
- the system may present rank content in a user's information stream differently to encourage the user to share or repost certain content.
- output processing may also include creating a visualization of the categorization of users and providing system administrators with statistics and characteristics of the users of the network. Using this information, system administrators may be able to develop more customized user experiences or design more appropriate features for users, for example.
- visualization and tracking of user behavior may be done relatively in real-time, thus providing feedback and adjustments while the users may be online, for example.
- the system may also have access to user profiles and activities in other applications as well (e.g., an email application, an online media-sharing application, a content (e.g., news) delivery application, a search application, a mapping application, etc.). Additional measures may be taken to restrict access to user identity or other sensitive information in order to protect the users' privacy. Activities and behavior on these applications may also be monitored by the system and used to categorize users.

Abstract
A system for categorizing users based on activities in a social network analyzes behavior data of online social activities for each user of a set of users. The system generates a user activity log for each user of the set of users, where the user activity log for each user is generated based on the behavior data. The system determines a set of behavioral categories based on the users' activity logs, each behavioral category of the set of behavioral categories being defined by a set of values corresponding to the one or more social activities in the behavior data. The system also associates at least one user of the set of users with one behavioral category of the set of behavioral categories based on the set of values defining the one behavioral category and user activity log for the at least one user.

- I. Overview
- Users of the Internet, and specifically users of certain applications and websites, e.g., social networks and applications, have different experiences and ways of interacting with other users and with the different aspects of the social networks or applications and as a result fall into different categories and their experiences are as a result different. Some users post new content, others prefer to react to the content posted by others, and others enjoy consuming content without contributing their own content and/or commenting on the content of others. Therefore, it may be desirable to classify users based on their activity level and to track changes in their activity level over time, adjust their experiences according to their classification, and improve products so that users become more active
- In accordance with aspects of this disclosure, a system and method are provided for categorizing users based on detected social activities and behaviors. In one example, the system may utilize an algorithm to categorize the users. The algorithm may utilize statistical modeling to identify different user behaviors, then analyze the distributions associated with each of the different behaviors across all users, and break down the distributions into segments. Part of the analysis may include determining the thresholds in the distributions, e.g., the points in the distributions where states change, e.g., from very active to moderately active, and from moderately active to inactive. Therefore, the algorithm may analyze the users to identify clusters to determine the different behaviors, and then analyze the users within each of the identified clusters to determine the different categorizations into which users fit.
- In categorizing users, the system may be able to provide customized user experiences, encourage desired user activities in particular users, design more fitting features for users, and enable system administrators to better understand the users. For example, the system may display and provide more promotional materials and/or different features to users who do not share much or any content such that they may contribute more content and may react more to the content of other users. In another example, the system may analyze users who share a lot of content to determine what makes them share more content than other users and/or may provide them with features that make these users consume more, e.g., react to the content of other users. In one aspect of this disclosure, in addition to categorizing users, the system may track the movement of users among categories, to better understand what influences the behaviors of the users. The system may also determine how users from different categories react to a certain feature.
- II. Example Network Environments for Categorizing Users in a Social Network
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example network that can be used to implement aspects of the subject technology. Specifically, thenetwork system 100 comprises a number ofelectronic user devices network 108, afirst server 110 and asecond server 120. As illustrated,user devices first server 110 and thesecond server 120 via thenetwork 108.Server 110 may include aprocessing device 112 and adata store 114.Processing device 112 may execute computer instructions stored indata store 114, for example, to categorize users ofelectronic devices network 108. It is understood that in addition to theuser devices first server 110 and thesecond server 120, any number of other processor-based devices could be communicatively connected to thenetwork 108. Furthermore, as will be discussed in greater detail below, thenetwork 108 could comprise multiple networks, such as a network of networks, e.g., the Internet. - In some example embodiments,
electronic devices FIG. 1 ,electronic device 102 is depicted as a smartphone,electronic device 104 is depicted as a desktop computer, andelectronic device 106 is depicted as a PDA. - The
network 108 may include, for example, any one or more of a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, thenetwork 108 may include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like. - One or more of the process steps of the subject technology may be carried out by one or more of the
user devices first server 110 and thesecond server 120. For example, thefirst server 110 and thesecond server 120 may be used to support a social network platform accessible by one or more users (e.g., viauser devices first server 110 and/or thesecond server 120 may be used to obtain, store, and process information associated with users connected to the social network and the activities and behaviors of the users in their interaction with the social network to categorize the users based on their social activities and behaviors, as discussed in more detail below. - In one example, the subject technology may comprise a system for categorizing users based on users' activities in a network (e.g., a social network). The system may be hosted at
server 110, for example, and may include an input processor, a data processor, and an output processor. The input processor may be configured to obtain behavior data for a number of users and generate user activity logs for the users. For example, the input processor may detect a user's activities on a social networking application (e.g., an online community) over a period of time and generate a user activity log based on detected activities and the time each activity occurred (e.g., a timestamp). The input processor can generate activity logs on a per user basis where an activity log is generated for each user or can generate activity logs that include aggregate data for multiple users. - The data processor may be configured to create a number of categories based on the activities listed in the user activity logs and classify the users into at least one of the created categories. In one example, the data processor may generate the categories using a clustering algorithm (e.g., a K-means clustering algorithm), which may divide a set of observations (e.g., the user activity logs) into subsets or clusters (e.g., categories) so that the observations in each cluster are similar in some sense.
- The output processor may be configured to create an output illustrating the categorization of users and provide statistics and characteristics of the users and their activities. This output information may be utilized to customize user experiences or provide features more appropriate for users based on their activities. In one example, the output information may be provided to system administrators of the network or networking application in which the users interact with other users and with the network or application.
- The operations associated with the input processor, data processor, and output processor may be implemented by one or more processors (e.g., processing device 112), which may be operable to execute to one or more algorithms, e.g., a categorizing algorithm. In one example, the categorizing algorithm may categorize users based on users' activities in the network. The categorizing algorithm may comprise one or more algorithms, which may perform one or more of the operations associated with the present disclosure.
- III. Example Processes for Categorizing Users in a Social Network
-
FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of anexample process 200 for categorizing users in a social network, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure.Example process 200 may be performed by a computing device, e.g.,server 110 ofFIG. 1 . In some examples, a computer-readable storage medium (e.g., data store 114) may be encoded with instructions that, when executed, cause one or more processors (e.g., processing device 112) to perform one or more of the acts illustrated inexample process 200. - The present disclosure provides a method for categorizing users in a network (e.g., a social network) based on users' social activities. The activities may include any detectable action associated with a user in his or her interaction with other users or with features of the network. Activities may include, among other thing, posting content in a published information stream, posting content of a particular type (e.g., an image, a link, a file, etc.) in the information stream, commenting on posted content, reposting content posted by another user, indicating approval of posted content, receiving comments or approval from other users, reading posted content (e.g., scrolling a user interface containing the information stream), signing in to a social networking application, sending messages to users, reading or receiving messages from users, etc.
- The process for categorizing users based on users' activities in a network may include input processing, data processing, and output processing. In some examples, input processing includes obtaining and analyzing behavior data for a plurality of users in the network (202). In one example, behavior data may correspond to one or more social activities of the users in the network. Input processing also includes generating user activity logs for the users (204). In one example, obtaining the behavior data may include extracting data from user logs or taking existing raw data. The data may be collected over a period of time and may have associated time and date, which may be utilized generating the user activity logs. Generating the user activity logs may include transforming each user activity log (e.g., data of a user's activity over time) into a structured file, which may include, for example, instances of incoming and outgoing information sharing and the corresponding timestamp (e.g., time and date). In one illustrative example in the context of a social networking application, input processing may, for example, track the posting, reading, commenting, and approval indications of a number of users of a social networking application for a period of time (e.g., 7 days) and generate a user behavior log with these behaviors for each user.
- Data processing includes determining a plurality of behavioral categories based the users' activity logs for the plurality of users in the network (206). In one example, each behavioral category may be defined by a set of values corresponding to the one or more social activities in the user activity logs. In some examples, other user data (e.g., user profiles) may be also evaluated to determine the behavioral categories. In one example, data processing may utilize statistical evaluations to generate the behavioral categories. For example, a clustering algorithm (e.g., a K-means clustering algorithm) may be utilized to divide a set of observations (e.g., the user activity logs) into subsets or clusters (e.g., categories) so that the observations in each cluster are similar in some sense, as illustrated in the example of
FIG. 3 . -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example categorization of users in a social network, in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. AsFIG. 3 shows, for a certain online activity, activity log data of users of the social network may be defined by a set of values. The values corresponding to each of the users is plotted and a clustering algorithm is used to generate one or more clusters, e.g.,clusters - In other examples, as illustrated in
FIG. 3 , the users of the social network get divided into more than two clusters corresponding to more than two behavioral categories associated with the online activity. In this example, the values representing the online activity are divided into three categories based on the clustering behavior of the values. Based on theseclusters threshold values - The statistical evaluation may evaluate the behavior characteristics and frequency of the behavior, then draw the lines that define the thresholds for each behavior to identify two or more categories (or clusters) of similar users, e.g., very active commenter or power user and moderate commenter or ordinary user. Generating behavioral categories may also depend on user-defined thresholds, in addition to the statistical evaluation. For example, users who have more than a certain number of shares in a social network may be identified as power users.
- In the context of a social networking application, a user's profile on the social network may be evaluated, along with sharing behavior to determine several attributes of the user. The user profile information may include, for example, the amount of information a user has filled on his or her profile and the audience (e.g., the public, a personal network, or an extended network) to which the user makes the profile information available. The profile data may also include any of the data listed in the user's profile as well as the user's settings for the social networking application. Other information that may be evaluated in this illustrative example, may be the amount of online sharing that occurs during a time period (e.g., posts, media types, comments, adding friends, and the like). The content of the sharing (e.g., media type, text length, etc.) and amount of incoming feedback (e.g., comments that a user receives) may also be considered in the evaluation.
- In one example, the statistical evaluation may also include determining whether the data distributions are appropriate (e.g., skewed, uniform, long-tailed, etc.) and the relationship between the individual variables. This information regarding the distributions may be utilized in evaluating the output during output processing, described below.
- Referring again to
FIG. 2 , data processing also includes associating each of the users with at least one of the determined behavioral categories (208). The association of a user with a behavioral category may be based on the set of values defining the one behavioral category and the user's activity log. In this manner, each user may be classified into at least one of the behavioral categories. - Output processing includes adjusting the content of the network utilizing the categorization information (210). Adjusting the content may include, for example, utilizing the categorization information to customize content for each user based on the category to which the user is assigned. For example, the system may present messages that encourage certain activities (e.g., posting or commenting) to users in a category associated with low activity or, for a user in a category associated with high activity of a certain type (e.g., posts or reposts), the system may present rank content in a user's information stream differently to encourage the user to share or repost certain content.
- In some examples, output processing may also include creating a visualization of the categorization of users and providing system administrators with statistics and characteristics of the users of the network. Using this information, system administrators may be able to develop more customized user experiences or design more appropriate features for users, for example. In some examples, visualization and tracking of user behavior may be done relatively in real-time, thus providing feedback and adjustments while the users may be online, for example.
- In some aspects, the system may also have access to user profiles and activities in other applications as well (e.g., an email application, an online media-sharing application, a content (e.g., news) delivery application, a search application, a mapping application, etc.). Additional measures may be taken to restrict access to user identity or other sensitive information in order to protect the users' privacy. Activities and behavior on these applications may also be monitored by the system and used to categorize users.
- Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium). When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
- In this specification, the term “software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software aspects of the subject disclosure can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- IV. Example Systems for Organizing Users in a Social Network
-
FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.Electronic system 400 can be a server, computer, phone, PDA, laptop, tablet computer, television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an electronic system includes various types of computer readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer readable media.Electronic system 400 includes abus 408, processing unit(s) 412, asystem memory 404, a read-only memory (ROM) 410, apermanent storage device 402, aninput device interface 414, anoutput device interface 406, and anetwork interface 416. -
Bus 408 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices ofelectronic system 400. For instance,bus 408 communicatively connects processing unit(s) 412 withROM 410,system memory 404,permanent storage device 402. - From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 412 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject disclosure. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different implementations.
-
ROM 410 stores static data and instructions that are needed by processing unit(s) 412 and other modules of the electronic system.Permanent storage device 402, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even whenelectronic system 400 is off Some implementations of the subject disclosure use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) aspermanent storage device 402. - Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as
permanent storage device 402. Likepermanent storage device 402,system memory 404 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlikestorage device 402,system memory 404 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such a random access memory.System memory 404 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored insystem memory 404,permanent storage device 402, and/orROM 410. For example, the various memory units include instructions for categorizing users in a social network according to various embodiments. From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 412 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations. -
Bus 408 also connects to input and output device interfaces 414 and 406.Input device interface 414 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used withinput device interface 414 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called “cursor control devices”). Output device interfaces 406 enables, for example, the display of images generated by theelectronic system 400. Output devices used withoutput device interface 406 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal displays (LCD). Some implementations include devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices. - Finally, as shown in
FIG. 4 ,bus 408 also coupleselectronic system 400 to a network (not shown) through anetwork interface 416. In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components of electronic system 500 can be used in conjunction with the subject disclosure. - These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
- Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
- While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself
- As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms “computer”, “server”, “processor”, and “memory” all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification, the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms “computer readable medium” and “computer readable media” are entirely restricted to tangible, physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude any wireless signals, wired download signals, and any other ephemeral signals.
- To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
