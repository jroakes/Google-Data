- FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram of a computing environment 100 according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a sentiment summarizing engine (the "sentiment summarizer") 110 and a data repository 112 connected to a network 114.
- a sentiment display engine 116 is also connected to the network 114.
- FIG. 1 illustrates only a single sentiment summarizer 110, embodiments can have multiple summarizers.
- the functions of the sentiment summarizer 110, sentiment display engine 116, and data repository are combined or rearranged in a different manner than is described here.
- the sentiment summarizer 110 provides summaries of sentiment about aspects of entities.
- An entity is a reviewable object or service.
- An aspect is a property of the entity that can be evaluated by a user. For example, if the entity is a restaurant the sentiment summarizer 110 can provide summaries of sentiment regarding aspects including the restaurant's food and service.
- the summary for an aspect can include a rating, e.g. three out of five stars or a letter grade, that concisely summarizes the sentiment.
- the summaries are based on source reviews gathered from web sites on the Internet and other locations.
- Static aspects are predefined aspects specific to particular types of entities.
- static aspects for a hotel can include location and service.
- Dynamic aspects are aspects that the sentiment summarizer 110 extracts from the source reviews during the summarization process.
- the dynamic aspects for a pizzeria can include "pizza,” “wine,” and "salad.”
- the data repository 112 stores documents and other data used by the sentiment summarizer 110 to summarize aspects of entities and by the sentiment display engine 116 to provide summaries.
- the data repository 112 stores a source reviews corpus 118 containing reviews expressing sentiment about various entities.
- the reviews are typically textual and unstructured in the sense that the reviews do not necessarily provide numeric or other concrete ratings for different aspects of the entities under review.
- the source reviews in the corpus 118 include user-provided and/or professional reviews gathered from web sites on the Internet. In one embodiment, each review is associated with a single entity, and this entity is determined based on the way the review is stored by the web site and/or based on a mention within the review.
- the source reviews can contain reviews of restaurants gathered from restaurant- specific web sites, reviews of hotels from hotel- and travel-specific web sites, and reviews of consumer electronic devices from techno logy- specific web sites. While this description focuses on only a few types of entities, e.g., restaurants and hotels, the source reviews can describe a wide variety of entities such as hair salons, schools, museums, retailers, auto shops, golf courses, etc.
- the source reviews corpus 118 also includes references to the network locations from which the source reviews were originally obtained.
- the data repository 112 includes an aspects database 120 that stores data describing the aspects of the reviewed entities that are summarized by the sentiment summarizer 110. As mentioned above, the aspects in the database 120 can include static and dynamic aspects.
- a sentiment summary storage 122 stores the sentiment summaries and related data produced by the sentiment summarizer 110.
- the sentiment summaries for a given entity include summaries of sentiment for the statically- and dynamically-determined aspects of the entity.
- the summaries include sentiment phrases from the source reviews corpus 118 on which the summaries are based. For example, if the entity is a restaurant and the aspect is "service,” the sentiment phrases can include "service was quite good” and "truly out service.”
- the sentiment phrases can be stored in the sentiment summary storage 122 or references to the phrases in the source review corpus 118 or on the network 114 can be stored.
- the sentiment display engine 116 provides the sentiment summaries stored in the data repository 112 to users, administrators, and other interested parties.
- the sentiment display engine 116 is associated with a search engine that receives queries about entities local to geographic regions.
- the search engine can receive a query seeking information about Japanese restaurants in New York, NY or about hotels in San Francisco, CA.
- the search engine provides the query and/or related information (such as a list of entities satisfying the query) to the sentiment display engine 116, and the sentiment display engine provides summaries of aspects of matching entities in return.
- the sentiment display engine 116 returns summaries of aspects of Japanese restaurants in the New York area.
- the summaries can include a star rating for each aspect, as well as relevant snippets of review text on which the summaries are based.
- the network 114 represents the communication pathways among the sentiment summarizer 110, data repository 112, sentiment display engine 116 and any other systems connected to the network.
- the network 114 is the Internet.
- the network 114 can also utilize dedicated or private communications links that are not necessarily part of the Internet.
- the network 114 uses standard communications technologies and/or protocols.
- the network 114 can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber line (DSL), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), etc.
- the networking protocols used on the network 114 can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), the file transfer protocol (FTP), the short message service (SMS) protocol, etc.
- MPLS multiprotocol label switching
- TCP/IP transmission control protocol/Internet protocol
- HTTP hypertext transport protocol
- SMTP simple mail transfer protocol
- FTP file transfer protocol
- SMS short message service
- the data exchanged over the network 114 can be represented using technologies and/or formats including the HTML, the extensible markup language (XML), the Extensible Hypertext markup Language (XHTML), the compact HTML (cHTML), etc.
- all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as the secure sockets layer (SSL), HTTP over SSL (HTTPS), and/or virtual private networks (VPNs).

- the modules are stored on the storage device 208, loaded into the memory 206, and executed by the processor 202.
- FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram illustrating modules within the sentiment summarizer 110 according to one embodiment. Other embodiments have different and/or additional modules than the ones shown in FIG. 3. Moreover, other embodiments distribute the functions among the modules in different manners.
- a sentiment classification module (the "sentiment classifier") 310 analyzes the reviews in the source review corpus 118 to find a set of syntactically coherent phrases which express sentiment about an entity being reviewed.
- a sentiment phrase can be a partial sentence, a complete sentence, or even more than a sentence.
- phrases extracted from reviews of an electronic device can include "very good sound quality," "This is my favorite pizzeria ever!,” and "Print quality was good even on ordinary paper.”
- Each review in the corpus 118 includes a body of text.
- the sentiment classifier 310 tokenizes the text of the reviews to produce a set of tokens. Each token is subject to part-of-speech (POS) tagging in order to associate the proper part of speech with the token.
- POS part-of-speech
- the sentiment classifier 310 tags the tokens using a probabilistic tagger and the following notation:
- Q is used to denote tokens representing punctuation or phrase-breaking markers.
- Y is used to denote tokens representing the pronoun "you.”
- M is used to denote tokens representing modal verbs (e.g., "can").
- A is used to denote tokens representing adjectives.
- R is used to denote tokens representing adverbs.
- N is used to denote tokens representing nouns.
- V is used to denote tokens representing verbs.
- O is used to denote tokens representing parts-of-speech that are other than the above listed parts-of-speech or unknown.
- the sentiment classifier 310 also processes the tokens comprising the reviews using a variety of natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming, word sense disambiguation and compound recognition.
- NLP natural language processing
- the sentiment classifier 310 uses a set of regular expression to extract sentiment phrases from the POS-tagged tokens in the reviews.
- the following regular expressions are given in standard regular expression notation.
- the second set of parentheses represents an example of the text that is extracted.
- the sentiment classifier 310 generates sentiment scores representing the polarity and magnitude of sentiment expressed by each of the extracted sentiment phrases.
- the sentiment classifier 310 uses a lexicon-based classifier to perform the scoring.
- the lexicon-based classifier is domain-independent and uses a sentiment lexicon derived from a lexical database, such as the WordNet electronic lexical database available from Princeton University of Princeton, NJ.
- An administrator selects initial n-grams for the sentiment lexicon by reviewing the lexical database and manually selecting and scoring seed n-grams (typically single words) expressing high sentiment of positive or negative magnitude. This seed set of n-grams is expanded through an automated process to include synonyms and antonyms referenced in the lexical database.
- an n-gram not in the seed set receives a sentiment score based on the scores of n-grams with which it bears a relationship.
- the sentiment lexicon is expanded by propagating scores from the seed set to other n-grams using a directed, edge-weighted semantic graph where neighboring nodes are synonyms or antonyms. N-grams in the graph that are positively adjacent to a large number of neighbors with similar sentiment get a boost in score. Thus, a word that is not a seed word, but is a neighbor to at least one seed word, will obtain a sentiment score similar to that of its adjacent seed words. This score propagates out to other n-grams.
- the administrator also supplies a set of neutral sentiment n- grams that are used to stop the propagation of sentiment.
- the neutral word “condition” may be a synonym of both "quality,” a generally positive word, and “disease” (as in “a medical condition”), a generally negative word.
- the sentiment classifier 310 uses the lexicon-based classifier to score the sentiment expressed by the sentiment phrases based on the n-grams within the phrases.
- Embodiments of the lexicon-based classifier score the sentiment expressed by a sentiment phase using techniques/factors including: the scores of n-grams in the lexicon found within the sentiment phrase; stemming (i.e., determining the roots of an n-gram in the sentiment phrase in order to match it with an n-gram in the lexicon); POS tagging (i.e., the POS of an n- gram within the sentiment phrase); negation detection; the n-gram based scores of any sentiment phrases found nearby in the document containing the sentiment phrase; and the user-supplied document level label (e.g., "5 stars") for the document containing the sentiment phrase, if any.
- the lexicon-based classifier score the sentiment expressed by a sentiment phase using techniques/factors including: the scores of n-grams in the lexicon found within the
- the sentiment score for each phrase is normalized to within a pre-established range.
- the sentiment scores can range from -1 for very negative sentiment to +1 for very positive sentiment.
- the sentiment classifier 310 performs domain-specific (i.e., entity type-specific) sentiment classification instead of, or in addition to, the domain-independent sentiment classification described above.
- An aspect module 312 identifies the aspects (also known as "features") that are relevant to the entity being reviewed.
- the aspects can include static aspects that are specific to the type (domain) of the entity, and also dynamic aspects that are specific to the entity itself.
- Static aspects tend to be coarse-grained aspects (e.g., "food” instead of "fries") that are common to all entities of the given type.
- Dynamic aspects tend to be fine-grained (e.g., "pizza” for a pizzeria).
- the aspects module 312 stores the static and dynamic aspects in the aspects database 120 in the data repository 112. Additionally, in one embodiment the aspects are added to a search index to allow a user to search for an individual aspect. For example, if an aspect is "hamburger,” the aspect is added to the index to allow searching for entities having the "hamburger” aspect.
- a static aspects module 314 is used to identify the static aspects.
- the static aspects are hand-selected.
- an administrator or other person identifies entity types of interest and selects aspects of interest for those entity types.
- the administrator can select aspects based on characteristics including the types of reviews and how the services provided by entities of the given type are used.
- the static aspects can also be identified by automatically culling the aspects from a large set of reviews for many entities of the same entity type , e.g. by finding the aspects mentioned most frequently in sentiment phrases across all restaurant reviews in the source reviews corpus 118.
- the entity types of interest are selected from among the most queried types in queries received by a search engine. As mentioned above, two commonly-searched entity types are restaurants and hotels.
- Selected static aspects for restaurants in one embodiment include food, decor, service, and value.
- Static aspects selected for hotels include rooms, location, dining, service, and value.
- Other types of entities have different static aspects.
- a dynamic aspects module 316 identifies the dynamic aspects for one or more entities. Aspects are dynamic in the sense that they are identified from the text of the source reviews of the entity. Dynamic aspects are especially useful for identifying unique aspects of entities where either the aspect, entity type, or both are too sparse to include as static aspects. For instance, reviewers of a given restaurant might rave about the "fish tacos," and the dynamic aspects module 316 will identify "fish tacos" as an aspect.
- dynamic aspects for an entity are determined by identifying the set of source reviews for the entity in the corpus 118.
- the dynamic aspects module 316 identifies short strings which appear with a high frequency in opinion statements in the reviews. Then, the dynamic aspects module 316 filters the strings in order to produce the set of dynamic aspects.
- an embodiment of the dynamic aspects module 316 identifies strings of one to three words (i.e., unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) that appear in the reviews (e.g., "fish tacos").
- the dynamic aspects module 316 employs the POS tagging and regular expression matching described above to identify strings containing nouns or noun compounds which represent possible opinion statements.
- the expression that identifies noun sequences following an adjective e.g., "great fish tacos” is beneficially used to identify strings containing candidate dynamic aspects.
- the dynamic aspects module 316 filters the identified strings to remove strings composed of stop words and other strings that appear with a high frequency in the source reviews corpus 118.
- the module 316 also filters out candidates which occur with low relative frequency within the set of input reviews.
- the dynamic aspects module 316 uses the sentiment lexicon to sum the overall weight of sentiment-bearing terms that appear in the strings containing candidate dynamic aspects, and filters out aspects which do not have sufficient mentions alongside known sentiment-bearing words.
- the module 316 collapses aspects at the word stem level, and ranks the aspects by a manually-tuned weighted sum of their frequency in the sentiment-bearing phrases described above. The higher ranked aspects are the dynamic aspects.
- a phrase-aspect association module 318 (the “association module”) associates the syntactically coherent sentiment phrases identified by the sentiment classifier 310 with the aspects identified by the aspect module 312.
- each aspect of an entity represents a possible "bucket" into which sentiment phrases from reviews of the entity may be classified.
- the association module 318 classifies each sentiment phrase into one or more of the buckets. In one embodiment, a phrase that is not classified into at least one of the static or dynamic aspects is classified within a catch-all "general comments" aspect.
- the association module 318 can use classifier-based techniques to associate the sentiment phrases with the aspects.
- a classifier is created by identifying a random set of phrases from a given domain (e.g., restaurant reviews) and labeling the phrases with the corresponding aspects that were mentioned.
- the set of phrases contains 1500 phrases which are manually labeled with one or more of the aspects. These labeled phrases are used to train a binary maximum entropy classifier for each aspect that predicts whether a phrase mentions that aspect.
- Some embodiments use additional techniques, such as active learning and semi-supervised learning to improve the classifications.
- some embodiments merge training sets for aspects that span multiple domains (e.g., "service” and "value” for restaurants and hotels) in order to further improve classification.
- the association module 318 uses the classifier- based techniques for only the static aspects.
- association module 318 can use string matching techniques to associate the sentiment phrases with the aspects.
- a phrase is associated with an aspect if the phrase mentions that aspect.
- the association module 318 uses natural language processing techniques to enhance the mappings between the n-grams in the sentiment phrases and the aspects. For example, the association module 318 can use stemming and synonym mapping to match the n-grams with the aspects.
- An aspect sentiment summary module (the "summary module") 320 summarizes the sentiment for aspects of an entity based on the sentiment phrases associated with the aspects. In one embodiment, the summary module 320 scores the sentiment expressed by each individual phrase assigned to an aspect using the techniques described above with respect to the domain-specific classifier.
- the summary module 320 uses the mean of the sentiment scores for the phrases as the summary sentiment score for the aspect.
- the module 320 maps the summary sentiment score to a rating (e.g., n out of 5 stars) for that aspect.
- the scores and/or ratings are stored within the sentiment summary storage 122 in the data repository 112.
- FIG. 4 is a high-level block diagram illustrating modules within the sentiment display engine 116 according to one embodiment. Other embodiments have different and/or additional modules than the ones shown in FIG. 4. Moreover, other embodiments distribute the functions among the modules in different manners.
- a request receipt module 410 receives a request to display sentiment associated with aspects of an entity. As described above, the request can be received in response to a search query issued by a user.
- An aspect selection module 412 selects the aspects to display in association with the entity. Generally, an entity has more aspects than it is desirable to display at once. Accordingly, the aspect selection module 412 selects the aspects that are most relevant to display in view of the request. In one embodiment, the aspect selection module 412 always selects the static aspects of an entity for display. For dynamic aspects, the module 412 selects the aspects based on the number of sentiment phrases from unique sources (e.g., from different user reviews of the entity). Aspects with phrases from more sources are favored.
- the aspect selection module 412 can also select aspects based on other factors, such as whether the aspect appears as a term within the search query.
- a phrase selection module 414 selects sentiment phrases to display in association with an aspect selected by the aspect selection module 412. In most cases there are more phrases associated with an aspect than it is desirable to display at once.
- the phrase selection module 414 selects a set of representative sentiment phrases for display. For example, if 90% of the sentiment phrases for an aspect are positive and 10% are negative, and there is room to display 10 phrases, the phrase selection module 414 selects nine positive phrases and one negative phrase.
- the phrase selection module 414 analyzes the sentiment phrases and selects phrases that are not redundant in view of other selected phrases. Some embodiments of the phrase selection module 414 use other criteria when selecting phrases. For example, in some situations it is desirable to show phrases that are associated with multiple aspects and the phrase selection module 414 thus favors phrases that relate to more than one aspect.
- a display generation module 416 generates a display illustrating the selected aspects and phrases for an entity.
- the display generation function is performed by a separate module, and the display generation module 416 within the sentiment display engine 116 provides the selected aspects and phrases to the other module.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by the sentiment summarizer
- the sentiment summarizer 110 identifies 510 a set of syntactically coherent phrases in source reviews which express sentiment about an entity.
- the sentiment summarizer 110 also identifies 512 reviewable aspects of the entity, including static and dynamic aspects, and associates 514 the sentiment phrases with the aspects.
- the sentiment summarizer 110 summarizes 514 the sentiment for each aspect expressed by the aspect's associated phrases.
- the summary can take the form of a score that is mapped to a rating such as a number of stars.
- the sentiment summarizer 110 stores the summaries.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by the sentiment display engine
- the sentiment display engine 116 receives 610 a request to display a sentiment summary for an entity.
- the engine 116 selects 612 the aspects to display based, for example, on the number of unique sources that provided sentiment phrases for the aspects and/or the terms in a search query associated with the request.
- the sentiment display engine 116 receives 610 a request to display a sentiment summary for an entity.
- the engine 116 selects 612 the aspects to display based, for example, on the number of unique sources that provided sentiment phrases for the aspects and/or the terms in a search query associated with the request.
- the sentiment display engine 116 receives 610 a request to display a sentiment summary for an entity.
- the engine 116 selects 612 the aspects to display based, for example, on the number of unique sources that provided sentiment phrases for the aspects and/or the terms in a search query associated with the request.
- the sentiment display engine 116 receives 610 a request to display a sentiment summary for an entity.
- the engine 116 selects 612 the aspects
- the sentiment display engine 116 selects 614 a representative sample of sentiment phrases to display for the selected aspects.
- the sentiment display engine 116 generates 616 a display of the selected aspects and phrases.
- FIG. 7 is a screenshot illustrating a display 700 of the selected aspects and sentiment phrases according to one embodiment.
- This display can be provided as a web page provided by a web site in response to a query.
- Different embodiments can provide different displays, and FIG. 7 is merely an example of one such display.
- the display 700 includes a portion 712 displaying the name of the entity being reviewed, which in this example is a restaurant named "Enoteca Pizza.” This portion also includes related information, such as the address and phone number of the entity, and a map showing the location of the entity.
- the display includes a set of hypertext links 714 that function as radio buttons and allow a viewer to select additional information about the entity for display. In this case, the "Reviews" link is selected.
- the display 700 also includes a portion 710 including columns respectively showing the selected aspects 716, associated ratings 718, and selected sentiment phrases 720 for the entity.
- a given row of this portion contains a single aspect, a rating for that aspect, and sentiment phrases expressing sentiment about the aspect.
- row 724 names the aspect "wine,” contains a star rating 726 representing a summary of the sentiment for the wine aspect, and contains a representative sample of sentiment phrases 728 describing the wine at the restaurant.
- the selected aspects shown in the display include static aspects (e.g., "food” and “service") and dynamic aspects (e.g., "pizza,” “wine,” and “gelato”).
- the sentiment phrases themselves are clickable links that can be selected to show the underlying review from which the phrases were selected.
- Some embodiments of the display 700 do not explicitly show the aspects.
- the display 700 can show a collection of sentiment phrases culled from a variety of aspects without explicitly showing the aspect with which each phrase is associated. Such a display is useful in situations where it is desirable to produce a compact display of the sentiment phrases, such as when the display is being provided to a mobile telephone with a small display.
- FIG. 8 is a partial screenshot illustrating a display 800 of selected aspects and sentiment phrases according to one embodiment.
- the display 800 of FIG. 8 generally corresponds to the portion 710 of FIG. 7 showing the selected aspects 716, associated ratings 718, and selected sentiment phrases 720 for an entity.
- Figure 8 displays aspects, ratings, and sentiment phrases associated with a color printer.
- the displayed aspects include "quality,” “printer,” “photo,” and “paper.”
- Figure 8 is distinctive in that the illustrated sentiment phrases are primarily sentences, rather than partial sentence phrases.
- one sentiment phrase 812 associated with the "quality” aspect is “Don't expect to get good quality two-sided prints either"
- Another sentiment phrase 814 associated with the "photo” aspect is "I encounter frequent mis-feeds and paper jams, especially with photo paper"
- Some of the sentences of the illustrated sentiment phrases are truncated in order to fit in the display 800.
- Other embodiments can display the full text of all or some of the sentences forming the sentiment phrases.
