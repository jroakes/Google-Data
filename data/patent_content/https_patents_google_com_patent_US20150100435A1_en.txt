- This specification relates to serving online content to consumers of products or services associated with the online content and, more particularly, to methods and systems for adjusting merchant bidding for serving online content to a consumer based on a merchant's inventory levels for a particular product or service offered for sale by the merchant.
- Internet publishers of publications may sell online content space (e.g., advertisement space on a web site) to merchants who wish to advertise online. Some publishers offer online content space at a fixed rate, while other publishers may offer online content space based on competitive bidding between multiple merchants. Some merchants purchase online content space for a particular product they offer for sale, and they may maintain an inventory of that product. Merchants must make decisions as to when they should advertise and/or how much they are willing to spend on advertising the sale of that product. The decision-making process may be performed without considering present inventory levels. Thus, the merchant may over-advertise or overspend on advertisements when their inventory levels for the product are restricted, or may under-advertise or underspend when their inventory levels for the product are high.
- online content space e.g., advertisement space on a web site
- a computer-implemented method for managing bids associated with serving an online content item for display to a consumer based on merchant inventory levels is provided.
- the method is implemented using a computing device in communication with a memory.
- the method includes receiving, in the memory, a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price.
- the method also includes receiving, by the computing device, a first inventory value associated with the product.
- the first inventory value represents the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory.
- the method further includes identifying a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value to the plurality of bidding levels.
- the current bidding level includes a current bid price.
- the method also includes selling an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price.
- the online content space is for displaying the online content item to the consumer.
- a computer system in another aspect, includes at least one processor and at least one memory comprising computer-executable instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to receive a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price.
- the computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to receive a first inventory value associated with the product. The first inventory value represents the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory.
- the computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to identify a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value and the plurality of bidding levels.
- the current bidding level includes a current bid price.
- the computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to sell an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price.
- the online content space is for displaying an online content item to the consumer.
- computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided.
- the computer-executable instructions When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to receive a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price.

- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable a content management system (“CMS”) to adjust merchant bids for serving online content, such as advertisements, based on inventory levels received from a merchant.
- Merchants i.e., content providers
- advertisement space i.e., online content space
- Advertisement spaces are filled with online content items (i.e., advertisements) when online content items are served with publications.
- the price that a particular merchant is willing to pay for advertisement space i.e., the merchant's “bid price” for advertisements
- the merchant's “bid price” for advertisements may be changed based on the merchant's actual inventory level of a product.
- the merchant configures the CMS with a plurality of bidding levels for a given product.
- Each bidding level includes an inventory quantity range for the product, as well as an associated bid price that the merchant is willing to pay for serving the online content to a user whenever the merchant's current inventory levels fall within that range. For example, the merchant may wish to pay a first bid price when their inventory level exceeds 10 units, but is only willing to pay a lesser price when their inventory levels are between 1 and 9 units. Further, the merchant may not wish to advertise at all when they have no inventory in the product, and thus may configure a zero bid price when their inventory level is at zero.
- the CMS provides or participates in auctions or other sales of online content space (i.e., the serving of advertisements by publishers). Merchants bid to have their advertisements presented with the online publications (i.e., served to users).
- the CMS retrieves either a static inventory level (such as a single value, perhaps updated on a daily or weekly basis by the merchant) or a dynamic inventory level (such as an automated data feed from a merchant's inventory system) from the merchant.
- the merchant's inventory level for the product is cross-referenced with the bidding levels to determine a bid price (i.e., the price that the merchant is currently willing to pay for serving content items for display to consumers based on their inventory levels).
- a merchant may provide a first bid price to the CMS for use when its inventory levels are at a sufficiently high number (i.e., a first inventory level), and may provide a second bid price that is less than the first bid price when its inventory levels are at a lower level (i.e., a second inventory level lower than the first inventory level).
- a first inventory level a sufficiently high number
- a second inventory level a second inventory level lower than the first inventory level
- the merchant may win a given auction/sale at the determined bid price (i.e., if the bid price is high enough to win the auction/sale), or the merchant may not win (i.e., if none of the auctions' prices are low enough to allow the merchant's bid price).
- bidding levels for serving of online content are adjusted based on the merchant's current inventory levels.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) receiving a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant, each bidding level including an inventory level and a bid price; (b) receiving a first inventory value associated with the product, the first inventory value representing the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory; (c) identifying a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value to the plurality of bidding levels, the current bidding level including a current bid price; (d) selling an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price, the online content space for displaying the online content item to the consumer; (e) submitting the current bid price during an auction for the online content space; (f) requesting an update to the first inventory value by the processor to the merchant; (g) receiving a plurality of bidding levels wherein
- the disclosure has general application to adjusting bids for online content items based on merchant inventory levels independently from, or in addition to, other factors that may influence bid levels.

The method includes receiving a plurality of bidding levels associated with a merchant's product. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price. The method also includes receiving, by the computing device, a first inventory value associated with the product. The first inventory value represents the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory. The method further includes identifying a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value to the plurality of bidding levels, the current bidding level including a current bid price. The method also includes selling an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price. The online content space is for displaying the online content item to the consumer.
Description
- This specification relates to serving online content to consumers of products or services associated with the online content and, more particularly, to methods and systems for adjusting merchant bidding for serving online content to a consumer based on a merchant's inventory levels for a particular product or service offered for sale by the merchant.
- Internet publishers of publications, such as websites, may sell online content space (e.g., advertisement space on a web site) to merchants who wish to advertise online. Some publishers offer online content space at a fixed rate, while other publishers may offer online content space based on competitive bidding between multiple merchants. Some merchants purchase online content space for a particular product they offer for sale, and they may maintain an inventory of that product. Merchants must make decisions as to when they should advertise and/or how much they are willing to spend on advertising the sale of that product. The decision-making process may be performed without considering present inventory levels. Thus, the merchant may over-advertise or overspend on advertisements when their inventory levels for the product are restricted, or may under-advertise or underspend when their inventory levels for the product are high.
- In one aspect, a computer-implemented method for managing bids associated with serving an online content item for display to a consumer based on merchant inventory levels is provided. The method is implemented using a computing device in communication with a memory. The method includes receiving, in the memory, a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price. The method also includes receiving, by the computing device, a first inventory value associated with the product. The first inventory value represents the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory. The method further includes identifying a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value to the plurality of bidding levels. The current bidding level includes a current bid price. The method also includes selling an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price. The online content space is for displaying the online content item to the consumer.
- In another aspect, a computer system is provided. The computer system includes at least one processor and at least one memory comprising computer-executable instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to receive a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to receive a first inventory value associated with the product. The first inventory value represents the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to identify a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value and the plurality of bidding levels. The current bidding level includes a current bid price. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to sell an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price. The online content space is for displaying an online content item to the consumer.
- In yet another aspect, computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided. When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to receive a plurality of bidding levels associated with a product of a merchant. Each bidding level includes an inventory level and a bid price. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to receive a first inventory value associated with the product. The first inventory value represents the quantity of the product that the merchant has in inventory. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to identify a current bidding level from the plurality of bidding levels based at least in part on comparing the first inventory value and the plurality of bidding levels. The current bidding level includes a current bid price. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to sell an online content space to the merchant at the identified current bid price. The online content space is for displaying the online content item to the consumer.

- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable a content management system (“CMS”) to adjust merchant bids for serving online content, such as advertisements, based on inventory levels received from a merchant. Merchants (i.e., content providers) purchase advertisement space (i.e., online content space) from publishers on the Internet, or other computer-based networked environments. These advertisement spaces are filled with online content items (i.e., advertisements) when online content items are served with publications. In the example embodiments described herein, the price that a particular merchant is willing to pay for advertisement space (i.e., the merchant's “bid price” for advertisements) may be changed based on the merchant's actual inventory level of a product.
- In one embodiment, the merchant configures the CMS with a plurality of bidding levels for a given product. Each bidding level includes an inventory quantity range for the product, as well as an associated bid price that the merchant is willing to pay for serving the online content to a user whenever the merchant's current inventory levels fall within that range. For example, the merchant may wish to pay a first bid price when their inventory level exceeds 10 units, but is only willing to pay a lesser price when their inventory levels are between 1 and 9 units. Further, the merchant may not wish to advertise at all when they have no inventory in the product, and thus may configure a zero bid price when their inventory level is at zero.
- During operation, the CMS provides or participates in auctions or other sales of online content space (i.e., the serving of advertisements by publishers). Merchants bid to have their advertisements presented with the online publications (i.e., served to users). The CMS retrieves either a static inventory level (such as a single value, perhaps updated on a daily or weekly basis by the merchant) or a dynamic inventory level (such as an automated data feed from a merchant's inventory system) from the merchant. The merchant's inventory level for the product is cross-referenced with the bidding levels to determine a bid price (i.e., the price that the merchant is currently willing to pay for serving content items for display to consumers based on their inventory levels). For example, a merchant may provide a first bid price to the CMS for use when its inventory levels are at a sufficiently high number (i.e., a first inventory level), and may provide a second bid price that is less than the first bid price when its inventory levels are at a lower level (i.e., a second inventory level lower than the first inventory level). Once the CMS determines the merchant's bid price (based on the inventory level), the CMS uses that bid price during auctioning and/or sales of online content space. Subsequently, the merchant may win a given auction/sale at the determined bid price (i.e., if the bid price is high enough to win the auction/sale), or the merchant may not win (i.e., if none of the auctions' prices are low enough to allow the merchant's bid price). As such, bidding levels for serving of online content are adjusted based on the merchant's current inventory levels.

TheCMS 106 can use thebackend processing systems 118 and thecontent serving system 120 to selectively recommend and provide relevant content from thecontent providers 102 through thepublishers 104 to the user access devices 108. - The
CMS 106 may include or access one or more crawling, indexing and searching modules (not shown). These modules may browse accessible resources (e.g., the World Wide Web, publisher content, data feeds, etc.) to identify, index and store information. The modules may browse information and create copies of the browsed information for subsequent processing. The modules may also check links, validate code, harvest information, and/or perform other maintenance or other tasks. - Searching modules may search information from various resources, such as the World Wide Web, publications, intranets, newsgroups, databases, and/or directories. The search modules may employ one or more known search or other processes to search data. In some implementations, the search modules may index crawled content and/or content received from data feeds to build one or more search indices. The search indices may be used to facilitate rapid retrieval of information relevant to a search query. Searching modules may also store search results including one or more of search query terms, search results elements, and ads impressions served.
- The
CMS 106 may include one or more interface or frontend modules for providing the various features to content providers, publishers, and user access devices. For example, theCMS 106 may provide one or more publisher front-end interfaces (PFEs) for allowing publishers to interact with theCMS 106. TheCMS 106 may also provide one or more content provider front-end interfaces (CPFEs) for allowing content providers to interact with theCMS 106. In some examples, the front-end interfaces may be configured as web applications that provide users with network access to features available in theCMS 106. - The
CMS 106 provides various content management features to thecontent providers 102. TheCMS 106 features may allow users to set up user accounts, set account preferences, create content, select keywords for content, create campaigns or initiatives for multiple products or businesses, view reports associated with accounts, analyze costs and return on investment, selectively identify customers in different regions, selectively recommend and provide content to particular publishers, analyze financial information, analyze content performance, estimate content traffic, access keyword tools, add graphics and animations to content, and configure bidding levels and inventory retrieval as described herein. - The
CMS 106 may allow thecontent providers 102 to create content and input keywords for which the content will appear. In some examples, theCMS 106 may provide content to user access devices or publishers when keywords associated with that content are included in a user request or a requested publication. TheCMS 106 may also allow thecontent providers 102 to set bids for content. A bid may represent the maximum amount a content provider is willing to pay for each content impression, user click-through of content or other interaction with content. A click-through can include any action a user takes to select content. Thecontent providers 102 may also choose a currency and monthly budget. - The
CMS 106 may also allow thecontent providers 102 to view information about content impressions, which may be maintained by theCMS 106. TheCMS 106 may be configured to determine and maintain the number of content impressions relative to a particular website or keyword. TheCMS 106 may also determine and maintain the number of click-trough's for content as well as the ratio of click-trough's to impressions. - The
CMS 106 may also allow thecontent providers 102 to select and/or create conversion types for content. A “conversion” may occur when a user consummates a transaction related to given content. A conversion could be defined to occur when a user clicks on content, for example a specific content item, is referred to the content provider's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. In another example, a conversion could be defined as the display of content to a user and a corresponding purchase on the content provider's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days). TheCMS 106 may store conversion data and other information in aconversion data repository 136. - The
CMS 106 may allow thecontent providers 102 to input description information associated with content. This information could be used to assist thepublishers 104 in determining content to publish. Thecontent providers 102 may additionally input a cost/value associated with selected conversion types, such as a five dollar credit to thepublishers 104 for each product or service purchased. - The
CMS 106 may provide various features to thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 may deliver content (associated with the content providers 102) to the user access devices 108 when users access publications from thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 can be configured to deliver content that is relevant to publisher sites, publications, and publisher audiences. - In some examples, the
CMS 106 may crawl publications provided by thepublishers 104 and deliver content that is relevant to publisher sites, publications and publisher audiences based on the crawled publications. TheCMS 106 may also selectively recommend and/or provide content based on user information and behavior, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website. TheCMS 106 may store such information in ageneral database 146. In some examples, theCMS 106 can add search to a publisher site and deliver content configured to provide appropriate and relevant content relative to search results generated by requests from visitors of the publisher site. A combination of these and other approaches can be used to deliver relevant content. - The
CMS 106 may allow thepublishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated content to be displayed with publications provided by thepublishers 104. For example, thepublishers 104 may search through content in thecontent repository 126 and select certain content for display with their publications. - The
CMS 106 may be configured to selectively recommend and provide content created by thecontent providers 102 to the user access devices 108 directly or through thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide content to a particular publisher 104 (as described in further detail herein) or a requesting user access device 108 when a user requests search results or loads a publication from thepublisher 104. - In some implementations, the
CMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in theenvironment 100. For example, theCMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of thecontent providers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by theCMS 106. - “Computing devices”, for example user access devices 108, may include any devices capable of receiving information from the
network 110. The user access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks.

FIG. 3 is a diagram 300 illustrating data flow between a content management system (CMS) 320 and amerchant 310, and using one or more computing devices 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ). In some embodiments,CMS 320 may be similar to CMS 106 (shown inFIG. 1 ). In the example embodiment, themerchant 310, such as “Merchant ABC”, offers aproduct 314 for sale. Themerchant 310 advertises theproduct 314 online through theCMS 320, which auctions advertisement space (i.e., online content space) to one or more merchants, and provides the advertisements (i.e., the online content items) to publishers 104 (shown inFIG. 1 ) for presentation to online users (i.e., potential consumers of product 314). - In the example embodiment, an
administrator 304 communicates withCMS 320 and configures theCMS 320 with a plurality ofbidding levels 322 associated with theproduct 314. In some embodiments, theadministrator 304 is themerchant 310. In other embodiments, theadministrator 304 is associated with theCMS 320. Eachbidding level 322 includes aninventory level 324 and abid price 326. Theinventory level 324 represents a quantity of units of a product, such asproduct 314, and may be a single value (e.g., “0”), a range of values (e.g., “1-9” and “10-19”), or an open-ended range (e.g., “20+”). Thebid price 326 represents an amount that themerchant 310 is willing to pay for an online content item (not shown inFIG. 3 ) if theirinventory value 316 satisfies the associatedinventory level 324. In the example embodiment, only onebid price 326 for aparticular inventory level 324 is configured. Alternatively,additional bid prices 326 may be configured for eachinventory level 324. For example,CMS 320 may allowmerchants 310 to set different bidding levels for different types of online content items, such as “ad impressions”, or “conversions”, or other categorizations of online content items. In some embodiments, each bidding level further includes a timeframe in which the bidding level is active. As such, theCMS 320 may allowmultiple bid prices 326 for eachinventory level 324, or theCMS 320 may allow amerchant 310 to configure several pluralities ofbidding levels 322, each for a different type of online content. - In the example embodiment, the
merchant 310 maintains aninventory management system 312, which tracks aninventory value 316 of theproduct 314 automatically. Theinventory value 316 represents how many units of the product 314 (i.e., a quantity of the product) that the merchant holds in inventory. In other embodiments, themerchant 310 provides aninventory value 316 for theproduct 314 manually, such as by an employee updating their inventory level forproduct 314 on a periodic basis. In the example embodiment, theCMS 320 is communicatively coupled to theinventory management system 312 such that theCMS 320 may request and/or receive updated values ofinventory level 316 forproduct 314. In other embodiments, anadministrator 304 may use acomputing device 302 to manually update theinventory level 316 of themerchant 310 or manually transmit theinventory level 316 to theCMS 320. - During configuration, an
administrator 304, such as themerchant 310, configures the plurality ofbidding levels 322 within theCMS 320. More specifically, for a givenproduct 314 that themerchant 310 is selling (and advertising), theadministrator 304 configures a plurality ofinventory levels 324 that define a value or range of values. For eachinventory level 324, theadministrator 304 also configures abid price 326 that defines the amount that themerchant 310 is willing to bid for online content items. As such, themerchant 310 is able to configure and control the amount that themerchant 310 bids on auctions for online content items based at least in part on a fluctuating inventory level. -
FIG. 4 is another diagram 400 illustrating data flow betweenCMS 320 and amerchant 310, and using one or more computing devices 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ). In some embodiments,CMS 320 may be similar to CMS 106 (shown inFIG. 1 ). In the example embodiment,merchant 310 participates in an online auction for anonline content space 410, such as an advertisement space through a publisher such as publisher 104 (shown inFIG. 1 ). It should be understood, however, that while some of the embodiments described herein depict the context of auctioning online content spaces to a plurality of merchants, other types of sales transactions for online content spaces are within the context of this disclosure. For example,CMS 320 may provide an offer-and-acceptance style transaction betweenmerchant 310 and publisher 104 (shown inFIG. 1 ), where the determined bid price (based on merchant's 310 inventory value 316) represents the price themerchant 310 is willing to pay, and either thepublisher 104 is willing to accept, or is not. - During operation, in the example auctioning embodiment depicted in
FIG. 4 , an auction for theonline content space 410 is conducted byCMS 320.Merchant 310 has an advertisement for theproduct 314, and desires participation in bidding for online advertisements. The merchant's 310 participation in the auction may be governed by several factors. In the example embodiment, the merchant's 310inventory level 316 for theproduct 314 is one factor.CMS 320 identifies theinventory value 316 associated with theproduct 314. TheCMS 320 may request an updated value from the merchant 310 (i.e., the CMS pulls the value from the merchant), or themerchant 310 may periodically update theCMS 320 with a current inventory value 316 (i.e., the merchant pushes the value to the CMS). - With the updated
inventory value 316, theCMS 320 cross-references theinventory value 316 with the plurality of inventory levels 324 (i.e., from the plurality of bidding levels 322) to determine acorresponding bid price 326. During the auction for online content space, the merchant participates in the auction using this determinedbid price 326. In other words, thedetermined bid price 326 is submitted as Merchant ABC'sbid 420. Further, other merchants may also submitbids 430 for the sameonline content space 410, which may compete against merchant ABC'sbid 420. - For example, consider a plurality of merchants participating in an auction for a single ad impression (i.e., an online content item that will be displayed to an online user in the online content space 410). Presume “Merchant ABC” 310 has a first product for sale, such as
product 314, and that product's current inventory value is 12. Prior to or during the auction, theCMS 320 queries merchant's 310inventory management system 312 and retrieves theinventory value 312 for the product 314 (e.g., “12”). TheCMS 320 determines how much themerchant 310 is willing to bid during this auction by referencing the plurality ofbidding levels 322 to determine whatbid price 326 correlates to thecurrent inventory level 324 of 12. TheCMS 320 determines thatmerchant 310 is willing to bid “$0.15” for online content space in which they will advertiseproduct 314. As such, during the auction with the other merchants, abid price 326 of “$0.15” is submitted on behalf ofmerchant 310. Ifmerchant 310 wins the auction, then themerchant 310 will pay thebid price 326 for the online content space. - During later auctions, merchant's 310 inventory level may have fluctuated. Presume that another auction occurs later, for another online content space similar to
content space 410. TheCMS 320 may re-query merchant's 310inventory value 316 and find that the inventory quantity is now “8” (i.e., the merchant's quantity has changed since the above-described auction, such as through intervening sales of product 314). For this auction, theCMS 320 cross-references the merchant's 310 current inventory value 316 (i.e., “8”) against the plurality ofbidding levels 322 to identify abid price 326 of “$0.10”. Accordingly,CMS 320 submits merchant ABC'sbid 420 as “$0.10” for this auction. - In some embodiments, the system may dynamically alter the bidding levels for a given
merchant 310. Historical inventory levels may be examined over time for a merchant'sproduct 314, andinventory levels 324 and/orbid prices 326 may be altered based on historical inventory quantities, conversion rates, or other data available toCMS 106. Further, themerchant 310 may provide an advertising budget associated with theproduct 314, and theinventory levels 324 and/or associatedprices 326 may be altered by theCMS 320 based on the advertising budget. As such, merchant bids 420 may be dynamically altered by theCMS 106. - As such, the example embodiment facilitates a user-customizable, tiered set of bidding levels for online content space based primarily on an inventory level of a product. The integration between the
CMS 320 and themerchant inventory system 312 facilitates a dynamic system that auto-adjusts bids based on current inventory levels. The merchant configures how much they are willing to pay based on how much inventory they happen to have at the time. In some situations, a merchant may desire to pay more when their inventory is higher, or may desire to pay less when their inventory is lower. It should be understood that, while the example system described herein discuss inventory level as the only factor for adjusting bidding amounts for online content items, other factors may also influence the bidding without departing from the subject matter of this disclosure. -
