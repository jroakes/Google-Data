Embodiment
Fig. 1 shows example answer frame and presents system 102.Answer frame and present the part that system 102 is search engine systems.Search engine system uses the answer frame to present system 102 with the content of acquisition for answer frame 104, and presents said answer frame 104 to user 106 then.Answer frame and present system 102 in user's 106 input texts input 107 and before user 106 submits the searching request for said text input 107, carry out all these.Even when said input 107 is not complementary with the specific complete phrase that is associated with said answer frame 104, answer frame present system 102 also can chosen content and present said answer frame 104.
It is mutual that user 106 and answer frame present system 102, for example the search engine user interface through on subscriber equipment, appearing.Search engine user interface can be search and webpage or Application Program Interface.Exemplary user equipment comprises computing machine and mobile device.Search engine user interface comprises the wherein inquiry input field of user input text input 107, and the user can use to submit the mechanism of searching request.The inquiry input field for example can be in the search-engine web page field, operate in field in the tool bar in user's the web browser, or operate in the field in the search for application on the subscriber equipment.User 106 can use said mechanism to submit the searching request for the text input; For example through pushing search button in the search engine user interface, push " input " button in the inquiry input field, or show that otherwise user 106 has accomplished the input to input, and search engine will be made response to the input in the inquiry input field and discern Search Results.Search engine user interface can further present the for example information of query suggestion, answer frame and Search Results to said user 106.
The answer frame presents system 102 and comprises input processor 108, answers frame acquisition device 110 and present engine 112.These software parts can perhaps upward operation of one or more server (for example, being connected to the search engine server of subscriber equipment through network) on subscriber equipment.
Input processor 108 receives text input 107.For example, text input 107 can be the text input of in the search engine inquiry input field, being imported by user 106, and perhaps text input 107 can be the text that generates according to the phonetic entry that receives from the user.Input processor 108 receives input 107, and determines whether that should said input be sent to the answer frame obtains device 110.Input processor 108 can verify that user 106 does not also submit searching request; For example the user does not also use the mechanism in the said search user interface; Perhaps any other mechanism shows that to send to said search engine said user has accomplished the input that should make response identification Search Results to the input in the said inquiry input field to the input and the said search engine of input.Input processor 108 it is also conceivable that other factors, for example text input whether have minimum number character, or imported the time of whether having passed through scheduled volume since the last character of text input 107 since user 106.
Should obtain device 110 transmission inputs 107 to answering frame in case input processor 108 has been verified, input processor 108 obtains device 110 to the answer frame and sends said input 107.Answer frame and obtain the content that device 110 obtains for answer frame 104 for said input 107.With reference to Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 answer frame acquisition device 110 is described in further detail below.
Present engine 112 and obtain the content that device 110 receives for answer frame 104, and it is presented to user 106, for example be used for appearing in search engine user interface through data from frame 104 to subscriber equipment transmission representative that answer from answering frame.Except selected answer frame 104, present engine and can send other data.For example, present the output that engine can receive group polling suggestion, generate the answer frame 104 of the tabulation that comprises query suggestion and selection, and send to subscriber equipment and to represent the data of this output to be used for appearing to user 106.Present engine 112 and can generate query suggestion engine reception query suggestion from for example using conventional art for the query suggestion of input 107.Subscriber equipment can be for example in the pull-down menu that is arranged in below the search engine user interface search engine inquiry input field, present said suggestion and answer frame 104.Even the user does not also have input to show that said user wants the input that presents said query suggestion or answer frame 104, also can present said suggestion and answer frame 104.Subscriber equipment can alternatively use other configurations that are used for appearing to user 106 output.Describing example answer frame with reference to Fig. 6 A-6O below appears.
Fig. 2 shows example and answers frame acquisition device 202.It is examples that the top answer frame of describing with reference to Fig. 1 obtains device 110 that example is answered frame acquisition device 202.
Answer frame acquisition device 202 and comprise mainly (dominant) query engine 204 and correlation engine 206.Answer frame and obtain main query engine 204 derivations of device 202 uses and input 107 corresponding main inquiries, and use the content of correlation engine 206 acquisitions for the answer frame 104 that is associated with said main inquiry.Although following example has been described the single main inquiry of deriving; But can derive for a plurality of main inquiry of input; And can obtain the content for a plurality of answer frames 104, each is answered in frame 104 and the said main inquiry 208 one or more and is associated.
Main inquiry 208 is and input 107 corresponding inquiries.Main inquiry 208 can be that input 107 is own, perhaps can be different with input 107.Main inquiry 208 can be the complete form of input 107.For example, are " weather San Fr " if import 107, then mainly inquiring about 208 can be " weather San Francisco ".Main inquiry 208 also can be the modification of input 107.For example, are " wetaher San Francisco " if import 107, then main inquiry can be " weather San Francisco ", thereby has revised the misspellings of " weather ".Modification that main inquiry 208 also can be input 107 and complete form the two.For example, are " wetather San Fr " if import 107, then mainly inquiring about 208 can be " weather San Francisco ".Main inquiry 208 also can be the inquiry relevant with input 107.For example, mainly inquiring about 208 can be for the query suggestion of importing 107.As another example; Be complementary with the particular category key word or the regular expression that are associated in input with the answer frame; But when not comprising enough information with triggering particular answer frame; Main inquiry 208 can be the part of the input that is complementary with said key word or regular expression, adds the complete form of the remainder of the above input 107.For example; If importing 107 is " weather San "; And key word " weather " is answered frame with weather and is associated, and then system can inquire about 208 through making combined the generation mainly of the key word " weather " and the complete form of the remainder of input " San ".The technology that can use being used to of describing below to generate main inquiry generates said complete form.
Submit for the number of times of the search of query suggestion according to one or more user and to derive for the popularity value of given query suggestion.For example, said popular value can be that one or more user submits for the number of times of the search of said query suggestion and submits the value for the total degree of the inquiry of each query suggestion divided by said one or more user, for example:
Wherein inquiring about x is the calculated query suggestion of its popular value, and each inquiry i is the inquiry that is arranged in the group of said query suggestion.Said one or more user can for example be exactly the user who imports said input 107, perhaps bigger group of the user.
Also can use other formula to be used for confirming popular value.For example, main query engine 204 can be alternatively quality measured values through each inquiry the number of times that the user submits each inquiry is carried out weighting.Said quality measured values can be for example according to the user after sending its inquiry, select number of times, the user of searching structure to spend how long to browse to its inquiry make response Search Results, its inquiry of user's refinement frequent degree and user and whether carry out alternately its inquiry being made other characteristics that respond the result of page searching that appears.As another example, the denominator in the popular value can be the number of times with the inquiry that begins with said input that the user submits.
In case main query engine 204 has been confirmed the popularity value for each query suggestion, the query suggestion that main query engine 204 is just selected to have the popularity value that exceeds threshold value is as main inquiry.Example threshold comprises 50%, 66% and 75%.Can rule of thumb confirm threshold value.For example, threshold value confirms that system can be through testing various threshold values and confirming whether they cause the expected behavior of said system to confirm appropriate threshold.Said threshold value confirms that system can be for example explicitly shows that whether they find that the answer frame that is appeared is useful, or will find to answer frame useful human evaluator, confirm whether the behavior of said system is the behavior of expecting through using.As another example, said system can measure the user and show that indirectly they find the useful number of times of answer frame that is appeared.The user can be for example browse for a long time through answer frame, the cost selecting appear for text input 107 and answers frame, clicks the link of answering in the frame, or do not submit any additional searching after answering frame having, and comes to show indirectly that they find that the answer frame that is appeared is useful.
Threshold value confirms that system can make various modification to top scheme.For example, threshold value confirms that system only can confirm the threshold value for fuzzy input, and then with this threshold application to not too fuzzy input.Fuzzy input is the input that can trigger several different main inquiries, for example can trigger " weather San Jose ", " weather San Francisco ", " weather Santa Fe " or the like " weather San ".As another example, threshold value confirms that system can confirm the different threshold values for the particular category of answering frame.Threshold value confirms that system can select to select the loose threshold value score that reduces gradually for each classification of answering frame, up to for the acceptable threshold value of each class discovery.This allows threshold value to confirm that system makes said threshold value loose as far as possible for each inquiry.
In some were realized, said threshold value was user's appointment.For example, if the user frequently triggers the answer frame of particular category, perhaps have and show the answer frame interested profile data of this user to particular category, then this threshold value can be looser for the answer frame and the user of special classification.Threshold value also can be specific to user's classification, and for example user or its search history specific to the same position place shows that they share the user of search interest.User's search history can show that the user shares search interest, for example when search history has the number of thresholds more than inquiry jointly.
In other are realized, to have imported after 107 the user, but before the user submits search inquiry, the answer frame presents system 102 and presents query suggestion to the user.In these are realized, mainly inquire about 208 be the user for example through will being placed on the query suggestion top such as the cursor of keyboard cursor or cursor of mouse, and show the inquiry in the group of interested query suggestion, rather than explicitly is clicked query suggestion.In these are realized, main query engine 204 receive show subscriber's meter clear one input in the interested query suggestion, and then this query suggestion is identified as main inquiry.
One realizing that mainly inquiring about 208 is the most frequent inquiries of appearance in the inquiry that the text to be complementary with input 107 that the user sends begins.In these were realized, main query engine 204 was for the customer analysis user search historical data of the said input 107 of input, one or more inquiry that begins with the text to be complementary with said input 107 of finding that the user before submitted.If text is 107 identical with input, then text is complementary with input 107, and is perhaps different with input 107, for example definite through search engine system aspect unessential.In text and input 107 when identical, except use, spelling, word order or the synon replacement that stops word, text aspect unessential with to import 107 different.For example; If import 107 be " weather San " perhaps " wehather San " and user's prior searches " weather San Francisco ", " weather San Jose ", " the weather Santa Fe " and " weather Mountain View ", then document query engine 204 identifications " weather San Francisco ", " weather San Jose " and " weather Santa Fe " are as inquiring about.Main query engine 204 is ignored " weather Mountain View ", because it is not similarly to import beginning with " weather San ".Main query engine 204 is selected inquiry with the occurrence number that satisfies threshold value then.
Threshold value can be the pre-determined number that occurs.Alternatively, threshold value can be confirmed according to the total degree of submitting inquiry.For example, threshold value can be 50 percent of the inquiry of being submitted.For example, if user search " weather San Francisco " ten times, " weather San Jose " five times and " the weather Santa Fe " are once, threshold value be this inquiry of user search number of times 50 percent, then threshold value is eight.Main query engine 204 selects " weather San Francisco " as mainly inquiry, because it is submitted ten times, and ten greater than threshold value eight.Main query engine 204 can carry out weighting through the number of times of being submitted from each inquiry to the number of times that each inquiry occurs alternatively, and low weight gives older inquiry.
In other were realized, mainly inquiring about 208 was inquiries that the user frequently submits, and irrelevant with input 107.For example, comprise this character string of ineffective law, rule, etc. as input 107 o'clock in the inquiry field, the user can click the inquiry input field.Main query engine 204 is the analysis user search history then, submits the most frequent inquiry with the identification user, and selects one of them as main inquiry.For example, main query engine 204 can select to occur at least the inquiry of threshold number in search history.Can rule of thumb confirm threshold value.
In other were realized, mainly inquiring about 208 was the frequently inquiries of the answer frame of the classification of triggering of inquiry of being sent by the user triggering.Main query engine 204 can confirm that the user has frequently triggered the given classification of answering frame, and the inquiry number percent of the answer frame of the given classification of for example submitting the user of triggering is confirmed than by the big threshold quantity of inquiry number percent of the answer frame of user's the bigger group of given classification of submitting of triggering the time.Alternatively, main query engine 204 can check inquiry than group, for example share inquiry through the pattern of input coupling.For example, when input comprised the city title, main query engine 204 can calculate the number percent of the inquiry that comprises the city title.In these were realized, main query engine 204 was for the customer analysis user search historical data of the said input 107 of input, with the classification of the answer frame of the previous querying triggering confirming to be submitted by the user.For example, if the user frequently searches for " weather " and various cities title, then main query engine 204 identification users frequently submit and cause appearing the search inquiry that weather is answered frame.Therefore, are city title " San Jose " if import 107, then query engine 204 can be discerned main inquiry for " San Jose weather ".As another example; If the user frequently submits to trigger the inquiry of answering frame about the finance and economics of the financial information of each B shareB is provided; And the user imports the input 107 of identification stock; Then main query engine 204 can be discerned main inquiry for the title that " financial information " adds stock, perhaps will trigger some other inquiries that financial information is answered frame similarly.
One realizing again, mainly inquiring about 208 and be and the optimal inquiry of user profile data.User profile data can be the explicit data by user's input, and can for example comprise user's position, language, time zone and preference.User profile data also can be the hidden data of confirming as required, for example through locate the user's who confirms position to the user's IP address applied geography.In these were realized, main query engine 204 was handled said input, whether had lacked the item or the character that will trigger the particular category of answering frame to confirm said input.If said input has lacked the item or the character that will trigger the particular category of answering frame, then main query engine 204 can use profile data to comprise the item of disappearance or the main inquiry of character with generation.
In some were realized, main query engine 204 was handled said input to confirm whether said input possibly lack the position.For example, if said input begins with " weath ", then main query engine 204 can confirm that the user possibly be that request weather is answered frame.Main query engine 204 can be through matching said input with key word or regular expression, and confirm that what inquiry has lacked the position.In such realization; Main query engine 204 is kept the key word that needs positional information or the tabulation of regular expression; To be associated with the answer frame; But when definite input is complementary with key word or regular expression and does not have the position, and adds said position from the user profile data for this user to said input then.
In some were realized, main query engine 204 analysis of user profile possibly asked the answer frame of particular category to confirm input, and selection will trigger the main inquiry of the answer frame of this ad hoc inquiry.For example; If input is a stock symbol; And user's profile data comprises the data that show the several stocks of this usertracking, and then main query engine 204 can confirm that the user is interested in the Financial Information, and selects will cause appearing the main inquiry of answering frame for the Financial Information of stock.Alternatively; If input is a stock symbol; And user's profile data comprises the data of the stock that shows that this usertracking is discerned in input, and then main query engine 204 can confirm that the user is interested in the financial details of designated speculative stock, and therefore presents this Financial Information.The user can for example pass through in his or her profile, to add the designated speculative stock symbol, and requires the system of this profile of management to follow the tracks of this stock for the user provides stock more to newly arrive then.
The example of other user profiles comprises film that the user watches and user's Preferred Language.For example,, the user watches if having stored the film of a series of films of current broadcast in its profile, and user's key entry " showtimes ", then main query engine 204 can be discerned the main inquiry that comprises this series title.As another example; If the user has imported the inquiry with " translate " beginning; And have the phrase with the language different with user's Preferred Language, then main query engine 204 can generate the main inquiry that request is translated as this phrase user's Preferred Language.
In other are realized, can use one or more the above-mentioned inspiration and the combination of technology.For example, main query engine 204 can be selected main inquiry 208 according to query suggestion with for the analysis of the user's of the said input 107 of input user search historical data.Main query engine 204 can filter out in the user search historical data not to be had the query suggestion more than threshold number to occur, perhaps can how to appear at the popular score of regulating in the user search historical data for above-mentioned query suggestion continually through query suggestion.
As another example, correlation engine 206 can confirm that main inquiry 208 is complementary with regular expression, perhaps comprises one or more key word that is associated with particular answer frame 104, and selects then to answer frame 104.In some were realized, correlation engine 206 can require main inquiry 208 and input 107 the two and regular expression to be complementary, and perhaps comprises one or more key word that is associated with particular answer frame 104.For example; If definition is answered frame and is associated with the pattern of following one or more word " definition "; Then selecting definition to answer before frame is used for main inquiry 208, correlation engine 206 can require: input 107 comprises word " definition " and mainly inquires about 208 and comprises the word " definition " of following one or more word.In some are realized, before selecting to answer frame 104, correlation engine 206 can require following both: mainly inquire about 208 with mainly inquire about 208 for this and be considered to another inquiry of being associated with identical answer frame 104.For example, if from the group of query suggestion, select main inquiry 208, then before selecting to answer frame 104, correlation engine 206 can confirm in main inquiry 208 and other query suggestion one this two all with answer frame 104 and be associated.
If discern a plurality of main inquiries 208, then correlation engine 206 can be selected the answer frame 104 that quilt and main inquiry 208 the most frequently are associated, perhaps can select mainly to inquire about for each 208 answer frame 104.
In case correlation engine 206 has been selected answer frame 104, correlation engine 206 just obtains to answer for this content of frame 104.How correlation engine 206 obtains to depend on that for the content of answering frame this answer frame is static or dynamic.Static answer frame is that its content is by predetermined answer frame.The static frame of answering for example is stored in the data storage of storing the answer frame.Comparatively speaking, dynamically answering frame is that its content is by the answer frame that obtains as required.Some answer frame can some some places in time be static, and other some places in time are dynamic.For example, the content of answering in the frame can be updated according to rule-based scheduling.When the needs update content, answering frame is dynamically to answer frame.Yet in case upgraded content, it is the static frame of answering that this content is cushioned and answers frame, up to being used for the next time of upgrading.
When correlation engine 206 was obtaining the content for dynamic answer frame, 206 pairs of correlation engines were answered the classification of frame and are made response and obtain content with parameter, for example, and the rule that is associated according to classification with answer frame 104.Correlation engine 206 can be from the back-end server acquisition content of management for the data of the classification of answering frame 104.Alternatively, correlation engine can be from buffering for received content the buffering of the content of the answer frame of nearest acquisition.In case correlation engine 206 obtains content, correlation engine 206 is formulated form with regard to the template that basis is associated with the classification of this answer frame 104 to this content.
Fig. 3 shows the exemplary method 300 that is used to obtain to appear for the content of answering frame and to the user this answer frame.For convenience, with this method of system description of the method for consulting and carrying out 300.Said system can for example be that the top answer frame of describing with reference to Fig. 1 presents system 102, the selection engine of describing with reference to Fig. 2 above comprising 202.
When system is received in the text input of importing in the search engine inquiry input field, and before the user submits the searching request for the text input, carry out this method.Input can for example be received with reference to what Fig. 1 described according to top.System for example imports corresponding main inquiry (302) according to top derivation and the text of describing with reference to Fig. 2.System is for example according to the content (304) of the top acquisition of describing with reference to Fig. 2 for the answer frame that is associated with main inquiry.System for example presents said answer frame (306) according to top with reference to what Fig. 1 described.
In some were realized, system appears answered frame together with the query suggestion for user's input.In these were realized, the position of the answer frame relevant with query suggestion can be selected by system.In some were realized, system always presented the answer frame in default position, for example before whole query suggestion, after whole query suggestion, perhaps and then with answer frame corresponding main inquiry.In some were realized, default location was specific or specific for main inquiry for the classification of answering frame.For example, some classifications of answer frame always appear at the end of query suggestion.
In other were realized, the dependent credit in system's basis answer frame relevant with query suggestion was selected the position for this answer frame.This system can confirm the trust score for this answer frame, and for example basis and the popular score of answering the main inquiry that frame is associated are perhaps according to other factors.System for example can confirm the trust score for query suggestion according to the analysis to the user search historical data; This user search historical data shows how to submit each inquiry continually, how the user selects query suggestion continually when being rendered as query suggestion, and perhaps user's multifrequency is clicked numerously query suggestion is made the Search Results that response appears.
In other were realized, alternatively or in addition how the outstanding basis that perhaps is separated into of vision was selected for the position of answering frame to answer frame in system.For example, vision answer frame outstanding or that disperse can be placed on the query suggestion below more.Vision is given prominence to the classification of the answer frame that perhaps disperses, perhaps independent answer frame can be assessed in advance by for example use experience and confirm.System can store identification, and which answers the data that the frame vision is important or disperse, and visits these data when needed.
Fig. 4 shows another example and answers frame acquisition device 402.Answering frame acquisition device 402 is another examples that the top answer frame of describing with reference to Fig. 1 obtains device 110.Answering frame acquisition device 402 comprises historical data processor 404 and selects engine 406.Different with top answer frame acquisition device 202 with reference to Fig. 2 description, answer frame acquisition device 402 and under the situation that nonrecognition is mainly inquired about, obtain for the content of answering frame 104.The substitute is, answer frame acquisition device 402 obtains for the content of answering frame 104 according to the analysis of historical data 408.
The complete form of the actual input that is complementary according to the right text input to user input and given input-answers frame is made response, is to draw from the number of times derivation that search engine presents this centering answer frame for the present worth that is of this answers frame.Being present worth can be to present the inferior counting number that each answers frame.For example, historical data 408 can show: the user who has imported the inquiry that begins with the text that is complementary with " weather San " is presented the answer frame 95 times of answer frame 78 times and the expression Santa Fe weather of the answer 55 times of expression San Francisco weather, expression San Jose weather.The said present worth that is also can be stretched; The total degree of the inquiry that the actual input that for example is complementary with the text input with this centering through user's input begins, perhaps the user imports the total degree of the inquiry of the actual input that is complementary with the query suggestion of importing for the text of this centering.Alternatively or in addition; In response to as the match query of the complete form of reality input in input-answer frame to and when presenting the dialog box of this centering; Being present worth and can increasing for this input-answer frame; And/or when presenting the answer frame of this centering in the text input of this centering, can reduce for the value of this input-answer frame as the match query of reality input.This weighting allow historical data processor 410 for the corresponding input of inquiry complete form-answer frame to providing priority.Answer frame input-answer frame centering is current together with the Search Results for inquiry; Also can increase for this right present worth that is; And be current at the answer frame of this centering together with query suggestion, also can be reduced for this right present worth that is for inquiry.This weighting allows historical data processor 410 to provide priority for the answer frame that appears after the search of having submitted the user for inquiry.
In case select engine 406 to select input-answers frame right, select engine 406 to obtain then for content at the answer frame of selected input-answer frame centering, for example, as top with reference to Fig. 2 description.
Fig. 5 shows user's acquisition and presents another exemplary method 500 of answering frame for the content of answering frame and to the user.For convenience, with this method of system description of the method for consulting and carrying out 500.Said system for example can be that the top answer frame of describing with reference to Fig. 1 presents system 102, the selection engine of describing with reference to Fig. 4 above comprising 402.
When system is received in the text input of importing in the search engine input field and the user, submit and carry out this method before for the searching request of text input.Input can for example be received with reference to what Fig. 1 described as top.System visit will import-answer each input-the answers frame pair in the right group of frame and be present worth historical data associated (502), for example as top with reference to Fig. 4 description.System according to said historical data identification candidate input-answers frame to (504), for example as top with reference to Fig. 4 description.System according to for each candidate's input-answers frame right be present worth from candidate's input-answer frame centering selection input-answer frame to (506), for example as top with reference to Fig. 4 description.System obtains the content (508) for the answer frame of selected centering, for example as toply describe with reference to Fig. 4.System appears to the user answers frame (510), for example as toply describe with reference to Fig. 1.
