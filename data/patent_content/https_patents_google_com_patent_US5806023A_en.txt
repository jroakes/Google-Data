- the display 324 e.g., a conventional liquid crystal display (LCD), is preferably used for displaying data messages.

- FIGS. 4 and 5 are timing diagrams depicting a time-scaled compression/expansion process utilized by the controller 112 and the communication receivers 122 for transmitting and receiving voice messages in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the processing system 210 utilizes this process for compressing voice messages in a way that minimizes the transmission bandwidth used by the radio communication system, thereby improving the overall efficiency of delivering voice messages to the communication receivers 122.
- the processing system 210 digitally samples the amplitude of the message in a conventional manner (e.g., by using an analog-to-digital converter--ADC), thereby generating a digital input stream of signal representations (samples) conforming to a function X(n).
- FIG. 4 depicts X(n) and the partitioning of samples for creating a compressed output stream of signal representations (samples) conforming to a function Y(n) shown in FIG. 5.
- the time-scaled compression/expansion process begins with the partitioning of input stream samples into a sample size S s .
- An overlap index O m is used for selecting samples after O m for generating an output block of the output stream Y(n).
- the position of O m for one calculation cycle is shown in FIG. 4.
- the search index S m is initially equal to the pitch period P, or equivalently to 0.5S s .
- the position of the search index S m is shown in FIG. 5. Its position on the output stream Y(n) is used for locating a best correlation match between samples of the input stream X(n) and samples of the output stream Y(n), as will be described below.
- the time-scaling factor ⁇ is preferably set to a real number between 0 and 5, depending upon the degree of compression or expansion desired. A value of ⁇ greater than 1 results in compression, while a value of ⁇ less than 1 results in expansion.
- the number of samples selected after O m denotes an overlap segment size S o .
- the overlap degree f is a predetermined number less than one (e.g., 0.8).
- ⁇ >1 i.e., compression
- the processing system 210 copies S o samples after O m into an input buffer in the memory of the processing system 210 denoted as IN -- BUF.
- the processing system 210 selects samples from Y(n), delimited by an initial output block shown in FIG. 5, and copies the samples into an output buffer in the memory of the processing system 210 denoted as OUT -- BUF.
- the size of the initial output block is governed by the formula S o +W, where W is equal to a predetermined search window size.
- the search window size is governed by the formula L+H, where L is a low offset factor equal to Low -- Search -- Weight ⁇ S s , and H is a high offset factor equal to High -- Search -- Weight ⁇ S s .
- the high and low search weights are equal to, for example, 0.25, thus resulting in a search window size of 0.5S s , and an initial output block size of S o +0.5S s .
- the start position of the initial output block is controlled by the formula S m -L, while the end position of the initial output block is controlled by the formula S m +H+S o .
- the position of the initial output block and its delimiters is shown in FIG. 5.
- the processing system 210 then performs a cross-correlation between the samples of IN -- BUF and the samples in OUT -- BUF in order to determine which contiguous S o samples in the initial output block best match the contiguous S o samples of IN -- BUF.
- the cross-correlation calculation takes place one sample shifted at a time within the fixed range of samples of the initial output block. This step is repeated in the determination of a similarity measure over the fixed search range of samples of the initial output block.
- the best correlation value C(k) determines the location of a best index factor denoted as B m .
- the best index factor B m is positioned (as shown in FIG. 5) at the first sample where the S o samples of the input block generate the highest correlation value within the fixed range of samples in the initial output block.
- the samples located between B m and B m +S o is the position of the output block as shown in FIG. 5.
- the processing system 210 is then programmed to apply a weighting function to the input stream samples between O m and O m +S o , and a mirror image weighting function to the output stream samples between B m and B m +S o .
- the weighting function applied to the input stream is a linear fading function with a positive slope
- the weighting function applied to the output stream is a linear fading function with a negative slope as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, respectively.
- the weighting function applied can be a conventional averaging function, or some other type of weighting function, e.g., a Hamming window or a Hanning window.
- the processing system 210 is then programmed to add the results of the weighted input stream samples to the weighted output stream samples.
- the resulting final summation of S o samples represents a maximum similarity of S o samples between the selected samples of the input stream X(n) and the selected correlation samples of the output stream Y(n).
- the processing system 210 is then programmed to replace the S o samples starting at B m with the S o samples of the final summation. This completes the first compression cycle performed by the processing system 210.
- the processing system 210 places after the output block the continuing signal representations from the input stream starting from the first sample after O m +S o .
- the processing system 210 copies I fm -B m -S o +L+H samples from the input stream X(n) starting at the first sample after O m +S o into the output stream Y(n) starting at the first sample after B m +S o , thereby substituting previous samples copied from X(n) on the first cycle, and adding a net addition of L+H samples after I fm .
- processing system 210 repeats the process of calculating the next search index, the next overlap index, and the next final index.
- each initial output block can be determined from the formula ##EQU2## where L is the low offset factor described above. Applying these formulas cyclically along with the correlation formula C(k), and the substitution process described above results in a time-scaled output stream Y(n) that is substantially 1 ⁇ times the original voice signal X(n) in length.
- the processing system 210 is programmed to copy the incompressible portion of the input stream X(n) directly to the output stream Y(n) without application of the compression process.
- This anomaly in the compression process has negligible effects on the signal quality of the output signal stream Y(n). This is because the compression process factors discussed above are set to predetermined values that amount to the processing of small partitions of the original signal stream X(n) (e.g., 20 ms partitions). A small uncompressed partition at the end of the output stream Y(n) has a negligible effect on the compressed speech. Thus, when the compressed voice signal is expanded to its original form, a user will unlikely be able to discern any perturbation at the end of the speech signal.
- the processing system 210 preferably is programmed to convert the compressed digitized signal Y(n) to a continuous time signal Y(t) using conventional means (e.g., a digital-to-analog converter and associated circuitry--not shown in FIG. 2).
- the continuous time signal Y(t) is modulated by the transmitter 202 on a single sideband carrier signal which is intended for the communication receiver 122.
- the communication receiver 122 can utilize the same process to expand (i.e., restore) the compressed voice message Y(n) to substantially its original form, i.e., X(n).
- the time-scaling factor ⁇ must be less than one, and is preferably substantially equal to the reciprocal of the time-scaling factor ⁇ chosen for compression by the controller 112. The details of the calculation process are the same as described above for the controller 112.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart 400 summarizing the operations utilized by the controller 112 and the communication receiver 122 in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the flow chart 400 begins with step 402 where the variables m, S m , O m , and I fm are initialized as described above.
- step 406 S o contiguous samples from the input stream X(n) starting at O m are cross-correlated with samples within the initial output block in order to find the best index, B m .
- step 408 The cross-correlation process continues in step 408 until all samples of the initial output block have been tested. Once the highest correlation factor has been determined, i.e., the best index position is known, the output block position is also known.
- step 410 mirror images of weighted linear fading functions are applied to both the S o samples of the input block and the S o samples of the output block and the results are added together to produce a summation result.
- step 412 the summation result replaces the S o samples of the output block.
- step 414 the continuing input samples starting after O m +S o and ending at O m +I fm -B m +L+H are copied to the output samples starting after B m +S o .
- step 416 m is incremented, and the variables O m , S m , and I fm are calculated along with the limits of the next initial output block as described herein above. Then the process continues cyclically from step 406 until the end of the input stream is reached.
- the flow chart 400 applies to the controller 112 when the original voice message X(n) is being compressed by the processing system 210 by a time-scaling factor ⁇ .
- flow chart 400 applies to the communication receiver 122 when the compressed voice message Y(n) received from the base station 116 is being expanded by the processing system 310 by an expansion time-scaling factor ⁇ which is substantially equal to the inverse of the compression time-scaling factor ⁇ .
- the time-scaling process described above utilizes an event based approach to time-scale modification of speech by using a predetermined selection of the input speech samples rather than a predetermined selection of the output speech samples as a correlation target.
- This feature is a major difference between the present invention and prior art systems.
- the effect of using a predetermined selection of the input speech rather than a predetermined selection of the output speech as the correlation target is to produce time-scaled speech which has higher audio quality after the communication receiver 122 has reconstructed the compressed voice signal.
- the process is also much simpler than prior art systems, because the search window used for the correlation is substantially smaller. This improvement reduces processing requirements of the communication receiver 122 such as, for example, memory and signal processing speed, thereby reducing the overall cost and complexity of the communication receiver 122.
- the present invention is also applicable to other quasi-periodic signals, e.g., music.
- the present invention is applicable not only to radio communication systems, but also to other types of apparatus.
- a dictation machine in which the present invention can be used for slowing the playback of recorded speech without changing its pitch.
- a reading machine for the sight impaired in which the present invention can be applied for speeding the playback of the reading machine without changing the pitch of the playback.
- the present invention provides a novel method and apparatus for time-scaled modification of a signal.
- the present invention is efficient and significantly improves the audio quality of the time-scaled signal.
