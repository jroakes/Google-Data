Recently, catch on having more on the medium of interactivity to advertise.For example, along with the number surge of using internet, medium and the potential effective means of service as a kind of advertisement by internet provides have obtained advertiser's approval.
Interactive Advertising provides the chance that its advertisement is directed to receptible audient for the advertiser.In other words, since directed advertisement can be relevant (for example with the demand of inferring from some User Activities, relevant with the user, relevant etc. with the document content of user's request to the search inquiry of search engine), thus directed advertisement more may be useful for the final user.Search engine has used the searching keyword orientation to send relevant advertisements.For example, the AdWords ad system of the Google company in California mountain scene city (being called as " Google ") can be sent the advertisement that is directed to from the keyword of search inquiry.Similarly, the content-targeted ads delivery system has been proposed.For example, submission and listed invention people were JeffreyA.Dean on Dec 6th, 2002, Georges R.Harik and Paul Buchheit, title is 10/314 for the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number of " METHODS ANDAPPARATUS FOR SERVING RELEVANT ADVERTISEMENTS ", 427 (are incorporated in this by reference and are called as " ' 427 application ") and submit to and listed invention people is DarrellAnderson on February 26th, 2003, Paul Buchheit, Alex Carobus, Claire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar, title for the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number of " SERVING ADVERTISEMENTS BASED ON CONTENT " be 10/375,900 (by reference and nonjoinder in this and be called as " ' 900 application ") method and apparatus that is used to distribute the advertisement relevant with document (such as webpage) content described.The ad delivery system of targeted content (such as the AdSense ad system of Google) has been used to serve ads on webpage.

In view of the above, providing to allow the user easily to navigate, browse, create and edit the application of the information of big advertisement account, be preferably cross-platform desktop (desktop) and use, will be useful.Provide with by the current technology that is used for the managing on-line advertisment account (for example in batches form) the function of the function that provides similar at least (if not identical) will be useful.Allowing the advertiser to import and/or derive advertising account information in the mode that has reduced or eliminated the demand of Customer Service Representative's intervention, will be useful.Minimizing will cause needs contrast strategy check advertising account information incident number and/or frequency and/or make needs contrast tactful checked quantity of information to minimize, also will be useful.
Summary of the invention
Embodiment according to the invention can provide cross-platform desktop application, so that the one or more user interface that satisfies the demand to be provided.For example, embodiment according to the invention can allow the advertiser and/or the Customer Service Representative browses simply and effectively, navigation and edit advertisement account's client-side editing application is accomplished this point, described advertisement account or even the advertisement account with a large amount of activities, advertisement group, keyword and advertising creative by providing.The scope that node during the hierarchical tree that browsable information can be limited to advertising account information on user interface screen is represented is selected, and be limited to the type that tab (tab) is selected.Can between different advertisement groups and advertising campaign, shear, duplicate and/or move the advertising message of representing with table row.
