In the accompanying drawings, similar Ref. No. represents corresponding part always.
Specific embodiment
The voice queries of the entity term of unique name including such as local restaurant are often erroneously identified, because they
Comprising only combining relevant rare term with specific position, user, time or context data.It does not include the general of position data
Common term in different user position usually cannot be distinguished in voice recognition technology, and as a result, provides voice queries
Inaccuracy transcription.
Therefore, technology described in this specification is that voice queries generation is multiple by the data based on instruction user location
Location-specific transcription candidate improves speech recognition accuracy.For example, user can in the first inquiry that specified location is submitted
With from various data sources (search inquiry, voice queries or the other kinds of user activity data such as, such as previously submitted)
It extracts.Then, the data of extraction can be focused into different delamination area models, and each delamination area model, which is specified, to be used for
Different size of geographic area associated with position is (for example, neighborhood (neighborhood), son are regional (sub-locality)
With the set of the term of regional (locality)).As a result, it is only possible to which this term used in smaller area is stored in neighbour
In domain model, and the term that may more globally use is stored in sub- regional model or regional model.Then, with multiple areas
The inquiry that the set of the associated term of each of domain model regional model can be used for then to send from designated position
Generate replacement transcription.
Fig. 1 shows the exemplary system 100 that can be used for location-based voice queries identification.In general, user 102
The voice queries 104a for being encoded to audio data 104b is provided to system 100, then which generates initial candidate transcription
List 104c.System 100 also receives position data 106, which is used to generate the list of additional candidate transcription
104d selects representative candidate transcription 104e in the list 104d that additional candidate is transcribed, and in response to voice queries
104a, which is provided, exports 104f for the identification of output.
In brief, system 100 may include: including transcribing selector 112 and again scorer (re-scorer) 114
Automatic speech recognizer (ASR) 110, including model selector 122, regional model 124 and the candidate transcription for transcribing generator 126
Expander 120 and language model bias device (biaser) 130.The more specific of the operation executed about system 100 is described below
Details.
In more detail, user 102 initially provides voice queries 104a, and then voice queries 104a is encoded as audio number
According to 104b.In the example of fig. 1, user 102 provide include as California mountain scene city (Mountain View,
California) the term " ZANH " of the title in interior deficiency structure restaurant.
ASR 110 receives the audio data 104b of coded speech inquiry 104a, and is corresponding with audio data 104b
Language generates the list 104c of initial candidate transcription.List 104c includes being confirmed as phonetically and in voice queries 104a
Including the similar language model of term " ZANH " in n-gram.In the example of fig. 1, ASR 110 is based on voice queries
Deduction language (phonetic) the Lai Shengcheng initial candidate of " ZANH " transcribes " ZEN ", " SIGN ", " SIN " and " SEEN ".Show at this
In example, ASR 110 generates such initial candidate transcription, because acoustic model and language model indicate that this is referred in no reception
Most probable identification is candidate in the case where showing the data of user location.For example, as shown, acoustics can be used in ASR 110
Model and language model are transcribed to generate incorrect initial candidate, because language model can indicate that " ZEN " is for language
" ZE-EH-EN " (being shown in voice queries 104a) most probable transcription.
Candidate transcription expander 120 receives the list 104c of initial candidate transcription, and additionally receives position data
106.The position data 106 can be based on global positioning system (the global positioning from user equipment 110
System, GPS) signal and information relevant to current user position indicates the current user position.For example, position data
106 may include term associated with current user position, such as the neighbouring title, associated with current user position of facility
Popular query or the inquiry previously submitted when 102 last time of user is near current location.
In some embodiments, position data 106 can also include the context data obtained from previous user session,
Such as prior searches engine results from prior queries, such as, knowledge panel, list, answer or with prior queries phase
The other kinds of information closed.In other cases, context data may include the webpage clicked recently, indicative user interface
On user behavior (such as, click tracking activity, the time quantum that spends in specific screens or other kinds of user to hand over
Tracking screen data mutually).In this case, position data 106 may include n member language associated with user activity data
Method.
In some embodiments, position data 106 can be extracted alternatively or additionally from user profiles, the use
Family profile indicates the user preference that the frequency based on the voice queries (for example, the restaurant usually searched for) previously submitted determines.With
Family profile also can indicate that prior searches, which includes entity term, the title of such as famous person or popular position or
Represent the different types of User Activity number of user preference (such as, such as " locking " position or be set as " collecting " by webpage)
According to.
In the example depicted in fig. 1, candidate transcription expander 120 receives the positional number that specified postcode is " 94041 "
According to 106, which indicates mountain scene city of the current location in California of user.Then, candidate transcription expands
The model selector 122 for opening up device 120 is known using current user position for each geographic area associated with user location
The one or more models of other and selection.
Each model includes the collection for being previously determined to be n-gram associated with the geographic area specified by particular model
It closes.For example, n-gram represent such as with the title of area-of-interest in geographic area (for example, enterprise name, neighborhood title)
Corresponding entity term.As being more specifically described with reference to Fig. 2, model can be layering so that some models it is specified with
Small geographic area (for example, mountain scene city, CA) associated n-gram of such as neighborhood, and other models are specified with such as son
Larger geographic area (for example, California) the associated n-gram in area, and specified and whole distract is (for example, beauty
Li Jian united states) associated n-gram other models.
Although for simplicity, describing region mould with reference to three ranks (for example, neighborhood, son area and area) always
Type, but in some embodiments, system 100 can based on from the received specific voice queries of user equipment 110 come using
Hierarchical levels more or less.For example, in a specific embodiment, system 100 may include for neighborhood, son
The model in area, area and administrative area.In addition, being although description throughout refers to single national (for example, U.S.)
System 100 can also assemble the global metadata of multiple countries.In this regard, region level (hierarchy) may include for having
The regional model of different zones, the different zones in specific continent or the different zones in the whole world in body country.
Different models can be used for adjusting the selection of term based on specified specificity associated with each model.Example
Such as, therefore the territory boundary based on geographic area (and has more than including that in sub- area or regional model n-gram is smaller
Body), neighbourhood model may include the n-gram being more likely used by a user in specific location.Description as detailed below
, the geographical classification of model can be further used for adjusting the selection of n-gram to be included in the additional of voice queries 104a
In candidate transcription.
In some embodiments, the different levels for the model of certain geographic zone can contain each other.For example, the U.S.
Regional model may include being confirmed as all n-grams associated with the U.S., the regional mould of son for California
Type may include the subset and mountain scene for the n-gram being confirmed as in only regional model associated with California
Neighbourhood model may include the subset for the n-gram being confirmed as in sub- regional model associated with mountain scene.In this example
In, it is also included in sub- area and regional model including the n-gram in neighbourhood model.In addition, there is some n-grams can
To be included in sub- area and/or regional model, but it is not included in neighbourhood model (for example, the Sa Ke with CA pulls
Hold in the palm associated term).Therefore, different levels can be used to generate special with the similar homophylic different zones of language
The substitution transcription sequence of property.
In some embodiments, regional model 124 can be with from by the level of certain n-grams and different geographic regions
Information that associated mapping database is sent is updated periodically.It, can be with for example, as being more specifically described with reference to Fig. 2
Aggregation is by the previously used n-gram for being integrated into specified location of user, and to identify specific n-gram, the specific n is first
Grammer be neighborhood specific (for example, being more likely to only by user's use in specific neighborhood) or be sub- area it is specific or
It is regional specific.This is realized by handling and being associated with position data relevant to the user query data of the set of user
's.In this regard, it can be used for reflecting that the usage of n-gram changes (for example, local use arrives to the update of regional model 124
The overall situation uses, and vice versa).
Model selector 122 selects different models, so that the n-gram specified by each of selected model
Set then can be used for for voice queries 104a generate additional candidate transcription.In some embodiments, by position data
106 instruction user locations be used to identify in each region level correspondence model (for example, the neighbourhood model of best match,
The sub- regional model of best match and regional model including the two), then parallel processing is specified by each regional model
N-gram different sets.In other embodiments, model selector 122 is every in the level of region with can replace
The model of seed type selects multiple models.In such an embodiment, model selector 122 can choose including user location
Neighbourhood model and for include user location neighborhood near neighborhood other neighbourhood models.Equally, model selector
122 also can choose multiple son areas and/or multiple regional models.
The transcription generator 126 one group n member specified using each of regional model selected by model selector 122
Then grammer generates one or more additional candidate transcriptions for each of selected regional model.Shown in Fig. 1 shows
In example, transcription generator 126 is neighbourhood model, sub- regional model based on the user location selection specified by position data 106
It is transcribed with each of the regional model single additional candidate of generation.In other examples, transcription generator 126 can be each
Model selects multiple additional candidate transcriptions.
Transcription generator 126 based on compare by each of regional model specify n-gram set be included in
Initial candidate transcription in table 104c, to generate including the additional candidate transcription in table 104d.For each regional model, turn
Record generator 126 and then generation include that the one or more of the n-gram of the set of the following n-gram from regional model is attached
Add candidate, the n-gram: (i) is not present in table 104c, and (ii) be indicated as phonetically with appear in table 104c
Term is similar.As an example, for neighbourhood model, " XHAN " is identified as additional candidate transcription by transcription generator 126, because should
N-gram is not identified as initial candidate transcription in table 104c, but phonetically transcribes " ZEN " class with initial candidate
Seemingly.
Transcription generator 126 can be that each of additional candidate transcription generated for selected regional model is attached
Calculate identification score with adding.Identification score can be used for reflecting the accurate transcription of additional candidate transcription reflection voice queries 104a
Possibility.In some embodiments, identification score be based in comparison domain model specify specific n-gram may by by
The probability and specific n-gram that user in the specified geographic area of model uses may be made by any user in any position
Global probability (for example, the probability indicated in the baseline language model that ASR 110 is used) is come what is calculated.In this regard, know
Other score enables system 100 to be compared the use of n-gram in different geographic regions relative to global use, with true
In the case where being scheduled on given user's current position, additional candidate identify a possibility that whether greatly may be very voice queries 104b
Accurate transcription.
ASR 110 receives the list 104d of additional candidate transcription, and selects representative candidate transcription to be used for as identification
Export 104e output.For example, in some embodiments, ASR 110 can be initial transcription and column each of in list 104c
Additional candidate transcription in table 104d initially generates corresponding confidence.Confidence can represent each specific time
A possibility that choosing transcription represents the accurate transcription of voice queries 104a.As shown as an example in figure 1, due in position data 106
Postcode instruction current user position, so ASR 110 be based on audio data 104b and the two of position data 106 come for
Initial candidate transcription " ZEN " determines low confidence score.Alternatively, ASR 110 is that additional candidate transcribes " ZANH " determining height
Confidence, because it is phonetically similar to audio data 104b, and because in term " ZANH " and position data 106
Postcode it is associated.
In more detail, transcription selector 112 transcribes and represents the candidate for most possibly representing accurate transcription from initial candidate
Initially select specific candidate transcription for exporting in the additional candidate transcription of transcription.For example, transcription selector 112 can be with
Compare the respective confidence score for distributing to each of initial candidate transcription and additional candidate transcription, and selects that there is highest
The specific candidate transcription of confidence.As shown as an example in figure 1, the position data of instruction 102 current location of user is given
106, transcription selector 112 is that there is the additional candidate of more high confidence score to transcribe " ZANH " for transcription selection.Then, ASR
110 are provided as " ZANH " based on selection additional candidate transcription, by identification output 104e.
In some embodiments, ASR 110 can additionally include scorer 114 again, this again scorer 114 to by
ASR 110 is that the confidence that each specific candidate transcription calculates is scored again.For example, scorer 114 can be attached again
Add the language similarity between more each candidate transcription and audio data 104b, which individual candidate transcription generation determined
Table is most likely to be the transcription correctly transcribed.For example, if audio data 104b includes much noise, then scorer 114 can
To adjust the confidence for distributing to each of initial candidate transcription 104c and additional candidate transcription 104d, so that ASR
110 properly select the candidate transcription for being most likely to be accurate transcription.
Although fig 1 illustrate that the representative candidate transcription selected by ASR 110, but in other embodiments, it represents
Property candidate transcription can also be selected by candidate transcription expander 120.For example, in such an embodiment, transcribing generator 126
The operation of transcription selector 112 can also be performed, to provide most accurate turn that is confirmed as voice queries 104a to ASR110
The representative transcription of record.In this example, the processing of additional candidate transcription 104d is embodied from ASR 110
(externalized), so that ASR 110 only sends the representative transcription selected by candidate transcription expander 120, to be output to
User equipment 110.
In some embodiments, it can be exported based on biasing by the identification that ASR 110 is used to generate voice queries 104a
Baseline language model alternatively or additionally select representative transcription.E.g., including the n-gram in table 104d can
To be sent to language model bias device 130, with forward bias baseline language model, so that ASR 110 selects this n-gram
Probability as candidate transcription sequence increases.In such an example, following equation can be used in language model bias device 130
(1) increase the baseline probability of specific n-gram:
LMBoost=log [P (n-gram | position)]-log [P (n-gram)]+FS (1)
In equation (1), LMBoost represents the forward bias of the baseline probabilistic language model of specific n-gram, P (n member
Grammer | position) in the user location indicated by position data 106 using the probability of n-gram, P (n-gram) is represented for representative
The probability of n-gram and FS are represented and include that the associated feature of the regional model of n-gram is divided in baseline language model
Number.
The value of feature scores can be used for being adjusted based on associated regional model to including the independent n in table 104d
The biasing of metagrammar.For example, neighbourhood model can be associated with the feature scores bigger compared to regional model, so that in neighborhood
The n-gram identified in model is biased to a greater degree compared with the related n-gram identified in regional module.At this
In example, since neighbourhood model is associated with lesser geographic area, so the n-gram from neighbourhood model is by more
Ground biasing, to increase the user location indicated by position data 106 compared with the related n-gram from regional model
Interior user may use the probability of the n-gram from neighbourhood model.
Fig. 2 shows for generating the example process 200 of the delamination area model for improving voice queries identification.Letter
For it, process 200 can be executed by server 210, which obtains looking into for user 202a, 202b and 202c respectively
Ask daily record data 204a, 204b and 204c.Server 210 handles the n member identified in inquiry log data 204a, 204b and 204c
Grammer, and they are gathered in storage device 212.Then server 210 classifies to the n-gram of identification, to give birth to
At one group of regional model (for example, regional model 124), which includes neighbourhood model 214a, sub- regional model
214b and regional model 214c.
In more detail, regional model can correspond to different size of geographic area so that each model it is specified from it is different
The set of the associated n-gram of area size.In discribed example, neighbourhood model 214a it is specified all with " mountain scene city,
The set of the associated entity n-gram of CA ", sub- regional model 214b it is specified all with " California, USA " are associated
The set and regional model 214c of entity n-gram are specified all related to including the U.S. " West Coast " region in multiple states
The set of the entity n-gram of connection.
Server 210 initially obtain respectively inquiry log data 204a associated with user 202a, 202b and 202c,
204b and 204c.As described above, inquiry log data may include the voice or text query that such as user 202a-c is submitted
Historical data, and such as other kinds of data of search inquiry data or application input data.Inquiry log data include
It is included in the set of the n-gram in historical data associated with each user.
Server 210 executes various processing operations, to select to be extracted and stored in storage dress from inquiry log data
Set the n-gram in 212.For example, server 210 can annotate text chunk to extract entity n-gram and remove non-physical n member
Grammer.For example, in this example, annotation text chunk " INCANON CITY " with extraction " CANON CITY " and deletes " IN ".
In addition, server 210 is not included in regional model using various heuristics (heuristic) to filter out
N-gram.For example, server 210 can filter out misspelling, the only n-gram that uses of a few users, and/or by
In wrong identification only in the position in popular n-gram.For example, in this example, n-gram " OBAMA " is from inquiry day
It is removed in will data, because it is higher than by the frequency that all users use for including the specified threshold in regional model.?
In another example, server 210 can filter out the inquiry and the inquiry of incorrect spelling wherein correctly spelt in position
Ratio is lower than the n-gram of threshold value, this instruction n-gram is since the frequent fault identification mistake on all users causes
's.In another example, server 210 can filter between wherein subset spelling correction ratio and global spelling correction ratio
Difference is more than the n-gram of threshold value, this instruction n-gram is local misspelling.In another example, server 210 may be used also
It is included in many voice queries but is not included the n-gram in text query to filter out, this instruction n-gram is only
It is wrongly recognized.In another example again, server 210 can filter out wherein subset speech ratio and global speech ratio
Between difference be higher than threshold value n-gram, this instruction n-gram be local error identification, for example, " canoncity " is by mistake
It is identified as " canyon city ".
In discribed example, each of user 202a, 202b and 202c user are each in different positions
(for example, " mountain scene city, CA ", " Sacramento, CA " and " Phoenix ") submit inquiry.Based on these positions, server 210 is raw
At neighbourhood model 214a, so that it only includes the n-gram obtained from inquiry log 204a.In addition, because user 202a and use
Family 202b rather than user 202c is located at California, so sub- regional model 214b include from inquiry log 204a and
Term of the 204b rather than from inquiry log 204c.Finally, because all user 202a, 202b and 202c are all located at U.S. west
Seashore, for example, California and Arizona State, so regional model 214c include from inquiry log 204a, 204b and
The n-gram that each of 204c is obtained.
