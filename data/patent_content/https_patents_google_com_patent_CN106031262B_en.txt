Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
This application is based on the priority of U.S. patent application nos. 14/622, 762 entitled "proximitoydetection" filed on 13/2/2015 as required by 35U.S. c. 119 and U.S. provisional patent application No.61/941, 466 entitled "proximitoydetection" filed on 18/2/2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Technical Field
This specification relates to device proximity detection.
Background
Existing systems typically utilize the Global Positioning System (GPS) to locate user equipment and determine proximity between different user equipment, however, GPS is power consuming and often used, which leads to the possibility of outdated data. Additionally, if GPS is used indoors, GPS signals may not be available and, as a result, the user equipment switches to WiFi or cellular devices using location detection, which are much less accurate.
Disclosure of Invention
In accordance with one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system for detecting proximity between users includes: a processor; and a memory to store instructions that, when executed, cause the system to: determining a context associated with a first user device; querying the other user devices based on the context to create a set of other user devices that satisfy the query; generating a list of filtered devices by filtering the set of other user devices; notifying the first user equipment of the list of filtered devices; and querying the list of filtered devices to determine which filtered devices are within proximity of the first user device.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be embodied in the following operations that include: wherein the first user device queries the list of filtered devices based on at least one bluetooth protocol, receives a token instead of a media access control address of the filtered devices on the list of filtered devices and queries the token; filtering the one or more sets of other user devices based on a threshold level of separation between a first user associated with the first user device and a second user associated with the one or more sets of other user devices; filtering the set of one or more other user devices based on a threshold number of interactions between a first user associated with the first user device and a second user associated with the set of one or more other user devices; filtering the set of one or more other user devices based on privacy settings of the one or more other user devices; ranking the one or more filtered devices within proximity of the first user device based on proximity of the one or more filtered devices to the first user device and one or more connections between the first user device and the one or more filtered devices and notifying a user of the first device of the one or more filtered devices in ranked order; and determining actions of other user devices when in proximity to the first user device and notifying a user associated with the first user device to take steps to facilitate the actions of the device when in proximity to the first user device.
Each of these and other embodiments may optionally include one or more of the following features. For example, the features include: the context includes one or more of the following: a location, a time, an ongoing action, and a future action associated with the first user device; the first user device is located at the destination and further comprising sending information related to the destination to the filtered user devices in response to the one or more filtered user devices being within proximity of the first user device; and the first user device performs an inquiry to determine which filtered devices are within proximity of the first user device using the bluetooth protocol.
Other aspects include corresponding methods, systems, apparatuses, and computer program products of these and other inventive aspects.
The present disclosure may be particularly advantageous in a number of respects. First, the system can accurately determine proximity between different users using bluetooth technology. For example, the system can calculate whether the user is in the same room, which is difficult using other techniques. Second, the system reduces battery consumption by being able to determine proximity between users without requiring the users to activate the bluetooth protocol. For example, devices in the system may search for and pair with each other based on the bluetooth discovery protocol without user involvement.

Detailed Description
Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a system 100 for determining proximity between user devices. The illustrated system 100 includes a user device 115a.. 115n accessible by a user 125a.. 125n, one or more social network servers 101, and a context server 107. In fig. 1 and the remaining figures, letters following a reference number, such as "115 a," indicate a reference to an element having that particular reference number. Reference numbers in the text without subsequent letters, such as "115," indicate general references to embodiments of the element bearing the reference number. In the illustrated embodiment, these entities of system 100 are communicatively coupled via a network 105. In some embodiments, system 100 may include other servers or devices not shown in FIG. 1. For example, the system 100 may include a Global Positioning System (GPS) to assist in determining the location of the user device 115.
The social network server 101 may be a hardware server that includes a processor, memory, and network communication capabilities. The social network server 101 is communicatively coupled to a network 105 via a signal line 104. In some embodiments, the social network server 101 sends and receives data to and from one or more user devices 115a, 115n and the context server 107 via the network 105. The social network server 101 includes a social network application 109 and a database 199. Database 199 stores social data associated with users. For example, database 199 stores social data published in a social network describing one or more of the following: user profiles, posts, comments, videos, audio files, images, shares, confirmations, and the like.
A social network may be a type of social structure that users may link through common features. Common features include relationships/linkages such as friendship, family, work, interests, and so forth. The common features may be provided by one or more social networking systems that include well-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections to other online users, where the relationships form a social graph. In some examples, the social graph may reflect the mapping of these users and how they relate.
Multiple social network servers 101 are illustrated and the multiple social network servers 101 represent different social networks coupled to the network 105, each with its own server, application, and social graph. For example, a first social network may refer more to a business network, a second may refer more to an electronic messaging application whose social graph represents communications between users, a third may refer to a social forum, a fourth may refer to a blog or microblog environment, and so forth. In one embodiment, one of the social applications 109 is part of the context server 107.
In some embodiments, the proximity application 103a may operate on a context server 107, the context server 107 being coupled to the network 105 via the signal line 106. The context server 107 may be a hardware server that includes a processor, memory, and network communication capabilities. For example, the context server 107 sends data to and receives data from other entities of the system 100 via the network 105. Although fig. 1 illustrates one context server 107, the system 100 may include one or more context servers 107.
In some embodiments, the context server 107 determines a context based on signals received from other entities of the system 100 and thus determines one or more device identifiers or user identifiers based on the context. For example, the signal may include a time and location signal from the user device 115 or other server (not shown) indicating the current time and location of the user device 115. The signals may also include social signals maintained by the social network server 101 indicating social relationships between users. In another example, the signal is received from a database (e.g., database 199, database 123, etc.). In some embodiments, a context may describe a given state of the world around a user. For example, a context describes a context in which a user goes home and can be defined as home. In another example, the context indicates a certain period of time (e.g., 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) after the current time. For example, the context describes that the user will arrive at the shopping mall in 15 minutes.
In some embodiments, the proximity application 103 may use the determined context as input (e.g., referred to as a signal) and determine the set of user devices 115 or certain actions as suggestions to the set of user devices 115 based on the context. For example, the proximity application 103a pre-computes a set of candidate user devices 115 that may be within proximity of the first user device 115 and determines that a subset of the candidate user devices 115 that the user of the first user device 115 may be interested in learning are nearby. In some embodiments, the proximity application 103a determines one or more actions to perform when the other user device 115 is within proximity. For example, if the context indicates that the user is en route home, the proximity application 103a determines content (e.g., music, video, etc.) to be preloaded for the user onto a home user device 115 (e.g., music player, television, video player, etc.).
In the illustrated embodiment, the context server 107 includes a database 123 for storing data associated with the context server 107. The database 123 may be a non-transitory memory that stores data used to provide the functionality described herein. Database 123 may be a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) device, a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) device, a flash memory, or some other memory device. In some embodiments, database 123 also includes non-volatile memory or similar permanent storage devices and media including hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, CD-ROM devices, DVD-RAM devices, DVD-RW devices, flash memory devices, or some other mass storage device for storing information on a more permanent basis.
In some embodiments, the proximity application 103b may be stored on a user device 115a connected to the network 105 via the signal line 108. In some embodiments, the user devices 115a, 115n may be computing devices that include memory and a processor, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile email device, a portable game player, a portable music player, a reader device, a television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, or other electronic device capable of accessing the network 105. In the illustrated embodiment, the user 125a interacts with the user device 115a. The user device 115n is communicatively coupled to the network 105 via the signal line 110. The user 125n interacts with the user device 115 n. The user devices 115a, 115n in fig. 1 are used by way of example. Although fig. 1 illustrates two user devices 115a and 115n, the present disclosure is applicable to system architectures having any number of user devices 115.
In some embodiments, the user device 115 may be a mobile device included in a device worn by the user 125. For example, the user device 115 is included as part of a clip (e.g., a wristband), as part of jewelry, or as part of a pair of eyeglasses. In another example, the user device 115 may be a smart watch. The user 125 may view the notification from the proximity application 103 on a display of the user device 115 worn by the user 125. For example, the user 125 may view the notification on a display of a smart watch or smart wristband. The user 125 may also configure what type of notifications to display on the user device 115 worn by the user 125. For example, if a friend's mobile user device 115 is detected in proximity to the user 125, the user 125 may configure the wearable user device 115 to flash for 5 seconds.
In some embodiments, the proximity application 103 functions in part as a thin client application that may be stored on the user devices 115a, 115n and in part on the context server 107. For example, the proximity application 103b on the user device 115a generates a list of device identifiers associated with the user 125 in the proximity of the user 125a and sends the list of device identifiers to the proximity application 103a stored on the context server 107. The proximity application 103a determines whether the user 125 allows their proximity to be displayed to the user 125a based on the user's 125 profile or other social data, and sends permission data indicating the permission of the user 125 to the proximity application 103b on the user device 115a for presenting the user's 125 proximity to the user 125a based on the permission data.
The network 105 may be wired or wireless, of a conventional type, and may have a number of different configurations including a star configuration, a token ring configuration, or other configurations. Further, the network 105 may include a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN) (e.g., the internet), and/or other interconnected data paths through which multiple devices communicate. In some embodiments, the network 105 may be a peer-to-peer network. The network 105 may also be coupled to or comprise part of a telecommunications network for transmitting data in accordance with various different communication protocols. In some embodiments, network 105 comprises a bluetooth communication network or a cellular communication network for sending and receiving data via Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, and the like. Although fig. 1 illustrates one network 105 coupled with the user device 115, the social network server 101, and the context server 107, in practice one or more networks 105 may be connected with these entities.
The proximity application 103 may be code and routines for determining proximity between users. In some embodiments, the proximity application 103 may be implemented using hardware including a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). In some other embodiments, the proximity application 103 may be implemented using a combination of hardware and software. In some embodiments, the proximity application 103 may be stored in a combination of a device and a server or in one of the device or the server. Proximity application 103 is described in more detail below with reference to fig. 2-5B.
Referring now to FIG. 2, an example of a proximity application 103 is shown in more detail. Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a computing device 200 including a proximity application 103, a processor 235, a memory 237, and a communication unit 241, according to some examples. The components of computing device 200 are communicatively coupled by a bus 220. In some embodiments, the computing device 200 may be one of the user device 115 and the context server 107.
Processor 235 includes an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller, or some other array of processors to perform computations and provide electronic display signals to a display device. Processor 235 is coupled to bus 220 for communication with other components via signal line 222. The processor 235 processes the data signals and may include various computing architectures including: a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) architecture, a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, or an architecture for implementing a combination of instruction sets. Although fig. 2 includes a single processor 235, multiple processors 235 may be included. Other processors, operating systems, sensors, displays, and physical configurations are possible.
The memory 237 stores instructions and/or data that may be executed by the processor 235. Memory 237 is coupled to bus 220 for communication with other components via signal line 224. The instructions and/or data may include code for performing the techniques described herein. The memory 237 may be a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) device, a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) device, a flash memory, or some other memory device. In some embodiments, memory 237 also includes non-volatile memory or similar permanent storage devices and media including a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a DVD-RAM device, a DVD-RW device, a flash memory device, or some other mass storage device for storing channels on a more permanent basis.
In some embodiments, the communication unit 241 includes a wireless transceiver for exchanging data with the user device 115 or other communication channel using one or more wireless communication methods including IEEE802.11, IEEE802.16, bluetooth, or another suitable wireless communication method. The communication unit 241 communicates with the first user equipment 115 using bluetooth by broadcasting a media access control address (MAC address) of the second user equipment 115 to use to discover the first user equipment 115. The second user device 115 will be paired with the first user device 115. For example, two user devices 115 may be wirelessly paired with each other using bluetooth, such as a cellular phone and headset so that a user may make a call without holding a cell phone.
The MAC address is a unique identifier of the user device 115 stored in the user device 115 hardware. Because the MAC address is static, it can be used for illegal purposes. As a result, in one embodiment, the communication unit 251 receives a token from the context server 107 to broadcast, rather than a MAC address, for use with the proximity application. In another embodiment, the device detector 202 on the user device 115 generates and transmits a token to the communication unit 251 for transmission to the other user devices 115. The token is described in more detail below with reference to the device detector 202.
In some embodiments, the communication unit 241 comprises a cellular communication transceiver for sending and receiving data over a cellular communication network including via Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, or another suitable type of electronic communication. In some embodiments, the communication unit 241 includes a wired port and a wireless transceiver. Communication unit 241 also provides other conventional connections to network 105 for distributing files and/or media objects using standard network protocols including TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPs, and SMTP, among others.
In the illustrated embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the proximity application 103 includes a device detector 202, one or more filtering engines 204, a rights engine 206, a ranking engine 208, a user interface engine 210, a device activator 212, and a mode engine 214. These components of proximity application 103 are communicatively coupled to each other via bus 220.
The device detector 202 may be software that includes routines for detecting devices. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality for detecting the user device 115 as described below. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. The device detector 202 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 230.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 determines the location of the user's device. The user device 115 may be any user device 115 with communication capabilities, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile email device, a portable game player, a portable music player, a reader device, a television set with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, or other electronic device capable of accessing a network, such as an embedded or coupled bluetooth communication component. In some embodiments, the user device 115 may be a wearable computer. For example, the device detector 202 determines the location of the user device 115 based on GPS technology. In another example, the device detector 202 determines the location of the user device 115 based on bluetooth technology, infrared, audio signals, and the like.
In some other embodiments, the device detector 202 receives the recorded location of the user device 115 from one or more databases (e.g., database 199, database 123, etc.) and determines an approximate location of the user device 115. For example, the user device 115 is typically registered with a social network and the database 199 stores historical locations of the user device 115 based on the registration. The device detector 202 determines its approximate location based on the historical location of the user device 115. For example, user device 115 is a user's home device (e.g., television, video player, etc.) and it is typically registered at home. Thereafter, the device detector 202 determines home as its approximate location. In another example, the user device 115 is a cellular telephone and it is typically with the user and at the user's workplace during a certain time period (e.g., 9 am-6 pm on a weekday). If the time is 4 pm on a weekday, the detector 202 determines that the user device 115 is at the user's workplace.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 determines the context of the user device 115. For example, the context of the user device 115 describes a time, a location, an ongoing action, and/or a possible future action (e.g., an action within 30 minutes, etc.) associated with the user. In some embodiments, device detector 202 also receives signals from user device 115, a server, and/or a database (e.g., social signals to represent the user's current social activity, etc.) and determines a context based on the signals.
The device detector 202 detects the other user devices 115 based on the determined location of the first user device 115 by querying the other user devices 115. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 pings the first user device 115 among nearby devices based on the bluetooth protocol. The device detector 202 may determine the presence of other user devices 115 by sending messages to the other user devices 115. For example, the device detector 202 stored in the first user device 115 sends a communication message based on the bluetooth protocol to one or more second user devices 115 by scanning the MAC address of a known user device 115. If the second user device 115 sends a response back to the first user device 115, the first user device 115 and the second user device 115 are paired. For example, if one second user device 115 is within range of the first user device 115 and receives a communication message from the first user device 115, the second user device 115 may send a response back to the first user device 115 to pair with the first user device 115. Bluetooth typically extends only to a few hundred meters. As a result, in one embodiment, the device detector 202 uses a combination of techniques such as GPS or the like to determine the location of the other user devices 115 that have recently been updated or registered to the user devices 115 in the social network. As a result, the range may be several meters, miles (e.g., one, two, three, five miles), about 30 miles, about 50 miles. In another embodiment, the device detector 202 uses other devices such as infrared and audio signals when in close proximity.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 receives a device identifier or a list of user identifiers from the user device 115. For example, the operating system in the user device 115 maintains a list of device identifiers associated (paired) with the user device 115 or a list of user identifiers related to the user of the user device 115 (e.g., a contact list, a list of devices or users that are often near the user of the device, etc.). The device detector 202 receives the device identifier or the list of user identifiers and pings the user device 115. For example, the list has fields that the device detector 202 can recognize using bluetooth technology.
In some embodiments, the device identifier for bluetooth technology is a MAC address that uniquely identifies the user device 115. In other embodiments involving bluetooth technology to store the device detector 202 on the user device 115, the device detector 202 receives a token to replace the MAC address from the device detector 202 on the event server 107 to avoid misuse of the MAC address by the user device 115. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 on the event server 107 generates a token (e.g., after registering with the proximity application 103) and permanently assigns the token to the user device 115. In other embodiments, the device detector 202 on the event server 107 periodically issues new tokens so that the tokens are also not misused. For example, the device detector 202 may employ a round-robin MAC address as a token to issue new MAC addresses weekly, monthly, yearly, and so forth. In other embodiments, the device detector 202 on the user device 115 generates its own token (e.g., once or periodically) and communicates the token to the event server 107 for identification purposes. The device detector 202 passes the token to the communication unit 251 on the user device 115 for use with other user devices 115 in the discovery process.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 queries all other user devices 115 within range of the first device. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 queries a subset of the other user devices 115 that are within range of the first user device 115 due to memory limitations and battery life limitations. For example, the device detector 202 in the first user device 115 pings a subset of the other user devices 115 within a three mile radius of the first user device 115 that are picked based on some criteria. Example criteria may include social connections between users, common interests based on user profiles or activities, historical status of devices, signals from other applications, and so forth. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 queries other devices within proximity of the first user device 115 and then sends information about the ping derived user device 115 to the filtering engine 204, the list generator 206, the rights engine 208, or the ranking engine 212 for filtering the list of ping derived user devices 115 to generate a subset for providing to the first user device 115. In some other embodiments, the device detector 202 receives a list of other user devices 115 for the first user device 115 selected by the filtering engine 204 or the list generator 206 based on one or more certain criteria (e.g., the user of the first user device 115 may know the user associated with the list of other user devices 115) and queries the list of other user devices 115 to detect whether they are within proximity of the first user device 115. In some embodiments, the device detector 202 receives the list of other user devices 115 filtered by the rights engine 208 and pings the user devices 115 in the list that are within proximity of the first user device 115. In some other embodiments, the device detector 202 receives the list of other devices filtered by the ranking engine 212 and pings the user devices 115 in the list. For example, the ranking engine 212 picks the top 50 users in the list and the device detector 202 queries the top 50 users to pair with the first user device 115.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 queries a database (not shown) that stores data for linking user identifiers to their device identifiers. For example, the device detector 202 queries a database using a list of user identifiers (e.g., a list of user identifiers filtered by the engine described above) and receives the device identifiers. The device detector 202 then pings the user device 115 based on the device identifier.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 scans for devices within proximity of the first user device 115 and sends the detected devices to other appropriate engines for filtering and provision to the first user. For example, the device detector 202 scans the user devices 115 by querying the user devices 115 one after another and if one of the user devices 115 is within radio range, the user device 115 may respond so that the device detector 202 can know that it is nearby. In some other embodiments, the device detector 202 scans for user devices 115 that are within proximity of the first user device 115 and sends the detected devices to the context server 107, which context server 107 is used to process the detected devices and determine which user devices 115 to provide the list of detected devices. In this manner, the user device 115 may be passively detected and provide a list of other user devices 115 within its proximity.
In some embodiments, the device detector 202 detects the user devices 115 within proximity based on other technologies or communication protocols. For example, the device detector 202 uses GPS technology to detect the user device 115. In another example, the device detector 202 detects the user device 115 based on infrared detection techniques. It should be understood to one of ordinary skill in the art that the device detector 202 may detect the device using any other suitable device detection technique.
The filtering engine 204 may be software that includes routines for filtering the user device 115 based on certain criteria and generating a list of filtered devices. In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality for filtering the user device 115 based on certain criteria, as described below. In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. The filtering engine 204 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 232.
In some embodiments, the one or more filtering engines 204 may determine social connections between users based on a social network, filter the user devices 115 based on the user connections, and generate a list of filtered devices. For example, the one or more filtering engines 204 receive social data (e.g., profiles, relationships, social graphs, etc.) from one or more social networks and determine whether and how users are connected. In some embodiments, one or more filtering engines 204 may authenticate different social networks. In some embodiments, one or more filtering engines 204 may define general criteria for determining user connections. For example, the one or more filtering engines 204 define a primary connection as the first user following the second user, the first user and the second user being friends, the first and second users being part of a group on a social network, and so on. Alternatively, filtering engine 204 defines a primary link as the first user follows the second user and the second user follows the first user in the social network. The one or more filtering engines 204 filter the user devices 115 by omitting from the set of other user devices 115 whose users do not have a nexus with the user associated with the first user device 115. This type of filtering engine 204 may be referred to as a social link filtering engine 204. For example, the social link filtering engine 204 residing in the user device 115 operated by the first user 125a filters out the user devices 115 used by the second user 125 that have a threshold level of social links with the first user 125a. For example, the social link filtering engine 204 may remove other user devices 115 from the set of other user devices 115, where a user associated with the first device 115 has a secondary or lower level of links to users associated with other user devices 115 used by the second user 125 that do not have social links with the first user 125a from the list, and keep the user device 115 whose user 125 has social links with the first user 125a in the list.
In one embodiment, the social connection filtering engine 204 determines the type and level of social connections between users and filters from the set of other user devices 115 based on the type and level. Types include, for example, different bases of social connections such as friends, colleagues, and family. The levels include, for example, different levels within the same category. For example, the user may be an acquaintance, a good friend, or a best friend. In other embodiments, the types and levels may also be used by the ranking engine to rank the user devices 115 within the list of filtered devices.
In some embodiments, the social connection filtering engine 204 may determine user connections based on the source of other types of social relationships. For example, sources of social relationships may include, in addition to social networks as described above, emails, micro-blogs, forums, user contact lists, corporate employee databases, organizational charts, and so forth. For example, the social connection filtering engine 204 may determine whether the user is connected by examining the user's contact list or by determining whether the users sent or received a certain number of emails (e.g., 1 email, 5 emails, 10 emails, 50 emails, etc.) with each other over a certain period of time (e.g., one week, one month, one year, etc.). In another example, the social connection filtering engine 204 may determine the user connections by analyzing a corporate employees database or a school alumni database, among others. For example, if the user is working for the same employer or if they are learning at the same school, the social connection filtering engine 204 determines the user connection.
In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 may include a filtering engine 204 for implicitly identifying people who are linked through something they share in common. The different types of filtering engines 204 operate independently or in cooperation with each other to filter the user device 115 based on certain criteria. In one embodiment, the profile or interest filtering engine 204 may filter the user devices 115 based on user profiles or interests. For example, the profile or interest filtering engine 204 receives a user's profile and/or data describing the user's activities, determines characteristics of the user (e.g., interests, friendship, etc.) based on the user's profile and/or activities, and filters other user devices 115 for display to the user based on the characteristics of the user. For example, the profile of the first user indicates that the first user is part of a nursery community and a motorcycle community; the profile or interest filtering engine 204 determines the user devices 115 used by the first user that may be interested in the child care and motorcycle and thus selects the second user that is also interested in either child care and motorcycle. In another example, for an appointment application, the profile or interest filtering engine 204 may use user devices 115 that are within proximity of the user device 115 used by the searching user to find candidate users based on their profiles on the appointment application. For example, the candidate user's profile matches or is related to the searching user's profile; the profile or interest filtering engine 204 filters out other users whose profiles are not related to the profile of the searching user, even if the other users are also in proximity to the searching user. In this manner, searching for a user may save a significant amount of time for picking candidates from a list of user devices 115 used by users within proximity, especially when the list is fairly long. The searching user can be provided with other users nearby without giving personal information (e.g., telephone number, etc.).
The profile or interest filtering engine 204 may also determine user characteristics based on user activity. Exemplary user activities include, but are not limited to, physical activities (e.g., running, walking, sleeping, driving, talking to someone, riding a bike, talking to a group, hiking, etc.), activities on a social network (e.g., online surfing on a social network, posting and/or commenting, replying to posts, sharing posts, etc.), and activities on the user device 115 (e.g., opening an application, listening to a playlist, calling contacts, writing an email, browsing a photograph, watching a video, etc.). Other example activities are possible. By analyzing user activity, the profile or interest filtering engine 204 may determine the first user's preferences or interests and filter other users to select a second set of users having the same or related preferences or interests for introducing to the first user when within proximity of each other.
In one embodiment where the store uses the first user device 115, the filtering engine 204 includes a club filtering engine 204, the club filtering engine 204 to filter other user devices 115 for the first user device 115 based on loyalty club points or based on locations or stores that the user has historically visited frequently (e.g., at least once per week, etc.). For example, the club filter engine 204 selects nearby user devices 115 for the first user device 115 so that the device activator 214 can communicate notifications, such as coupons for users with loyalty points that exceed a threshold, to other user devices 115.
In one embodiment, one filtering engine 204 may filter the user device 115 of the user based on a signal indicating that the user device 115 will be physically proximate to the user device 115. For example, the filtering engine 204 (referred to as "signal filtering engine 204") selects user devices 115 that have registered to a server (e.g., context server 107, social network server 101, etc.) within a certain distance (e.g., 0.5 miles, 1 mile, 2 miles, etc.) from the first user's location and within a certain time range (e.g., past 10 minutes, past 2 hours, etc.). The signal that the user device 115 has registered with the server within a certain distance from the first user's location within a certain time range indicates that the user device 115 may be physically proximate to the first user device 115.
In one embodiment, one filtering engine 204 may filter the user devices 115 of a first user based on a threshold of interaction between the first user associated with the first user device 115 and a second user associated with one or more of the other user devices 115. For example, the filtering engine 204 filters a set of user devices 115 of one or more second users that the first user and the second user have communicated with each other (i.e., the first user contacts the second user and the second user contacts the first user) or that the first user meets or contacts the second user with a certain frequency (e.g., at least once per week, etc.). The frequency may be determined in conjunction with the device detector 202, the device detector 202 defining contacts within a certain proximity (e.g., the same room). This establishes the basis for defining situations such as people gathering together to eat lunch each week. For example, if the first user and the second user are often accompanied by lunch, the first user will find it useful to be notified that the second user is within proximity.
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other types of filtering engines are possible to implement filtering for the user device 115 of the user. In some embodiments, the geographic filtering engine 204 filters the user device 115 based on its geographic location. For example, the geo-filtering engine 204 receives recorded location data of the user devices 115 from the database 123 and determines a subset of the user devices 115 based on their last recorded location.
In one embodiment, the filtering engine 204 filters the set of other devices 115 based on the other user devices 115 that have recently interacted with the first user device 115. For example, the filtering engine 204 constructs a filtered list that includes the second user device 115 that sent at least 10 instant messages to the first user device 115 in the past week and the filtering engine 204.
In one embodiment, the filtering engine 204 generates a filtered list that includes the second user devices 115 that are often around the first user device 115. For example, if one or more second devices 115 are in proximity to the first user device 115 one or more times (e.g., 5 times, 10 times, etc.), the filtering engine 204 generates a filtered list of one or more second user devices 115 that include the device detector 202 to query.
In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 generates a filtered list of the user devices 115 by cross-referencing one or more likelihood maps. In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 receives signals from a GPS device embedded in the user device 115 or coupled to the user device 115. The GPS signal may indicate that some other user devices 115 may be within proximity. The filtering engine 204 generates a list of user devices 115 by referencing GPS signals. In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 generates a list of user devices 115 based on software updates through a server. For example, a user updates software on the user device 115 through the social network server 101; the filtering engine 204 receives a signal indicating a telephony software update and generates a list based on the signal. In some embodiments, the list generator 206 uses social network registration to generate a suggested list of devices to ping. For example, the social network registration indicates that friends of the first user are within proximity of the first user; the filtering engine 204 generates a suggested list of user devices 115 associated with friends to query. In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 receives a WiFi signal and confirms a list of user devices 115 within proximity based on the WiFi signal.
In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 generates an aggregated filtered list from the filtered lists of the plurality of filtering engines 204. For example, the top five chosen for each filtered list are aggregated and duplicates are removed.
In some embodiments, the filtering engine 204 is stored on the context server 107 and provides the filtered list to the device detector 202 stored on the first user device 115, which device detector 202 pings the user devices 115 on the filtered list. In another embodiment, the filtering engine 204 transmits the filtered list to the rights engine 206 on the first user device 115 and the rights engine 206 transmits the list of filtered user devices 115 for which the device detector 202 has the right to ping.
The rights engine 206 may be software including routines for enabling a user to configure privacy settings. In some embodiments, the privilege engine 206 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality that enables a user to configure privacy settings as described below. In some embodiments, the rights engine 206 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. The rights engine 206 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 234.
In some embodiments, the privilege engine 206 may enable the user to select which other users or which type of other users may ping the device identifier associated with the user device 115. For example, privilege engine 208 cooperates with user interface engine 210 to provide a user interface for a first user to give one or more other users the privilege to detect proximity of the first user. In some embodiments, the permissions engine 208 generates suggestions for the first user about other users to whom permissions are to be given based on the first user's social connections and provides the suggestions to the first user through a user interface. For example, privilege engine 208 provides the first user with an option of allowing types of connections (e.g., friends, family, etc.) in a certain social network to detect proximity of the first user. In some embodiments, the privilege engine 208 receives input from the first user specifying other users that may be allowed to detect proximity of the first user and configures the first user device 115 to specify privacy settings of the other users that may be allowed to detect the first user device 115. In some embodiments, the privilege engine 208 notifies the first user and other users allowed or obtains confirmation thereof before configuring the privacy settings for the first user device 115. For example, rights engine 208 cooperates with a server (e.g., social network server 101, context server 107, etc.) to generate emails to send to the first user and other users allowed for notification or confirmation.
In some embodiments, the rights engine 208 uses a fake Media Access Control (MAC) address to protect user device 115 privacy. The entitlement engine 208 replaces the MAC address of the first user device 115 with the newly generated fake MAC address. The entitlement engine 208 sends the fake MAC address to the other user devices 115 so that they will use the fake MAC address when ping the first user device 115. In some embodiments, the list of MAC addresses may be circular and common. For example, a new fake MAC address is associated with the first user device 115 every 6 months. The fake MAC address may be part of a set of MAC addresses or may be newly generated each time a fake MAC address is generated.
Ranking engine 208 may be software that includes routines for generating a ranked list of users and their proximity. In some embodiments, the ranking engine 208 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality for generating a ranked list of users and their proximity as described below. In some embodiments, the ranking engine 208 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. Ranking engine 208 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with processor 235, as well as other components of computing device 200, via signal line 236.
The ranking engine 207 receives a filtered list of second user devices 115 within proximity of the first user device 115 from the device detector 202. The ranking engine 207 ranks the second user devices 115 within the filtered list based on some criteria. In one embodiment, the ranking engine 208 ranks the second user devices 115 based on their physical distance from the first user device 115 and generates a ranked list of the second user devices 115. In another embodiment, the ranking engine 208 ranks the second user devices 115 based on their social connections with the first user. For example, a second user with a first level of social ties with the first user appears higher in the ranked list than a second user with a second level of social ties. In yet another embodiment, the ranking engine 208 ranks the second user device 115 based on a combination of a physical distance from the first user and a social connection with the first user. For example, ranking engine 208 assigns a weight to both factors (physical distance and social ties) based on some algorithm and computes a ranking score for second user device 115 by applying the weight. In this way, a second user (e.g., family) who has a closer social connection to the first user than other users (e.g., friends, followers, etc.) appears higher in the ranked list, even though the second user is physically further away from the first user than the other users who are ranked lower. Ranking engine 208 instructs user interface engine 210 to generate graphical data for displaying the ranked list.
In some embodiments, ranking engine 208 reorders the order of second user devices 115 in the filtered list of the first user based on the current context of the first user and/or the second user. For example, if the context server 107 determines that the first user is participating in the context of a professional meeting, the ranking engine 208 ranks the first user's colleagues and business partners higher in the list. In another example, if the device detector 202 detects that the first user is away from work and is in a bar, the ranking engine 208 ranks the friends of the first user higher than the business partners or clients.
In some embodiments, the ranking engine 208 picks the top number of user devices 115 in the list based on the ranking. For example, ranking engine 208 picks the top 100 users from the list. In another example, ranking engine 208 picks the top 10 users from a list of 50 users and loops the list if the context changes. For example, the list may be cycled at the end of each day and ranking engine 208 re-ranks the list based on the new context.
The user interface engine 210 may be software including routines for generating graphical data for providing a user interface to a user. In some embodiments, the user interface engine 210 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality for generating graphical data for providing a user interface to a user as described below. In some embodiments, the user interface engine 210 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. The user interface engine 210 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 238.
In some embodiments, the user interface engine 210 generates graphical data for providing the first user device 115 with a user interface for displaying a list of second user devices 115 within proximity of the first user device 115. The user interface engine 210 receives instructions from the device detector 202 if the filtered list is not ranked, or the user interface engine 210 receives instructions from the ranking engine 208 if the data is a ranked list. The user interface engine 210 sends graphical data to the first user device 115, which causes the first user device 115 to present a user interface to a user operating on the first user device 115. In some embodiments, the user interface engine 210 receives instructions from the rights engine 206 to generate graphical data for providing a user interface that allows users to allow other users to detect proximity of the user device 115. The user interface engine 210 may generate graphical data for providing other user interfaces to the user. For example, the user interface engine 210 receives instructions from the mode engine 214 to generate graphical data for providing a user interface for displaying a history of user actions while in proximity to the first user device 115. Example user interfaces are shown in fig. 6-8.
The device activator 212 may be software including routines for performing actions based on user proximity to the user device 115. In some embodiments, the device activator 212 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality for performing actions based on user proximity to the user device 115 as described below. In some embodiments, the device activator 212 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. The device activator 212 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 240.
In some embodiments, the device activator 212 controls the user device 115 to perform certain actions when a signal is received indicating that the user is in proximity to the user device 115. In some embodiments, the device activator 212 residing in the first user device 115 activates an application on the first user device 115 or preloads certain content onto the first user device 115 when the user's second user device 115 is proximate to the first user device 115. For example, the user goes home and travels with the second user device 115; the first user device 115 detects that the second user device 115 is within proximity and the device activator 212 in the first user device 115 opens certain applications on the first user device 115 or preloads certain content (e.g., music, video, etc.) onto the first user device 115 so that the user can use the applications or play the content without waiting when the user is home. In another example, the first user device 115 residing in the user's vehicle (e.g., car) detects that the second user device 115 is within proximity of the vehicle and the device activator 212 in the first user device 115 wakes up the first user device 115 or preloads the user with certain content (e.g., maps, music, etc.) to play without delay.
In some embodiments, the device activator 212 of the first user device 115 residing in the store preloads the user's information onto the first user device 115 when the user is within proximity of the store. For example, the user's information may include the user's profile, the user's history of visiting a store, the user's historical shopping records in the store, the user's actions in the store, the user's member information, and so forth. For example, the device activator 212 of the first user device 115 residing in the store preloads the user's historical shopping records when the user is within proximity of the store. The device activator 212 may cooperate with the user interface engine 210 to display a historical shopping record of the user on the first user device 115 so that the store may be ready for the user's arrival. For example, if most go to a coffee shop and order "coffee latte", the coffee shop may prepare the same order for the user when the user approaches the coffee shop again. This example is further described with reference to fig. 8.
In some embodiments, the device activator 212 may load information about the destination onto the user device 115 (e.g., phone) of the user when the user is within proximity of the destination. For example, when a user approaches a mall, the user device 115 (e.g., a phone) detects that the mall is within proximity of the user (e.g., the user device 115 associated with the mall by ping) and thus the device activator 212 residing on the user device 115 (e.g., a phone) loads mall information (e.g., a map of the store, a coupon, etc.) onto the user device 115. Alternatively, a user device 115 residing in a mall may detect the proximity of the user by ping the user device 115 (e.g., a cellular phone) and the user device 115 in the mall sends the mall information to the user device 115 (e.g., via the context server 107). The device activator 212 then loads the marketplace information onto the user device 115.
In one example, the device activator 212 is used in a medical setting, such as a hospital, to load information relating to a patient onto the first user device 115. For example, where the second device 115 belongs to a patient approaching a check-in center, the administrator's user device 115 loads information associated with the patient as the patient approaches. This may make medical treatment faster, as the user does not have to wait for registration. In addition, device activator 212 may load information from the patient related to the need (e.g., insurance cards, questionnaires for new physicians) before the patient arrives, which reduces the need to summon the patient back to a check-in desk to provide more information.
The pattern engine 214 may be software including routines for analyzing user actions to identify patterns. In some embodiments, the pattern engine 214 may be a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide functionality for analyzing user actions to identify patterns, as described below. In some embodiments, the mode engine 214 may be stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 235. The mode engine 214 may be adapted to cooperate and communicate with the processor 235 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 242.
In some embodiments, the pattern engine 214 determines one or more patterns based on the user's actions. For example, the user device 115 residing in the user's car during the work day detects that the user is driving from home to work at approximately 8 am and back home at approximately 6 pm. The pattern engine 214 stored in the user device 115 may thereafter determine the user's pattern, e.g., driving from home to work at 8 am on weekdays and returning at 6 pm. In some embodiments, the pattern engine 214 may apply machine learning techniques to learn patterns of user actions. In some embodiments, the mode engine 214 cooperates with the device activator 212 to determine a mode of the user and to control user device 115 actions based on the mode of the user. For example, the pattern engine 214 determines that on each day of work the user is at 6 PM: 30 hours and home and thus the device activator 212 is at about 6 pm: 30 preload the user's favorite music onto the user device 115 (e.g., music player, etc.) at home so that the user can listen to the music immediately after arrival.
In some embodiments, the pattern engine 212 cooperates with the device detector 202 to provide suggested actions to the user device 115. For example, the pattern engine 212 stored on the first user device 115 determines that every morning the user associated with the second user device will visit the store where the first user device 115 resides and buy a certain beverage and a certain type of breakfast. When the device detector 202 detects that the second user device 115 is within proximity of the store in the morning, the mode engine 214 determines that the user is likely to order the same beverage and the same type of breakfast based on the user's mode. Thus, once the second user device 115 is within proximity of the store, the mode engine 214 may instruct the store clerks in the store to prepare the beverage and breakfast for the user. For example, the mode engine 214 controls the user interface engine 210 to generate graphical data for providing a user interface that displays upcoming notifications to the user and information related to beverages and breakfast that the user typically orders.
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example method 300 for determining proximity between user devices 115. In the illustrated embodiment, the method 300 is divided between actions performed by the context server 107 and actions performed by the user device 115. Other configurations are also possible. For example, the user device 115 may perform all the steps. The method 300 may include determining 302 a context associated with the first user device 115. For example, the device detector 202 determines a context associated with the first user device 115 that includes a location, time, and/or action of the first user device 115. The method 300 may include querying 304 the other user devices 115 based on the context to create a set of other user devices 115 that satisfy the query. For example, the device detector 202 queries all other user devices 115 within a certain distance (e.g., a three mile radius) that are associated with a second user that the first user may know (e.g., a user connected to the first user on a social network, a user in the first user's contact list, a colleague, etc.). In some embodiments, the device detector 202 queries all other user devices 115 within the proximity of the first user device 115.
The method 300 includes generating 306 a list of filtered devices by filtering the set of other user devices 115. For example, one or more of the filtering engines 204 filters the user devices 115 based on a connection between a first user and a second user associated with the other user devices 115. In some other embodiments, the filtering engine 204 filters the second user device 115 based on the second user device's 115 connection with the first user and thereafter the device detector 202 queries the user devices 115 associated with the filtered second user to see if they are within proximity of the first user. The method 300 notifies 308 the first user device of the list of filtered devices. For example, the filtering engine 204 communicates a list of filtered devices to the device detector 202 stored on the first user device 115. The first user device 115 queries 310 the list of filtered devices to determine which filtered devices are within proximity of the first user device 115. In some embodiments, the first user device 115 queries using the bluetooth protocol.
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of an example method for notifying a first user device of a list of filtered devices within proximity of the first user device. In the illustrated embodiment, the method 400 may include determining 402 a location of the first user device 115 and generating 404 queries for other user devices 115 within a set distance from the first user device 115. The method 400 may include receiving 406 a set of other user devices 115 based on the query.
The method 400 may include filtering 408 the set of other user devices 115 based on the ties, privacy settings, and frequency of connections in the social network. For example, the one or more filtering engines 204 filter the set of other user devices 115 received through the query based on a nexus between a second set of users associated with the other user devices 115 and the first user, privacy settings of the second user device 115, and a frequency of contact between the second set of users and the first user. In another example, the one or more filtering engines 204 filter the set of other user devices 115 received from the server based on a nexus between a second set of users associated with the other user devices 115 and the first user, privacy settings of the second user device 115, and a frequency of contact between the second set of users and the first user. The method 400 also includes generating 410 a ranked list of filtered user devices 115 in rank order. For example, the ranking engine 208 reorders the set of other user devices 115 based on the distance of the other user devices 115 from the first user device 115 and/or the closeness of the nexus between the second user and the first user associated with the filtered user device 115. The ranked list of filtered devices may also be limited by a threshold number of filtered devices provided to the first user device 115. For example, the ranked list may be only 10 devices to preserve the battery life of the first user device. The method 400 may include providing 412 the ranked list of filtered devices to the first user device 115. For example, the user interface engine 210 generates graphical data for providing a user interface for displaying the ranked list of filtered devices on the first user device 115. The first user device queries 414 the ranked list of filtered devices, for example using bluetooth protocol, infrared, or audio.
Fig. 5 is an example method for notifying a first user device of actions associated with devices within proximity of the first user device, according to one embodiment. The method 500 may include determining 502 a location of the first user device 115. For example, the device detector 202 determines that the first user device 115 is at a coffee shop. The method 500 may include generating 504 queries for other user devices 115 within the set-up location. For example, the device detector 202 queries other user devices 115 within proximity of the store and used by users who purchased coffee at the store. The method 500 may also include receiving 506 a set of other user devices 115 based on the query. The method 500 can include the acts of filtering 508 the set of other user devices 115 when in previous proximity to the first user device 115 and determining 510 the other user devices 115 that are within the setting. For example, when the user has been proximate to the first user device 115, the device activator 212 determines historical actions of the user associated with the other user devices 115 (e.g., ordering a certain beverage). In another example, the pattern engine 216 determines a pattern of user actions when the user is already proximate to the first user device 115. The method 500 may include notifying 512 a user associated with the first user device 115 to take action to facilitate the action of the user device 115 when the user device 115 is proximate to the first user device 115. For example, when the second user device 115 is detected within proximity of the first user device 115, indicating that the second user is in the store, the device activator 212 notifies the user of the first user device 115 to prepare a certain beverage for the second user based on a determination that the second user typically ordered a certain beverage.
FIG. 6 is a graphical representation 600 of an example user interface generated by the user interface engine 210 for providing proximity of other users to a user. In the illustrated embodiment, the user interface 600 includes a proximity button 601 that the user can click to select who is found nearby. For example, if a first user clicks the proximity button 601, a list 603 of other users that are close to the first user will appear. The list 603 includes entries 611, 613, 615 indicating that three other users are near the first user, how they are connected to the first user, and their current physical distance from the first user. In the illustrated embodiment, list 603 may be a ranked list generated by ranking engine 208 based on some criteria. For example, the list 603 of other users 611, 613, 615 may be ranked based on how closely they are connected to the first user and how far they are physically away from the first user. The second user 613 is physically further from the first user than the third user 615, however the second user 613 is ranked higher because the second user 613 has a tighter connection (e.g., family) with the first user than the third user 615 (e.g., follower).
FIG. 7 is a graphical representation 700 of an example user interface generated by the user interface engine 210 that a user can allow others to detect the proximity of the user, according to one embodiment. The example user interface 700 includes a permissions button 701 that a user can click on to make privacy settings. For example, if the user clicks the permissions button 701, the user interface 700 provides the user with a detect permissions option to select. In the illustrated example, the user interface 700 displays a permissions options box 703, the permissions options box 703 including user-selectable entries to allow each person, people that the user follows only or is friends with the user on some social network, people that the user contacts only at least once, or some other user specified by the user.
FIG. 8 is a graphical representation 800 of an example user interface generated by the user interface engine 210 for providing a user's actions when in proximity, according to one embodiment. The example user interface 800 includes a proximity button 801 that a user can click to find out who is nearby. For example, the user interface 800 is displayed on the user device 115 in the coffee shop and employees of the shop may click on the proximity button 801 to find any users near the coffee shop. If the user device 115 detects any users within proximity, the user interface 800 provides a notification 803 indicating that the user is nearby. For example, notification 803 indicates that the user (e.g., Sara D.) is only 0.5 miles away and that she may want to order coffee. Thereafter, the user device 115 may retrieve the user's click history and the user interface 800 may display the user's click history, and the store's employees may determine actions based on the user's click history. For example, the user's ordering history 805 indicates that the user (e.g., Sara) generally orders a certain coffee (e.g., cafe latte). A clerk at the coffee shop can then prepare a certain coffee for the user based on the user's ordering history.
