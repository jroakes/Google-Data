Description
- This application is a continuation application and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/017,613, filed Jan. 22, 2008, which is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/017,597, filed Jan. 22, 2008, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- This document generally relates to information management.
- On-line advertisements allow advertisers to reach a wide range of viewers through the Internet. The selection of advertisements for display, such as with search results and other information, and the ordering of those advertisements, may be achieved by various techniques. In one example, an initial determination is made to identify all advertisements that are a match or near match for the applied search terms or other query items or information. The match may be made, for example, between one or more words in a query, and key words identified by an advertiser and associated with a particular advertisement or group of advertisements, such as a campaign. For example, a company selling fishing tackle may have a line of large lures, and may thus identify terms such as “lunker,” “sturgeon,” and “muskie fever” as keywords to associate with their advertisements for such large lures. Those advertisements may then be considered by the system for display when a search results are displayed to a user who enters such terms. The comparison may also be made between a search or query, and the text in an advertisement or the text in a target of a hyperlink in an advertisement, or to a combination of keywords, target text, and advertisement text, among other possible techniques. For example, the system may effectively select terms from an advertisement as key words so that the advertisement is selected for possible display when a search or other user action associated with the key words is submitted. An advertisement may be selected for possible display if there is a “near” match also, for example, if a query includes terms that are known synonyms or mistypings/misspellings of the key word terms for an advertisement.
- This document describes a system for allowing advertisers to target on-line advertisements based on environmental factors of end users. When determining what ads to serve to end users, the environmental factors can be used independently or in combination with matching of keywords associated with the advertisements and keywords in user search queries. A web browser or search engine located at the user's site may obtain information on the environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, light, sound, air composition) from sensors. Advertisers may specify that the ads are shown to users whose environmental conditions meet certain criteria. For example, advertisements for air conditioners can be sent to users located at regions having temperatures above a first threshold, while advertisements for winter overcoats can be sent to users located at regions having temperatures below a second threshold.
- In general, in one aspect, information about an environmental condition of a remote user who is accessing a network is received at a server, an advertisement based on the environmental condition is identified at the server, the information about the environmental condition being derived from an output of a sensor located at the remote user, and the advertisement is provided to the user through the network.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. The sensor can include an environmental sensor that provides information about the environmental condition. The sensor can be part of or coupled to a machine used by the user for accessing the network. At the server, the advertisement can be identified from among a plurality of advertisements by matching an environmental condition associated with the advertisement with the environmental condition of the user. The environmental condition can include at least one of temperature, humidity, sound, light, air composition, location, and speed of movement. The environmental condition can include at least one of soil, crop, or livestock conditions. The advertisement can be associated with a predetermined temperature condition, and the server can provide the advertisement to the user when the temperature at the user's site or at a geographical location of the user meets the predetermined temperature condition. The advertisement can be associated with a predetermined sound level condition, and the server provides the advertisement to the user when the ambient sound level at the user's site meets the predetermined sound level condition.
- A keyword query can be received from the user, the keyword query including one or more keywords, wherein the advertisement provided by the server is associated with the one or more keywords. Traffic condition of the user can be determined based on the information about the environmental condition, and the advertisement can be provided based on the traffic condition. Receiving information about the environmental condition can include identifying a geographical location of the user based on the sensor output, and receiving information about the environmental condition of the geographical location. Identifying the geographical location of the user can include identifying the geographical location of the user based on data from a global positioning system sensor or by signal triangulation.
- In general, in another aspect, at a server, a request for information from a remote user accessing a network is received, a location of the remote user is determined without using location information stored in a pre-established user profile, an environmental condition of the remote user is determined based on the location of the remote user, and an advertisement is identified based on the environmental condition. The requested information and the advertisement are provided from the server to the remote user through the network.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. The network can include a mobile phone network having base stations, and determining the location of the remote user can include determining the location of the remote user using information provided by a base station that receives signals from the remote user. The request from the remote user can include a request for information. The request for information can include a request for phone directory information. The request for information can include a request for a document.
- In general, in another aspect, from a client device, information about an environmental condition of a user of the client device who is accessing a network is provided to a remote server, and an advertisement that is identified at the server based on the environmental condition is received at the client device. At the client device, the advertisement is presented to the user.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. Providing to a remote server information about an environmental condition can include providing to the remote server information about an environmental condition that is derived from an output of a sensor of the client device or a sensor coupled to the client device. The environmental condition can include temperature, humidity, sound, light, air composition, location, or speed of movement. A keyword query can be provided from the user to the server, the keyword query including one or more keywords, wherein the advertisement provided by the server can be associated with the one or more keywords. Traffic condition of the user can be provided based on the information about the environmental condition and advertisement that is identified based on the traffic condition can be received.
- In general, in another aspect, information about an environmental condition of a remote device is received, the environmental condition being determined based on a signal output from a sensor of the remote device or a sensor coupled to the remote device; an advertisement is identified based on the environmental condition; and the advertisement is provided to the remote device.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. An audio, image, or video signal can be received from the sensor and the environmental condition can be determined based on the audio, image, or video signal, respectively.

- Referring to
FIG. 1 , an exemplaryinformation retrieval system 100 retrieves and provides information (e.g., web documents) and content 102 (e.g., advertisements or simply ads) that match search queries submitted byremote users 104. Thesystem 100 includes asearch server 106 that enables theusers 104 to search for information using, for example, a keyword search. Thesystem 100 is configured to receive information about environmental conditions of theremote users 104, use the environmental conditions as one of the criteria for identifyingads 102, and provide theads 102 to theusers 104. Sponsors of theads 102 generate higher revenue when their ads are clicked on or acted upon. By using environmental conditions of theusers 104 as one of the criteria for selectingads 102, morerelevant ads 102 can be served to theusers 104, increasing the likelihood of theads 102 being clicked on or acted upon. - The
content 102 is not limited to advertisements, and can include various types of information useful to theusers 104, such as weather and traffic information. - The
user 104 may use aweb browser 108 executing on a client terminal 110 (e.g., personal computer, personal digital assistant, mobile phone, media player, in-vehicle terminal) to access thesearch server 106 through a network 112 (e.g., Internet). One ormore sensors 114 provide information about environmental conditions of theuser 104. Thesensors 114 can be configured to sense, for example, temperature, humidity, sound, light, and/or air composition. Sensing air composition may including sensing odors, smog, dust, pollen, pollutant, or other particles or molecules in the air. Thesensors 114 can include a digital camera to obtain images of the environment. Thesensors 114 can include a positioning sensor, such as a global positioning system (GPS) sensor, that provides location information. The location information can be used to access services (e.g., weather channel websites) that provide environmental conditions of a given location. Location information can also be inferred from other means. For example, theclient terminal 110 can be a cell phone, and location information can be derived from information about base stations that the cell phone is connected to. - The
sensors 114 can be integrated with theclient terminal 110. Thesensors 114 can also include a stand-alone device that is connected to theclient terminal 110 through a wired or wireless connection, such as a USB (universal serial bus), Bluetooth®, radio frequency, or infrared link. - An environmental
condition monitor application 120 is executed on theclient terminal 110 for processing data generated by theenvironmental sensors 114. For example, the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 may process audio signals from an audio sensor and filter sporadic signals to determine a long term ambient noise level. The environmentalcondition monitor application 120 may process temperature signals from a temperature sensor to detect a temperature pattern, such as an average temperature above a certain level for a number of hours per day for a number of days. The environmentalcondition monitor application 120 may process ambient light signals from an ambient light sensor to detect an ambient light pattern, such as an average ambient brightness above a certain level for a number of hours per day for a number of days. - The environmental
condition monitor application 120 may also access, through thenetwork 112, services that provide information about general environmental conditions at the geographical region where theuser 104 is located. The environmentalcondition monitor application 120 may request theuser 104 to input address information during a setup process. The environmentalcondition monitor application 120 may access a weather service, a pollution alert, and an allergy alert to obtain information about local weather (e.g., outdoor temperature), pollution, and allergy conditions. - The environmental
condition monitor application 120 may share thesensors 114 with other applications. For example, thesensors 114 can include a microphone of a personal computer or a mobile phone that is used in speech recognition, phone calling, or video conferencing applications. The microphone can also be used by the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 for sensing ambient noise. Thesensors 114 can include a light sensor of a display of theclient terminal 110 for sensing ambient light to determine the brightness of the display. The light sensor can also be used by the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 for sensing ambient light to determine a likelihood that theuser 104 is in an indoor or outdoor environment. - It is important to respect the privacy of the
users 104. The environmentalcondition monitor application 120 may provide theuser 104 with options of enabling or disabling some or all of thesensors 114 for the purpose of gathering information to support advertisements. A privacy policy may be provided to theuser 104 to specify what information is gathered and how the information is used. Theuser 104 can turn off the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 to prevent any information about the environmental condition from being gathered. - The
web browser 108 is configured to receive information from the environmentalcondition monitor application 120. When theuser 104 accesses thesearch server 106 to search for information, theweb browser 108 sends a search request that includes a search query and information about the environmental conditions of theuser 104 to thesearch server 106. The search query may include one or more search terms (e.g., keywords or key phrases). In response, thesearch server 106 searches anindex 118, returns a list of documents (e.g., web pages) having keywords that match the search query submitted by theuser 104, and provides the list of documents in a sequence according to rank scores of the documents. Thesearch server 106 may also causeads 102 to be displayed alongside the list of returned documents. Theads 102 may be provided by anad server 116 that selects theads 102 based on the keywords and environmental conditions. - The
search server 106 sends the keywords in the user's search query and information about the environmental conditions of theuser 104 to thead server 116. Thead server 116 selectsads 102 based on several criteria. One criterion is how close the keywords associated with theads 102 match the keywords in the user's search query. Another criterion is how close the environmental conditions of theuser 104 match the environmental conditions associated with theads 102. Thead server 116 selects a list of ads ranked according to the criteria specified above and sends the list of ads to thesearch server 106. Thesearch server 106 sends the search results and theads 106 to theuser 104. Some ads, such as video ads, may require theweb browser 108 to connect to thead server 116 to stream data (e.g., video) from thead server 116. - When advertisers or sponsors provide the
ads 102 to thesystem 100, the advertisers may specify the environmental conditions that are relevant to theads 102. For example, a seller of air conditioners may specify that anad 102 for air conditioners should be sent tousers 104 who are searching for information about air conditioners and are situated in environments where the temperatures sensed by thesensors 114 are above a preset level (e.g., 80° F.). When auser 104 searches for information about air conditioners and is situated in a high temperature environment, there is a high likelihood that theuser 104 may be interested in purchasing an air conditioner in the near future. - The advertiser may specify that the air conditioner ad be served to a
user 104 located in a geographical region (e.g., city) where the outdoor temperature is above a preset level (e.g., 80° F.). The advertiser may specify that the air conditioner ad should not be served to auser 104 located in an environment where the room temperature as sensed by thesensors 114 is below a first preset level (e.g., 75° F.) and the outdoor temperature is above a second preset level (e.g., 80° F.). This may indicate that theuser 104 is already in an air conditioned environment (or otherwise cool environment, such as the basement) where air conditioners are not needed. - In order for the
air conditioner ad 102 to reach a wide audience, the advertiser may specify that a percentage of the ad budget is used to serve thead 102 tousers 104 who search for information about air conditioners regardless of their environmental conditions, a percentage of the ad budget is used to serve thead 102 tousers 104 who search for information about air conditioners and are in high temperature environments, and a percentage of the ad budget is used to serve thead 102 tousers 104 who are in high temperature environments regardless of the information being sought by theusers 104. - Similarly, a seller of heaters may specify that an
ad 102 for heaters be served tousers 104 who are searching for information about heaters and situated in environments that meet certain temperature conditions.Ads 102 for winter overcoats can be sent tousers 104 located at regions having temperatures below a threshold.Ads 102 for humidifiers can be sent tousers 104 situated in a humid environment. A seller of beers may specify thatads 102 showing cool beers be sent tousers 104 in high temperature environments. A restaurant serving hot pots may specify thatads 102 showing hot pots be sent tousers 104 in low temperature environments. - For example, a seller of noise canceling headphones may specify that an
ad 102 for noise canceling headphones be served to auser 104 located in an environment where the ambient noise is above a preset level (e.g., 70 dB). The advertiser may specify that the ambient noise level be above the preset level for more than a preset period of time (e.g., noisy levels detected for at least one hour per day for at least two consecutive days). - In some examples, the
user 104 may sign up for a service provided by a service provider, in which provision of the service requires information from thesensors 114. For example, a farmer may usesensors 114 to sense soil, crop, and livestock conditions on a farm. The data from the sensors may be sent to a service provider that remotely diagnose and monitor health conditions of the crops and livestock. Thesensors 114 may be provided to the farmer at a subsidized cost in exchange for the farmer agreeing to receiveads 102 that are delivered to a terminal on the farm based on data feed from thesensors 114. The data from thesensors 114 may be used to targetads 102 from sellers of seeds, fertilizers, feedstock, pesticides, farm machinery, or any other potential supplier of the farm. - In some examples, location information obtained from the
sensors 114 can be used to infer that theuser 104 is waiting in a traffic jam. For example, the location information may indicate that theuser 104 is located on a highway and moving very slowly. Links to websites having information about mass transit and/or car pooling may be provided to theuser 104. Location information may be used to infer that an earthquake has recently occurred in the geographical region where theuser 104 is located.Ads 102 for structural engineers may be provided to theuser 104. - Location information obtained from the
sensors 114 can be used to infer a change of weather conditions at the locations of theusers 104, andrelevant ads 102 or announcements may be sent to theusers 104. Various examples are given below. During seasonal changes, ads for outerwear suitable for the user's location may be provided to theuser 104.Ads 102 for light jackets may be provided tousers 104 located in regions with mild winters, andads 102 for heavy overcoats and snow boots may be provided tousers 104 in regions with severe winters. Near the start of winter season,ads 102 for snow blowers may be provided tousers 104 located at geographical regions where heavy snowfalls occur. - In some implementations, the
system 100 may provide business listing search service, e.g., Google Voice Local Search. Theclient terminal 110 can be a cell phone that includessensors 114 such as a digital camera, a microphone, and a position sensor (e.g., a GPS sensor). When theuser 104 calls 1-800-GOOG-411, thesystem 100 provides business listing information according to user request. Thesystem 100 may also provide ads that are selected based on information obtained from one ormore sensors 114, such as images of ambient environment, ambient noise, and location information. - For example, the
user 104 may be in a sports stadium and calling GOOG-411 for information about a nearby restaurant. The cheering of crowds and announcements made during the sports event may be picked up by the cell phone microphone. Thesystem 100 may be able to determine the type of sports event based on the background noise. If location information is available, thesystem 100 may compare the location information with locations of known sports events and determine which sports event theuser 104 is attending. Ads that may be of interest to fans of the sports event may be served to theuser 104. For example, links to websites that provide sports news and statistics may be provided to thecaller 104. - Similarly, when a
user 104 calls GOOG-411 for information about a nearby restaurant before a concert or during intermission, the tuning of instruments during the pre-concert or intermission period may be picked up by the cell phone microphone. If location information is available, thesystem 100 may compare the location information with locations of known musical events and determine which musical event theuser 104 is attending. While GPS information may not be available indoors, such as in a music hall, the cell phone may store the last available GPS data prior to entering the music hall, and the GPS data can be provided to thesystem 100. Alternatively, location information can be inferred by cell phone signal triangulation. Ads that may be of interest to fans of the musical event may be served to theuser 104. For example, links to websites that provide news of musicians, or ads of albums, instruments, or audio equipment may be provided to thecaller 104. - When a
user 104 is at a train or subway station, the background noise may include announcements of arriving or departing trains that can be used to infer the location of theuser 104. - As discussed above, the
client terminal 110 has privacy protection features and allows theuser 104 to enable or disable some or all of thesensors 114 for the purpose of gathering information to support advertisements. - A feature of the
system 100 is that it can deliver advertisements that targetindividual users 104 based on environmental conditions of the individual users. For example, one user may live next to a busy street and more likely to be interested in receiving ads for noise canceling headphones than another user located on a quiet cul-de-sac a few blocks away. One user may have a damp basement and more likely to be interested in receiving ads for dehumidifiers, while another user located nearby may live in a house where dampness is not a problem. The interests of users inside a stadium may be different from the interests of users outside of the stadium. Compared to ads delivered through broadcast systems and received through radios or televisions, the on-line ads delivered by thesystem 100 can more closely match the interests of theusers 104. - The
system 100 includes an environmentalcondition determination engine 122 that determines general environmental conditions of theuser 104 based on information about theuser 104 that is not obtained by thesensors 114. For example, the environmentalcondition determination engine 122 can be used when theclient terminal 110 does not haverelevant sensors 114, when the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 is not installed on theclient terminal 110, or when the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 is turned off by theuser 104. For example, when auser 104 accesses thesearch server 106, thesystem 100 may be able to derive the location of theuser 104 based on an Internet Protocol (IP) address of theclient terminal 110. Theclient terminal 110 may send location information (e.g., obtained from a GPS sensor) to thesearch server 106. The environmentalcondition determination engine 122 obtains information about general environmental conditions of theuser 104 based on the user's location using, for example, services that provide weather, pollution, or allergy conditions. - In some examples, the
system 100 may provide a service (e.g., e-mail service) that requires registration. Theusers 104 provide residence address information as part of the registration process. When auser 104 accesses the service, the environmentalcondition determination engine 122 determines the general environmental conditions (e.g., weather, air pollution, allergy conditions, etc.) of theuser 104 based on the registered residence address. Information about the general environmental conditions can be used by thead server 116 in selecting ads to be served to theuser 104. - Referring to
FIG. 2 , in some implementations,users 104 access aserver 160 of a third party service provider to request information. The service provider can be, e.g., a publisher of premium content, such as financial news and analyses. The service provider can be a member of an ad network that delivers ads served by thead server 116. Whenusers 104 sign up for services provided by the service provider, theusers 104 provide residence addresses as part of the registration process. - When a
user 104 uses theweb browser 108 to access the service provided by theserver 160, theweb browser 108 may forward information about environmental conditions (received from the environmental condition monitor application 120) to theserver 160. Theserver 160 forwards the environmental condition information to thesystem 100. Theserver 160 also sends information about theuser 104, such as the user's residence address, to thesystem 100. The environmentalcondition determination engine 122 determines the general environmental conditions of theuser 104 based on the information about the user, such as the user's residence address. Information about the user's environmental conditions provided by the environmentalcondition monitor application 120 and the environmentalcondition determination engine 122 can be used by thead server 116 in selecting ads to be served to theserver 160. Theserver 160 delivers requested information and the ads to theuser 104. - In some examples, the
client machine 110 can be placed in a public location and viewed or accessed by several users. For example, theclient machine 110 can be a digital billboard, a digital kiosk, a vending machine, or a public address system that delivers advertisements selected based on environmental conditions. - Referring to
FIG. 3 , auser 104 can use aclient terminal 260 to access services provided by anapplication server 262, in which theapplication server 262 provides information and content items (e.g., ads) based on the environmental conditions of theuser 104. Theclient terminal 260 does not necessarily execute aweb browser 108 or an environmentalcondition monitor application 120. For example, theclient terminal 260 can be amobile phone 260. - In one implementation, when the
user 104 uses themobile phone 260 to access a service provided by anapplication server 262, theapplication server 262 determines a location of theuser 104 using information obtained from mobile phone base stations that receive signals from themobile phone 260. When theuser 104 dials a number to request information, theapplication server 262 determines the location of theuser 104, identifies environmental conditions (e.g., weather) at the user's location, and delivers the requested information and ads that are selected based on the environmental conditions. In some implementations, theapplication server 262 can infer the destination of theuser 104, and select ads that are based on the environmental conditions of the destination. - For example, the
application server 262 may provide a phone directory service, such as GOOG-411 service. As an example, when theuser 104 dials GOOG-411 to look up information about a museum, if theapplication server 262 determines that the city where the user's located has a high temperature, the application sever 262 may provide theuser 104 information about the museum and a message indicating, for example, there is an ice cream store nearby. - For example, the
application server 262 can provide theuser 104 information about the museum, then ask theuser 104 whether he/she is interested in hearing information about other local businesses or attractions. If theuser 104 expresses interest in receiving additional information, theapplication server 262 can identify the businesses in the vicinity of the user and provide information about those businesses in a sequence determined based on criteria that include environmental conditions. - The information provided by the
application server 262 to theuser 104 can be advertisements provided by advertisers or other information available to theapplication server 262. When providing a list of local attractions to theuser 104, theapplication server 262 may take into account the environmental condition (e.g., local weather) when ranking the local attractions. For example, when theuser 104 is asking about local attractions on rainy days, theapplication server 262 may rank indoor facilities (e.g., museums) higher than outdoor facilities (e.g., parks), and vice versa on sunny days. - Referring to
FIG. 4 , an exemplaryinformation delivery system 160 includesdigital billboards 162 placed at public locations, such as train station platforms or pedestrian sidewalks. Thedigital billboard 162 has adisplay 170 that showsinformation 172, such as train schedules or other public announcements. Thedisplay 170 can also show advertisements. Thedigital billboard 162 has built-insensors 164 a and/orexternal sensors 164 b (collectively referenced as 164). The sensors 164 may include, e.g., a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a rain gauge, and/or a snow gauge. Theexternal sensors 164 b can be placed at, for example, roof tops to allow sensing of rain and/or snow, and communicate with thedigital billboard 162 using wired or wireless links. - Information about environmental conditions detected by the sensors 164 is sent through a
network 112 to anad server 116, which selectsads 102 according to the environmental conditions, e.g., in addition to other criteria. For example, during the winter season, when the temperature is below a preset value (e.g., 32° F.), thead server 116 can deliver, e.g., ads forski resorts 166 and ads forwinter overcoats 168 to thedigital billboard 162. During the summer season, when the temperature is above a preset value (e.g., 85° F.), thead server 116 can deliver, e.g., ads for beach resorts or air conditioners to thedigital billboard 162. - Ads that are delivered based on environmental conditions may be more effective than ads delivered without consideration of environmental conditions. For example, it may be more effective to show ads for winter coats on the
digital billboard 162 on the first chilly day in late autumn or early winter when shoppers are starting to buy winter clothes than showing the ads on warmer days. It may be more effective to show ads for snow boots on thedigital billboard 162 during the first day of snow accumulation. It may also be more effective to show ads for rain gear on thedigital billboard 162 during rainy days than sunny days. - In some implementations, the
system 160 may allow sponsors of ads to select various criteria for placement of ads, and the bidding price may vary depending on the selected criteria. For example, thesystem 160 may have several digital billboards at various locations across the country. Thesystem 160 may allow sponsors of ads to specify particular days (e.g., ads shown on weekdays may be more expensive than ads shown on weekends), particular time slots within a day (e.g., rush hour time slots may be more expensive than non-rush hour time slots), particular locations (e.g., ads shown at major train stations may be more expensive than ads shown at small train stations), particular billboards within a location (e.g., a train station may have several digital billboards and ads shown on billboards located at higher traffic areas may be more expensive than ads shown on billboards located at lower traffic areas). The system may allow the sponsors to specify particular environmental conditions and time period after occurrence of particular environmental conditions. For example, ads for winter clothing shown on the first day of frost may be more expensive than similar ads shown a week later, and ads for air conditioners shown on the first day of occurrence of a heat wave may be more expensive than similar ads shown a week later. - For example, sponsors can bid for placement of ads at a particular digital billboard located at a particular major train station at a particular time slot during rush hour on weekdays. Sponsors can also bid for placement of ads at any one of a number of selected locations when certain environmental conditions are met (e.g., the temperature is below 32° F.).
- In some implementations, the
system 160 may provide a preset schedule for showing ads on thedigital billboard 162, in which the preset schedule can be overridden when certain environmental conditions are met. For example, thebillboard 162 can be configured to show a first ad A1 according to a regular schedule. If a predetermined environmental condition is met, thedigital billboard 162 replaces the ad A1 with another ad A2 and provides a credit to the sponsor of the ad A1. - A feature of the
system 160 is that it allows effective placement of ads for items that are associated with certain environmental conditions. For example, rather than spending money advertising a new line of winter coats on a large number of digital billboards across the country, it may be more cost effective to advertise on a smaller number of digital billboards when the local temperature is below a certain threshold. By providing ads that are selected based in part on environmental conditions, more relevant ads may be shown to the viewers of thedigital billboard 162, providing a better user experience. - In some implementations, the
system 160 includes digital billboards 164 located in shopping malls or walkways of strip malls. Stores in the shopping mall may sign up for display of ads on the digital billboard 164 based on environmental conditions. For example, a store selling rain gear may bid for placement of an ad on the digital billboard 164 when it is raining, a store selling winter coats, winter sports goods, or heaters may bid for placement of an ad when the outdoors temperature is below a preset value, and a store selling air conditioners or fans may bid for placement of an ad when the outdoors temperature is above a preset value. - Shopping malls and strip malls may be large and often shoppers do not have time to visit every store, or may not know the existence of certain stores. Shows ads on the digital billboard based on environmental conditions provides a way to attract the attention of shoppers when the shoppers are most likely to pay attention to the ads.
- Referring to
FIG. 5 , an exemplaryinformation delivery system 180 allows delivery of ads that are selected based on environmental conditions of a local region. For example, a shopping mall may have a wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi) network that allowsshoppers 188 to use, e.g.,mobile phones 190 to access aweb site 184 hosted by amall server computer 182. The shoppingmall web site 184 may provide information about the stores in the mall, such as locations of the various stores and brief descriptions of the goods sold at the stores. Theweb site 184 may also display advertisements of the stores, in which the advertisements can be selected based on environmental conditions detected bysensors 186. - In some implementations, upon entering the
shopping mall 182, ashopper 188 can use amobile phone 190 to access themall web site 184 and look up a list ofads 192 showing, e.g., stores having items on sale. Ads that are placed earlier in the list may be more expensive than those placed later in the list. Sponsors may bid different prices depending on environmental conditions. For example, a store selling winter coats may bid $x1 for placement of an ad on the list when the outdoors temperature is above a preset value, and bid $x2 when the outdoors temperature is below the preset value. By providing ads that are selected based in part on environmental conditions, more relevant ads may be shown to theshoppers 188, providing a better shopping experience. - In some implementations, a public address system may broadcast pre-schedules programs (e.g., background music or public announcements) and advertisements. The advertisements in the form of audio files may be selected dynamically by an
ad server 116 according to environmental conditions and played during time slots allocated for advertisements. - Other than selecting ads based on the environmental conditions, the system can adjust ad campaigns based on environmental conditions. For example, an ad network may allow advertisers to deliver ads to different types of media, such as Internet, radio, television, and digital billboards. Ad consumption for different types of media may be different depending on environmental conditions.
- For example, during cold and rainy days, people may spend more time indoors, whereas during warm and sunny days, people may spend more time outdoors. The system may provide the option to allow an advertiser to increase the percentage of ad budget or bid amount for delivering ads to outdoor digital billboards on warm and sunny days, and increase the percentage of ad budget or bid amount for delivering ads to indoor digital billboards on cold and rainy days. The system may provide the option to allow an advertiser to increase the ad budget or bid amount for Internet ads and television ads on cold and rainy days (perhaps on the assumption that more people will be staying home surfing the Internet or watching television) and decrease the ad budget or bid amount for Internet ads and television ads on warm and sunny days (perhaps on the assumption that more people will be enjoying outdoor activities).
- Referring to
FIG. 6 , an exemplary graphical user interface (GUI) 130 is provided to allow an advertiser to configure parameters associated with anad 102. TheGUI 130 includes anarea 132 for showing the ad content that is displayed to theend user 104, anarea 134 for configuring keywords associated with thead 102, and anarea 136 for specifying the environmental conditions associated with thead 102. Thearea 136 includeareas area 138 a allows the advertiser to specify conditions for room temperature and outdoor temperature. TheGUI 130 can be used to configure other environmental conditions, or other parameters associated with thead 102. - In some implementations, the
GUI 130 may provide options to allow the advertiser to bid for different amounts depending on whether thead 102 is delivered tousers 104 based on environmental conditions. For example, the advertiser may specify a first price that he is willing to pay when anad 102 for air conditioners is delivered tousers 104 based on a matching of keywords alone, and a second price when theair conditioner ad 102 is delivered tousers 104 based on a matching of keywords and environmental conditions. - In some implementations, the
GUI 130 may provide options to allow the advertiser to bid for different amounts depending on time periods after occurrence of certain environmental conditions. For example, an advertiser may specify a formula F1(t) for the price that he is willing to pay for delivery of anad 102 for winter overcoats, where t is the time from the morning of the first day of frost, or specify a formula F2(t) for the price for delivery of anad 102 for air conditioners, where t is the time from the occurrence of a heat wave. - Referring to
FIG. 7 , anexemplary process 150 can be used for serving ads using environmental conditions as one of the criteria for selecting the ads. Theprocess 150 receives information about an environmental condition of a remote user who is accessing a network (152). For example, the information can be generated by thesensors 114 and received by the search sever 106 (FIG. 1 ). The network can be thenetwork 112. The environmental condition can be determined based on location information of the user. The location information of the user can be determined without using location information stored in a pre-established user profile. For example, the environmentalcondition determination engine 122 can be used to determine the environmental condition of the user based on the IP address of theuser 104 or a registered residence address of theuser 104. - The
process 150 identifies on-line ads based on the environmental condition (154). For example, thead server 116 may identify the on-line ads 102. Theprocess 150 provides the on-line ads to the user through the network (156). For example, thesystem 100 can provideads 102 to theuser 104. - Referring to
FIG. 8 , anexemplary process 230 can be used for receiving ads that are identified based on environmental conditions. For example, a client device provides to a remote server information about an environmental condition of a user of the client device who is accessing a network, in which the information about the environmental condition is derived from an output of a sensor of the client device or a sensor coupled to the client device (232). For example, the client device can be the client terminal 110 (FIG. 1 ), and the remote server can be thead server 116. - In some examples, the sensor can include an environmental sensor that provides information about the environmental condition. The environmental condition can include temperature, humidity, sound, light, air composition, location, or speed of movement. In some examples, the sensor includes a GPS sensor, and the
process 230 includes identifying a geographical location of the user based on the sensor output and identifying information about the environmental condition of the geographical location. - The client device receives an on-line advertisement that is identified at the server based on the environmental condition (234). The client device provides the on-line advertisement to the user (236).
- In some examples, the
process 230 includes providing a keyword query from the user to the server, the keyword query including one or more keywords, and the on-line advertisement are selected by the server based on the one or more keywords and the environmental condition. In some examples, theprocess 230 provides a traffic condition of the user based on the information about the environmental condition, and the on-line advertisement is identified based on the traffic condition. - Referring to
FIG. 9 , anexemplary process 240 can be used for serving ads that are identified based on environmental conditions. Information about an environmental condition of a remote device are received, in which the environmental condition is determined based on a signal output from a sensor of the remote device or a sensor coupled to the remote device (242). - In some examples, an audio, image, or video signal is received from the sensor, and the environmental condition is determined based on the audio, image, or video signal. In some examples, the remote device is a mobile phone. An audio signal including a voice instruction from a user is received at the mobile phone. The environmental condition can be determined based on background sounds in the audio signal. An event can be determined based on the signal output from the sensor and location information. For example, the event can be a sports event or a musical event.
- An on-line advertisement is identified based on the environmental condition (244). The on-line advertisement is provided to the remote device (246). In some examples, the remote device includes a visual or audio user interface. For example, the remote device can be a digital billboard, a digital kiosk, a vendor machine, or a public address system. A visual advertisement can be provided for displaying on a display of the digital billboard, digital kiosk, or vending machine. An audio advertisement can be provided for playing through an audio output of the digital billboard, digital kiosk, vending machine, or public address system.
- Referring to
FIG. 10 , anexemplary process 250 can be used configure ad campaigns. Theprocess 250 enables a sponsor to configure an ad campaign based on criteria that include environmental conditions (252). For example, a user interface can be provided to the sponsor to allow the sponsor to specify different ad budgets for different environmental conditions. For example, the user interface may allow the sponsor specify how allocation of ad budgets for different types of media, bid amounts of ads for different types of media, allocation of ad budgets for different products, or bid amounts of ads for different products are adjusted based on the environmental conditions. - The
process 250 includes receiving information about environmental conditions (252), and dynamically adjusting the ad campaign based on the environmental conditions (254). For example, the allocation of ad budgets for different types of media, the bid amounts of ads for different types of media, the allocation of ad budgets for different products, or the bid amounts of ads for different products can be adjusted based on the environmental conditions. - Referring to
FIG. 11 , anexemplary process 270 can be used configure ad campaigns. Theprocess 270 enables advertisers to associate advertisements with one or more environmental conditions to allow the advertisements to be provided to users whose environmental conditions match the environmental conditions associated with the advertisements (272). The process enables the advertisers to bid for environmental conditions associated with one or more keywords (274). - For example, a user interface can be provided to allow the advertiser to associate the advertisement with the environmental condition. The user interface can be configured to allow the advertiser to bid for environmental conditions associated with one or more keywords. The environmental condition can include, for example, at least one of temperature, humidity, sound, light, air composition, location, and speed of movement.
