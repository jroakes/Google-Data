Definitions
- the present disclosure generally relates to linking Internet-based applications and services to broadcast media programs, and in particular, to providing users with real-time access to associated applications and services while a broadcast media program is playing.
- Internet-enabled electronic devices are increasingly interested in real-time access to Internet-based media applications and services associated with broadcast media programs (e.g. TV programs, sports events, pay-per-view events and movies, etc.).
- broadcast media programs e.g. TV programs, sports events, pay-per-view events and movies, etc.
- Some users are deterred by the effort it takes to find and access Internet-based applications and services associated with broadcast media programs.
- the current methods of discovering and accessing online applications and services are primarily user-driven.
- discovering applications and/or services associated with a broadcast media program currently requires users to take some action beyond the viewing experience to find the associated content, such as a keyword search using an Internet search engine.
- a user-driven search generally tends to be ad hoc, and often produces incomplete search results.
- a user-driven search can also lead a particular user astray to topics and/or content providers that are unrelated or only tangentially related to the broadcast media program. Consequently, an opportunity to further engage that particular user has been lost along with an opportunity to monetize the Internet-based user engagement.
- the users also lose out. For example, it is difficult for a casual viewer to determine public or community opinion about a particular subject that is occurring in real-time (e.g. a televised political debate).
- users have to seek out various content publishers that post content about the subject, including source-synchronous and quasi-officially approved posts from producers, cast members and/or other program representatives. It can be time consuming to decipher public or community opinion about the subject from ratings, articles and/or comments posted on websites or micro-blogging applications.
- the total amount of Internet searching involved may take longer than the duration of the TV program, which makes trying to determine public or community opinion about the TV program in real-time a futile endeavor.
- users that are led astray may simply overlook related applications and/or services provided by the content provider responsible for broadcast media program.
- Systems, methods and devices described herein enable users of Internet-enabled devices to access various Internet-based media applications and services associated with broadcast media programs in real-time.

Abstract
Systems, methods and devices described herein enable users of Internet-enabled devices to view and access various Internet-based media applications and services associated with broadcast media programs in real-time. For example, in some implementations systems, methods and devices are operable to synchronize the user interface of a client device with the real-time broadcast of a particular broadcast media program. In turn, the device is enabled to receive entity metadata associated with at least one identifiable entity included in the particular broadcast media program. The entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media application or service associated with the at least one identifiable entity. The device then presents the availability of access to the at least one media application or service associated with the particular broadcast media program to the user via the user interface of the client device in real-time.
Description
- This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/800,562, filed Mar. 15, 2013, entitled “Social Network Augmentation of Broadcast Media,” which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- The present disclosure generally relates to linking Internet-based applications and services to broadcast media programs, and in particular, to providing users with real-time access to associated applications and services while a broadcast media program is playing.
- Users of Internet-enabled electronic devices are increasingly interested in real-time access to Internet-based media applications and services associated with broadcast media programs (e.g. TV programs, sports events, pay-per-view events and movies, etc.). Currently, however, it is relatively cumbersome for a user to find and access related media applications and services associated with a broadcast media program in real-time. Some users are deterred by the effort it takes to find and access Internet-based applications and services associated with broadcast media programs.
- The current methods of discovering and accessing online applications and services are primarily user-driven. At the outset, discovering applications and/or services associated with a broadcast media program currently requires users to take some action beyond the viewing experience to find the associated content, such as a keyword search using an Internet search engine. A user-driven search generally tends to be ad hoc, and often produces incomplete search results. A user-driven search can also lead a particular user astray to topics and/or content providers that are unrelated or only tangentially related to the broadcast media program. Consequently, an opportunity to further engage that particular user has been lost along with an opportunity to monetize the Internet-based user engagement.
- The users also lose out. For example, it is difficult for a casual viewer to determine public or community opinion about a particular subject that is occurring in real-time (e.g. a televised political debate). Typically, users have to seek out various content publishers that post content about the subject, including source-synchronous and quasi-officially approved posts from producers, cast members and/or other program representatives. It can be time consuming to decipher public or community opinion about the subject from ratings, articles and/or comments posted on websites or micro-blogging applications. For example, in the case of a TV program, the total amount of Internet searching involved may take longer than the duration of the TV program, which makes trying to determine public or community opinion about the TV program in real-time a futile endeavor. In another example, users that are led astray may simply overlook related applications and/or services provided by the content provider responsible for broadcast media program.
- Systems, methods and devices described herein enable users of Internet-enabled devices to access various Internet-based media applications and services associated with broadcast media programs in real-time. Features of various implementations enable users of Internet-enabled devices to view and access various Internet-based media applications and services associated with a broadcast media program in real-time. For example, in some implementations systems, methods and devices are operable to synchronize the user interface of a client device with the real-time broadcast of a particular broadcast media program. In turn, the device is enabled to receive entity metadata associated with at least one identifiable entity included in the particular broadcast media program. The entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media application or service associated with the at least one identifiable entity. The client device then presents the availability of access to the at least one media application or service associated with the particular broadcast media program to the user via the user interface of the client device in real-time.
- One aspect of the disclosure is a system enabling device interaction with media services associated with identifiable entities within a broadcast media program. In some implementations, the system includes instructions, storable in a non-transitory memory and executable by a processor, that, when executed by a processor, cause a device to: match the user interface of a user device with a particular broadcast media program having at least one identifiable entity; receive entity metadata associated with the at least one identifiable entity, wherein the entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media service associated with the at least one identifiable entity; and present the availability of access to the at least one media service associated with the at least one identifiable entity.
- In some implementations, the system further comprises instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the device to receive a user input, wherein the input is indicative of at least the initiation of attempting to access media services associated with the particular broadcast media program, and wherein the instructions to match the user interface with the particular broadcast media program are processed in response to receiving the user input. In some implementations, the system further comprises instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the device to receive a user input, wherein the input is indicative of at least the initiation of attempting to access media services associated with the particular broadcast media program, and wherein the instructions to present the availability of access to the at least one media service are processed in response to receiving the user input.
- In some implementations, the system further comprises instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the device to transmit a user selection associated with the at least one media service presented on a user interface. In some implementations, the system further comprises instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the device to transmit a request for updated entity metadata.
- In some implementations, wherein the particular broadcast media program includes at least one of a movie, a television show, a commercial, radio show, a video file, or an audio file. In some implementations, wherein the at least one identifiable entity includes a person, a place, an object or an indicia of a service. In some implementations, wherein the object includes a consumer product. In some implementations, wherein the service includes at least one of an internet-based service or an action by a service provider. In some implementations, wherein the at least one media service includes one of electronic mail, a website, a social networking service, or a telephone service. In some implementations, wherein the device comprises a client device associated with a television, and the entity metadata is presented as a screen overlay. In some implementations, wherein the device comprises a television, and the entity metadata is presented as a screen overlay. In some implementations, wherein the device comprises at least one of a laptop computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, and the entity metadata is presented in a web-browser. In some implementations, wherein the device comprises at least one of a laptop computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, and the entity metadata is presented in an application interface. In some implementations, wherein the entity metadata comprises a dataset that includes the dataset comprising the broadcast media content. In some implementations, wherein the entity metadata comprises a dataset that is distinct from the dataset comprising the broadcast media content. In some implementations, wherein the entity metadata includes relationship information linking at least two entities.
- One aspect of the disclosure is a computer-implemented method of enabling interaction with media services associated with identifiable entities within a broadcast media program from a device including a non-transitory memory and a processor. In some implementations, the method includes aggregating entity metadata associated with one or more identifiable entities within the broadcast media program, wherein the entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media service associated with the at least one identifiable entity; providing an interface by which users can request presentation of the entity metadata; and facilitating access to at least one media service associated with the at least one identifiable entity in response to receiving a request from a user device.
- So that the present disclosure can be understood in greater detail, a more particular description may be had by reference to the features of various implementations, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings. The drawings, however, illustrate only certain typical features of the present disclosure and are therefore not to be considered limiting, for the description may admit to other effective features.

- For example, a client device is enabled to synchronize a displayable user interface with a real-time broadcast of a particular broadcast media program having at least one identifiable entity, such as a person, a place, an object or an indicia of a service. In turn, the device is enabled to receive entity metadata associated with the at least one identifiable entity. The entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one Internet-based media application or service associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the broadcast media program generally. Then, based at least on the particular broadcast media program, the device is enabled to present the availability of access to the at least one media application or service to the user on the displayable user interface.

Similarly, in some implementations, thebroadcast system 140 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. For convenience of explanation, thebroadcast system 140 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, thecontent provider 150 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. For convenience of explanation, thecontent provider 150 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Moreover, the functionality of thebroadcast system 140 and thecontent provider 150 can be combined into a single server system. Additionally and/or alternatively, while only one broadcast system and only one content provider is illustrated inFIG. 1 for the sake of brevity, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that fewer or more of each may be present in an implementation of a client-server environment. - In some implementations, the set-
top box 102 and theTV 110 are provided in combination. The set-top box 102 is configured to receive and decode signals including media content from thebroadcast system 140 or the like. In some implementations, the set-top box 102 is also Internet-enabled in order to receive signals including media content or the like. In operation, the set-top box 102 decodes the signal received from thebroadcast system 140 or the like and provides audio and video content to theTV 110 for display. While a TV has been used in the illustrated example, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that any number of displays devices, including computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smart-phones and the like, can be used to display a video stream and play the associated audio stream. In some implementations, the functions of the set-top box 102 and theTV 110 may be combined into a single device. - In some implementations, the set-
top box 102 is any computer device capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104, receiving video streams, extracting information from video streams and presenting video streams for the display using the TV 110 (or another display device). In some implementations, the set-top box 102 may be configured as a receiver for cable TV and/or satellite TV, a digital video recorder (DVR), a digital media receiver, a TV tuner, a computer, and/or any other device that outputs TV signals. In some implementations theTV 110 can be a conventional TV display that is not connectable to the Internet and that displays digital and/or analog TV content received via over the air broadcasts or a satellite or cable connection. - As is typical of televisions, the
TV 110 includes adisplay 118 andspeakers 119. Additionally and/or alternatively, theTV 110 can be replaced with another type of display device for presenting video content to a user, such as for example, a computer, a tablet device, a mobile telephone, a projector, or other type of video display system. The display device can be coupled to the set-top box 102 via a wireless or wired connection. - As used herein, a TV signal is an electrical, optical, or other type of data transmitting medium that includes audio and/or video components corresponding to a TV channel. In some implementations, the TV signal is a terrestrial over-the-air TV broadcast signal or a sign distributed/broadcast on a cable-system or a satellite system. In some implementations, the TV signal is transmitted as data over a network. For example, the set-
top box 102 can receive video streams from an Internet connection. Audio and video components of a TV signal are sometimes referred to herein as audio signals and video signals. In some implementations, a TV signal corresponds to a TV channel that is being displayed on theTV 110. - The second
screen client device 120 may be any computer device that is capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104, such as a computer, a laptop computer, a tablet device, a netbook, an Internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a mobile phone, a gaming device, or any other device that is capable of communicating over thecommunication network 104. In some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 includes one ormore processors 121,non-volatile memory 122 such as a hard disk drive, adisplay 128,speakers 129, and various other notoriously well known components that are not shown for the sake of brevity. The secondscreen client device 120 may also have input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse and/or track-pad (not shown). In some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 includes a touch screen display, a digital camera and/or any number of well known supplemental devices to add functionality. - In some implementations, the second
screen client device 120 may be connected to the set-top box 102 via a wireless or wired connection. In some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 may optionally operate in accordance with instructions, information and/or digital content (collectively “second screen information”) provided by the set-top box 102 (and vice versa). In some implementations, the set-top box 102 issues instructions to the secondscreen client device 120 that causes the secondscreen client device 120 to display the real-time availability of Internet-based media applications or services associated with the currently playing broadcast media program. - In some implementations, the second
screen client device 120 includes a microphone that enables the client device to receive sound (audio content) from, for example, thespeakers 119 of theTV 110. The microphone enables the secondscreen client device 120 to store the audio content/soundtrack that is associated with the video content as it is presented. The secondscreen client device 120 is enabled to store this information locally and then send an associated server system content information that is any one or more of: fingerprints of the stored audio content, the audio content itself, portions/snippets of the audio content, fingerprints of the portions of the audio content or references to the playing content. - In turn, the associated server system (e.g. a media monitoring server operable to monitor the broadcast system 140) can identify the content playing on the television even if the electronic device on which the content is being presented is not an Internet-enabled device (e.g. as an older TV set) or is not currently connected to the Internet. Such an arrangement (i.e., where the second
screen client device 120 stores and sends the content information to the media monitoring server 130) allows a user to receive one or more Internet-based media applications and/or services associated with the real-time broadcast of a TV program or the like. - In some implementations, the second
screen client device 120 includes one ormore applications 125 stored in thememory 122. As discussed in greater detail below, theprocessor 121 executes the one or more applications in accordance with a set of instructions received from the web-hostingserver 180, thebroadcasting system 140 and/or thecontent provider 140. - The
communication network 104 may be any combination of a wired and a wireless local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, including a portion of the Internet, or a wireless network provided by a wireless carrier. In some implementations, thecommunication network 104 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). HTTP permits theclient device 120 to access various resources available via thecommunication network 104. But the various implementations described herein are not limited to the use of any particular protocol. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes afront end server 134 that facilitates communication between themedia monitoring server 130 and thecommunication network 104. Thefront end server 134 receives content information from the secondscreen client device 120. In some implementations, the content information is a video stream, a portion thereof, and/or a reference to a portion thereof. A reference to a portion of a video stream may include a time indicator and/or a digital marker referencing the content of the video stream. In some implementations, the content information is derived from a video stream being presented (i.e. playing) by the combination of theTV 110 and the set-top box 102. - In some implementations, the
front end server 134 is configured to send a set of instructions to the secondscreen client device 120. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send content files, links to content files and/or metadata associated with the content files. The term “content file” includes any document or content of any format including, but not limited to, a video file, an image file, a music file, a web page, an email message, an SMS message, a content feed, an advertisement, a coupon, a playlist or an XML document. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send or receive one or more video streams. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to receive content directly from thebroadcast system 140 and/or thecontent provider 150 over thecommunication network 104. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes abroadcast monitor module 135 that is configured receive and record broadcast media programming as the broadcast media programming airs, and to create fingerprints of media content broadcast by thebroadcast system 140 and/or thecontent provider 150. In some implementations, themedia monitoring server 130 includes afingerprint database 132 that stores content fingerprints. A content fingerprint includes any type of condensed or compact representation, or signature, of the content of a video stream and/or audio stream. In some implementations, a fingerprint may represent a clip (such as several seconds, minutes, or hours) of a video stream or audio stream. Or, a fingerprint may represent a single instant of a video stream or audio stream (e.g., a fingerprint of single frame of a video or of the audio associated with that frame of video). Furthermore, since video content may change over time, corresponding fingerprints of that video content may also change over time. In some implementations, thefingerprint database 132 is a distributed database. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes acontent database 136. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 includes advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents, and ratings associated with various media content or any combination thereof. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 includes links to advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents and ratings associated with various media content. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 is a distributed database. - In some implementations, the
broadcast system 140 includes media content such asTV programs 141. In other words, thebroadcast system 140 includes electronic copies of the media content. In some implementations, thebroadcast system 140 also includesmetadata 142 associated with one or more of theTV programs 141, and applicationprogram interface instructions 143. In some implementations, the applicationprogram interface instructions 143 include instructions that can be provided to a client device and/or may be executed by thebroadcast system 140 under a client-server model or the like. In some implementations, the instructions link aparticular TV program 141 with the associatedmetadata 142 and/or link theTV program 141 and the associatedmetadata 142 with external data and/or services, such as a social networking application. In some implementations, thecontent provider 150 includes media content such asTV programs 151, as well asmetadata 152 associated with one or more of theTV programs 151. - In some implementations, the
social network server 170 includesprofiles 171, which include profiles of users, brands, companies and/or groups. In some implementations, theweb hosting server 180 includes acontent database 181 that includes, for example, various web pages, Internet-based applications and/or services. - In some implementations, the
online retailer 190 includes anonline sales module 191 and aninventory database 192. In some implementations, theonline retailer 190 includes a local customer sales application, such as a point-of-sale terminal within a department store. Theretailer 190 may be an online service provider (e.g. a gambling website, a social networking website, a dating website, etc.) or a retailer of real and/or digital goods (e.g. clothing, music, etc.). -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of another example client-server environment 200. The client-server environment 200 illustrated inFIG. 2 is similar to and adapted from the client-server environment 100 illustrated inFIG. 1 . Elements common to both share common reference indicia, and only the differences between the client-server environments - Within the client-
server environment 200, the second screen client device 120 (e.g. a tablet computer or laptop, etc.), the set-top box 102, theTV 110, a supplemental set-top box 103 (e.g., an electronic device configured with Google TV functionality or a subset thereof), and aremote control 112 are provided in combination—typically within a home or office. In operation, theremote control 112 may be used to control the operation of one or more of the set-top box 102, theTV 110, and the supplemental set-top box 103. In operation, theclient device 103 receives information from the set-top box 102 associated with the media content presented on theTV 110. In turn, the supplemental set-top box 103 may then communicate with any one of themedia monitoring server 130, thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150, and thesocial network server 170 through thecommunication network 104. More specific details pertaining to how the supplemental set-top box 103 and/or the secondscreen client device 120 enables users to access one or more Internet-based media applications and/or services as a related broadcast media program is aired are described below with reference toFIGS. 5-8 . - As discussed above, in some implementations, TV programs and other broadcast media programs are associated with entity metadata. The entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one Internet-based media application or service associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the program in general. An identifiable entity includes, without limitation, a person, a place, an object or an indicia of a service. For example, a TV program may be centered on a popular actor, who is an example of an identifiable entity. In turn, in some implementations, the entity metadata for that particular TV program includes instructions or a pointer to at least one of a social network account/profile, a micro-blog service account/profile, and a personal website associated with the actor. In another example, the TV program may include a reference to a new product (e.g. a car) or service (e.g. food delivery), which are also each examples of identifiable entities associated with the program. In turn, in some implementations, the entity metadata includes instructions or a pointer to at least one of a social network account/profile, a micro-blog service account/profile, and a personal website associated with the product or service. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate from the present disclosure that a TV program or other televised event is also an identifiable entity. For example, a sporting event (e.g. a basketball game) is an example of an identifiable entity, as are the teams, the players, the coaches, the announcers, and the sponsors (etc.) associated with the sporting event. In turn, in some implementations, the entity metadata for a sporting event, or any other broadcast media program, includes instructions and/or pointers for any number of identifiable entities associated with the broadcast media program.
- To that end,
FIG. 3A is a block diagram of anexample data structure 300 a linking broadcast media program content with metadata including links to related Internet-based applications and/or services. More specifically, thedata structure 300 a includesTV program data 301,TV program metadata 302, andentity metadata 303. TheTV program data 301 includes the audio and video data of the TV program, and additionally, at least one of instructions or apointer 301 a. The instructions orpointer 301 a directs devices to theTV program metadata 302. Similarly,TV program metadata 302 includes at least one of instructions and apointer 302 a to theentity metadata 303. In some implementations, theTV program metadata 302 is the superset of a collection of entity metadata elements associated with theTV program data 301. - The
entity metadata 303, as described above, provides instructions that direct devices to present the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with theTV program data 301. As shown for example inFIG. 3A , theentity metadata 303 includes anentity identifier 304. Theentity identifier 304 then includes one or more of actions 304 a (e.g. express approval, etc.), asocial network profile 304 b, and awebsite 304 c associated with the entity (e.g. an actor) identified by theentity identifier 304. -
FIG. 3B is a block diagram of an anotherexample data structure 300 b linking broadcast media program content with metadata including links to related Internet-based media applications and/or services. Thedata structure 300 b illustrated inFIG. 3B is similar to and adapted from thedata structure 300 a illustrated inFIG. 3A . Elements common to both share common reference indicia, and only the differences between thedata structures TV program data 301 includes a number of pointers (or instructions) to respective portions ofmetadata metadata 305 a includes metadata for the TV program as an identifiable entity. In turn, theTV program metadata 305 a includes at least one of instructions or a pointer toprogram entity metadata 306 a, which includes entity identifiers for one or more identifiable entities associated with the program as a whole (e.g. actors, sponsors, a related website, etc.). Similarly, themetadata 305 b includes, for example, metadata for the first scene of the TV program as an identifiable entity. In turn, thefirst scene metadata 305 b includes at least one of instructions or a pointer to the firstscene entity metadata 306 b, which includes entity identifiers for one or more identifiable entities within the first scene (e.g. the tourism website associated with a location in the first scene). Thedata structure 300 b also includes anentity graph 307, which defines the relationships between the various entity metadata segments (i.e., 306 a, 306 b, . . . 306 c) created for the TV program. -
FIG. 4A is a block diagram of an exampleapplication program interface 402 a linking broadcast media program content with metadata including links to related Internet-based applications and/or services. In some implementations, theapplication program interface 402 a is a software module that operates to match TV program data 301 (i.e., the audio and video data components of a broadcast media program) toentity metadata 303. As such, theapplication program interface 402 a includes instructions that are executed by a processor residing on any one of a server and various client devices (e.g. tablets, smart-phones, laptop computers, etc.). In some implementations, theTV program data 301 and theentity metadata 303 is included in memory on the same device as theapplication program interface 402 a. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, theapplication program interface 402 a, theTV program data 301 and theentity metadata 303 are all included on the supplemental set-top box 103. In some implementations, theTV program data 301 and theentity metadata 303 is included in memory on a different device accessible to the device including the application program interface. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, theapplication program interface 402 a is included on the supplemental set-top box 103, theTV program data 301 is delivered to the set-top box 102, and theentity metadata 303 is received from thecontent provider 150. -
FIG. 4B is a block diagram of an another exampleapplication program interface 402 b linking broadcast media program content with metadata including links to related Internet-based applications and/or services. As shown inFIG. 4B theapplication program interface 402 b links theTV program data 301 to various segments ofentity metadata FIG. 4A . -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of aclient device method 500. In some implementations, themethod 500 is performed by a set-top box associated with a cable or satellite TV provider (or the like) (e.g., the set-top box 102 ofFIG. 1 ), and/or a supplemental set-top box (e.g., the supplemental set-top box ofFIG. 2 ) and/or television-integrated device or system associated with an Internet-based service. Briefly, the method includes acquiring instructions and/or pointers directing the client device to an Internet-based media application and/or service associated with a broadcast media program, and presenting the availability of access to the media application and/or service while the user is watching the broadcast media program on a TV or the like. - To that end, the
method 500 includes synchronizing (i.e. matching) the user interface of client device (e.g. a set-top box or a supplemental set-top box) to a TV program playing on a TV or another device (501). For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , theTV 110 is used to present a TV program selected by a user. TheTV 110 receives the audio and video signal components from the set-top box 102, which receives a corresponding signal from thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and/or a web-hosting service. In some implementations, the user interface of one of the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103 is synchronized to the TV program playing on theTV 110. In some implementations, one or more of the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103, theTV 110 is provided with instructions, storable in a non-transitory memory and executable by a processor, that, when executed by a processor, match the user interface provided by one or more of the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103 to a particular broadcast media program having at least one identifiable entity. In some implementations, the matching process includes fingerprinting the playing TV program, communicating the fingerprint to themedia monitoring server 104, and in turn, receiving a program identifier that can be used to match the user interface to the playing TV program. In some implementations, the matching process includes receiving synchronization information from one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and theweb hosting service 180. - The
method 500 also includes receiving entity metadata associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the program in general (502). The entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media service associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the program in general. In some implementations, the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services, provided by the entity metadata, is presented in response to a user input indicating that the user is interested in being presented such information. In some implementations, the input is received from one of theclient device 120 and theremote control device 112. Accordingly, themethod 500 includes receiving a user input or determining that a counter has breached a threshold indicating that a waiting period has expired (503). The counter threshold indicates the time during which the current entity metadata points to timely information associated with the TV program. If the user does not provide an input requesting to be presented with the availability of applications or services (“TO” path from 503), themethod 500 includes transmitting a request for updated entity metadata (508). In some implementations, the request is transmitted to one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and theweb hosting service 180. On the other hand, if a user input is received (“UI” path from 503), themethod 500 includes presenting the entity metadata that indicates the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with the currently playing TV program. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, one of the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103 provides theTV 110 with a displayable overlay that presents the available applications and services on a portion of thedisplay 118. - The
method 500 includes displaying the overlay until the user provides an input or a display counter threshold is breached (505). If a user input is received (“UI” path from 505), themethod 500 includes transmitting an access request to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with the currently playing TV program. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, one of the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103 transmits a request to one of the web-hostingservice 180, theonline retailer 190 and thesocial network server 170. On the other hand, if the user does not provide an input requesting access to one of the available applications and services (“TO” path from 505), themethod 500 includes transmitting a request for updated entity metadata or retrieving the next available set of applications and services (507). In some implementations, when new entity metadata is sought, a request for new entity metadata is transmitted to one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and theweb hosting service 180, as described above with reference to the portion of the method represented by 508. In some implementations, when more entity data is available on one of the set-top box and the supplemental set-top box 103, the method circles back to the portion of the method represented by 503 from 507 so that the next available entity metadata bundle is readied for display (503). -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of aclient device method 600. In some implementations, themethod 600 is performed by at least one of a client device such as a personal computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, and a smart-phone (e.g., one ormore client devices 120 ofFIG. 1 ). Briefly, the method includes acquiring instructions and/or pointers directing the client device to an Internet-based media application and/or service associated with a broadcast media program, and presenting the availability of access to the media application and/or service while the user is watching the broadcast media program on a TV or the like. In some implementations, unlike themethod 500, themethod 600 presents the availability of the associated media applications and/or services without user selection because themethod 600 is performed by a client device different from the display device presenting the broadcast media program. Consequently, the presentation of the availability of the associated media applications and/or services is not likely to directly interfere with a user's enjoyment of the playing broadcast media program. - To that end, the
method 600 includes synchronizing (i.e. matching) the user interface of the client device to a TV program playing on a TV or another device (601). For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , theTV 110 is used to present a TV program selected by a user. TheTV 110 receives the audio and video signal components from the set-top box 102, which receives a corresponding signal from thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and/or a web-hosting service. In some implementations, the user interface of the secondscreen client device 120 is synchronized to the TV program playing on theTV 110. In some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 is provided with instructions, storable in a non-transitory memory and executable by a processor, that, when executed by a processor, match the user interface of the secondscreen client device 120 to a particular broadcast media program having at least one identifiable entity. In some implementations, the matching process includes fingerprinting the playing TV program, communicating the fingerprint to themedia monitoring server 104, and in turn, receiving a program identifier that can be used to match the user interface to the playing TV program. In some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 records a portion of the audio and/or video of the TV program, and then transmits the recorded audio and/or video data to a server to perform the fingerprinting. In some implementations, the matching process includes receiving synchronization information from one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and theweb hosting service 180. - The
method 600 also includes receiving entity metadata associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the program in general (602). The entity metadata includes at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media service associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the program in general. Themethod 500 includes presenting the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services, provided by the entity metadata, using the user interface of the secondscreen client device 120. Presenting the entity metadata includes indicating the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with the currently playing TV program. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 displays the available applications and services on a portion of thedisplay 128. - The
method 600 includes displaying the available applications and/or services until the user provides an input or a display counter threshold is breached (604). If a user input is received (“UI” path from 604), themethod 600 includes transmitting an access request to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with the currently playing TV program. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 transmits a request to one of the web-hostingservice 180, theonline retailer 190 and thesocial network server 170. On the other hand, if the user does not provide an input requesting access to one of the available applications and services (“TO” path from 604), themethod 600 includes transmitting a request for updated entity metadata (607) or retrieving the next available set of applications and services, if such a set has been previously received. In some implementations, when new entity metadata is sought, a request for new entity metadata is transmitted to one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and theweb hosting service 180. In some implementations, when more entity data is locally available on the secondscreen client device 120, the method circles back to the portion of the method represented by 603 so that the next available entity metadata bundle is readied for display (603). -
FIG. 7 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of aclient device method 700. In some implementations, themethod 700 is performed by a set-top box associated with a cable or satellite TV provider (or the like) (e.g., the set-top box 102 ofFIG. 1 ), and/or a supplemental set-top box (e.g., the supplemental set-top box 103 ofFIG. 2 ) and/or television-integrated device or system associated with an Internet-based service. Briefly, the method includes acquiring instructions and/or pointers directing the client device to an Internet-based media application and/or service associated with a broadcast media program, and presenting the availability of access to the media application and/or service while the user is watching the broadcast media program on a TV or the like. - To that end, the
method 700 includes receiving entity metadata and instructions associated with the at least one identifiable entity or the program in general (701). Themethod 700 includes broadcasting a paging message on a user network (e.g. a local WiFi network) that signals the availability of one or more Internet-based media applications and services provided by the received entity metadata and instructions. For example, with reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , one of the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103 transmits a paging message on a local WiFi network to which the secondscreen client device 120 is connected. In some implementations, the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services, provided by the entity metadata, is presented in response to a user input indicating that the user is interested in being presented such information. In some implementations, the input is received by the secondscreen client device 120. Accordingly, themethod 700 includes receiving a user input or a counter breaches a threshold, and thus times out (703). The counter threshold indicates the time during which the current entity metadata points to timely information associated with the TV program. If the user does not provide an input requesting to be presented with the availability of applications or services (“TO” path from 703), themethod 700 includes transmitting a request for updated entity metadata (708). In some implementations, the request is transmitted from the secondscreen client device 120 to one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150, theweb hosting service 180, the set-top box 102 and the supplemental set-top box 103. On the other hand, if a user input is received (“UI” path from 703), themethod 700 includes presenting the entity metadata that indicates the availability of access to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with the currently playing TV program (704). For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 presents the available applications and services on a portion of thedisplay 128. In some implementations, the secondscreen client device 120 communicates the request to the supplemental set-top box 103, which in turn, provides theTV 110 with a displayable overlay that presents the available applications and services on a portion of thedisplay 118. - The
method 700 includes displaying the available applications and services until the user provides an input or a display counter threshold is breached (705). If a user input is received (“UI” path from 705), themethod 700 includes transmitting an access request to one or more Internet-based applications and/or services associated with the currently playing TV program. For example, with further reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 , in some implementations, one of the secondscreen client device 120 and the supplemental set-top box 103 transmits a request to one of the web-hostingservice 180, theonline retailer 190 and the social network server 170 (706). On the other hand, if the user does not provide an input requesting access to one of the available applications and services (“TO” path from 705), themethod 700 includes transmitting a request for updated entity metadata or retrieving the next available set of applications and services (707). In some implementations, when new entity metadata is sought, a request for new entity metadata is transmitted to one of thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150 and theweb hosting service 180, as described above with reference to the portion of the method represented by 708. In some implementations, when more entity data is available on one of the set-top box and the supplemental set-top box 103, the method circles back to the portion of the method represented by 703 from 707 so that the next available entity metadata bundle is readied for display (703). -
FIG. 8 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of aserver system method 800. In some implementations, themethod 800 is performed by a server system (e.g., one of theserver systems FIG. 1 ) in order to produce and deliver metadata including at least one of instructions or a pointer that enables access to at least one media application and/or service associated with the at least one identifiable entity in a broadcast media program. To that end, themethod 800 includes aggregating entity metadata associated with one or more entities included in a TV program or the like (801). Themethod 800 includes receiving a synchronization request associated with a particular TV program or the like from a user device (802). Themethod 800 includes transmitting synchronization data and instructions associated with the particular TV program or the like to the user device in response to receiving the synchronization request (803). Themethod 800 includes transmitting entity metadata and instructions to the client device (804). In some implementations, the entity metadata and instructions are transmitted in response to receiving a confirmation that the user device has successfully utilized the synchronization data and instructions. - Subsequently, the
method 800 includes receiving a user request from the client device or determining that a counter has breached a threshold indicating that a waiting period has expired (805). If a user request is not received before the counter threshold has been breached (“TO” path from 805), themethod 800 includes circling back to the portion of the method represented by 801. On the other hand, if a user request is received in time (“UR” path from 805), themethod 800 includes providing a link between the user device and the requested media application or service. - It will also be understood that, although the terms “first,” “second,” etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a first contact, which changing the meaning of the description, so long as all occurrences of the “first contact” are renamed consistently and all occurrences of the second contact are renamed consistently. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.
- The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the claims. As used in the description of the embodiments and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term “and/or” as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
- As used herein, the term “if” may be construed to mean “when” or “upon” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “in response to detecting,” that a stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase “if it is determined [that a stated condition precedent is true]” or “if [a stated condition precedent is true]” or “when [a stated condition precedent is true]” may be construed to mean “upon determining” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “upon detecting” or “in response to detecting” that the stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context.
