- the invention generally relates to search engines. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for processing instant messenger messages.
- ⁇ олователи generate and access a large number of articles, such as emails, web pages, word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, instant messenger messages, and presentation documents, using a client device, such as a personal computer, personal digital assistant, or mobile phone.
- Some articles are stored on one or more storage devices coupled to, accessible by, or otherwise associated with the client device(s). Users sometimes wish to search the storage device(s) for articles.
- client-device search applications may significantly degrade the performance of the client device.
- certain conventional client-device search applications typically use batch processing to index all articles, which can result in noticeably slower performance of the client device during the batch processing.
- batch processing occurs only periodically. Therefore, when a user performs a search, the most recent articles are sometimes not included in the results.
- the index of articles associated with the client device can become outdated.
- Conventional client-device search applications can also need to rebuild the index at each batch processing or build new partial indexes and perform a merge operation that can use a lot of client-device resources.
- Conventional client-device search applications also sometimes use a great deal of system resources when operational, resulting in slower performance of the client device.
- search engines do not index instant messenger messages and/or allow a user to search instant messenger messages.
- client-device search applications can require an explicit search query from a user to generate results, and may be limited to file names or the contents of a particular application's files.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for processing instant messenger messages.
- an instant messenger event is captured by compiling event data associated with at least one instant messenger message, the instant messenger event is associated with a conversation, and at least some of the event data associated with the instant messenger event is indexed.
- a search query is received, and the conversation is identified as relevant to the search query.
- capturing the instant message event can comprise identifying instant messenger activity associated with an instant messenger application on a client device, identifying the instant messenger event, and compiling the instant messenger event from at least some of the event data.

- PDF Portable Document Format
- the user's 112 a interaction with articles, the client applications 120 , and the client device 102 a creates event data that may be observed, recorded, analyzed or otherwise used.
- An event can be any occurrence possible associated with an article, client application 120 , or client device 102 a , such as inputting text in an article, displaying an article on a display device, sending an article, receiving an article, manipulating an input device, opening an article, saving an article, printing an article, closing an article, opening a client application program, closing a client application program, idle time, processor load, disk access, memory usage, bringing a client application program to the foreground, changing visual display details of the application (such as resizing or minimizing) and any other suitable occurrence associated with an article, a client application program, or the client device whatsoever.
- event data can be generated when the client device 102 a interacts with an article independent of the user 112 a , such as when receiving an email or performing a scheduled task.
- the memory 108 of the client device 102 a can also contain a capture processor 124 , a queue 126 , and a search engine 122 .
- the client device 102 a can also contain or is in communication with a data store 140 .
- the capture processor 124 can capture events and pass them to the queue 126 .
- the queue 126 can pass the captured events to the search engine 122 or the search engine 122 can retrieve new events from the queue 126 .
- the queue 126 notifies the search engine 122 when a new event arrives in the queue 126 and the search engine 122 retrieves the event (or events) from the queue 126 when the search engine 122 is ready to process the event (or events).
- the search engine When the search engine receives an event it can be processed and can be stored in the data store 140 .
- the search engine 122 can receive an explicit query from the user 112 a or generate an implicit query and it can retrieve information from the data store 140 in response to the query.
- the queue is located in the search engine 122 .
- the client device 102 a does not have a queue and the events are passed from the capture processor 124 directly to the search engine 122 .
- the event data is transferred using an information exchange protocol.
- the information exchange protocol can comprise, for example, any suitable rule or convention facilitating data exchange, and can include, for example, any one of the following communication mechanisms: Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Calling protocol (XML/RPC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared memory, sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- XML/RPC Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Calling protocol
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol
- shared memory sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- the capture processor 124 can capture an event by identifying and compiling event data associated with an event. Examples of events include sending or receiving an instant messenger message, a user viewing a web page, saving a word processing document, printing a spreadsheet document, inputting text to compose or edit an email, opening a presentation application, closing an instant messenger application, entering a keystroke, moving the mouse, and hovering the mouse over a hyperlink.
- An example of event data captured by the capture processor 124 for an event involving the receipt of an instant messenger message by the user 112 a can comprise the sender of the message, the recipients of the message, the time and date the message was received, the content of the message and a conversation ID.
- a conversation ID can be used to associate messages that form a conversation and can be provided by the instant messenger application or can be generated by the capture processor 124 .
- a conversation can be one or more messages between the user 112 a and at least one other user until the user 112 a logs out of or closes the instant messenger application or the instant messenger application is inactive for a certain period of time (for example, 30 minutes).
- the capture processor 124 comprises multiple capture components.
- the capture processor 124 shown in FIG. 1 comprises a separate capture component for each client application in order to capture events associated with each application.
- the capture processor 124 can also comprises a separate capture component that monitors overall network activity in order to capture event data associated with network activity, such as the receipt or sending of an instant messenger message.
- the capture processor 124 shown in FIG. 1 also can comprise a separate client device capture component that monitors overall client device performance data, such as processor load, idle time, disk access, the client applications in use, and the amount of memory available.
- 1 also comprises a separate capture component to monitor and capture keystrokes input by the user and a separate capture component to monitor and capture items, such as text, displayed on a display device associated with the client device 102 a .
- An individual capture component can monitor multiple client applications and multiple capture components can monitor different aspects of a single client application.
- the capture processor 124 can monitor activity on the client device and can capture events by a generalized event definition and registration mechanism, such as an event schema.
- Each capture component can define its own event schema or can use a predefined one.
- Event schemas can differ depending on the client application or activity the capture component is monitoring.
- the event schema can describe the format for an event, for example, by providing fields for event data associated with the event (such as the time of the event) and fields related to any associated article (such as the title) as well as the content of any associated article (such as the document body).
- An event schema can describe the format for any suitable event data that relates to an event.
- an event schema for an instant messenger message event sent by the user 112 a can include a recipient or list of recipients, the time sent, the date sent, content of the message, and a conversation ID.
- An event schema for a web page currently being viewed by a user can include the Uniform Resource Locator or URL of the web page, the time being viewed, and the content of the web page.
- An event schema for a word processing document being saved by a user can include the title of the document, the time saved, the location of the document, the format of the document, the text of the document, and a pointer to the location of the document. More generally, an event schema can describe the state of the system around the time of the event.
- an event schema can contain a URL for a web page event associated with a previous web page that the user navigated from.
- event schema can describe fields with more complicated structure like lists.
- an event schema can contain fields that list multiple recipients.
- An event schema can also contain optional fields so that an application can include additional event data if desired.
- the capture processor 124 can capture events occurring presently (or “real-time events”) and can capture events that have occurred in the past (or “historical events”).
- Real-time events can be “indexable” or “non-indexable”.
- the search engine 122 indexes indexable real-time events, but does not index non-indexable real-time events.
- the search engine 122 may determine whether to index an event based on the importance of the event. Indexable real-time events can be more important events associated with an article, such as viewing a web page, loading or saving a file, and receiving or sending an instant message or email. Non-indexable events can be deemed not important enough by the search engine 122 to index and store the event, such as moving the mouse or selecting a portion of text in an article.
- Non-indexable events can be used by the search engine 122 to update the current user state. While all real-time events can relate to what the user is currently doing (or the current user state), indexable real-time events can be indexed and stored in the data store 140 . Alternatively, the search engine 122 can index all real-time events.
- Real-time events can include, for example, sending or receiving an article, such as an instant messenger message, examining a portion of an article, such as selecting a portion of text or moving a mouse over a portion of a web page, changing an article, such as typing a word in an email or pasting a sentence in a word processing document, closing an article, such as closing an instant messenger display area or changing an email message being viewed, loading, saving, opening, or viewing an article, such as a word processing document, web page, or email, listening to or saving an MP3 file or other audio/video file, or updating the metadata of an article, such as book marking a web page, printing a presentation document, deleting a word processing document, or moving a spreadsheet document.
- an article such as an instant messenger message
- examining a portion of an article such as selecting a portion of text or moving a mouse over a portion of a web page
- changing an article such as typing a word in an email or pasting a sentence in a word processing document
- closing an article such
- Historical events are similar to indexable real-time events except that the event occurred before the installation of the search engine 122 or was otherwise not captured, because, for example, the search engine 122 was not operational for a period of time while the client device 102 a was operational or because no capture component existed for a specific type of historical event at the time the event took place.
- Examples of historical events include the user's saved word processing documents, media files, presentation documents, calendar entries, and spreadsheet documents, the emails in a user's inbox, and the web pages book marked by the user.
- the capture processor 124 can capture historical events by periodically crawling the memory 108 and any associated data storage device for events not previously captured by the capture processor 124 .
- the capture processor 124 can also capture historical events by requesting certain client applications, such as a web browser or an email application, to retrieve articles and other associated information. For example, the capture processor 124 can request that the web browser application obtain all viewed web pages by the user or request that the email application obtain all email messages associated with the user. These articles may not currently exist in memory 108 or on a storage device of the client device 102 a . For example, the email application may have to retrieve emails from a server device. In one embodiment, the search engine 122 indexes historical events.
- events captured by the capture processor 124 are sent to the queue 126 in the format described by an event schema.
- the capture processor 124 can also send performance data to the queue 126 .
- Examples of performance data include current processor load, average processor load over a predetermined period of time, idle time, disk access, the client applications in use, and the amount of memory available.
- Performance data can also be provided by specific performance monitoring components, some of which may be part of the search engine 122 , for example.
- the performance data in the queue 126 can be retrieved by the search engine 122 and the capture components of the capture processor 124 .
- capture components can retrieve the performance data to alter how many events are sent to the queue 126 or how detailed the events are that are sent (fewer or smaller events when the system is busy) or how frequently events are sent (events are sent less often when the system is busy or there are too many events waiting to be processed).
- the search engine 122 can use performance data to determine when it indexes various events and when and how often it issues implicit queries.
- the queue 126 holds events until the search engine 122 is ready to process an event or events.
- the queue 126 uses the performance data to help determine how quickly to provide the events to the search engine 122 .
- the queue 126 can comprise one or more separate queues including a user state queue and an index queue.
- the index queue can queue indexable events, for example.
- the queue 126 can have additional queues or comprise a single queue.
- the queue 126 can be implemented as a circular priority queue using memory mapped files.
- the queue can be a multiple-priority queue where higher priority events are served before lower priority events, and other components may be able to specify the type of events they are interested in.
- real-time events can be given higher priority than historical events, and indexable events can be given higher priority than non-indexable real-time events.
- Other implementations of the queue 126 are possible.
- the client device 102 a does not have a queue 126 .
- events are passed directly from the capture processor 124 to the search engine 122 .
- events can be transferred between the capture components and the search engine using suitable information exchange mechanisms such as: Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Calling protocol (XML/RPC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared memory, sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- XML/RPC Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Calling protocol
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol
- the search engine 122 can contain an indexer 130 , a query system 132 , and a formatter 134 .
- the query system 132 can retrieve all real-time events and performance data from the queue 126 .
- the query system 132 can use performance data and real-time events to update the current user state and generate an implicit query.
- An implicit query can be an automatically generated query based on the current user state.
- the query system 132 can also receive and process explicit queries from the user 112 a .
- Performance data can also be retrieved by the search engine 122 from the queue 126 for use in determining the amount of activity possible by the search engine 122 .
- indexable real-time events and historical events are retrieved from the queue 126 by the indexer 130 .
- the queue 126 may send the indexable events to the indexer 130 .
- the indexer 130 can index the indexable events and can send them to the data store 140 where they are stored.
- the data store 140 can be any type of computer-readable media and can be integrated with the client device 102 a , such as a hard drive, or external to the client device 102 a , such as an external hard drive or on another data storage device accessed through the network 106 .
- the data store can be one or more logical or physical storage areas. In one embodiment, the data store 140 can be in memory 108 .
- the data store 140 may facilitate one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs, and may include compression and encryption.
- the data store comprises an index 142 , a database 144 and a repository 146 .
- the indexer 130 when the indexer 130 receives an event, the indexer 130 can determine, from the event schema, terms (if any) associated with the event, the time of the event (if available), images (if any) associated with the event, and/or other information defining the event. The indexer 130 can also determine if the event relates to other events and associate the event with related events. For example, for a received instant messenger message event, the indexer can associate the message event with other message events from the same conversation. The messages from the same conversation can be associated with each other in a conversation object, which can be stored in the data store 140 .
- the indexer 130 can send and incorporate the terms and times, associated with the event in the index 142 of the data store 140 .
- the event can be sent to the database 144 for storage and the content of the associated article and any associated images can be stored in the repository 146 .
- the conversation object associated with instant messenger messages can be stored in the database 144 .
- a user 112 a can input an explicit query into a search engine interface displayed on the client device 102 a , which is received by the search engine 122 .
- the search engine 122 can also generate an implicit query based on a current user state, which can be determined by the query system 132 from real-time events. Based on the query, the query system 132 can locate relevant information in the data store 140 and provide a result set.
- the result set comprises article identifiers for articles associated with the client applications 120 or client articles.
- Client articles include articles associated with the user 112 a or client device 102 a , such as the user's emails, word processing documents, instant messenger messages, previously viewed web pages and any other article or portion of an article associated with the client device 102 a or user 112 a .
- An article identifier may be, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), a file name, a link, an icon, a path for a local file, or other suitable information that may identify an article.
- the result set also comprises article identifiers for articles located on the network 106 or network articles located by a search engine on a server device.
- Network articles include articles located on the network 106 not previously viewed or otherwise referenced by the user 112 a , such as web pages not previously viewed by the user 112 a.
- the formatter 134 can receive the search result set from the query system 132 of the search engine 122 and can format the results for output to a display processor 128 .
- the formatter 134 can format the results in XML, HTML, or tab delineated text.
- the display processor 128 can be contained in memory 108 and can control the display of the result set on a display device associated with the client device 102 a .
- the display processor 128 may comprise various components.
- the display processor 128 comprises a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server that receives requests for information and responds by constructing and transmitting Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages.
- the HTTP server comprises a scaled-down version of the Apache Web server.
- the display processor 128 can be associated with a set of APIs to allow various applications to receive the results and display them in various formats.
- the display APIs can be implemented in various ways, including as, for example, DLL exports, COM interface, VB, JAVA, or .NET libraries, or as a web service.
- a server device 150 can be coupled to the network 106 .
- the search engine 122 can transmit a search query comprised of an explicit or implicit query or both to the server device 150 .

- indexable real-time events may not be sent to the user state queue to save computational time.
- the capture processor 124 can send the event in a form described by an event schema to the queue 126 . If the event is determined to be a non-indexable event, then, in 206 , the non-indexable event can be sent by the capture processor 124 to the user state queue of the queue 126 with an indication that it is not to be indexed.
- the queue 126 holds the event until a condition is met, such as the search engine is ready to receive it. Based on the event data, the event can be prioritized on the queue 126 for handling. For example, historical events are given a lower priority for processing by the queue 126 than real-time events.
- the indexer 130 when the indexer 130 is ready to process another event, it can retrieve an event or events from the index queue in the queue 126 .
- the query system 132 can retrieve an event or events from the user state queue of the queue 126 , when it is ready to update the user state.
- a queue is not used and events are sent directly to the search engine 122 from the capture processor 124 .
- the indexer 130 indexes and stores the event.
- the indexer 130 can retrieve an event from the queue 126 when it is ready to process the event.
- the indexer 130 determines if the event is a duplicate event and if not assigns an Event ID to the event.
- the indexer 130 can also associate the event with related events.
- the indexer determines indexable terms associated with the event, dates and times associated with the event, and other data associated with the event from the event schema.
- the indexer 130 can associate the Event ID with the indexable terms that are contained in the index 142 .
- the event can be stored in the database 144 and the content of the event can be stored in the repository 146 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary method 210 for indexing and storing an instant messenger event.
- the indexer 130 retrieves an instant messenger event from the queue 126 and determines that the event is an instant messenger event. In one embodiment, the indexer 130 can determine if the retrieved instant messenger event is a duplicate of a previously processed instant messenger event, and if not can assign the instant messenger event an event ID. The indexer 130 can also parse out indexable terms, including sender and recipient names, times and dates associated with the event, and a conversation ID from the event schema. In one embodiment, the indexer 130 determines a title associated with an instant messenger conversation.
- the indexer 130 can determine the title based on the frequency of unique terms appearing in the conversation, the first sentence of the conversation, or the participants and time of the conversation. For example, the indexer 130 can select the first sentence in the first message of the conversation and associate that sentence as the title of the conversation. In another embodiment, the query system or other component can do this in a post-processing phase.
- the indexer 130 determines whether the instant messenger event is associated with a new conversation or if the instant messenger event is associated with an existing conversation.
- the instant messenger event can have a conversation ID associated with it.
- the indexer 130 can compare the conversation ID with previously processed instant messenger event conversation IDs to determine if there is a match. If no conversation ID exists, the indexer 130 can determine if the instant messenger event is associated with an existing conversation based on some or all of the recipient(s) and sender of the message, the time in between receipt or sending of the message and previous messages, content of the message and messages associated with a conversation, and whether the message is associated with the same instant messenger application display area as previous messages.
- the indexer 130 can associate the two events with the same conversation. Additionally, if user A sends user B a number of messages in a row, these messages may be associated with the same conversation. In other embodiment, messages between multiple users, such as in a “chat room” can be associated with the same conversation, messages from a user to himself can be associated with the same conversation, and messages from a user to an automated service or computer can be associated with the same conversation.
- the indexer 130 determines that the instant messenger event is associated with a new conversation, then the indexer, in 406 , can create a new conversation object.
- a conversation object can associate an instant messenger event with related instant messenger events from the same conversation. Conversations can also be associated with each other through an associated conversation identifier.
- the indexer 130 determines that the instant messenger event is associated with an existing conversation, then the indexer 130 , in 408 , can load the relevant conversation object from the database 144 of the data store 140 . By associating instant messenger events with a conversation, a user is able to search for and retrieve complete instant messenger conversations.
- the instant messenger event can be stored in the data store 140 .
- the instant messenger message is stored in the repository 146 .
- a link or any suitable associated identifier for the location of the stored conversation can be stored in the data store associated with the Event ID.
- the event and conversation object are stored in the database 144 .
- the indexable terms from the instant message are stored in the index 142 .
- the Event ID from the event is associated with terms in the index 142 that equate to the indexable terms of the event.
- the capturing of instant messenger message events that are indexed and stored by the search engine 122 allows the user 112 a to search for and retrieve instant messenger messages on the client device 102 a and allows the search engine to automatically search for instant messenger messages on the client device 102 a . Indexing instant messenger events while they happen without waiting for the end of the conversation provides the user with access to the event data before the end of the conversation.
- the environment shown reflects a client-side search engine architecture embodiment. Other embodiments are possible, such as a stand-alone client device or a network search engine.
