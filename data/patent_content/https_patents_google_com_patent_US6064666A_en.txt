- FIG. 1 shows a cross service network 100. It includes an array of primary users 101, a primary service network 130, and a remote service interface 150.
- the array of primary users 101 includes "k" users from USER, 102 to USER k 120.
- Each user may have up to ⁇ N ⁇ network access means.
- Each access means may use any appropriate access media such as a telephone, computer, dumb terminals and wireless connection.
- the mixed media may use a variety of addressing domains.
- USER 1 has a telephone as the media for M 11 103, a personal computer as the media for M 12 104, and a cell phone as the media for M 1n 105.
- USER 2 110 has an array of telephones.
- Access media M 21 111 is a home phone
- M 22 112 is a business phone
- M 2n 113 is a car phone.
- USER k 120 has a telephone as access media M k1 121, a personal computer as media M k2 122 and is a service provider via access media M kn .
- All primary users 101 have connectivity to a Primary Service Network (PSN) 130.
- PSN 130 serves as a Enhanced Telephony Service (ETS) provider.
- ETS is provided using a primary CSA system 131.
- the primary CSA 131 includes cross connect means 134 to provide user and service connectivity and information transfer. Information is transferred between cross connected users and services called the communicating parties. Information transfer is primarily in digital form in any of a variety of protocols depending upon the needs of the parties. Analog signals can be accommodated to and from the users, as required.
- Primary CSA 131 includes a user image database 142.
- the database 142 maintains an image of each user wherein it correlates, stores and associates the service related passwords and/or IDENTIFIERs of each user.
- the database 142 is regularly modified and updated to add, delete and modify particular user image data in the CSADm mapping whenever it receives information that a user's service and its respective assigned password and/or IDENTIFIER is added, deleted or changed. With implementation of the present invention, each user may input these changes from any of that user's access media.
- the database 142 normally includes input and output interfaces for the modalities and characteristics of the user's access media and service connections.
- the domain to domain transfer is often performed in a conversion means 132.
- the domain conversion is performed by providing a temporary IDENTIFIER in a domain for which the user does not have an IDENTIFIER.
- the conversion means 132 also converts between the input and output protocols and media modalities required to satisfy the communicating parties.
- user 1 102 may access E-mail messages or documents from the computer 122 of user k 120 with a voice telephone M 11 103.
- the conversion means converts the document into a voice message for delivery to user 1 's 102 telephone 103.
- a message or response in the other direction in the form of a voice message sent from user 1 's 102 telephone 103 is converted to an E-mail message or document delivered to user k 's 120 personal computer 122.
- the primary CSA 131 also includes a network management module 136.
- the management module implements all network control and monitoring, error handling, scheduling, administration and management.
- a billing module 138 is separated from the management module 136 as an example of the many advantages of the user image database.
- the billing module correlates all charges to each user, in accordance with that user's stored IDENTIFIERs, so as to develop and construct a common billing capability for all service utilizations by that user.
- the CSA 131 also includes a primary services means 140 which provides all the enhanced telephony services provided internally of PSN 130.
- a remote service interface 150 is generally available for connecting to remote service networks.
- the cross service network 100 of FIG. 1 provides coordination of user service identifications and/or verifications for disparate services. It allows the array of users 101 to operate under multiple appropriate service IDENTIFIERs within the cross service domain described. Each user retains a single user image for applications which bridge the service boundaries.
- the user IDENTIFIER provides a means to gain access to a service provider. Actual service provision often requires that the user enter a password for purposes of user verification.
- the image database also includes these verification passwords as appropriate to the service domain.
- the word IDENTIFIER is used herein, it is understood to include any password, and/or interactive sequence, and/or signals required to be provided by the service requestor to become authorized by the service provider for the requested service.
- MAIN-ID main IDENTIFIER
- the MAIN-ID is the most desired one to be used for all in-network and out-of-network communications with the user.
- the MAIN-ID may include the social security number and/or the actual name of the party responsible for billing and IDENTIFIER utilization.
- Each image database includes the user's MAIN-ID when it exists. It is generally made available to any service or user requesting it.
- mapping information is stored in the database using any of the database store-and-retrieve techniques known to those skilled in the art.
- a relational type database implementation is clearly suitable for the CSADm association purposes.
- the data is stored by means of storage, indexing and retrieval such as in a distributed database comprising multiple computers attached to a network.
- the database stores information sufficient to uniquely identify subscribers of each service that is associated, and to provide these subscribers access to the service.
- the nature of the information required is generally determined by the service providers of said services. For a particular subscriber, this information comes from the service, from the subscribers themselves and/or other sources.
- Data input is accomplished by various means.
- the means include manual and automated entry to the CSADm by system administrators, entry through a batch or transaction based update from the computer systems of the service providers or other information sources, and/or by the subscribers themselves.
- the means for maintaining this database information is generally dependent upon the size and nature of the services to be associated, and the business and other objectives of the cross domain system administrator.
- Such means include distributed relational databases, network databases with replication, distributed file systems, relational hierarchical and network databases within a single system, databases requiring disk access per lookup, databases keeping information in high speed random access memory, and file systems within a single system.
- means are employed for keeping information with the appropriate level of security, reliability, availability, and performance as dictated by the CSADm service.
- the means to do this include redundant and distributed processing, fault tolerant hardware and/or software, fault tolerant network attachments, logging and journaling, and back out or force ahead of incomplete transactions.
- the database schema is selected to provide a powerful general mapping service for a dynamically variable number of services to be associated. Additional services can be associated after the association is first set up in that it is dynamically variable. Associations for a small or fixed number of services whose attributes are well known may use more limited, performance optimized approaches or ones that can be implemented in less programming steps.
- each user is identified by that user's identification within any of the associated services. Given an identification within any service, the users IDENTIFIERs and capabilities within any of the other services can be found by the CSADm.
- An embodiment of the database uses data structures that include a service user IDENTIFIER table, a user service record, and a cross domain user service record
- a service user IDENTIFIER table for each service.
- Each table is indexed by the way the user is known within that service. This may be via that user's MAIN IDENTIFIER or a specific IDENTIFIER assigned by that service.
- the table provides a pointer to the user service record for that service. This record provides information of how that service can be accessed and operated on behalf of that user. This often requires that user's service IDENTIFIER and password, as well as the capabilities that the service is willing to perform on behalf of that user. Since many of the users have the same capabilities, these records could be stored in a normalized format to minimize the amount of common information that is replicated.
- each user service with cross service functionality there is a chain or doubly linked list of all that user's service records.
- each user has a user service record for each service to which that user has access. These records normally result from long term service subscription, or are dynamically created as the result of accessing a transaction based service.
- a user is assigned a service IDENTIFIER for temporary use from a pool. These records contain forward and back pointers to the user's other user service records in a doubly linked list forming a chain.
- a new service user IDENTIFIER is created along with a new user service record which is linked into this chain to form the service association. In this manner, all the services associated with each particular user indicating that user's access and operating rights are found.
- the cross domain user service record specifies information on the operation of the cross domain service for each user. For example, if the service is an interworking between an internet based service and a voice based telephony service, it is often necessary to choose which of the services that user has associated with telephony, such as wireline and wireless, should be used. This information is pointed to by all the user service records for rapid access in providing cross services. The cross service provider often chooses to keep this information within its own data facility. In this case, the information is either stored within the CSADm redundantly, or this function is not used at all.
- the CSA 131 in FIG. 1, awaits a request for service from a primary user, block 204.
- the CSA identifies the request to come from USER 1 .
- the above schema is generally employed by the PSN, 130 of FIG. 1, in usually asynchronous and quasi-simultaneous fashion for a multiplicity of requests from its connected primary users, 101 of FIG. 1,
- the PSN 130 also satisfies any requests it receives via its remote service interface, 150 of FIG. 1. Once a user hangs up to disconnect the accessing line, often following a predetermined delay, the service is disconnected and any temporary IDENTIFIERs are closed, block 242, and the operation is stopped, block 260.
- FIG. 3 An embodiment of the coordination of disparate services in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIG. 3. It shows a network 300 with two service network entities.
- One network entity is an Enhanced Telephony Service (ETS) 310 network.
- the ETS 310 includes a cross connect means 342, a management administration and control means 341, and a primary service provision means 313.
- the other entity is an On-line Information Service (OIS) 340 network.
- the OIS 340 includes a cross connect means 342, a management, administration and control means 341, and an on-line service means 343.
- a group of ETS attached users 301 have direct connectivity to the ETS network 310.
- ETS users 301 include users 302-304.
- OIS users 350 have direct connectivity to the OIS network 310.
- OIS users 350 include users 351-354.
- the ETS and OIS networks are interconnected through coupling 335 through which information is exchanged.
- the two networks have independent connectivity through couplings 333-334 to a Shared Cross Service Association, SCSA 330.
- SCSA 330 contains the user mapping of both the ETS attached users 301 and the OIS attached users 350 in a user image database CSADm w331 stored in storage media 332.
- the mapping correlates all the identification and verification IDENTIFIERs and passwords of both the ETS users 301 and OIS users 350. This enables each user to operate within the Cross Service Domain under multiple appropriate service IDENTIFIERs and to retain a single user image for applications which bridge the service boundaries.
- both the ETS 310 and OIS 340 networks have access to the user image database CSADm 331.
- the entire user mapping is resident separately in both the ETS 310 and the OIS 340 networks.
- These embodiments represent different degrees of centralized system CSADm implementations in which each network has access to the entire user image mappings.
- the CSADm provides user image data to other entities. This enables the other entities to share and use the CSADm contents for identifying and/or verifying a user by any of that user's image entries in a variety of domains and formats.
- these other entities are also provided with rights to add, delete and modify user image data from the CSADm mapping.
- An entity normally only modifies image data associated with itself and/or upon the user's verified request.
- each network entity only maps the user images of users which have direct connectivity. This is most generally employed in a distributed system implementation of the invention.
- the ETS 310 includes the database mapping of only the family of users referred to as ETS users 301.
- the OIS includes the database mapping of only the family of users referred to as OIS users 350. In this way the user's image is resident only in the network entity which is responsible for generating and providing the user's common bill and/or any connectivity maintenance.
- a large network generally implements a combination of distributed and centralized implementations.
- some entities will have a mapping of a large subset or the entire user population, other entities will have a mapping of only directly connected users, while still other entities may not be adapted to make use of the CSADm database.
- OIS 340 service request using telephone 306 for service to be provided to the computer 305.
- the ETS 310 requests and receives an IDENTIFIER association for USER abc from the SCSA 330.
- OIS 340 forwards the transmission to ⁇ C-prime ⁇ in the ETS 310.
- the entity shown as the OIS network 340 has enhanced telephony service network capabilities and characteristics similar to the ETS 310.
- the ETS 310 and the OIS 340 may be operating in different geographic areas with different names but having like capabilities.
- the ETS 310 may be one regional operating company or subset thereof.
- the OIS 340 may be a second regional operating company or subset thereof. In this situation each regional operating company, or its subset, maps and handles all its own directly connected customers.
- the present invention is also advantageous to service support applications such as: common billing customer service, problem reporting; service registration; and service provisioning.
- the CSADm provides a user association means so that its users can receive common billing for enhanced telephony services, Internet access services, electronic commerce service and on-line information services.
- Detail billing records transmitted to the CSADm supplier are associated with each common user via the CSADm to enable single billing for each common user. This is done in traditional fashion or through real-time on-line or IVR demand techniques.
- FIG. 4 shows three service networks SN-1 430, SN-2 440, SN-3 450, and SN-4 420.
- the three networks are provided common customer servicing by a Shared Cross Service Association (SCSA) provider 460.
- SCSA 460 includes a CSADm 462, a conversion means 466, a customer service and maintenance control means 465, a common billing system 468, and a storage means 464.
- Each service network has its own directly connected user family.
- Network SN-1 430 serves SN-1 users 402.
- Network SN-2 440 serves SN-2 users 444.
- SN-3 users 454 are served by network SN-3 450, and
- Network SN-4 420 serves SN-4 users 422.
- Network SN-4 420 has no direct connectivity to the SCSA 460. This may be because of the specialized nature of network SN-4 420. It may be due to lack of adaptation to, or cooperation with, the common sharing of the SCSA 460 provisions. Normally, all the four service networks have either direct or indirect connectivity with each other.
- SCSA 460 has a user image map for each user in the user families of SN-1 430, SN-2 440, and SN-3 450. Upon receiving a request from a network, SCSA 460 uses the mapping to make available to that network the cross service IDENTIFIER and password associations for a user. The association results in the provision of the pass-through and/or access IDENTIFIER or IDENTIFIERs for a requested service to be requested from, and then provided by, the providing service.
- USER 33 404 uses three devices D 405, E 406, and F 407, to access desired services.
- SN-2 Following a service provision to USER 33 404 by SN-2 440 SN-2 sends a billing detail record to the SCSA 460 on-line 446.
- USER-33 404 is provided a service from SN-1 430 through device D 406, E 407 or F 408, SN-1 sends a billing detail record to the SCSA 460 on-line 432. Both of these records are associated with the same end user, USER 33 404, and the data is sent to that user's billing file in the common billing system 468.
- the data may be used to generate paper bills, camera ready copy for paper bills, or may be returned to the storage mean 464 for storage.
- the SCSA 460 makes the billing information available to the entity to which USER 33 has direct connectivity, SN-1 430 .
- USER 33 's bill is supplied to the end user, namely USER 33 404.
- CSADm of the present invention allows service providers to enable computer ETS interfaces for telephony functions.
- implementing of the CSADm allows an end user to interrogate and modify telephony functions with all advantages of a graphic computerized user interface. These functions include call forwarding and follow-me universal phone number selection lists. This enables an increasing array of available user directed and/ implemented commands. For example, it enables a small business owner to use a PC application to direct the telephone network to automatically route telephone calls to a home number after close of business. Enhanced services such are these are presently modified only by skilled telephone company operators.
- service selections are examined much like software configuration data via a PC-like screen.
- This provides a two dimensional graphic ETS user interface to what has traditionally been a one- dimensional serial data input and output readout.
- a third dimension namely time and/or duration of service modification, is also easily made available to the ETS user.
- This service enhancement has great value to voice subscribers. It allows them to employ a friendly GUI to modify, verify, and control their enhanced telephony services via access through the Internet, or a telephone company service provider dial-in port.
- FIG. 5 shows a service network 500 which provides Enhanced Telephony Services, ETS 510, to ⁇ r ⁇ residential users 502, USER R1 504 to USER Rr 506, and to ⁇ b ⁇ business users 520, USER B1 522 to USER Bb 527.
- the ETS 510 includes a network cross-connect and control 512 which provides all network functions other than the cross service association domain mappings.
- the cross service association domain mapping is provided by CSADm 514.
- Residential users 502 includes USER R1 504, USER R2 505, and USER Rr 506.
- Business users 520 include USER B1 522, USER B2 523, USER B3 526, and USER Bb 527.
- CSADm 514 associates for a common image, the residential telephone 505 with the business telephone 524 and with the personal computer 526. This essentially associates residential USER R2 with business USER B2 as a common user with three ETS connections, two telephones 505, 524 and a personal computer 525.
- USER B2 is a small business which responds to business customer calls to telephone number ⁇ G B-TEL ⁇ at a business telephone 524 during the hours between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM of each day.
- the ETS is firstly set to route calls to telephone number ⁇ G B-TEL ⁇ between 6:00 PM in the evening and 9:00 AM of the following day to this common user's residential phone 505 with telephone number ⁇ G R-TEL ⁇ .
- this common user may use the PC 525 to change the time of routing business calls to the residential phone.
- the small business owner connects to the ETS 510 and requests to make a change in its time based call routing control.
- User profile information is retrieved for this common user, USER B2 , and a graphic user interface is presented to allow USER B2 to request a change using PC 525. In this case, the change is to route calls to the residential phone between the hours of 5:00 PM and 9:00 AM rather than between the hours of 6:00 PM to 9:00 AM previously set.
- FIG. 6 shows an example of the steps involved in enabling a user to use that user's personal computer to change that user's telephone service parameters.
- USER B2 523 uses USER B2 's PC 525 to change the time of forwarding phone calls directed to USER B2 's business phone 524 to USER B2 's residential phone 505.
- FIG. 6 The steps involved in the operation of the cross service user interface of FIG. 5, are shown in FIG. 6. Included with the flow block diagram 600 are the specifics of the example chosen. These specifics are each included within an ellipse. Operation commences at the start block 602.
- the ETS 512 awaits a user connection request, block 604.
- the ETS 510 responds by furnishing the requested PC-type connection to the PC 525 by providing a menu of applications, block 608.
- USER B2 605 selects the application for time-based routing (ellipse 609).
- the ETS determines if the application requires IDENTIFIER association, block 612.
- the time-based routing application does indeed require IDENTIFIER association, block 614. If an association does not exist, block 616, the request is denied, block 618, and the PC-connection is again furnished the application menu, block 608. If the association exists, block 616, or an association is not required, the application is furnished, block 620.
- the routing control for call forwarding of calls to business telephone 523 is initially set to activate call forwarding to residential telephone 505 between the hours of 6:00 PM and 9:00 AM (ellipse 621).
- USER B2 exercises the time based routing application, block 622, to activate the call forwarding between the hours of 5:00 PM and 9:00 AM.
- the ETS determines if USER B2 wants to exercise another application, block 626. If not the ETS discontinues the connection with the PC 525, block 628, and goes back to await another user connection request, block 604. If USER B2 wants to exercise another application 626, the PC 525 is then furnished the application menu, block 608.
- the ETS determines if the phone to which the call is directed is busy, block 654. If it is not busy, the telephone connection is established, block 648. When USER B3 hangs-up, the telephone connection is disconnected, block 656 and the ETS awaits another request from USER B3 block 604.
- the interactive sequence of steps described with the aid of FIG. 6 for USER B2 and USER B3 are typical for the ETS quasi-simultaneous servicing of a multiplicity of similar and non-similar ETS connected users.
- a user can modify a computer's connection parameters, such as baud rate and parity, from that user's telephone or from a second, often remote, computer.
- the user can perform parameter modifications to an owned connection medium, from a remote access medium that is not owned by that user. This is accomplished by the user identifying himself and verifying himself with a password. Furthermore, the modifications are made even when the remote access medium operates in one modality, e.g. voice, and the medium connection to be modified operates in an other modality, e.g. data and/or still or motion video.
- modality e.g. voice
- modality e.g. data and/or still or motion video.
- the steps of FIG. 6 may also be followed when a request is received by the ETS from a remote user with which the ETS does not have direct connectivity. This is most feasible when that remote user's image is in an ETS local CSADm. It is also viable when a non-local CSADM contains that remote user's image and is available to the ETS. This technique is similarly adaptable for use with a shared CSADm.
- the request denial in FIG. 6 block 612 is useful whenever the user lacks rights and/or assets for exercising a particular application.
- This is an ETS response behavior mode useable for any application request made by a user for which the user is not enabled, and/or which is inappropriate to that user's image in the CSADm. This is the case for example if a user image shows only a single phone connection, and/or that user is without call-forwarding privileges. It generally does not allow a user to modify or cause forwarding of calls directed to a phone for which the user is not the system recognized owner. It may however not preclude the ability of a user to redirect calls directed to a phone that it does own, to a phone which it does not own. Request denial is sometimes due to the unavailability of equipment required to satisfy a request.
- the ETS provides modality conversion such as voice to and from document, via an available conversion means.
- the ETS does not normally provide a user's service request for a service between a user-owned medium and a non-user owned medium, if the owner of the owned medium does not have conversion means privileges.
- the owner of the non-user owned medium may subsidize use of the conversion means for callers to the non-user owned medium.
- the present invention is similarly used to advantage to enable service media transformations. These result in services that employ continually developing advancements in technologies such as speech recognition and speech synthesis that feature the requisite media transformations.
- Use of the CSADm allows these services to use the most appropriate network functions to communicate with an end user. For example, when a voice mail message is received which is targeted to an end user by a telephone number, speech recognition is used to transform the message to text. The text is available to be sent to one or more on-line E-mail services for end user examination.
- the message may be directed to particular CSADm IDENTIFIERs based on a message's header, keyword, content and/or address list in accordance with CSADm supplied appropriate IDENTIFIERs.
- FIG. 7 shows a multiple network entity configuration 700.
- Three entities are shown.
- One entity is Service Network-A 720 which includes ETS 722.
- a second entity is Provider Network-B 740.
- Provider Network-B 740 includes an on-line information service, OIS 742. It has ⁇ N ⁇ OIS users 750, ranging from USER B1 , to USER BN 752-756.
- OIS 742 user connectivity generally includes a plurality of DS-0, DS-1, DS-3, T1 and ISDN connections.
- a third entity is the Shared Network-C 730.
- Shared Network-C 730 includes a shared CSADm 732 which is shared by all participating entities.
- Service Network-A 720 and Provider Network-B 740 are participating entities.
- the original voice mail message is stored in ETS 722 for access and retrieval by USER A2 through telephone 712.
- each user may use that user's MAIN-ID from any access media, and from any access point, to access any voice or electronic mail message directed to that user.
- each user accesses any network that is interconnected with the Shared Network-C 730 with a medium and IDENTIFIER appropriate to that accessed network.
- the Shared Network-C 730 provides that accessed network with the CSADm IDENTIFIER associations of that user. This association allows that user to access and upon verification to use, listen and/or view any message or service accessible to any of the associated IDENTIFIERs.
- on-demand ETS provided transformation means for converting voice to and from a document enables a telephone user to have on-demand access to PC style features through an array of equipment recognized voice commands. Users who either lack access to a personal computer, or just prefer a telephone, may receive e-mail via voice appropriate navigation commands.
- These types of transformation techniques used with the present invention enables the granting of service delivery to a wide population of users. This includes users with very limited devices and/or network connections.
- the Shared Network-C 730 provides the accessing network with the CSADm IDENTIFIER associations of each user. This association allows that user to use, listen or view any message or service accessible to any of the associated IDENTIFIERs. This is just one utilization of the Shared Network-C 730.
- the Shared Network-C 730 which includes the CSADm 732, is connected to a plurality of user servicing networks.
- the Shared Network-C 730 is basically a provider of services to other entities. Each such entity is usually a multiple user connecting network.
- the Shared Network-C 730 is therefore a prime locale for performing any of many entity functions which are commonly required by a plurality of its connected entities.
- the Shared Network-C 730 includes a special service means to provide special services to networks 734.
- This special service means 734 includes an array of network servicing means besides the separately shown CSADm 732.
- Many network appropriate services result from the Shared Network-C's 730 having a CSADm 732 shared by other entities.
- One of the available services of the special servicing means 734 is a shared common protocol and conversion system described previously. Another is the shared common billing system.
- a shared common billing system requires that the Shared Network-C 730 be made aware of user transactions and their cost. These may include only usages which require IDENTIFIER association or even utilizations that do not.
- the Shared Network-C 730 forwards this data periodically and/or on-demand to each common user an/or to each common user's main provider.
- the main provider uses the data for sending a single bill for all that common user's utilizations.
- This billing data may be used to enable a user and/or a service provider to set a maximum billing limit.
- the billing limit may be set to be a maximum dollar limit, or as is more usual, to limit the expenditure over a particular time period. The time period is usually for a month, but it can set to be daily, weekly or any combination of these.
- Another resulting special servicing means 734 service is formation of a database of service utilization habits of each CSADm common user.
- the database may provide information tracking the types and/or number of a common user's usages, and/or the frequency and population of users of particular servicing networks service provisions. Databases may be formed that are useful for advertising and/or to determine which user may be a candidate for an additional or enhanced service.
- the database can be used to identify good credit and/or bad credit users. This may be based upon user bill payment history.
- the database may be used to make surveys and/or special offers etc.
- FIG. 8 shows an embodiment of the steps to provide the transformed information commencing from the start block 802.
- the ETS determines if the called party, USER A2 , is busy, block 824. If the called party is not busy the telephone connection to USER A2 is made, block 826. If USER A2 is busy, block 824, USER A4 is offered an option to send a voice mail message to USER A2 , block 828. If voice mail is desired, then USER A4 records a voice message, block 830. The message is stored, block 832, and USER A2 is disconnected, block 816.
- the present invention is also used to advantage for multi-media cross services.
- both data and voice networks are tools for collaboration of a plurality of users.
- These services enable people to collaborate with other people through real time voice and data telephony communication in a plurality of modalities with various access media.
- the services enable applications to collaborate with other applications through isochronous or asynchronous protocols.
- the CSADm offerings allow end users to participate in multi-media conferences by associating disparate devices, user interfaces, and collaboration techniques. It enables voice and/or data real time collaboration for multiple users.
- each user may employ one or more telephone lines.
