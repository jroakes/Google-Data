- FIG. 11 shows a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- An application specific user interface may allow the safe use of media applications on a mobile computing device in conjunction with a vehicle-based computing device, while still presenting a unique user interface for different media applications.
- a mobile computing device such as a smartphone or tablet, may include a number of media applications, including, for example, music players that playback locally and remotely stored music, subscription-based music players and Internet radio players.
- Each media application may have its own unique user interface to display on the user's mobile computing device, which may allow the user to interact with and control the media applications via a touchscreen on the mobile computing device.
- the user may connect the mobile computing device to a vehicle computing device, for example, the head unit of an audio/visual system in a car, for example, using a wired or wireless connection.
- the user may then use one of the media applications on the mobile computing device, for example, to playback music through the car stereo.
- the media application may expose, for example, through an Application Programming Interface (API), the various features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application.
- API Application Programming Interface
- the vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application, which may include commands such as play, next track, previous track, and pause, and ranking inputs such as thumbs up and thumbs down.
- the vehicle computing device may then display, on a display that is part of the vehicle computing device, a user interface translated from a template user interface and the ranking of the features, and customized using a media application theme.
- the translated interface may include controls that allow the user to access certain features of the media application that are deemed safe to access while driving, while preventing access to other controls.
- the controls may be presented in a manner that makes them safer for a driver to use than the controls would be if they presented on the display of the vehicle computing device in the same manner as the controls are presented on the display of the mobile computing device by the media application.
- the template user interface may be used with any media application the user selects to use while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. This may allow for a standardized display for all media applications used through the vehicle computing device while still allowing the media applications to control media playback.
- Media applications may have their own themes, which may be used to customize the translated interface for the media applications. This may allow the translated interface to include controls for features that are unique to a specific media application, and may also allow for easier identification of which media application is currently being used, based on background colors, overall color scheme, and media application logos displayed with the translated interface.
- a mobile computing device such as, for example, a smartphone or tablet, may include any number of different media applications. Different media applications may have access to different media items from different sources of media, and may have independent media databases stored on the mobile computing device.
- Media players may have access to media items stored in the local storage of the mobile computing device, media items stored in remote storage accessible by the mobile computing device, or access to media items through subscription services.
- Media items may include audio tracks, such as music tracks, and videos. For example, a user may install three separate music players on their smartphone. The first and second music player may detect music tracks stored in the local storage of the smartphone, and may build their own separate media databases.
- the second music player may also have access to music tracks stored by the user in a remote music track storage service, and may include these music tracks as part of its media database, though the tracks may not be part of the media database built by the first music player.
- the third music player may have access to music tracks through a subscription service, and may have no media database, or, if the service allows for local storage, a media database that includes only music tracks the user has stored locally from the subscription service. These locally stored subscription service music tracks may not appear in the media database for the first or second music player.
- the different media applications may also have different user interfaces.
- Each media application may have a different placements for common media application user interface controls, such as play and pause buttons, and may include their own unique controls, such as thumbs up and thumbs down controls, or other controls for rating media items, or controls for posting messages to social media services.
- a music player may include a next track, previous track, play, and pause buttons, for controlling playback of locally stored music tracks, while another music player may include only a play, pause, and next track buttons, for controlling playback of music tracks accessed through an Internet radio service which may not allow skipping back to the previous track.
- the mobile computing device with the media applications may be connected to a vehicle computing device, which may be, for example, a head unit in a car, truck, or other personal vehicle, or any other type of vehicle.
- vehicle computing device may include a display, which may be, for example, a touchscreen in the center console of the vehicle, and may be connected to the vehicle's stereo system, allowing for audio playback.
- the mobile computing device may be connected to the vehicle computing device in any suitable manner.
- a smartphone may be connected to a car head unit using a USB cable, a Bluetooth connection, a device-to-device WiFi connection, or to an in-vehicle Wireless LAN.
- the vehicle computing device may access various features of the mobile computing device, and may, for example, allow for control of the mobile computing device through the controls for the vehicle computing device.
- a user may be able to, for example, view applications available on the mobile computing device using the display of the vehicle computing device, for example, through screen sharing or duplication, or through a separate interface that lists the available application, and run the applications.
- the display of the mobile computing device may also be used as the display for the vehicle computing device, which may not have its own separate display hardware, or may have simple display hardware not suitable for interaction with applications on the mobile computing device.
- the mobile computing device may be a tablet, and the tablet display may also be used as the display of the vehicle computing device.
- a media application may be run on the mobile computing device while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device.
- a user may use the controls for the vehicle computing device, such as a touchscreen display, to select and run a music player on a smartphone that is connected to the vehicle computing device with a USB cable.
- the media application may include an API that exposes the features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application to the vehicle computing device.
- the vehicle computing device may include a component, for example, a software application installed on the vehicle computing device or as part of the operating system of the vehicle computing device, which may access the API of the media application to receive a list of the features available in the application.
- the features may include, for example, controls used by the media application.
- the vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application based on, for example, how safe the features are for use by a driver during operation of the vehicle. For example, a play button may be considered very safe and ranked high, while a button that allowed for posting to social media services may be considered unsafe, and ranked low.
- Each media application may provide a list of the features used by that media application. Access to the features on the list may be provided through, for example, the API.
- the media application may list only those features that can be used to control the media application, and may omit any features not used by the media application. For example, a media application that plays back custom-built radio stations may not include a “previous track” feature, as the media application may not allow users to skip back to a previously played track. Thus, the media application would not list “previous track” as one of its available features.
- the features of the media application may be combined with a template user interface and a media application theme to create a translated interface that may be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device for the media application running on the mobile computing device.
- the template user interface may include locations and sizes for the controls or buttons for different features, so that the features of the media application can be controlled through, for example, a touchscreen that is part of the display for the vehicle computing device.
- the template user interface may have a location for previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons, such that those controls are always displayed in the same location no matter which media application is being run on the mobile computing device.
- a first music player may include the features of previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons.
- a second music player may include next track, pause, and play buttons.
- the common features may be displayed in the same location on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- no previous track button may be displayed.
- Certain low ranked features may also not have displayed controls.
- the second music player may include the feature of a button for posting to social media services.
- the vehicle computing device may rank the button low enough that the button may not be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- the template user interface may include a set number of slots for controls, with each slot representing the location and size for a particular control.
- the template use interface may include five slots, for controls for “play”, “pause”, “previous track”, “next track”, and “information display.” These may be the controls that correspond to the most common features among a number of media applications.
- the features listed by a media application may have their controls appear on the translated interface as defined by slots from the template user interface that are for controls corresponding to the feature. If a media application does not use a particular feature, the slot for the control corresponding to that feature may be left empty on the translated user interface.
- the slots may also be associated with priorities, which may be based, for example, on how accessible a control placed in the location for the slot may be to the driver of the vehicle.
- a slot with a location that would let a control placed in that slot in a translated interface be highly accessible to the driver may have a higher priority than a slot with a location that is less accessible.
- Unique features of media applications may also be displayed on the translated interface, and may be taken from, for example a media application theme, and may be in the list of features sent by the media application.
- a media application may include a bookmark button.
- the bookmark button may be taken from the media application theme, which may include a location, size, and icon for the bookmark button, and become part of the translated interface displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- the media application may define a slot from the template user interface that may be used by the unique feature.
- a media application may not use a previous track control, but may use a bookmark control.
- the list of features sent by the media application may indicate that the bookmark control should use the slot that would have been used for the previous track control.
- the bookmark control may then appear on the translated interface in the location that is used for the previous track control for media applications that do have a previous track control.
- controls may always appear in set locations on translated user interfaces, even when different media applications use different controls. This may allow a user, for example, the driver of a vehicle, to always know where controls will be located for media applications, even when the controls are different between different media applications.
- the developer of a media application may declare which features are used by the media application, and which slots should be used by unique features for the media application. For example, the developer may specify that a slot for a feature that the developer does not use in their media application may be used by a unique feature that the developer has added to their media application. This declaration may be made within the media application, and may be included on the list features used to generate the translated user interface.
- the developer may also just specify which features for the developer's media application are unique features, without specifying specific slots for the unique features. In this case, controls for the unique features may be a placed into available slots, for example, slots for features not used by the developer's media application, in any suitable manner.
- the developer may specify priorities for the unique features, and the controls for the unique features may be placed in available slots based on the priorities.
- a high priority feature may be placed in a slot with a high priority, for example, a slot that may be in more accessible location on the translated interface.
- a media application may not use a previous track button or a next track button, but may use unique features of a bookmark button and change station button, which may change the internet radio station used by a media application, cycling through available stations.
- the change station button may be higher priority than the bookmark button, and may be placed in the slot that would have been used by the next track button, which may be in a location on the user interface that is more easily accessible to a driver than the slot used for the previous track button.
- the bookmark button which may be lower priority, may be placed in the slot that would have been used by the previous track button.
- the translated interface may also have different color schemes for different media applications.
- a first media application may have a media application theme that includes a blue and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the first media application.
- a second media application may have a media application theme that includes an orange and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the second media application.
- the media application theme may also include an application logo, or different icons for common controls, that may be included in the translated interface. This may allow for the different translated interfaces to be application specific user interfaces, and may make it easier, for example, for a driver to tell which media application is currently being run based on the colors, logos, and other identifiers displayed on the translated interface, despite the identical placement of controls across different translated interfaces for different media applications.
- Media application themes may be created by, for example, the creator of the media application, and may be stored with the media application, or may be stored on the vehicle computing device.
- a media application may send its media application theme to the vehicle computing device to be used in a translated interface whenever the media application is run while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device.
- the media application theme may also be stored on the vehicle computing device, for example, with the template user interface, and retrieved whenever the vehicle computing device creates a translated interface for the media application.
- the translated interface for a media application may be used to control the media application in a similar manner to using the media application's user interface on the mobile computing device.
- Commands issued through the translated interface for example, by the touching of buttons displayed on the touchscreen of the display of the vehicle computing display, may be sent to the media application running on the mobile computing device.
- the mobile computing device may respond to the commands as if they were issued through the user interface of the mobile computing device. For example, a user may press the play button on the display of the translated interface, which may result in the media application beginning or resuming playback of a media item.
- the media application may still have access to any media databases the media application has stored on the mobile computing device and to any local, remote, subscription based, or otherwise accessible media items that media application has access to when run on the mobile computing device.
- an Internet radio player may still have access to Internet radio stations
- a subscription music player may still access music tracks through the subscription service
- a local music player may still play local music tracks based on the media database for the local music player.
- Media items played back using a media application on a mobile computing connected to a vehicle computing device may be played through the audio/visual devices attached to the vehicle computing device.
- the user may use the translated interface to start playback of a music track using a media application on the mobile computing device.
- the music track may be played through the vehicle's stereo.
- the audio signal for the music track may be processed through the media application, by hardware and software for audio processing associated with the vehicle computing device and vehicle stereo, or both. This may allow for the use of equalizer settings in media application on mobile computing devices when using the media application to playback audio through the vehicle's stereo.
- the API for the media application may also expose data to the vehicle computing device.
- the API may be used by the vehicle computing device to media database data such as media libraries and playlists, metadata for media items, available Internet radio stations, and other data associated with media applications.
- This may allow the translated interface to display metadata, for example, artist, album, and track title for music being played back using a media application, and allow the user to browse and select media items in a manner appropriate to the media application.
- the user may use the translated interface to view available Internet radio stations when running an Internet radio music player on the mobile computing device, or browse a library of available music tracks when using a local music player on the mobile computing device.

Description
- Mobile computing devices, such as smartphones, may be connected to suitable computing devices in a vehicle, such as a car. For example, a car may have head unit with a large display that is capable of connecting to a smartphone via a wired or wireless connection. This may allow the smartphone access to other equipment within the vehicle, such as a stereo system that can be used for audio playback of media stored on the smartphone, or accessible through the smartphone. An application running on the smartphone may be controlled using the vehicles controls, such as a touchscreen on the display of the head unit. However, a smartphone application's user interface may not be suitable for use by a driver while the vehicle is in motion, as the positioning and size of the controls may be difficult. Some of the features of the smartphone application may also be unsafe to use regardless of the design of the user interface, such as, for example, features that require the user to send messages, for example, positing to social media services, or perform other actions that would be distracting for the driver of a vehicle.
- Many different media applications used on mobile computing devices may use the same basic controls, such as play, pause, previous track, and next track. A user interface for smartphone applications such as media players may display these basic controls in the same position for different media applications, for safer operation of the media applications as a user may always know where a particular control is, regardless of the media application. However, some media applications may not use some of these basic controls, and may include other, unique controls, in their place, which may need to be placed in the user interface among the basic controls still used by the media applications in a manner which does not compromise safe operation of the media application.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, a template user interface including slots may be received. The slots may each include a definition for a control. The definition may include a position within a user interface for the control and a size of the control. The control may be associated with a feature for media applications. A list including a feature for a first media application may be received. The first media application may be run on a first computing device. The feature for the first media application may use one of the slots of the template user interface. The feature for the first media application may be different from the features for media applications associated with the slots. A translated interface for the first media application may be generated by replacing one the controls associated with the slots with a control for the feature of the first media application, where the control for the feature of the first media application uses the position in the definition associated with the slot for the replaced control. The translated interface may be displayed for the first media application on the display of a second computing device.
- The features for media applications may each be display information, play, pause, next track, previous track shuffle, repeat, or randomize. The feature of the first media application may be bookmark, post to social media service, rate positively, or rate negatively. The first computing device may be a smartphone, a tablet, or a laptop. The second computing device may be a vehicle head unit. The list of features may omit the feature for media applications associated with the replaced control, and wherein the list of features specifies that the control for the feature of the first media application uses the slot associated with the replaced control. The feature for the first media application appears on the displayed translated interface in place of the feature for media applications associated with the control for the slot. Each of the slots may be associated with a priority. The feature of the first media application may be associated with a priority. The slot on the template user interface used by the feature of the first media application may be based on the priorities associated with the slots and the priority of the feature of the first media application.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, a means for receiving a template user interface including slots, where each slot may include a definition for a control, where the definition may include a position within a user interface for the control and a size of the control, and where the control is associated with a feature for media applications, a means for receiving a list including a feature for a first media application, where the first media application may be run on a first computing device, where the feature for the first media application uses one of the slots of the template user interface, and where the feature for the first media application may be different from the features for media applications associated with the slots, a means for generating a translated interface for the first media application by replacing one the controls associated with the slots with a control for the feature of the first media application, wherein the control for the feature of the first media application may use the position in the definition for the slot for the replaced control, and a means for displaying the translated interface for the first media application on the display of a second computing device, are included.
- A means for receiving a list of features for a media application, each of the features associated with a control for the media application, a means for ranking the features on the list of features, a means for receiving a template user interface comprising slots, each slot including a definition for a control, the definition for a control including a position within a user interface for the control and a size of the control, each slot further including a feature associated with the control, a means for associating each feature from the list of features ranked above a threshold with a corresponding slot in the template user interface based on the feature of the slot to generate a translated interface, wherein the control for a slot with a feature that does not correspond to a feature from the list of features ranked above a threshold is not part of the translated interface, a means for displaying the translated interface to a user, a means for receiving an input to the translated interface, a means for translating the input into a command control for the media application, and a means for sending the command control to the media application, are also included.

FIG. 11 shows a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. - An application specific user interface may allow the safe use of media applications on a mobile computing device in conjunction with a vehicle-based computing device, while still presenting a unique user interface for different media applications. A mobile computing device, such as a smartphone or tablet, may include a number of media applications, including, for example, music players that playback locally and remotely stored music, subscription-based music players and Internet radio players. Each media application may have its own unique user interface to display on the user's mobile computing device, which may allow the user to interact with and control the media applications via a touchscreen on the mobile computing device. The user may connect the mobile computing device to a vehicle computing device, for example, the head unit of an audio/visual system in a car, for example, using a wired or wireless connection. The user may then use one of the media applications on the mobile computing device, for example, to playback music through the car stereo. The media application may expose, for example, through an Application Programming Interface (API), the various features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application. The vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application, which may include commands such as play, next track, previous track, and pause, and ranking inputs such as thumbs up and thumbs down. The vehicle computing device may then display, on a display that is part of the vehicle computing device, a user interface translated from a template user interface and the ranking of the features, and customized using a media application theme. The translated interface may include controls that allow the user to access certain features of the media application that are deemed safe to access while driving, while preventing access to other controls. The controls may be presented in a manner that makes them safer for a driver to use than the controls would be if they presented on the display of the vehicle computing device in the same manner as the controls are presented on the display of the mobile computing device by the media application. The template user interface may be used with any media application the user selects to use while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. This may allow for a standardized display for all media applications used through the vehicle computing device while still allowing the media applications to control media playback. Media applications may have their own themes, which may be used to customize the translated interface for the media applications. This may allow the translated interface to include controls for features that are unique to a specific media application, and may also allow for easier identification of which media application is currently being used, based on background colors, overall color scheme, and media application logos displayed with the translated interface.
- A mobile computing device, such as, for example, a smartphone or tablet, may include any number of different media applications. Different media applications may have access to different media items from different sources of media, and may have independent media databases stored on the mobile computing device. Media players may have access to media items stored in the local storage of the mobile computing device, media items stored in remote storage accessible by the mobile computing device, or access to media items through subscription services. Media items may include audio tracks, such as music tracks, and videos. For example, a user may install three separate music players on their smartphone. The first and second music player may detect music tracks stored in the local storage of the smartphone, and may build their own separate media databases. The second music player may also have access to music tracks stored by the user in a remote music track storage service, and may include these music tracks as part of its media database, though the tracks may not be part of the media database built by the first music player. The third music player may have access to music tracks through a subscription service, and may have no media database, or, if the service allows for local storage, a media database that includes only music tracks the user has stored locally from the subscription service. These locally stored subscription service music tracks may not appear in the media database for the first or second music player.
- The different media applications may also have different user interfaces. Each media application may have a different placements for common media application user interface controls, such as play and pause buttons, and may include their own unique controls, such as thumbs up and thumbs down controls, or other controls for rating media items, or controls for posting messages to social media services. For example, a music player may include a next track, previous track, play, and pause buttons, for controlling playback of locally stored music tracks, while another music player may include only a play, pause, and next track buttons, for controlling playback of music tracks accessed through an Internet radio service which may not allow skipping back to the previous track.
- The mobile computing device with the media applications may be connected to a vehicle computing device, which may be, for example, a head unit in a car, truck, or other personal vehicle, or any other type of vehicle. The vehicle computing device may include a display, which may be, for example, a touchscreen in the center console of the vehicle, and may be connected to the vehicle's stereo system, allowing for audio playback. The mobile computing device may be connected to the vehicle computing device in any suitable manner. For example, a smartphone may be connected to a car head unit using a USB cable, a Bluetooth connection, a device-to-device WiFi connection, or to an in-vehicle Wireless LAN. This may allow the vehicle computing device to access various features of the mobile computing device, and may, for example, allow for control of the mobile computing device through the controls for the vehicle computing device. A user may be able to, for example, view applications available on the mobile computing device using the display of the vehicle computing device, for example, through screen sharing or duplication, or through a separate interface that lists the available application, and run the applications. In some implementations, the display of the mobile computing device may also be used as the display for the vehicle computing device, which may not have its own separate display hardware, or may have simple display hardware not suitable for interaction with applications on the mobile computing device. For example, the mobile computing device may be a tablet, and the tablet display may also be used as the display of the vehicle computing device.
- A media application may be run on the mobile computing device while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. For example, a user may use the controls for the vehicle computing device, such as a touchscreen display, to select and run a music player on a smartphone that is connected to the vehicle computing device with a USB cable. The media application may include an API that exposes the features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application to the vehicle computing device. The vehicle computing device may include a component, for example, a software application installed on the vehicle computing device or as part of the operating system of the vehicle computing device, which may access the API of the media application to receive a list of the features available in the application. The features may include, for example, controls used by the media application. The vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application based on, for example, how safe the features are for use by a driver during operation of the vehicle. For example, a play button may be considered very safe and ranked high, while a button that allowed for posting to social media services may be considered unsafe, and ranked low.
- Each media application may provide a list of the features used by that media application. Access to the features on the list may be provided through, for example, the API. The media application may list only those features that can be used to control the media application, and may omit any features not used by the media application. For example, a media application that plays back custom-built radio stations may not include a “previous track” feature, as the media application may not allow users to skip back to a previously played track. Thus, the media application would not list “previous track” as one of its available features.
- The features of the media application may be combined with a template user interface and a media application theme to create a translated interface that may be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device for the media application running on the mobile computing device. The template user interface may include locations and sizes for the controls or buttons for different features, so that the features of the media application can be controlled through, for example, a touchscreen that is part of the display for the vehicle computing device. For example, the template user interface may have a location for previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons, such that those controls are always displayed in the same location no matter which media application is being run on the mobile computing device. For example, a first music player may include the features of previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons. A second music player may include next track, pause, and play buttons. When either the first or second music player is run on the mobile computing device connected to the vehicle computing device, the common features may be displayed in the same location on the display of the vehicle computing device. When the second music player is running, no previous track button may be displayed. Certain low ranked features may also not have displayed controls. For example, the second music player may include the feature of a button for posting to social media services. The vehicle computing device may rank the button low enough that the button may not be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- The template user interface may include a set number of slots for controls, with each slot representing the location and size for a particular control. For example, the template use interface may include five slots, for controls for “play”, “pause”, “previous track”, “next track”, and “information display.” These may be the controls that correspond to the most common features among a number of media applications. The features listed by a media application may have their controls appear on the translated interface as defined by slots from the template user interface that are for controls corresponding to the feature. If a media application does not use a particular feature, the slot for the control corresponding to that feature may be left empty on the translated user interface. For example, if a media application does not use a previous track control, the location where the previous track control would have been located in the translated user interface may be left empty. The slots may also be associated with priorities, which may be based, for example, on how accessible a control placed in the location for the slot may be to the driver of the vehicle. A slot with a location that would let a control placed in that slot in a translated interface be highly accessible to the driver may have a higher priority than a slot with a location that is less accessible.
- Unique features of media applications may also be displayed on the translated interface, and may be taken from, for example a media application theme, and may be in the list of features sent by the media application. For example, a media application may include a bookmark button. When a media application lists a bookmark button among its features, the bookmark button may be taken from the media application theme, which may include a location, size, and icon for the bookmark button, and become part of the translated interface displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device. The media application may define a slot from the template user interface that may be used by the unique feature. For example, a media application may not use a previous track control, but may use a bookmark control. The list of features sent by the media application may indicate that the bookmark control should use the slot that would have been used for the previous track control. The bookmark control may then appear on the translated interface in the location that is used for the previous track control for media applications that do have a previous track control. In this way, controls may always appear in set locations on translated user interfaces, even when different media applications use different controls. This may allow a user, for example, the driver of a vehicle, to always know where controls will be located for media applications, even when the controls are different between different media applications.
- The developer of a media application may declare which features are used by the media application, and which slots should be used by unique features for the media application. For example, the developer may specify that a slot for a feature that the developer does not use in their media application may be used by a unique feature that the developer has added to their media application. This declaration may be made within the media application, and may be included on the list features used to generate the translated user interface. The developer may also just specify which features for the developer's media application are unique features, without specifying specific slots for the unique features. In this case, controls for the unique features may be a placed into available slots, for example, slots for features not used by the developer's media application, in any suitable manner. For example, the developer may specify priorities for the unique features, and the controls for the unique features may be placed in available slots based on the priorities. A high priority feature may be placed in a slot with a high priority, for example, a slot that may be in more accessible location on the translated interface. For example, a media application may not use a previous track button or a next track button, but may use unique features of a bookmark button and change station button, which may change the internet radio station used by a media application, cycling through available stations. The change station button may be higher priority than the bookmark button, and may be placed in the slot that would have been used by the next track button, which may be in a location on the user interface that is more easily accessible to a driver than the slot used for the previous track button. The bookmark button, which may be lower priority, may be placed in the slot that would have been used by the previous track button.
- The translated interface may also have different color schemes for different media applications. For example, a first media application may have a media application theme that includes a blue and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the first media application. A second media application may have a media application theme that includes an orange and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the second media application. The media application theme may also include an application logo, or different icons for common controls, that may be included in the translated interface. This may allow for the different translated interfaces to be application specific user interfaces, and may make it easier, for example, for a driver to tell which media application is currently being run based on the colors, logos, and other identifiers displayed on the translated interface, despite the identical placement of controls across different translated interfaces for different media applications.
- Media application themes may be created by, for example, the creator of the media application, and may be stored with the media application, or may be stored on the vehicle computing device. For example, a media application may send its media application theme to the vehicle computing device to be used in a translated interface whenever the media application is run while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. The media application theme may also be stored on the vehicle computing device, for example, with the template user interface, and retrieved whenever the vehicle computing device creates a translated interface for the media application.
- The translated interface for a media application may be used to control the media application in a similar manner to using the media application's user interface on the mobile computing device. Commands issued through the translated interface, for example, by the touching of buttons displayed on the touchscreen of the display of the vehicle computing display, may be sent to the media application running on the mobile computing device. The mobile computing device may respond to the commands as if they were issued through the user interface of the mobile computing device. For example, a user may press the play button on the display of the translated interface, which may result in the media application beginning or resuming playback of a media item. The media application may still have access to any media databases the media application has stored on the mobile computing device and to any local, remote, subscription based, or otherwise accessible media items that media application has access to when run on the mobile computing device. For example, an Internet radio player may still have access to Internet radio stations, a subscription music player may still access music tracks through the subscription service, and a local music player may still play local music tracks based on the media database for the local music player.
- Media items played back using a media application on a mobile computing connected to a vehicle computing device may be played through the audio/visual devices attached to the vehicle computing device. For example, the user may use the translated interface to start playback of a music track using a media application on the mobile computing device. The music track may be played through the vehicle's stereo. The audio signal for the music track may be processed through the media application, by hardware and software for audio processing associated with the vehicle computing device and vehicle stereo, or both. This may allow for the use of equalizer settings in media application on mobile computing devices when using the media application to playback audio through the vehicle's stereo.
- The API for the media application may also expose data to the vehicle computing device. For example, the API may be used by the vehicle computing device to media database data such as media libraries and playlists, metadata for media items, available Internet radio stations, and other data associated with media applications. This may allow the translated interface to display metadata, for example, artist, album, and track title for music being played back using a media application, and allow the user to browse and select media items in a manner appropriate to the media application. For example, the user may use the translated interface to view available Internet radio stations when running an Internet radio music player on the mobile computing device, or browse a library of available music tracks when using a local music player on the mobile computing device.

Thevehicle computing device 200 may be a single computing device, or may include multiple connected computing devices, and may be, for example, part of the head unit of a vehicle's audio/visual system. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may use atemplate user interface 242 andmedia application themes 244 from thestorage 240 to generate a translated interface that may be displayed on thedisplay 220. Thedisplay 220 may be any suitable display device connected to thevehicle computing device 200, and may be used to display the translated interface. Thecontrol interface 230 may receive control input from a user, for example, the driver of the vehicle. Thestorage 240 may store thetemplate user interface 242 and themedia application themes 244 in any suitable manner. - The
vehicle interface translator 210 may be any suitable combination of hardware and software in thevehicle computing device 200 for accessing the features of media applications on a mobile computing device, for example, themedia applications template user interface 242 andmedia application themes 244 to generate a translated interface. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may access the features through the feature anddata access template user interface 242 may define locations, sizes, and positions, in a user interface for controls for common features of media applications. The translated interface may include controls for features of a specific media application in the locations, and with the size and shape, defined by thetemplate user interface 242 for those controls. Themedia application themes 244 may include media application themes specific to different media applications. The translated interface may be customized for each media application using a one of themedia application themes 244, which may, for example, change the colors use in the translated interface, add controls for features unique to the media application, add logos, or change icons for controls in the translated interface. Thetemplate user interface 242 may have a certain number of slots for controls, which may be used for common media application controls. A media application, such as any of themedia applications vehicle interface translator 210 indicating which slots on thetemplate user interface 242 should be used by the unique controls, either directly specifying the slot to be used, or specifying a priority for the control for the unique feature. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may then place the controls for the unique features in the slots as specified by the feature list, in place of the control that would normally occupy that slot. If the list of features includes priorities for the control for the unique features, thevehicle interface translator 210 may place the controls for the unique features based on the priorities, for example, placing controls with higher priorities in available slots, for example, slots for features not on the list of features, that also have higher priorities. The unique control with the highest priority may be placed in the available slot with the highest priority among the available slots, and so on until all available slots have been filled. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may also receive media application database data, including, for example, metadata for media items, and display the media application database data to a user using the translated interface on thedisplay 220, and translate commands for a media application received through thecontrol interface 230 to ensure the proper command is sent to the media application. In some implementations, thevehicle interface translator 210 may be run, for example, as an application or operating system component, on themobile computing device 100. - The
display 220 may be any suitable hardware and software for a display device connected to thevehicle computing device 200. For example, thedisplay 220 may be a touchscreen display in the center console of a vehicle. Thedisplay 220 may be used to display the translated interface to the user, who may be the driver of the vehicle, and to receive input through a touchscreen interface. Thecontrol interface 230 may be, for example, the touchscreen interface of thedisplay 220, and may also include hard and soft keys and other control devices inside the vehicle, such as, for example, play, pause, next track, and previous track buttons located on a steering wheel of the vehicle. In some implementations, thedisplay 220 may be the display on themobile computing device 100. For example, themobile computing device 100 may be a tablet with a large screen that may be mounted in a suitable location in the vehicle to be accessible to the driver. Thedisplay 220 may also be a display belonging to another computing device. For example, themobile computing device 100 may be a smartphone, and thedisplay 220 may be the display of a tablet connected to thevehicle computing device 200. - The
local wireless interface 260 may be any suitable combination of hardware and software on thevehicle computing device 200 for connecting wirelessly to a local area network or other local device. For example, thelocal wireless interface 260 may use a WiFi radio to connect to a router that has created a local area network, or to connect directly to another device, or may use a Bluetooth radio to connect directly to another device. Thelocal wireless interface 260 may be used by thevehicle computing device 200 to connect to another computing device, for example, themobile computing device 100.

wired interface 270 may be any suitable combination of hardware and software on thevehicle computing device 200 for establishing a wired connection to a local area network or other local device. For example, thewired interface 270 may use a USB connection to connect directly to another device. Thewired interface 270 may be used by thevehicle computing device 200 to connect to another computing device, for example, themobile computing device 100. -
FIG. 3 shows an example arrangement for an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. A user may bring themobile computing device 100 into a vehicle. For example, a driver may carry their smartphone with them into their car. Themobile computing device 100 may establish a connection to thevehicle computing device 200 using, for example, thelocal wireless interface 160 of themobile computing device 100 andlocal wireless interface 260 of thevehicle computing device 200. For example, the driver's smartphone may connect via Bluetooth to the head unit of a vehicle. Thevehicle computing device 200 may be used to select a media application, such as themedia application 110, to run on themobile computing device 100. Thedisplay 220 may display allavailable media applications mobile computing device 100, and the user may use thecontrol interface 230 to select and run themedia application 110. - The
vehicle interface translator 210 may use the feature anddata access 112 to access the features of themedia application 110. For example, themedia application 110 may send, or expose to thevehicle interface translator 210, a list of features for themedia application 110. The features may include, for example, the various controls that would be used on the native user interface of themedia application 110, such as previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons. The list of features may include features that are unique to themedia application 110, and may specify slots in thetemplate user interface 242 that should be used to display the controls for these features, in place controls that would normally appear in those slots but correspond to features not listed in the list of feature by themedia application 110. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may rank the features of themedia application 110, for example, based on how the safe the features are for use by a user who is driving the vehicle. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive thetemplate user interface 242 and one of themedia application themes 244 for themedia application 110 from thestorage 240, and combine thetemplate user interface 242 and media application theme for themedia application 110 with the ranked features to generate a translated interface. The translated interface may include the features of themedia application 110 that were ranked highly, for example, deemed safe enough to be used while driving. The translated interface may include controls for the features of themedia application 110 in positions defined by thetemplate user interface 242 and by the media application theme from themedia application themes 244, and not by the native user interface of themedia application 110. For example, the translated interface may include the controls in positions and sizes that make them safer for the driver to use when the translated interface is displayed on thedisplay 220. The translated interface may use a color scheme defined by the media application theme for themedia application 110, and may include a logo or other identifiable marking allowing the translated interface to be more easily identified as being for themedia application 110. - The translated interface may also include unique controls for unique features of the
media application 110 in place of common controls that correspond to features not used by themedia application 110, as specified in the list of features for themedia application 110. For example, the translated interface may include a bookmark control in place of a previous track control, as themedia application 110 may not use the previous track control and may specify that a bookmark control should use the slot in thetemplate user interface 242 normally used for a previous track control. The unique controls may be placed by thevehicle interface translator 210 based on slots specified in the list of features for themedia application 110, or based on priorities assigned to the unique controls and the priorities of the available slots. - The translated interface may be displayed on the
display 220 of thevehicle computing device 200. The user, for example, the driver of the vehicle, may use the translated interface and thecontrol interface 230 to issue control commands to themedia application 110 on themobile computing device 100. For example, the driver may use a touchscreen of thedisplay 220 to press a play button on the translated interface. The pressing of the play button on the translated interface may be sent to thevehicle interface translator 210, which may translate the control command in order to relay it to themedia application 110, for example, using the features anddata access 112. For example, thevehicle translator interface 210 may translate the control command into an API call for themedia application 110. Themedia application 110 may receive the control command, and may respond as if the control command had been received through native user interface of themedia application 110. This may allow the controls of the translated interface shown on thedisplay 220 to control themedia application 110 as themedia application 110 were being controlled by its native user interface on the display of themobile computing device 100. For example, a music player running on a smartphone may be controlled from the display of a vehicle's head unit without requiring that the user issue any commands through the touchscreen of the smartphone. This may allow for safer operation of themedia application 110 by the driver of the vehicle, while not requiring that thevehicle computing device 200 implement any of the media access and playback functionality of themedia application 110. - The
vehicle translator interface 210 may receive media database data from themedia application 110, for display on thedisplay 220. For example, thevehicle translator interface 210 may receive, through feature anddata access 112, metadata for a currently playing media item from themedia items 142, taken from themedia database 144. Thevehicle translator interface 210 may also receive media library and playlist data taken from themedia database 144, to be displayed on thedisplay 220 using the translated interface. This may allow the translated interface to include any data about media items and media selection functionality that may be included in themedia application 110, for example, allowing the user to browse through themedia items 142 that are accessible to themedia application 110 andselect media items 142 for playback. For example, a music player on a smartphone may have access to locally stored music tracks, and may have built a library from those music tracks. The translated interface may be used to browse the library built by smartphone, rather than having thevehicle computing device 200 build its own library from the music tracks stored on the smartphone. The translated interface may, though thevehicle translator 210, may allow for use of themedia database 144 of themedia application 110 as if the native user interface of themedia application 110 were being used. The translated interface may use a different format, layout, or controls for accessing themedia database 144 through themedia application 110, as may be necessary to increase the safety of the use of the translated interface. - The
media application 110, controlled by inputs from thecontrol interface 230 to the translated interface on thedisplay 220, may play back media items, for example, from themedia items 142. Themedia items 142 that are played back may be output to thevehicle computing device 100, which may then output themedia items 142 appropriately, for example, through the vehicle stereo. Themedia application 110 may handle any decoding and processing of themedia items 142 necessary for playback, for example, converting encoded digital music into analog audio output. -
FIG. 4 shows an example arrangement for an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may be used with any media application on themobile computing device 100, including, for example, themedia application 130. Themedia application 130 may be, for example, a subscription music player. For example, a user may bring their smartphone into their car, connect the smartphone to the vehicle head unit via Bluetooth, and use thedisplay 220 andcontrol interface 230 to run a subscription music player on the smartphone. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive the features of themedia application 130, rank the features, and generate a translated interface for themedia application 130 using thetemplate user interface 242 and a media application theme for themedia application 130 from themedia application themes 244. The translated interface for themedia application 130 may include controls for unique features of themedia application 130 displayed in slots normally used for controls that are not used by themedia application 130, as specified by the list of features for themedia application 130 received by thevehicle interface translator 210. - The translated interface may be displayed on the
display 220, and may include controls for the features of themedia application 130 and a color scheme, logo, control icons and unique controls from the media application theme for themedia application 130 that may make the translated interface for themedia application 130 more easily distinguishable from the translated interface for themedia application 110. The user, for example, the driver, may use thecontrol interface 230 to issue control commands to themedia application 130, which may function as if the control commands were received through native user interface of themedia application 130. Themedia application 130 may access media items and media database data through a subscription service, for example, a subscription music service, using the wide arewireless interface 150. The media database data received by themedia application 130 from the subscription service through the wide arewireless interface 150 may be passed to thevehicle interface translator 210 and displayed using the translated interface. This may allow the user to control themedia application 130 using thecontrol interface 230 anddisplay 220, accessing the data and media items available through the subscription service, and playing back the media items through, for example, the vehicle stereo, as if the user were using the native user interface of themedia application 130. Thevehicle computing device 200 may not need to be able to access the subscription service itself, as access may be handled throughmedia application 130 on themobile computing device 100. - The
media application 130 may have features in common with themedia application 110. The translated interface may include controls for these common features in the same location, having the same size and shape, as defined by thetemplate user interface 242, and different icons, for example, as defined by themedia applications themes 244 for themedia application 110 and themedia application 130. This may allow for easier and safer control of both themedia application 110 and themedia application 130, as the driver of the vehicle may not have to adjust to different control locations on thedisplay 220 when switching between themedia application 110 and themedia application 130. This may result in the driver needing to spend less time looking at thedisplay 220 in order to operate a touchscreen interface to control either of themedia application 110 andmedia application 130. -
FIGS. 5 a, 5 b, and 5 c shows example displays for media applications for use with an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.

Theinformation area 502 may be used to display information, such as, for example, library or playlist information from themedia database 144, or metadata for a currently playing media item, such as a music track, from themedia items 142. - A native
user interface display 520 may be displayed on a display of themobile computing device 100 when, for example, themedia application 120, which may be a music player for locally stored media items such as themedia items 142 and remotely stored media items, for example, media items in cloud storage, is run. The nativeuser interface display 520 may includeinformation area 522 and buttons that control the various features of themedia application 110 such asprevious track button 524,pause button 526,play button 528,next track button 530,scrub bar 532,positive rating button 534, andnegative rating button 536. Theinformation area 522 may be used to display information, such as, for example, library or playlist information from themedia database 146, or metadata for a currently playing media item, such as a music track, from themedia items 142 or from the remote storage. The buttons for the nativeuser interface display 520 may be arranged differently than those of the nativeuser interface display 500 for themedia application 110. - A native user interface display 540 may be displayed on a display of the
mobile computing device 100 when, for example, themedia application 130, which may be a subscription music player for media items accessed through a subscription music service, is run. The native user interface display 540 may includeinformation area 542 and buttons that control the various features of themedia application 130 such aspause button 546,next track button 550, scrub bar 552,positive ranking button 554,negative ranking button 556, a socialmedia service button 558, and abookmark button 560. Thepause button 546 may dynamically switch between pause and play functions depending on whether the current media item is playing or paused. The information area 552 may be used to display information, such as, for example, library or playlist information from the subscription music service, or metadata for a currently playing media item, such as a music track, received from the subscription music service. The native user interface display 540 may have buttons in different locations, and may have fewer or different buttons than, the native user interface displays 500 and 520. -
FIG. 6 shows an example display for an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Thetemplate user interface 242 and a media application theme from themedia application themes 244 may be used to generate a translatedinterface display 600. The translatedinterface display 600 may includeinformation area 602 and buttons that control the various features of a media application running on themobile computing device 100 that is connected to thevehicle computing device 200, such asprevious track button 604,pause button 606,play button 608,next track button 610, andscrub bar 612. Theprevious track button 604,pause button 606,play button 608, andnext track button 610 may be controls for features that are common among media applications, and may be slots in thetemplate user interface 242. For example, themobile computing device 100 may be connected to thevehicle computing device 200, and themedia application 110 may be run on themobile computing device 100. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive the features of themedia application 110 using the feature anddata access 112, rank the features, and use thetemplate user interface 242 to create the translated interface to be displayed on thedisplay 220. The translated interface may use the translatedinterface display 600. Theinformation area 602 may display the same data that would have been displayed in theinformation area 502. Selecting theprevious track button 604, for example, touching the button ontouchscreen control interface 230 for thedisplay 220, may cause themedia application 110 to perform the same action, for example, skipping to the previous track, as theprevious track button 504. Thepause button 606, theplay button 608, thenext track button 610, and thescrub bar 612 may all be used to control themedia application 110 in place of thepause button 506, theplay button 508, thenext track button 510, and thescrub bar 512. The translatedinterface display 600 may include a color scheme, for example, background colors and control colors, control icons, and alogo 618 defined by the media application theme for themedia application 110. The media application theme may allow the translatedinterface display 600 to be more easily identifiable as being a translated interface for themedia application 110. - The user may switch to the
media application 120. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive the features for themedia application 120, and generate the translated interface based on a ranking of the features and media application theme for themedia application 120. The translated interface for themedia application 120 may also use the translatedinterface display 600. Theinformation area 602 may display the same data that would have been displayed in theinformation area 522. Selecting theprevious track button 604, for example, touching the button ontouchscreen control interface 230 for thedisplay 220, may cause themedia application 120 to perform the same action, for example, skipping to the previous track, as theprevious track button 524. Thepause button 606, theplay button 608, thenext track button 610, and thescrub bar 612 may all be used to control themedia application 110 in place of thepause button 526, theplay button 528, thenext track button 530, and thescrub bar 532. - The translated
interface display 600 may additionally include, when generated from the features of themedia application 120, unique features, such as a positive ranking button and negative ranking button, which may control the features normally controlled bypositive ranking button 534 andnegative ranking button 536, and may be placed in slots that would be otherwise be used for controls not used by themedia application 120. The common features between themedia application 110 and themedia application 120 may have controls in the same place on the translatedinterface display 600, even when the controls are in different locations between the nativeuser interface display 500 and the nativeuser interface display 520. The translatedinterface display 600 for themedia application 120 may include a color scheme, for example, background colors and control colors, control icons, and alogo 618 defined by the media application theme for themedia application 120. The color scheme, control icons, and logo may be different than those used on the translatedinterface display 600 generated for themedia application 110. The media application theme may allow the translatedinterface display 600 to be more easily identifiable as being a translated interface for themedia application 120. -
FIG. 7 shows an example display for an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. The user may also switch to themedia application 130. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive the features for themedia application 130, and generate the translated interface based on a ranking of the features and the media application theme for themedia application 130. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may also place unique controls for themedia application 130, such as thebookmark button 560, in slots for controls not used by themedia application 130, as specified by the list of features received from themedia application 130, or based on priorities for the features in the list of features for themedia application 130 and priorities for the available slots. The translated interface for themedia application 130 may use the translatedinterface display 700. Theinformation area 602 may display the same data that would have been displayed in theinformation area 542. Selecting thenext track button 610, for example, touching the button ontouchscreen control interface 230 for thedisplay 220, may cause themedia application 130 to perform the same action, for example, skipping to the next track, as thenext track button 550. Thepause button 606, theplay button 608, thenext track button 610, and thescrub bar 612 may all be used to control themedia application 130 in place of thepause button 526, which may have the pause and play features split between thepause button 606 and theplay button 608, thenext track button 550, and the scrub bar 552. The translatedinterface display 600 may not include a control for the feature controlled by the socialmedia service button 558, as that feature may be deemed to unsafe to be used while driving, and may also not include a control for a previous track feature, and themedia application 130 may not include that feature. For example, themedia application 130 may be an Internet radio service which not allow for skipping to a previous music track. The translatedinterface display 700 may additionally include, when generated from the features of themedia application 130, abookmark button 720, which may be displayed in the slot normally reserved for theprevious track button 610. This replacement may be specified in the list of features thevehicle interface translator 210 receives from themedia application 130. The translatedinterface display 700 for themedia application 130 may include a color scheme, for example, background colors and control colors, control icons, and alogo 618 defined by the media application theme for themedia application 120. The color scheme, control icons, and logo may be different than those used on the translatedinterface display 600 generated for themedia application 110 and themedia application 120. The media application theme may allow the translatedinterface display 700 to be more easily identifiable as being a translated interface for themedia application 130. - The common features between any of the
media application 110, themedia application 120, and themedia application 130 may have controls in the same place on the translatedinterface display 600 and translatedinterface 700, even when the controls are in different locations between the nativeuser interface display 500, the nativeuser interface display 520, and the native user interface display 540. This may allow for easier usage of any of themedia applications control interface 230 and thedisplay 220, and the driver does not have to relearn or adjust to changing position controls when switching between media applications running on themobile computing device 100. -
FIG. 8 shows an example of a process for an interface for multiple media application according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. At 800, a feature list may be received. For example, thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive a list of the features for themedia application 110 using the feature anddata access 112. A user may have taken a smartphone into a car, connected the smartphone to the car's head unit, and selected a music player to run on the smartphone. The list of features may indicate which controls that have slots on thetemplate user interface 242 are used by themedia application 110. The list of features may also specify that certain slots for controls on thetemplate user interface 242 should be used for controls for unique features of themedia application 110. For example, the list of features may specify that themedia application 110 does not have a previous track feature, and the slot on thetemplate user interface 242 that would be used for a previous track control should instead be used for a bookmark control that corresponds to a bookmark feature of themedia application 110. The list of feature may also include priorities for unique features of themedia application 110. - At 802, the features may be ranked. For example, the
vehicle interface translator 210 may rank the features received from themedia application 110 according to, for example, how safe the features are to use while driving. Features such as play and pause may be ranked high, as they may be safe to use, while features allowing posting to social media services may be ranked low, as they may be distracting to the driver and unsafe to use. - At 804, a template user interface and media application theme may be received. For example, the
vehicle interface translator 210 may receive thetemplate user interface 242 and a media application theme, from themedia application themes 244, from thestorage 240. Thetemplate user interface 242 may include locations, positions, and sizes, for controls for various features of media applications, and may ensure that controls for common features between media applications may appear in the same location and have the same size and shape on thedisplay 220, regardless of which of themedia applications mobile computing device 100. - At 806, a translated interface may be generated using the template user interface, the media application theme, and the feature ranks. For example, the
vehicle interface translator 210 may generate a translated interface, with the translatedinterface display 600, connecting the high ranked features for themedia application 110 to the appropriate controls defined by thetemplate user interface 242. Controls for features not used by themedia application 110 may be omitted from the translated interface, and not appear on the translatedinterface display 600, as may controls for features that are ranked low because they were deemed unsafe, or controls for features for which there is no corresponding control defined in thetemplate user interface 242, for example, due to the feature being uncommon or unsafe. Controls for unique features of themedia application 110 may be displayed on the translated interface in slots normally used for features that were omitted from the list of features for themedia application 110. The list of features may specify which slots should be used for each unique feature, or may assign priorities to the unique features, and the controls for the unique features may be placed based on the priorities for the unique features and priorities for slots on the translated interface for features not used by themedia application 110. The translated interface may use a color scheme, control icons, logos, and unique controls defined by the media application theme. - At 808, the translated interface may be displayed. For example, the translated interface may be displayed on the
display 220 of thevehicle computing device 200, allowing the driver of the vehicle to control themedia application 110 without having to look at or use themobile computing device 100. Thedisplay 220 may, for example, display the translatedinterface display 600. -
