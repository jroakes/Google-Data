Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the ranking of documents and, more particularly, to techniques for refining the ranking of an initial set of documents.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results to the user based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are “hits” and are returned to the user.
- a search engine may attempt to sort the list of hits so that the most relevant and/or highest quality pages are at the top of the list of hits returned to the user. For example, the search engine may assign a rank or score to each hit, where the score is designed to correspond to the relevance or importance of the web page. Determining appropriate scores can be a difficult task. For one thing, the importance of a web page to the user is inherently subjective and depends on the user's interests, knowledge, and attitudes. There is, however, much that can be determined objectively about the relative importance of a web page. Conventional methods of determining relevance are based on the contents of the web page.
- More advanced techniques determine the importance of a web page based on more than the content of the web page. For example, one known method, described in the article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a web page based on the link structure of the web page. In other words, the Brin and Page algorithm attempts to quantify the importance of a web page based on more than just the content of the web page.
- a returned set of news articles about a particular news topic may be ranked.
- Postings gathered from message groups, such as Usenet groups, may also be ranked when returned to the user.
- the present invention is directed to a document ranking technique in which, for a given document, a set of related documents is determined. A related score is calculated based on the related document. The score may then be used to modify an original ranking of the given document.
- One aspect of the invention is directed to a method for scoring documents.
- the method comprises obtaining an initial set of documents and generating a set of related documents for at least one document in the initial set of documents using a similarity criterion.
- the method further includes generating a related set score by applying a related set criterion to the set of related documents corresponding to the at least one document and scoring the at least one document using the related set score.
- Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method for refining a ranking associated with a document.
- the method includes obtaining a set of documents related to the document, calculating a relevance ranking for the set of documents using a criterion, and modifying the ranking associated with the document based on the relevance ranking for the set of documents.

- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an implementation of search engine 125 in additional detail.
- search engine 125 is described as a traditional search engine that returns a ranked or ordered set of documents related to a user query.
- search engine 125 may be thought of as any of a number of services or applications that rank or order a set of input documents. For example, a set of documents that are classified by topic or a set of postings gathered from message groups, such as Usenet groups, may also be ranked when returned to the user.
- Search engine 125 may also be a specialized search engine, such as a news search engine.
- Search engine 125 may include a document locator 330 and a ranking component 340 .
- document locator 330 finds a set of documents whose contents match a user search query.
- Ranking component 330 further ranks the located set of documents based on relevance.
- Document locator 330 may initially locate documents from a document corpus by comparing the terms in the user's search query to the documents in the corpus. In general, processes for indexing documents and searching the indexed corpus of documents to return a set of documents containing the searched terms are well known in the art. Accordingly, this functionality of relevant document component 330 will not be described further herein.
- Ranking component 340 assists search engine 125 in returning relevant documents to the user by ranking the set of documents identified by document locator 330 .
- This ranking may take the form of assigning a numerical value corresponding to the calculated relevance of each document identified by document locator 330 .
- Ranking component 340 includes main ranking component 345 and re-ranking component 347 .
- Main ranking component 345 assigns an initial rank (a score) to each document received from document locator 330 .
- the initial rank value corresponds to a calculated relevance of the document.
- suitable ranking algorithms known in the art. One of which is described in the article by Brin and Page, as mentioned in the Background of the Invention section of this disclosure.
- main ranking component 345 and document locator 330 may be combined so that document locator 330 produces a set of relevant documents each having rank values.
- the rank values may be generated based on the relative position of the user's search terms in the returned documents. For example, documents may have their rank value based on the proximity of the search terms in the document (documents with the search terms close together are given higher rank values) or on the number of occurrences of the search term (e.g., a document that repeatedly uses a search term is given a higher rank value).
- the initial ranking scores assigned by main ranking component 345 may be refined by re-ranking component 347 to improve the relevance scores.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for implementing re-ranking component 347 .
- the functions performed by main ranking component 345 and re-ranking component 347 may be combined as a single ranking component 340 .
- document locator 330 may return an initial set of documents, such as a set of documents generated in response to a user search query (act 401 ).
- Each of the documents in the initial set of documents may be initially ranked based on some scoring criterion that may generate a rank score or value for each document in the initial set of documents.
- the criterion may be based on, for example, a user search query, a topic (e.g., sports), a list of keywords, a geographical area, or similarity to another document or set of documents.
- re-ranking component 347 may then generate one or more sets of related documents (act 402 ).
- a set of related documents may be generated for each document, d, in the initial set of documents.
- the related sets of documents will be referred to herein as a related set D, which includes documents d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d n , where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to one.
- the related set D may be drawn from all documents known to search engine 125 , or may be drawn from any desired subset of documents.
- re-ranking component 347 may compute a related set score for D (act 403 ).
- the related set score may be based on a matching procedure between the document d and the related set D, or a subset of the related set D.
- the initial ranking score for document d may then be modified based on the related set score (act 404 ).
- a number of techniques may be used to compute the set of related documents D for a particular document d in the initial set.
- the documents in D are determined as documents that re-ranking component 347 determines to be somehow similar to document d.
- similarity between document d and another document may be based on authorship or publication information.
- This type of similarity criteria can be particularly useful in the context of news articles. For example, if news articles are being ranked, one similarity criterion may be defined from the news source that published the news article d. The related set D may then be defined as a set of documents published by the same source as news article d. Thus, if d is an article from the New York Times then D may be the set of previous articles published by the New York Times.
- Another news article based similarity criteria may be defined as news articles having the same author as the news article d. Under this criteria, other articles written by the same journalist may form related set D. For example, if document d is an article by Thomas Friedman, the related set D may be the set of previous articles by Thomas Friedman.
- Yet another possible news article based similarity criterion may be defined as news articles from the same or similar publication sections.
- the similarity criterion may be the same newspaper section.
- Other articles from the same section e.g., “sports” or “business” could be used to form related set D. If document d is an article in the “business” section then related set D could be defined as the set of other articles in the “business” sections of any newspaper.
- Similarity criteria may be defined that are more specific to message groups, such as Usenet postings.
- a similarity criteria may be based on the author, where the author is defined by the email address of the poster. Thus, other postings by the same email address may form the related set D.
- Search engine 125 may be used to search postings from multiple message groups.
- a similarity criteria may be based on the group in which the posting appears. Other articles in the same message group would be considered related by this criterion. For example, if document d is a posting in the news group “soc.culture.Ethiopia,” the related set D may be defined as all the other postings from the news group “soc.culture.Ethiopia.”
- Another similarity criteria that can be used for message groups may be based on the thread in which the posting occurred. Thus, the related set D may be defined as all the other postings in the same thread as posting d. This similarity criteria will tend to return smaller sets than one based on the news group.
- search engine 125 may implement a general web page search engine.
- the similarity criteria may define the related set D as other web pages from the same web site as document d, as web pages that link to document d, or as web pages to which document d contains a link.
- the same web site can broadly refer to documents on the same host or in the same domain.
- the similarity criteria may be defined in many different ways, depending on the particular situation.
- numerous other classification or clustering techniques can be used to identify a set of related documents to a given document.
- the related documents in related set D can be pre-computed or generated when necessary.
- combinations of the above-discussed similarity criteria or other similarity criteria may be used to define related set D.
- re-ranking component 347 computes the related set score for document d.
- the search query may be classified and the classification may be compared to the pseudo-document. For example, assume the original search query is “New York Yankees.” This query may be classified as a “Sports” query, and the pseudo-document may be compared based on how well it matches the topic of sports.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating exemplary operations consistent with aspects of the invention for computing the related set score.
- Re-ranking component 347 may combine the documents in the related set D to produce a single “pseudo-document” (act 501 ).
- the documents in D may be combined via straightforward concatenation.
- a match between the pseudo-document and the initial scoring criterion may then be performed (act 502 ). If the initial scoring criteria is based on a search query, for example, the search query can be compared to the pseudo-document in the same manner that the search query was compared to the main document corpus from which the initial set of documents were generated.
- a different scoring criterion such as one related to the original scoring criterion, may be used to compute the related set score.
- the result of this comparison may be a ranking score.
- the ranking score may be returned as the related set score (act 503 ) (act 50 ).
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of an exemplary alternate implementation consistent with aspects of the invention for computing the related set score. This implementation is similar to that shown in FIG. 5 , except that instead of combining the documents in the related set D to form a pseudo-document, each document n in D is individually matched to the initial scoring criterion in a manner similar to the matching performed in act 502 (act 601 ). When all the documents in D have been evaluated to obtain a ranking value, (acts 602 and 603 ), the ranking values may be combined to obtain the related set score (act 604 ). The ranking values may be combined via a number a possible functions, such as an average value, a weighted average value, a sum, etc.
- another possible technique for determining the related set score can include determining a geographical relevance vector of each document in related set D. For example, based on terms in the documents in D, a vector may be generated over all the documents in D, in which the vector defines a set of geographic scores. The geographic scores may represent a confidence level that the documents in related set D are relevant to a particular geographic region. For example, an exemplary vector for a particular related set D may include three non-zero confidence scores, such as (USA, 0.5), (Europe, 0.4), (Asia, 0.05). This vector may be matched with a geographic ranking criterion, such as the geographic search query “USA,” to produce the related set score. As a possible modification to this technique, the vector can be generated based on the source of each of the documents in D instead of on the documents themselves.
- Another possible technique for determining the related set score can include determining a topic of each document in related set D.
- the topics may be generated using automated classification techniques or drawn from either manually or automated pre-generated classification information (e.g., a hierarchical web directory tree).
- the topics for the documents in related set D may be combined to produce a vector of topic scores that defines confidence levels in the topics.
- the vector of topic scores can then be matched with the ranking criterion, in a manner similar to that described above, to produce the related set score.
- a set of terms that are “strong” in each document in the related set D may be determined and combined to produce a vector of final strong terms for the documents in D.
- the determination of whether a term is “strong” can be based on, for example, a pre-determined list of terms or terms that are determined to have an inverse document frequency (idf) above a threshold level.
- the idf of each term in a document may be defined based on a ratio of the number of occurrences of the term in the document to the relative frequency of the term in the language or over the entire document corpus. Thus, terms that are generally less common in the corpus but that occur frequently in the document will have a high idf and may be classified as being strong.
- the final vector of strong terms can then be matched with the given ranking criterion (e.g., a search query) to produce the related set score.
- the related set score can be defined in many different ways, depending on the particular situation.
- the related set score and the initial ranking score for each document d may be combined to produce a modified (final) ranking score for document d.
- the initial set of documents returned in act 401 may then be re-ranked by re-ranking component 347 based on the modified ranking scores.
- the modified ranking score may be calculated as a weighted sum as follows: ⁇ (Initial_Score)+ ⁇ (Related_Set_Score), (1) where ⁇ and ⁇ are predetermined constants.
- the values to use for ⁇ and ⁇ may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art through empirical trial-and-error techniques. Exemplary values for ⁇ and ⁇ may be 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.
- ⁇ could be set to zero and ⁇ could be set to one.
- the modified ranking score is equal to the related set score.
- the initial ranking scores may not even need to be calculated.
- the modified ranking score may be calculated by using the related set score to boost the initial score as follows: Initial_Score ⁇ (1+ ⁇ Related_Set_Score). (2) As in equation (1), ⁇ may be a suitable predetermined constant.
- related set D combinations of the discussed similarity criteria may be used to define related set D.
- the source, the journalist, and the section can all be used to define a related set D.
- more than one related set score can be computed for each document.
- the multiple related set scores can then be combined by, for example, a summing or averaging function, and then used in formula (1) or (2).
- the related set score can be computed independently of the ranking criteria.
- the related document set D can be scored based on the length of the included documents, on the timeliness of the documents, on the quality of the documents (determined by, for example, human evaluation or automated techniques based on grammar, spelling, or writing style), or based on popularity or usage characteristics of the documents.
- the ranking component described above improves the ranking of documents initially ranked through a number of possible existing scoring criterion.
- the ranking component can be applied, for example, to the ranking of news articles, Usenet postings, or general web searches.
Abstract
Description
α(Initial_Score)+β(Related_Set_Score), (1)
where α and β are predetermined constants. The values to use for α and β may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art through empirical trial-and-error techniques. Exemplary values for α and β may be 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. As a special case of formula (I), α could be set to zero and β could be set to one. In this case, the modified ranking score is equal to the related set score. Thus, in this case, the initial ranking scores may not even need to be calculated.
Initial_Score×(1+β×Related_Set_Score). (2)
As in equation (1), β may be a suitable predetermined constant.
