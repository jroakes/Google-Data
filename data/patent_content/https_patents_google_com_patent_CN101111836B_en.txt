Historical events is similar to indexable real-time event; Just incident be betide search engine 122 install before or receive because of other reasons is at large, for example because of search engine 122 off-duties when client apparatus 102a can move to cycle time or because of when incident takes place, there not being the capture component that is used for a particular type historical events.The instance of historical events comprise word processing document that the user preserves, media file, display document, calendar, and electronic form document, user's inbox in Email, the webpage in user's high-speed cache, instant courier's session in past, reach the webpage that adds bookmark by the user.Catching processor 124 can catch any associated data memory storage of the incidents that processor 124 before do not capture and catch historical events through periodically roaming storer 108 and this.Catch processor 124 and also can catch historical events with retrieval article and other information of being associated through some client applications of request (for example web browser or email application).For example, catching processor 124 can ask web browser application to obtain all webpages or all email messages that are associated with the user of request email application acquisition that the user checked.These articles possibly currently not be present in the storer 108 or on the memory storage of client apparatus 102a.For example, email application maybe must be from a server unit retrieving electronic mail.In one embodiment, search engine 122 adds index for historical events.
In one embodiment, search engine 122 can be caught historical events selectively and added index for it.For example, can the article data that be associated with the article of incident partly be used for determining whether to catch said incident and adding index for it.Article data can comprise file type, and the access data of article of position, the article of (for example) article.In one embodiment, use article data to confirm that one catches score also with a said score and the threshold of catching.If the score of catching of a particular event is higher than said threshold value, then catches said incident and add index for it.If the score of catching of an article is lower than said threshold value, does not then catch said incident and do not add index yet for it.Likewise, search engine 122 can be caught real-time event selectively and added index for it.
In an embodiment shown in Figure 1, be sent to formation 126 will catch the incident that processor 124 caught by the described form of an event summary.Catch processor 124 and also can performance data be sent to formation 126.The instance of performance data comprises client applications in average treatment device load in the current processor load, a predetermined period of time, free time, disk access, the use, and available memory size.Performance data also can be provided by particular characteristic monitor component (for example wherein some can be the part of search engine 122).Performance data in the formation 126 can be retrieved by search engine 122 and the capture component of catching processor 124.For example, but capture component retrieval performance data are sent to the level of detail (send less or less incident) of the incident quantity or the incident of being sent of formation 126 or the frequency that incident is sent (when system busy or reduce when having too many incident etc. pending the transmission frequency of incident) with change when system is busy.Search engine 122 workabilities can data confirm when it sends implicit queries for variety of event adds index and when reaches with which kind of frequency.
In one embodiment, till formation 126 remains to incident search engine 122 and is ready to handle one or more incidents.Perhaps, how soon formation 126 usability data help confirm said incident to be provided to search engine 122.Formation 126 can comprise that one or more independent formations one comprise a user state queue and an index queue.For example, said index queue can be ranked to indexable incident.Perhaps, formation 126 can have extra formation or comprise single queue.Can use the memory mapping file that formation 126 is built into a rotation priority formation.Said formation can be one and wherein comes servo multipriority queue with incident of higher-priority prior to having than the incident of low priority, and other assembly can be specified its interested event type.By and large, can give real-time event the right of priority high, and can give the more not indexable real-time event of indexable incident high right of priority than historical events.Formation 126 also can have other structure form.In another embodiment, client apparatus 102a does not have a formation 126.In this embodiment, incident directly is sent to search engine 122 from catching processor.In other embodiments, can use for example with inferior suitable message exchange mechanism transmission incident between capture component and search engine: Extensible Markup Language-remote procedure call protocol (XML/RPC), HTTP(Hypertext Transport Protocol), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared storage, web application interface, the Local or Remote invocation of procedure or any other suitable message exchange mechanism.
Search engine 122 can comprise the device 130 of indexing, an inquiry system 132, an and formatter 134.Inquiry system 132 can be retrieved real-time event and performance data from formation 126.Inquiry system 132 workabilities ability data and real-time event upgrade current user state and produce an implicit queries.Implicit queries can be one according to the current user state inquiry of generation automatically.Inquiry system 132 also can receive and handle explicit queries from user 112a.Performance data also can be retrieved the quantity with the activity that is used for confirming being implemented by search engine 122 by search engine 122 from formation 126.
