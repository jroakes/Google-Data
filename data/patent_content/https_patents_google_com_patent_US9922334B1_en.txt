Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for providing an advertisement based on a minimum number of exposures and more particularly, to select a bid for each exposure and provide display data indicative of the advertisement based on the bid.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving selection criteria to specify a device identifier that meets the selection criteria.
- the method may yet further include receiving a minimum number of exposures to the advertisement and an interval of time for the minimum number of exposures to occur, and a maximum aggregate bid value to be paid for each device identifier that is exposed to the advertisement for the minimum number of exposures.
- the method may also include determining a probability that the device identifier reaches the number of exposures within the interval of time and within the maximum aggregate bid value.
- the method may also include selecting a bid for each exposure for the device identifier based on the determined probability and the maximum aggregate bid value.
- the method may include providing display data indicative of the advertisement, based on the selection of the bid.
- the method may also include updating the device identifier representative of the number of exposures to the advertisement.
- a system may include a tangible computer-readable storage device including instructions; and a processor coupled to the tangible computer-readable device and configured to execute the instructions to perform operations.
- the operations may include receiving selection criteria to specify the device identifier that meets the selection criteria.
- the operations may also include receiving a minimum number of exposures to the advertisement and an interval of time for the minimum number of exposures to occur, and a maximum aggregate bid value for each device identifier that is exposed to the advertisement for the minimum number of exposures.
- the operations may include determining a probability that the device identifier reaches the number of exposures within the interval of time and within the maximum aggregate bid value.
- the operations may also include selecting a bid for each exposure for the device identifier based on the determined probability and the maximum aggregate bid value.
- the operations may include providing display data indicative of the advertisement, based on the selection of the bid.
- the operations may yet further include updating the device identifier representative of the number of exposures to the advertisement.
- FIG. 1 is an example of a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example system for serving advertisements in accordance with a described implementation
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example interface for an advertiser in accordance with a described implementation
- FIG. 4 is an example of a system for updating the device identifier in accordance with a described implementation.
- FIG. 5 is an example of a flow diagram for serving advertisements in accordance with a described implementation.
- Advertisers can determine goals for exposure to certain advertisements or groups of advertisements within their advertising campaigns. Advertisers may also determine a strategy for what times to serve the advertisements to meet their goals for exposure. The strategy may be based on previous exposures of the advertisements to the users.
- the exposures may be determined by a number of devices, e.g., a set-top box, a television, a web page, etc. used to serve the advertisements.
- the devices may include a database to store the number of exposures and the time of exposure.
- advertisers can determine or update strategies for their proposed, i.e., yet to be served, advertisements. For example, advertisers concerned with delivering a message believe that users may need to be exposed to the message a minimum number of times, in a given period of time, before the user is aware of the message. Although a click would count as a recognition of the message, clicks are not a reliable source to estimate the minimum number of exposures, e.g., clicks are infrequent and do not acknowledge every time a user is exposed to the message and does not click on the message.
- the advertiser can determine a minimum number of exposures for an interval of time.
- the advertiser may also determine a maximum aggregate bid value for each user.
- An advertisement server determines the probability that a user will meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. Given the probability, the advertisement server adjusts bidding within the advertiser's maximum aggregate bid value for each user that meets the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time.

- FIG. 5 is an example of a flow diagram of a method 500 for providing an advertisement with a minimum number of exposures.
- Example method 500 may be implemented by various combinations of systems.
- Example method 500 may be performed online or offline.
- Example method may begin at block 502 , selection criteria to specify the device identifier that meets the selection criteria is received.
- the selection criteria may define one or more characteristics of the users to which the advertisement is directed. If a device identifier has one or more of the defined characteristics, then the device identifier meets the selection criteria. If the device identifier does not include one or more (or at least a threshold number) of the characteristics, then the advertisement may not be provided to the device identifier.
- the selection criteria may include budgetary criteria, e.g., one or more bids.
- a minimum number of exposures to the advertisement and an interval of time for the minimum number of exposures to occur is received.
- the minimum number of exposures is stored in a memory.
- a maximum aggregate bid value to be paid for each device identifier that is exposed to the advertisement for a minimum number of exposures may also be received.
- the minimum number of exposures and the interval of time includes a frequency, i.e., how many times the advertisement is exposed within a set period of time.
- the interval of time may include a length of time the advertisement is exposed, e.g., 1 week. In other implementations, the interval of time may include a time of day when the advertisement is exposed.
- a probability that the device identifier reaches the number of exposures within the interval of time and the maximum aggregate bid value is determined. Probability may be determined using a number of methods including, but not limited to, distributed gradient descent and logistic regression.
- the application of the desired interval of time and the desired selection criteria are applied to produce a prediction.
- statistical methods may not be needed. Either the prediction will indicate that the user will meet the minimum number of exposures in the interval of time or not.
- the system may determine by an estimation or a guess whether the user will meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time.
- the system may receive the historical data that it does have for the user to compare the data to a population of similar users that have sufficient historical data, e.g., any correlated or detectable data may be used.
- the population of similar users may produce a probability of meeting the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time for the desired selection criteria. This probability is then applied to the newly observed user, e.g., if seventy percent of the similar population would meet the minimum number of exposures, then the 0.7 probability is applied to the newly observed user.
- a bid for each exposure for the device identifier based on the determined probability and the maximum aggregate bid value is selected.
- the probability is determined at block 510 , which may produce a weight used to adjust a bid. The higher the probability, then the higher the bid, with a maximum combination of minimum exposures not exceeding the maximum aggregate bid value.
- the probability may be conditional and adjusted based on the number of exposures. For example, a user that is one exposure away from meeting the minimum number of exposures may receive a higher bid than a user that is three exposures away, provided all other criteria is equal.
- the system may also determine a different probability for each user.
- a weight may also be determined to select a bid.
- a bid is selected for each exposure for the device identifier based on the determined probability and the maximum aggregate bid value.
- the weight is the mechanism that can adjust a bid to favor impressions that are more likely to meet the goal minimum number of exposures in the interval of time.
- the probability may be used as the weight. In this implementation, however, campaign constraints may limit how low or high the weight can be set.
- the weight used to adjust a bid may be determined by historical impression data, for each device identifier, while also applying the selection criteria and the interval of time. If there are a sufficient number of impressions to meet the minimum number of exposures, then the bidding weight may be applied. If there is not a sufficient number of impressions, then no bidding weight may be applied. The probability is used to change the bid when the user is close to meeting the minimum number of exposures. In other implementations, the probability may not be used when the user is far from meeting the minimum number of exposures.
- the probability may be determined based on whether similar device identifiers meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time. Similar users may be selected based on regression analysis, where user characteristics, such as, but not limited to, browser, operating system, browser history, interests, etc., may determine whether the user will meet the minimum number of exposures. Then, a user model may be constructed along with the probability. The probability from the model may be used to set the bidding weight to bias exposures to users most likely to meet the minimum number of exposures within the interval of time.
- an advertisement is served on selection of the bid.
- serving may include providing display data, which may be indicative of the advertisement.
- the advertisement server may provide the display data to the client device.
- the advertisement server may be configured to cause the client to display the advertisement.
- the display data may cause the advertisement to be displayed.
- the display data may include the advertisement itself.

- the display data may be provided to an interface, e.g., a graphical user interface, a command line interface, etc.
- the count is updated representing the number of exposures of device identifier to the advertisement, as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the total number of different users exposed to the advertising message during a given period and how many times they are exposed to the advertising message may be predicted for an advertising campaign, e.g., using gross rating points or target rating points, which equate to how many times the message aired times the number of users that were exposed to the advertising message.
- the bid may be adjusted so that the prediction aligns with the minimum number of exposures per user for the total number of users exposed.
- a third party may access the optimization technology of advertisement server 104 using a user interface (e.g., GUI, command-line, etc.) or an application programming interface.
- a user interface e.g., GUI, command-line, etc.
- an application programming interface e.g., an application programming interface
