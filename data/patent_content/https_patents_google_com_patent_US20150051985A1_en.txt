Definitions
- This specification relates to data processing and content distribution.
- the Internet facilitates the exchange of information and transactions between users across the globe. This exchange of information enables content sponsors to provide sponsored content to a variety of users.
- a content sponsor can control the distribution of their content items (e.g., promotions, advertisements, audio files, video files, or other content items) based on a set of distribution parameters that specify under what conditions a content item is eligible to be distributed. When a presentation opportunity meeting the conditions is available, the content item provided by a content sponsor is deemed eligible to be provided for presentation.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a content item request specifying that at least two presentation positions are available for presentation of content items; identifying, for each of two or more different content sponsors, a current bid specifying an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay to provide a content item in response to the content item request; determining, for each of the two or more content sponsors, a sponsor value based, at least in part, on the current bid received from the content sponsor and one or more previous bids that were received from the content sponsor for presentation of content for previous content item requests; and selecting, based at least in part on the sponsor value for each of the two or more content sponsors, at least one content sponsor to provide a content item in response to the content item request and a presentation position of the at least one content sponsor.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Methods can include the actions of assigning two content sponsors to the at least two presentation positions based on the sponsor value for each of the two or more content sponsors, a first of the two content sponsors being assigned to a highest performing presentation position and a second of the content sponsors being assigned to a second highest performing presentation position.
- Determining a sponsor value can include obtaining, for a particular content sponsor, a distribution of the previous bids that were previously received from the particular content sponsor; and determining, for the particular content sponsor, the content sponsor value based on the current bid received from the particular content sponsor and the distribution.
- Methods can include the actions of determining, for the particular content sponsor, a cumulative distribution function based on the distribution; and determining, for the particular content sponsor, a probability density function, based on the cumulative distribution function.
- Determining the sponsor value can include determining the sponsor value based on an output of a function of the current bid, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function. Determining the sponsor value can include determining, for the particular content sponsor, a separate sponsor value for each publisher based on a proper subset of the previous bids received from the particular content sponsor for the previous content item requests that requested a content item for presentation with a resource provided by the publisher.
- Methods can include the operations of determining a cumulative distribution function based on a distribution of the previous bids that were received from the two or more content sponsors; and determining a probability distribution function based on the cumulative distribution function.
- Determining the sponsor value can include determining, for each particular content sponsor, the sponsor value based on an output of a function of the current bid received from the particular content sponsor, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function.
- Methods can include the actions of identifying a set of the previous bids that were received for content item requests that requested a content item for presentation with a resource provided by a particular publisher; determining a cumulative distribution function based on a distribution of the previous bids in the set of the previous bids; and determining a probability distribution function based on the cumulative distribution function.
- Determining the sponsor value can include determining, for each particular content sponsor, the sponsor value based on an output of a function of the current bid received from the particular content sponsor, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function.
- Methods can include the actions of determining, based on the content item request, a first number of content items that are able to be provided in response to the request; and determining a second number of content items that will be provided in response to the content item request, the second number being less than the first number, the determination being based on a first aggregate sponsor value of content sponsors that will provide the second number of content items being higher than a second aggregate sponsor value of content sponsors that will provide the first number of content items.
- a price paid by a content sponsor for each impression (or click) is determined based on a performance weighted average of bid values at which the content sponsor would be allocated various available presentation positions, which encourages a content sponsor to bid a full value of an impression (or click) because the price paid by the content sponsor depends on values other the content sponsor's bid.
- Publishers are encouraged to accurately specify a maximum number of content items that can be presented in a content item slot (or another portion of a resource) by selecting a set of content items that will provide a highest aggregate value, even if the number of content items in the set is fewer than the maximum number specified by the publisher.
- the publisher can accurately specify the maximum number of content items without sacrificing value.
- User satisfaction with a resource may be increased since the number of content items that provide the highest aggregate value may be fewer than the maximum number of content items that can be presented, thereby reducing resource clutter.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which content is distributed to user devices.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow that illustrates an example content item selection process.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for distributing content items.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for determining a price to be charged for distribution of a content item.
- FIG. 5 is block diagram of an example computer system.
- Content items are selected for presentation based on one or more measures of “sponsor value” associated with a given request or a value associated with a specific content item.
- a sponsor value in general can be determined for a content sponsor that provides content items, and the sponsor value for that content sponsor can be associated with each content item provided by that content sponsor.
- a different sponsor value can be determined for each content item request that is received (e.g., based on the bid submitted for use with respect to that content item request).
- sponsor value is referred to as being associated with either the content sponsor or a content item provided by the content sponsor.
- the sponsor value associated with a content item can be based on a function of the current bid associated with the content item (e.g., provided by the content sponsor) relative to a historical bid for the content item, or all historical bids provided by the content sponsor. For example, if the current bid is lower than a statistical measure of historical bids for the content item (or all bids provided by the content sponsor), the content item may have a lower sponsor value than if the current bid were higher than the statistical measure. Computation of the sponsor value is discussed in detail with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 .
- a set of one or more content items are selected based on the sponsor values.
- the number of content items selected in response to a received request can range from a single content item up to the maximum number of content items that can be presented in response to the request (e.g., as specified by the request). If fewer than the maximum number of content items are selected, the content items can be adjusted (e.g., resized) to fill the space available for presentation of content items provided in response to the request.
- the content item selection process can maximize an aggregate sponsor value of the content items provided in a configuration, which is referred to herein as the “efficiency” of the configuration.
- the term configuration can refer to a particular number of content items and/or an arrangement of content items responsive to a received request.
- a price that will be charged for distribution of each content item is determined.
- the price for a particular content item can be determined, for example, based on “trigger prices” at which a presentation position of the particular content item would change if the bid associated with the content item were set to that price. For example, assume that there are two presentation positions available, and a particular content item is selected for presentation in a highest presentation position based on the current bid associated with the particular content item. In this example, a first trigger price will be the price at which the content item moves from the highest slot to the second slot, and a second trigger price will be the price at which the content item is no longer shown.
- a performance weighted average of the trigger prices can be determined and used as the price charged for distribution of the particular content item.
- the first trigger price can be weighted by the difference in performance between the first slot and the second slot
- the second trigger price can be weighted by the performance of the second slot.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which content is distributed to user devices 106 .
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 , and a content distribution system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many different websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content sponsors 108 .
- a website 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). Units of content that are presented in (or with) resources are referred to as content items, and an individual content item can be stored in a single file or set of files independent of the resource.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can submit a resource request 112 that requests a resource 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the requested resource 114 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the requested resource 114 can be, for example, a home page of a website 104 , a web page from a social network, or another resource 105 .
- the data representing the requested resource 114 can include data that cause presentation of resource content 116 at the user device 106 .
- the data representing the requested resource 114 can also include data specifying a content item slot 118 .
- a content item slot is a portion of the resource (e.g., a portion of a web page) or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of another window or in a slot of a web page) in which one or more content items, such as advertisements, can be presented.
- a content items slot 118 can also be referred to as an advertisement slot, but any type of content (e.g., content items other than advertisements) can be presented in the content item slot 118 .
- a single content item slot 118 may be configured to include one or more presentation positions 119 a and 119 b . Each presentation position can represent a portion of the content item slot 118 at which a content item can be presented. In some implementations, the number of presentation positions and/or the size of the presentation positions for a particular content item slot 118 may be determined based on the number, type, and/or value of content items that are available for presentation in the content item slot. For example, as described in detail below, a set of content items that are associated with respective highest values (e.g., among eligible content items) may be selected for presentation, and the number of presentation positions included in the content item slot 118 can be determined based on the number of content items that are included in the selected set of content items. A publisher can specify a maximum number of presentation positions that are to be included in a particular content item slot, and the selection of the set of content items can be constrained based on that maximum number.
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource with which the data are associated.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in a search index 122 .
- Data that are associated with a resource is data that represents content included in the resource and/or metadata for the resource.
- User devices 106 can submit search queries to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the search index 122 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query.
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device in search results page.
- a search result is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- search results pages can include one or more content item slots 118 in which content items, such as advertisements, can be presented.
- a resource 105 When a resource 105 is requested by a user device 106 , execution of code associated with a content item slot 118 in the resource initiates a request for a content item to populate the slot.
- the request can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource 114 . For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the requested resource 114 for which the content item slot 118 is defined, a size of the content item slot, a maximum number of presentation positions (or content items) that can be included in the content item slot 118 , and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the content item slot 118 can be provided to the content distribution system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- keywords associated with a requested resource can also be provided to the content distribution system 110 to facilitate identification of content items that are relevant to the requested resource 114 .
- the requests can also include other information, such as information that the user has provided, geographic information indicating a state or region from which the request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the content item will be displayed (e.g., a type of device at which the content item will be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device).
- the content items that are provided in response to a request are selected based, in part, on distribution parameters associated with the content items.
- Distribution parameters are a set of criteria upon which distribution of content items are conditioned.
- the distribution criteria for a particular content item can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by resource keywords or search queries) in order for the content item to be eligible for presentation.
- the distribution criteria can also specify a bid and/or budget for distributing the particular content item. As described in more detail below, bids can be used to select a set of content items for presentation with a resource and/or to determine in which presentation position the content item(s) will be presented.
- the content distribution system 110 determines a number of content items that will be provided in response to a particular content item request. For example, if the content distribution system 110 receives a request for one or more content items, the request may specify, or be associated with, a maximum number of content items that are able to be presented in a particular content item slot. In response to the content item request, the content distribution system 110 determines a number of content items, up to the maximum number, that will be provided in response to the request. For example, if the content item request specifies that up to five content items can be presented in a particular content item slot, the content distribution system can select between zero and five content items to be provided in response to the content item request.
- the content items selected by the content distribution system 110 are sized for presentation based on the total number of content items that are being provided in response to the request. For example, assume that the dimensions of the content item slot remain constant irrespective of the number of content items that are presented in the content item slot.
- the selected content items can be sized so that the total dimensions of the combined set of content items correspond to (e.g., equal or be some specified amount less than) the dimensions of the content items slot, and the size of each content item can correspond to, or determine, a size of a presentation position for the content item.
- that content item can have dimensions equal to the dimensions of the content item slot.
- each of the content items can be sized to occupy one-half of the content item slot, and the dimensions of the content items can continue to decrease as the number of content items presented in the content item slot increases.
- the content items are each assumed to occupy an equal portion (when two or more are presented) of the content item slot, but the techniques described in this document can also be used when the various content items are of various sizes (e.g., where a highest ranked content item occupies more space than a lower ranked content item).
- the performance of content items can vary based on the size of the content items and/or a number of content items that are presented. For example, if only a single content item is presented in a content item slot, that content item will be presented more prominently than if another content item were presented in the content item slot with that content item. Similarly, when a single content item is selected, that content item will be the only content item in the slot with which a user can interact. As more content items are presented in the content item slot, the user has the option of selecting any of the content items presented in the content item slot. Therefore, the expected performance of a particular content item when presented with one or more other content items may be lower than the expected performance when the particular content item is the only content item presented in the content item slot.
- the performance of a content item can also vary based, in part, on a presentation position of the content item within the content item slot. For example, assume that two content items are presented in two presentation positions of a content item slot. In this example, users may more often interact with content items that are presented in a particular presentation position (e.g., a more prominent presentation position), such that the performance of (e.g., a number of clicks received by) content items presented in the particular presentation position may generally be higher than the performance of content items presented in the other presentation position.
- a presentation position of the content item within the content item slot For example, assume that two content items are presented in two presentation positions of a content item slot. In this example, users may more often interact with content items that are presented in a particular presentation position (e.g., a more prominent presentation position), such that the performance of (e.g., a number of clicks received by) content items presented in the particular presentation position may generally be higher than the performance of content items presented in the other presentation position.
- the presentation position 119 a may have a higher historical performance (e.g., historical click through rate) than the presentation position 119 b . Therefore, the expected performance of a particular content item when selected for presentation in presentation position 119 a may be higher than the expected performance of that content item when selected for presentation in presentation position 119 b . Differences in expected performance of a content item based on the presentation position in which the content item is presented and/or a number of other content items that are being presented with the content item can be quantified using position factors, which are discussed in more detail below.
- the variation in content item performance described above may lead a publisher to attempt to increase revenue by specifying a maximum number of content items that is lower than the actual maximum number of content items that can be presented in a content item slot, which is referred to as “artificially limiting” (i.e., the publisher artificially limits the maximum number of content items when in fact more can be presented).
- artificially limiting i.e., the publisher artificially limits the maximum number of content items when in fact more can be presented.
- the environment includes a distribution management apparatus 120 that allocates impressions to content items (or content sponsors) in a manner that encourages publishers to specify the actual maximum number of content items that can be presented in a content item slot, and also encourages a content sponsor to submit a bid representing the full value of an impression (or click) to that content sponsor.
- the distribution management apparatus 120 provides the above-referenced incentives by computing a sponsor value associated with content items that are eligible to be provided in response to a particular content item request, and using the sponsor values to select the number of content items that together provide a threshold sponsor value and/or a maximum sponsor value.
- the sponsor value for a particular content sponsor can generally be based, in part, on a bid that will be used for the current content item request relative to a range of previous bids that have been submitted by the content sponsor.
- the distribution management apparatus 120 can determine a price for distribution of each content item that reduces, or eliminates, benefits that content sponsors may otherwise achieve by lowering their bid.
- the price charged for distribution of a particular content item can be based on various bids that could be associated with the content sponsor (or content item), the configuration (e.g., number and/or presentation positions) of content items that would be distributed for each of the various bids, and/or an expected performance of the particular content item when distributed based on the various bids.
- a price determined based, in part, on these factors can generally result in a value to a content sponsor remaining fairly constant irrespective of the bid submitted, which provides an incentive for the content sponsor to submit a bid corresponding to a full value of an impression or click (e.g., based on a value of a conversion and/or conversion rate) to the content sponsor.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow 200 that illustrates an example content item selection process.
- the data flow 200 can begin with the distribution management apparatus 120 receiving a content item request 202 from a user device 106 .
- the content item request 202 can include information that facilitates selection of content items to be provided in response to the content item request 202 .
- the content item request 202 can include data (e.g., keywords or phrases) specifying one or more characteristics that are related to a resource with which the requested content items will be presented.
- the content item request can also specify a maximum number of content items that are able to be presented in presentation positions of a content item slot.
- the content item request 202 specifies that the content item slot in which the content items will be presented can include a maximum of three presentation positions.
- a maximum of three content items can be selected for presentation in response to the content item request 202 .
- the distribution management apparatus 120 Based at least in part on the information included in the content item request 202 , the distribution management apparatus 120 identifies content sponsors that are eligible to provide a content item in response to the content item request 202 .
- the content distribution apparatus 120 can use keywords or other information related to the content item request (e.g., geographic information or time of day information) to identify eligible content items (e.g., content items having distribution parameters that are matched by the information included in the content item request 202 ) and/or the content sponsors that are associated with (e.g., provided) the eligible content items.
- eligible content items e.g., content items having distribution parameters that are matched by the information included in the content item request 202
- the content sponsors that are associated with e.g., provided
- the distribution management apparatus 120 obtains, from each of the identified content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 , bids that are associated with the respective eligible content items.
- Bid_A 210 is obtained from Content Sponsor A 204
- Bid_B 212 is obtained from Content Sponsor B 206
- Bid_C 214 is obtained from Content Sponsor C 208 .
- Bid_A 210 , Bid_B 212 , and Bid_C 214 are described as being obtained from the respective content sponsors in response to receiving the content item request 202 .
- the bids are received prior to receipt of the content item request 202 , stored in a data store such as the bid data store 216 , and obtained from the bid data store 216 in response to receiving the content item request 202 .
- the distribution management apparatus 120 obtains, from the bid data store 216 , historical bid data for each of the content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 .
- the historical bid data can include a set of (or distribution of) previous bids 218 that were submitted by each of the content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 .
- the set of previous bids 218 that are obtained for each of the content sponsors can specify, for example, all previous bids that have been submitted by the content sponsor, all bids submitted by the content sponsor over a specified period (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year), recent bids (e.g., a most recent or sequence of recent bids), and/or bids that the content sponsor has submitted for content item requests associated with a particular resource or publisher.
- Other bid segments can be defined/retrieved as required or desired.
- the set of previous bids 218 that are obtained by the distribution management apparatus 120 in response to the content item request 202 can specify all bids that the content sponsors 210 , 212 , and 214 have submitted for content item requests associated with the specific publisher of the resource identified by the content item request 202 .
- the distribution management apparatus 120 can request, from the bid data store 216 , a set of previous bids 218 submitted by the content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 for previous content item requests for resources associated with the domain example.com and/or known related resources (e.g., resources in another domain that is registered to a same publisher).
- the distribution management apparatus 120 determines a cumulative distribution function (“CDF”) 220 of the previous bids for each of the content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 .
- the CDF 220 for a particular content sponsor describes a probability that a bid submitted by the particular content sponsor will be less than or equal to the various values included in the CDF 220 .
- the CDF 220 provides a probability that a bid received from the content sponsor will be less than or equal to the particular bid X.
- the distribution management apparatus 120 uses the CDF 220 for each of the content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 , to determine a probability density function (“PDF”) 222 for each of the content sponsors 204 , 206 , and 208 .
- PDF probability density function
- the distribution management apparatus 120 determines the PDF 222 for a particular content sponsor based on a derivative of the CDF 220 for the particular content sponsor. For example, relationship 1 can be used to determine the PDF 222 based on a CDF 220 .
- PDF i (b) is the probability density function for content sponsor i as a function of bid value (b);
- d/db(CDF i (b)) is the derivative of the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor i as a function of bid value (b).
- the distribution management apparatus 120 proceeds to determine a sponsor value for each of the content sponsors (e.g., a sponsor value associated with the content item provided by the content sponsor).
- the sponsor value of each content sponsor can be based on a function of the current bid submitted by the content sponsor, the CDF for the content sponsor, and the PDF for the content sponsor. For example, relationship (2) can be used to determine the sponsor value of a content sponsor.
- SV i is the sponsor value of content sponsor (i);
- b i is the bid value for content sponsor (i);
- CDF i (b i ) is the value provided by the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor i at the bid value of b i ;
- PDF i (b i ) is the value provided by the probability density function for content sponsor i at the bid value of b i .
- the bid value b i for content sponsor i is set equal to, or based on, the value of the current bid submitted by the content sponsor. For example, assume that Content Sponsor A 204 submitted a bid of $2.00 for use with respect to the content item request 202 . In this example, the bid b i can be set to $2.00.
- the bid value b i for content sponsor i is determined based on the current bid submitted by the content sponsor and one or more other values. For example, assume that the bid value b i is determined, at least in part, on a product of a quality score for content sponsor i and the current bid submitted by content sponsor i. To illustrate, assume that Content Sponsor A 204 submitted a bid of $2.00 for use with respect to the content item request 202 , and that the content sponsor A 204 has a quality score of 0.8 (e.g., on a scale of 0.0-1.0). In this example, the bid value b i can be determined to be $1.60 (i.e., $2.00*0.8), which can be referred to as a quality-adjusted bid value.
- a bid value which can either be the current bid submitted for use with respect to the content item request 202 or a quality-adjusted bid that is based on the current bid and quality score.
- quality scores can be obtained from a data store, such as the bid data store 216 or received from another data processing apparatus and represent a relative measure of quality of content items provided by a particular content sponsor.
- the relationship used to determine the sponsor value of a content sponsor can be based on the characteristics of relationship (2). For example, if relationship (2) is an increasing function of b i , then the SV i obtained from relationship (2) can be used as the sponsor value for the content sponsor. If relationship (2) is not an increasing function of b i , other relationships can be used to determine the sponsor value of a content sponsor. For example, assume that relationship (2) is not an increasing function of b i and that there does not exist some value SV i >b i for which relationship (3) is not met.
- SV i is the value resulting from relationship (2) based on b i ;
- CDF i (SV i ) is the value provided by the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor (i) at the bid value of SV i ;
- PDF i (SV i ) is the value provided by the probability density function for the content sponsor (i) at the bid value of SV i .
- relationship (4) can be used to determine the sponsor value for the content sponsor.
- ASV i min SV i > b i ⁇ ( SV i - 1 - CDF i ⁇ ( SV i ) PDF i ⁇ ( SV i ) ) ( 4 )
- ASV i is the alternative sponsor value for the content sponsor (i);
- SV i is the sponsor value provided by relationship (2) based on b i ;
- CDF i (SV i ) is the value provided by the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor (i) at the value SV i ;
- PDF i (SV i ) is the value provided by the probability density function for content sponsor (i) at the value SV i .
- the distribution management apparatus 120 can create a content sponsor ranking 224 based on their respective sponsor values. For example, assume that a sponsor value of L was computed based on Bid_A 210 , a sponsor value of M was computed based on Bid_B 212 , and a sponsor value of N was computed based on Bid_C 214 and that L>M>N.
- Content Sponsor A 204 has a highest sponsor value and highest rank (e.g., rank of 1)
- Content Sponsor B 206 has a second highest sponsor value and second highest rank (e.g., rank of 2)
- Content Sponsor C 208 has a third highest sponsor value and third highest rank (e.g., rank of 3), as illustrated by the content sponsor ranking 224 .
- the distribution management apparatus 120 uses the content sponsor ranking 224 and sponsor values to select the number of content items that will be provided in response to the request. In some implementations, the distribution management apparatus 120 selects between zero and the maximum number of content items specified by the content item request 202 to be provided in response to the content item request 202 . The number of content items selected to be provided in response to the content item request 202 can be selected, for example, based on an efficiency measure for various configurations (e.g., different numbers) of content items.
- the efficiency of a set of content items can generally represent a total value of the content items in the set, and the value of each content item can be based on the sponsor value associated with the content item (e.g., a sponsor value of a content sponsor that provides the content item) and a position factor for the position at which the content item will be presented in the configuration.
- the sponsor value associated with the content item e.g., a sponsor value of a content sponsor that provides the content item
- a position factor for the position at which the content item will be presented in the configuration e.g., a sponsor value of a content sponsor that provides the content item
- a position factor for the position at which the content item will be presented in the configuration e.g., a position factor for the position at which the content item will be presented in the configuration.
- a configuration having a higher number of content items may actually have a lower efficiency than a configuration having a lower number of content items.
- a first configuration having fewer content items than a second configuration may have a higher
- the efficiency for a particular configuration of (e.g., number of) content items (or content sponsors) can be determined, for example, based on a function of (e.g., a sum of, weighted sum of, or another mathematical combination of) the sponsor values of content sponsors that are eligible to provide content items for presentation in the configuration.
- the content sponsors that are eligible to provide content items for presentation in the configuration will be those content sponsors associated with the highest sponsor values.
- the efficiency of that configuration can be based on the two highest sponsor values for content sponsors that can provide a content item in response to the request.
- the computation of the efficiency measure is discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 3 . For purposes of the following example, assume that the efficiency of a configuration is determined based on the sum of the sponsor values of the content sponsors that can provide content items for presentation in the configuration.
- the distribution management apparatus 120 can determine that between zero and three content items can be provided in response to the content item request 202 .
- a first efficiency measure (e.g., efficiency measure O) can be determined for a first configuration in which only one of the content items (e.g., a content item provided by Content Sponsor A 204 , which is associated with a highest sponsor value) will be presented in response to the content item request 202
- a second efficiency measure (e.g., efficiency measure P) can be determined for a second configuration in which two content items (e.g., content items provided by Content Sponsor A 204 and Content Sponsor B 206 , which are associated with the two highest sponsor values) will be provided in response to the content item request 202
- a third efficiency measure (e.g., efficiency measure Q) can be determined for a third configuration in which three content items (e.g., content items provided by Content Sponsor A 204 , Content Sponsor B 206 , and Content Sponsor C 208 , which are associated with the three highest sponsor values) will be provided in response to the content item request 202 .
- efficiency measure P is higher than both of the efficiency measure O and the efficiency measure Q. Since efficiency measure P corresponds to a configuration of two content items, the distribution management apparatus 120 can determine that two content items will be provided in response to the content item request 202 . The distribution management apparatus 120 can also determine that the content sponsors associated with the two highest sponsor values (e.g., content items provided by Content Sponsor A 204 and Content Sponsor B 206 ) will be selected to provide content items in response to the content item request 202 .
- the content sponsors associated with the two highest sponsor values e.g., content items provided by Content Sponsor A 204 and Content Sponsor B 206
- the presentation positions that are allocated to the content sponsors/content items can be selected based on the sponsor values of the content sponsors. For example, as illustrated by table 228 , the content item provided by Content Sponsor A 204 can be presented in a first presentation position (e.g., highest position or most visually prominent position) since Content Sponsor A 204 is associated with a highest sponsor value, and the content item provided by Content Sponsor B 206 can be presented in the second presentation position (e.g., a second highest position or second most visually prominent position) since Content Sponsor B 206 is associated with a second highest sponsor value.
- the distribution management apparatus 120 can provide instructions that cause the selected content items to be provided for presentation at the user device 106 according to the selected allocation.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for distributing content items.
- the process 300 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus, such as the distribution management apparatus 120 or the content distribution system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- Operations of the process 300 can be implemented by execution of instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium and that cause one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations of the process 300 .
- a content item request is received ( 302 ).
- the content item request is received from a user device that is rendering a resource.
- code included in the resource being rendered by the user device can cause the user device to submit a content item request.
- the content item request can include information that can be used to select one or more content items that will be provided in response to the content item request.
- the content item request can include data specifying one or more topics related to the resource and/or other contextual data that can be used by a content item selection process.
- the content item request can also specify a maximum number of content items that can be provided in response to the request. For example, if up to three content items can be presented in a content item slot corresponding to the request, then the content item request can specify a maximum of three content items.
- a current bid is identified for each of two or more content sponsors ( 304 ).
- the current bid is requested from and/or received from each of the content sponsors following receipt of the content item request.
- the bids are submitted by the content sponsors prior to receipt of the content item request, and the bids that will be used to select content items are identified upon receipt of the content item request.
- Each bid specifies a maximum amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for distribution of a content item.
- the bid can be expressed on a per one thousand impressions (“CPM”) basis or on a cost per click (“CPC”) basis.
- the bid can be converted to an estimated CPM (“eCPM”) bid, which specifies an estimated amount that will be paid for one thousand impressions of the content item, and the eCPM bid can be used for subsequent determinations that utilize a bid value.
- eCPM estimated CPM
- the eCPM of a CPC bid can be determined, for example, based on a number of clicks that the content item has received, the CPC bid, and a number of impressions that the content item has received.
- the eCPM for a content item can be determined according to relationship (5).
- eCPM CPC * Number ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ Clicks Number ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ Impressions ( 5 )
- a sponsor value is determined for each of the two or more content sponsors ( 306 ).
- the sponsor value is determined based on the current bid (e.g., eCPM bid) received from the content sponsor and previous bids that were previously used during a content item selection process.
- the current bid e.g., eCPM bid
- historical bid values can be obtained for each of the content sponsors and each of the historical bids can correspond to a bid that was submitted by the content sponsor for use with respect to previous content item requests.
- the historical bids can define or be stored in the form of a bid distribution for the content sponsor. For example, the distribution of previously bids that were previously received from a particular content sponsor can be obtained from a database of historical bids.
- the historical bids can be used to determine a cumulative distribution function, which can be used to determine a probability density function of the bids.
- a function of the current bid, the cumulative distribution function, and/or the probability density function can be used to determine the sponsor value for each of the content sponsors. For example, one or more of relationships (2) or (4) discussed above can be used to determine the sponsor values for the content sponsors.
- a separate cumulative distribution function and probability density function is determined for each content sponsor.
- the cumulative distribution function and corresponding probability density function can be determined for a particular content sponsor based on the bids that were submitted by that content sponsor, independent of the bids that were submitted by other content sponsors.
- a particular content sponsor can have a separate cumulative distribution function and corresponding probability density function for each different publisher.
- a particular content sponsor can have a first CDF and corresponding PDF for resources provided by a first particular publisher, and have a second different CDF and PDF for resources provided by a second different publisher.
- the first CDF and corresponding PDF can be determined, for example, based on the bids that the particular content sponsor provided for content requests associated with the resources from the first particular publisher (e.g., independent of bids submitted by other content sponsors or other bids submitted by the particular content sponsor for content requests associated with resource from other publishers).
- the CDF and PDF for a particular content sponsor are determined on a per-publisher basis
- the CDF can be determined based on a proper subset (fewer than all) of the previous bids, and the proper subset can include only those bids that the content sponsor submitted with respect to content item requests requesting content items for presentation with resources provided by the particular publisher.
- multiple different content sponsors share a same CDF and PDF.
- a same CDF can be used by all (or a portion of) the content sponsors.
- the single CDF that is used for of the multiple different content sponsors can be determined based on all of (or a portion of the bids) that were received from any of the multiple different content sponsors and used as part of a content item selection process for a content item request associated with resources provided by that single publisher.
- the CDF and PDF will not vary on a per-content sponsor basis, but will vary on a per-publisher basis.
- a single CDF is determined for each content sponsor, and this single CDF will not vary on a per-publisher basis.
- each content sponsor's CDF will be determined independent of the bids provided by other content sponsors and independent of the CDFs determined for other content sponsors.
- the single CDF determined for a particular content sponsor can be based on any or all bids received from that particular content sponsor, but generally may not consider bids submitted by other content sponsors.
- this CDF for the particular content sponsor can be publisher independent and consider bids that the particular content sponsor submitted for content item requests associated with resources provided by multiple different publishers.
- a number of content items that are able to be provided in response to the request is determined ( 308 ).
- the number of content items that are able to be provided in response to the request can be referred to as a maximum number of content items, and can be specified by the publisher of the resource with which the selected content items will be presented.
- the maximum number can be specified in the content item request or can be obtained from a data store storing the maximum number for various publishers.
- a number of content items that will be provided in response to the request is determined ( 310 ).
- the number of content items that will be provided is determined based on an aggregate (e.g., total) sponsor value of content sponsors that would be selected to provide content items for various content item configurations.
- the value of a particular configuration is referred to as an efficiency of that particular configuration.
- the configuration e.g., the number of content items that has a highest efficiency is used to determine the number of content items that will be provided in response to the content item request.
- the efficiency of the candidate configuration can be a sum of the sponsor values of the content sponsors that would provide content items to be included the configuration.
- the candidate configurations can include configurations that include one to “N” content items, where “N” is an integer corresponding to a maximum number of content items that can be presented in the content item slot, and each different number of content items can constitute a different configuration.
- the threshold efficiency is specified to be a maximum efficiency that is provided by any candidate configurations. For example, assume that three different candidate configurations of content items are available (e.g., a one content item configuration, a two content item configuration, and a three content item configuration). In this example, the threshold efficiency can be provided by the configuration that provides the highest efficiency. Note that the threshold efficiency can also be specified as an absolute efficiency value or a relative efficiency value (e.g., relative to an efficiency provided by one or more other configurations).
- the configuration that provides the threshold efficiency is identified from all candidate configurations that can be created using up to the maximum number of content items that can be provided in response to the content item request. For example, the maximum number of content items that can be provided can be identified from the content item request, and the total number of content sponsors that are eligible to provide a content item in response to the content item request.
- the candidate configurations can be determined based, at least in part, on the maximum number of content items that can be provided in response to the content item request. For example, assume that up to three content items can be presented in a content item slot, and that only two content items are available to be provided in response to the content item request. Further assume that each configuration differs in the number of content items that are presented. In this example, two content items can be provided in response to the request, and there can be two different candidate configurations (e.g., a content item provided by a content sponsor having a highest ranking can be presented alone in one candidate configuration and both available content items can be presented in another candidate configuration).
- a position adjusted sponsor value can be determined for each of the content sponsors in the candidate configuration.
- the position adjusted sponsor value can be based, for example, on a product of (or another mathematical combination of) the sponsor value of the content sponsor and a position factor corresponding to the presentation position of the content item in the candidate configuration.
- a position factor can represent a position-specific performance associated with a presentation position.
- the position factor for a particular presentation position in a content item slot can represent the performance of content items presented in that particular presentation position relative to a baseline performance of content items.
- the baseline performance can be, for example, an average performance of content items presented in a reference presentation position (e.g., a highest performing or lowest performing presentation position). For example, assume that two presentation positions are available in a particular content item slot, and that the average click through rate for content items presented in a first of the presentation positions is 0.20, and that the average click through rate for content items presented in the second presentation position is 0.10.
- the baseline performance can be set to 0.20, and the position factor for the second presentation position can be 0.5 (e.g., 0.10/0.20). In some implementations, the baseline performance can be based on an average performance of all content items presented in the content item slot (e.g., irrespective of presentation position).
- the position factor for a particular presentation position can be determined according to relationship (6).
- PF(i,j) is the performance factor for presentation position i when j content items are presented in the content item slot;
- CI_Perf(i,j) is the performance of content items presented in position i when j content items are presented in the content item slot
- CI_Perf(bl) is the baseline performance.
- a single presentation position may be associated with multiple different performance factors. For example, performance factors can be determined on a per-content sponsor basis, and used to adjust sponsor value associated with each respective content sponsor. Also, a particular presentation position may have a first performance factor when two content items are presented in the content item slot, and have a second different performance factor when three content items are presented in the content item slot.
- the performance of content items presented in a second presentation position (e.g., a second highest performing presentation position) of a content item slot has a value of 0.4 (e.g., a click through rate of 0.4) when only two content items are presented in the content item slot, and has a value of 0.1 (e.g., a click through rate of 0.1) when three content items are presented in the content item slot.
- the presenting three content items in the content item slot instead of presenting two content items, reduces the performance of the second content item slot.
- the performance factor for the second presentation position in a two content item configuration will be higher than the performance factor for the second presentation position in a three content item configuration.
- the performance factor for the single presentation position may generally be higher than the performance factor for a highest presentation position when two or more content items are presented in the content item slot, since presentation of the additional content items will reduce the prominence of the highest presentation position.
- position factors can be used to determine position adjusted sponsor values.
- the position adjusted sponsor values can be used to determine an aggregate sponsor value for each of the candidate configurations, and the candidate configuration having the highest aggregate sponsor value can be used to determine a number of content items that will be provided in response to the content item request.
- the candidate configurations can include a first configuration in which only a single content item is presented, a second configuration in which two content items are presented, and a third configuration in which three content items are presented in the content item slot.
- Table 1 (below) lists the three content sponsors having the three highest sponsor values with respect to the current content item request.
- the efficiency of each candidate configuration can be determined as provided in Table 2, where SV i *PF i is the position adjusted sponsor value for content sponsor (i).
- One or more of the content sponsors are selected to provide a content item in response to the content item request ( 312 ).
- the content sponsors associated with the highest sponsor values are selected to provide a content item in response to the request.
- content sponsor 1 and content sponsor 2 are associated with the two highest sponsor values, and therefore, will be selected to provide the two content items in response to the content item request.
- the presentation positions that are assigned to each of the content sponsors can be based, at least in part, on the sponsor values of the content sponsors. For example, a content sponsor having a highest sponsor value can be assigned to a highest performing presentation position, and each next highest performing presentation position can be assigned to the content sponsor with the next highest sponsor value.
- a price that will be charged for distribution of the one or more content items for the one or more content sponsors is determined ( 314 ).
- the price paid by a particular content sponsor can be determined based on trigger prices at which the selected configuration of content items would change if the particular content sponsor lowered its bid to that price.
- trigger prices e.g., p i,1 , . . . , p i,m , where p i,1 >p i,2 > . . . >p i,m
- these m trigger prices can be utilized to determine the price that the particular content sponsor will pay for distribution of their content items.
- the price that the content sponsor will pay can be a performance weighted average of these m trigger prices.
- the price can be determined using relationship (7).
- P cpc is the price per click that the content sponsor (i) will be charged
- s i,1 is the position factor when the bid for content sponsor (i) is greater than p i,1 ;
- q i is the quality score for content sponsor (i).
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for determining a price to be charged for distribution of a content item.
- the process 400 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus, such as the distribution management apparatus 120 and/or the content distribution system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- Operations of the process 400 can be implemented by execution of instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium and that cause one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations of the process 400 .
- a bid that was used to select the content item for presentation at a first presentation position is identified ( 402 ).
- the first presentation position can be one of multiple different presentation positions that are available in a content item slot.
- the bid that was used to select the content item for presentation at the first presentation position is a first value, or a quality-adjusted value, corresponding to the bid submitted by the content sponsor associated with the content item.
- the bid used to select the content item can be a maximum bid submitted (or selected) by the content sponsor, or a value resulting from a product of the maximum bid and a quality measure (e.g., quality score) corresponding to the content sponsor.
- the bid of $2.00 can be identified as the bid that was used to select a content item from Content Sponsor A for presentation in the highest performing presentation position
- the bid of $1.50 can be identified as the bid that was used to select a content item from Content Sponsor B in the second highest performing presentation position.
- First performance data for the content item at the first presentation position is obtained ( 404 ).
- the first performance data specifies a measure of user interactions that the content item is expected to receive (referred to as an “expected performance” or “estimated performance”) when presented at the first presentation position.
- the first performance data can include a total number of clicks (or other user interactions) that the content item is expected to receive over a specified period of time (e.g., when presented at the first presentation position), a click-through rate (or interaction rate) that the content item is expected to experience when presented at the first presentation position, or another measure of performance.
- the first performance data can be obtained from a data store storing the performance data.
- the expected performance specified by the first performance data is determined based on historical performance of the content item, historical performance of any or all content items presented at the first presentation position, and/or a position factor for the first presentation position.
- the expected performance can be based on a number of user interactions that the content item received when previously presented at the first presentation position (e.g., over a specified period or number of impressions), a click-through rate of the content item when presented at the first presentation position, and/or a click-through rate of all content items presented in the first presentation position.
- the first performance data for the content item provided by Content Sponsor A specifies that the content item is expected to receive 3 clicks over a set of 100 impressions.
- a lower value of the bid that will result in a sponsor value that causes the content item being presented at a different presentation position is identified ( 406 ).
- the lower value is a value at which the content item will be presented in a lower performing presentation position.
- the lower value can be determined, for example, by lowering the value of the bid associated with the content item until the sponsor value of the content item falls below the next highest sponsor value associated with another content item that is available for presentation.
- the sponsor values associated with the content item and the other content item can be determined based on bid values, cumulative distribution functions, and probability density functions, as described above.
- the lower value for the bid associated with Content Sponsor A can be determined by iteratively lowering the value of the bid associated with Content Sponsor A until Content Sponsor A's sponsor value meets, or is lower than, the sponsor value of Content Sponsor B (e.g., the sponsor value that is computed for Content Sponsor B based on the bid value of $1.50). Assume for purposes of this example that the bid value at which the sponsor value of Content Sponsor A falls below the sponsor value of Content Sponsor B is at a value of $1.60. Thus, in this example, the identified lower value of the bid can be $1.60.
- Second performance data for the content item at the second presentation position is obtained ( 408 ).
- the second performance data for the content item at the second presentation position can specify an expected performance of the content item when presented at the second presentation position.
- the second performance data can be obtained and/or determined in a manner similar to that described above with respect to obtaining the first performance data ( 404 ).
- the second performance data can be obtained from a data store storing the second performance data.
- the expected performance specified by the second performance data can be determined based, at least in part on the historical performance of the content item, the historical performance of the content item and/or other content items when presented at the second presentation position, and/or based on a position factor for the second presentation position.
- the second performance data for the content item provided by Content Sponsor A specifies that the content item is expected to receive 1 click over a set of 100 impressions when presented at the second presentation position.
- the determination of whether there are additional lower presentation positions can be made by comparing the current number of presentation positions to the maximum number of presentation positions for the content item slot (e.g., as indicated by a content item request). If the current number of presentation positions is less than the maximum number of presentation positions, then there may be additional lower presentation positions in which the content item can be presented.
- the determination of whether there are additional lower presentation positions can also be based on an evaluation of the number of content items that would be selected for presentation as the bid for the content item is lowered. For example, as discussed above, the number of content items selected for presentation is based on the efficiency associated with the various numbers of content items that can be selected. Thus, even if the maximum number of presentation positions is higher than the current number of presentation positions, an additional lower presentation position may not be available if the efficiency associated with presentation of a content item in that additional lower presentation position is less than the efficiency associated with a configuration that does not include presentation of a content item in the lower presentation position.
- an additional lower value is identified ( 406 ), and performance data associated with the additional lower presentation position is obtained. The determination of whether there are additional lower presentation positions, and the obtaining of performance data can continue until there are no lower presentation positions to evaluate.
- a final lower value that results in a sponsor value at which the content item will no longer be presented is identified ( 412 ).
- the final lower value can be identified in a manner similar to that described above with respect to operation ( 406 ). For example, the lower value at which the content item will no longer be associated with one of the top X sponsor values (where X is the number of presentation positions that are being used to present content items), and therefore not selected for presentation, can be identified. Since the final lower value can generally be the value at which the content item will no longer be selected for presentation, the performance data corresponding to the final lower value can specify an expected performance of zero.
- a price that will be charged is determined based on the lower values and the differences between the expected performance specified by the performance data ( 414 ).
- the price that will be charged can be a performance weighted average of the lower prices (e.g., lower prices identified at operation 406 and the final lower price identified at operation 412 ).
- the weight of each lower price can be a difference between the estimated performance of the content item at the lower presentation position corresponding to the lower price and the estimated performance of the content item at the next highest presentation position.
- Table 3 (below) specifies various bid values at which the selection content item configuration will change, the presentation position that will be occupied by the content item at that bid value, and the estimated performance (e.g., number of clicks) for a content item at various presentation positions.
- the performance weighted average of the bid values that will cause a configuration change results in a price of $1.40 cost per click.
- the content sponsor in this example can be charged a price of $1.40 CPC for presentation in the first presentation position.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for distributing content are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes receiving a content item request specifying that at least two presentation positions are available for presentation of content items. Current bids specifying amounts that two or more content sponsors are willing to pay to provide a content item in response to the content item request are identified. For each of the two or more content sponsors, a sponsor value is determined based, at least in part, on the current bid received for the content sponsor and one or more previous bids that were previously received for the content sponsor. At least one content sponsor is selected to provide a content item based at least in part on the sponsor values.
Description
- This specification relates to data processing and content distribution.
- The Internet facilitates the exchange of information and transactions between users across the globe. This exchange of information enables content sponsors to provide sponsored content to a variety of users. A content sponsor can control the distribution of their content items (e.g., promotions, advertisements, audio files, video files, or other content items) based on a set of distribution parameters that specify under what conditions a content item is eligible to be distributed. When a presentation opportunity meeting the conditions is available, the content item provided by a content sponsor is deemed eligible to be provided for presentation.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a content item request specifying that at least two presentation positions are available for presentation of content items; identifying, for each of two or more different content sponsors, a current bid specifying an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay to provide a content item in response to the content item request; determining, for each of the two or more content sponsors, a sponsor value based, at least in part, on the current bid received from the content sponsor and one or more previous bids that were received from the content sponsor for presentation of content for previous content item requests; and selecting, based at least in part on the sponsor value for each of the two or more content sponsors, at least one content sponsor to provide a content item in response to the content item request and a presentation position of the at least one content sponsor. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Methods can include the actions of assigning two content sponsors to the at least two presentation positions based on the sponsor value for each of the two or more content sponsors, a first of the two content sponsors being assigned to a highest performing presentation position and a second of the content sponsors being assigned to a second highest performing presentation position.
- Determining a sponsor value can include obtaining, for a particular content sponsor, a distribution of the previous bids that were previously received from the particular content sponsor; and determining, for the particular content sponsor, the content sponsor value based on the current bid received from the particular content sponsor and the distribution.
- Methods can include the actions of determining, for the particular content sponsor, a cumulative distribution function based on the distribution; and determining, for the particular content sponsor, a probability density function, based on the cumulative distribution function.
- Determining the sponsor value can include determining the sponsor value based on an output of a function of the current bid, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function. Determining the sponsor value can include determining, for the particular content sponsor, a separate sponsor value for each publisher based on a proper subset of the previous bids received from the particular content sponsor for the previous content item requests that requested a content item for presentation with a resource provided by the publisher.
- Methods can include the operations of determining a cumulative distribution function based on a distribution of the previous bids that were received from the two or more content sponsors; and determining a probability distribution function based on the cumulative distribution function. Determining the sponsor value can include determining, for each particular content sponsor, the sponsor value based on an output of a function of the current bid received from the particular content sponsor, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function.
- Methods can include the actions of identifying a set of the previous bids that were received for content item requests that requested a content item for presentation with a resource provided by a particular publisher; determining a cumulative distribution function based on a distribution of the previous bids in the set of the previous bids; and determining a probability distribution function based on the cumulative distribution function. Determining the sponsor value can include determining, for each particular content sponsor, the sponsor value based on an output of a function of the current bid received from the particular content sponsor, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function.
- Methods can include the actions of determining, based on the content item request, a first number of content items that are able to be provided in response to the request; and determining a second number of content items that will be provided in response to the content item request, the second number being less than the first number, the determination being based on a first aggregate sponsor value of content sponsors that will provide the second number of content items being higher than a second aggregate sponsor value of content sponsors that will provide the first number of content items.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize none, one or more of the following advantages. A price paid by a content sponsor for each impression (or click) is determined based on a performance weighted average of bid values at which the content sponsor would be allocated various available presentation positions, which encourages a content sponsor to bid a full value of an impression (or click) because the price paid by the content sponsor depends on values other the content sponsor's bid. Publishers are encouraged to accurately specify a maximum number of content items that can be presented in a content item slot (or another portion of a resource) by selecting a set of content items that will provide a highest aggregate value, even if the number of content items in the set is fewer than the maximum number specified by the publisher. Thus, the publisher can accurately specify the maximum number of content items without sacrificing value. User satisfaction with a resource may be increased since the number of content items that provide the highest aggregate value may be fewer than the maximum number of content items that can be presented, thereby reducing resource clutter.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Content items are selected for presentation based on one or more measures of “sponsor value” associated with a given request or a value associated with a specific content item. For example, a sponsor value in general can be determined for a content sponsor that provides content items, and the sponsor value for that content sponsor can be associated with each content item provided by that content sponsor. Similarly, a different sponsor value can be determined for each content item request that is received (e.g., based on the bid submitted for use with respect to that content item request). Throughout this document, the term sponsor value is referred to as being associated with either the content sponsor or a content item provided by the content sponsor.
- The sponsor value associated with a content item can be based on a function of the current bid associated with the content item (e.g., provided by the content sponsor) relative to a historical bid for the content item, or all historical bids provided by the content sponsor. For example, if the current bid is lower than a statistical measure of historical bids for the content item (or all bids provided by the content sponsor), the content item may have a lower sponsor value than if the current bid were higher than the statistical measure. Computation of the sponsor value is discussed in detail with reference to
FIG. 2 andFIG. 3 . - In some implementations, a set of one or more content items are selected based on the sponsor values. The number of content items selected in response to a received request can range from a single content item up to the maximum number of content items that can be presented in response to the request (e.g., as specified by the request). If fewer than the maximum number of content items are selected, the content items can be adjusted (e.g., resized) to fill the space available for presentation of content items provided in response to the request. The content item selection process can maximize an aggregate sponsor value of the content items provided in a configuration, which is referred to herein as the “efficiency” of the configuration. As used throughout this document, the term configuration can refer to a particular number of content items and/or an arrangement of content items responsive to a received request.
- Once the content items have been selected, a price that will be charged for distribution of each content item is determined. The price for a particular content item can be determined, for example, based on “trigger prices” at which a presentation position of the particular content item would change if the bid associated with the content item were set to that price. For example, assume that there are two presentation positions available, and a particular content item is selected for presentation in a highest presentation position based on the current bid associated with the particular content item. In this example, a first trigger price will be the price at which the content item moves from the highest slot to the second slot, and a second trigger price will be the price at which the content item is no longer shown. Using the trigger prices and an estimated performance of the content item at each of the presentation positions, a performance weighted average of the trigger prices can be determined and used as the price charged for distribution of the particular content item. For example, the first trigger price can be weighted by the difference in performance between the first slot and the second slot, while the second trigger price can be weighted by the performance of the second slot.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which content is distributed touser devices 106. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108, and acontent distribution system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include manydifferent websites 104,user devices 106, andcontent sponsors 108. - A
website 104 is one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 is any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). Units of content that are presented in (or with) resources are referred to as content items, and an individual content item can be stored in a single file or set of files independent of the resource. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can submit aresource request 112 that requests aresource 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing the requestedresource 114 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The requestedresource 114 can be, for example, a home page of awebsite 104, a web page from a social network, or anotherresource 105. The data representing the requestedresource 114 can include data that cause presentation ofresource content 116 at theuser device 106. The data representing the requestedresource 114 can also include data specifying acontent item slot 118. A content item slot is a portion of the resource (e.g., a portion of a web page) or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of another window or in a slot of a web page) in which one or more content items, such as advertisements, can be presented. A content items slot 118 can also be referred to as an advertisement slot, but any type of content (e.g., content items other than advertisements) can be presented in thecontent item slot 118. - A single
content item slot 118 may be configured to include one ormore presentation positions content item slot 118 at which a content item can be presented. In some implementations, the number of presentation positions and/or the size of the presentation positions for a particularcontent item slot 118 may be determined based on the number, type, and/or value of content items that are available for presentation in the content item slot. For example, as described in detail below, a set of content items that are associated with respective highest values (e.g., among eligible content items) may be selected for presentation, and the number of presentation positions included in thecontent item slot 118 can be determined based on the number of content items that are included in the selected set of content items. A publisher can specify a maximum number of presentation positions that are to be included in a particular content item slot, and the selection of the set of content items can be constrained based on that maximum number. - To facilitate searching of resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource with which the data are associated. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in asearch index 122. Data that are associated with a resource is data that represents content included in the resource and/or metadata for the resource. -
User devices 106 can submit search queries to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses thesearch index 122 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device in search results page. A search result is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Like other resources, search results pages can include one or morecontent item slots 118 in which content items, such as advertisements, can be presented. - When a
resource 105 is requested by auser device 106, execution of code associated with acontent item slot 118 in the resource initiates a request for a content item to populate the slot. The request can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requestedresource 114. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the requestedresource 114 for which thecontent item slot 118 is defined, a size of the content item slot, a maximum number of presentation positions (or content items) that can be included in thecontent item slot 118, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in thecontent item slot 118 can be provided to thecontent distribution system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or entities that are referenced by the resource can also be provided to thecontent distribution system 110 to facilitate identification of content items that are relevant to the requestedresource 114. The requests can also include other information, such as information that the user has provided, geographic information indicating a state or region from which the request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the content item will be displayed (e.g., a type of device at which the content item will be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device). - The content items that are provided in response to a request (or another content item request) are selected based, in part, on distribution parameters associated with the content items. Distribution parameters are a set of criteria upon which distribution of content items are conditioned. In some implementations, the distribution criteria for a particular content item can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by resource keywords or search queries) in order for the content item to be eligible for presentation. The distribution criteria can also specify a bid and/or budget for distributing the particular content item. As described in more detail below, bids can be used to select a set of content items for presentation with a resource and/or to determine in which presentation position the content item(s) will be presented.
- In some implementations, the
content distribution system 110 determines a number of content items that will be provided in response to a particular content item request. For example, if thecontent distribution system 110 receives a request for one or more content items, the request may specify, or be associated with, a maximum number of content items that are able to be presented in a particular content item slot. In response to the content item request, thecontent distribution system 110 determines a number of content items, up to the maximum number, that will be provided in response to the request. For example, if the content item request specifies that up to five content items can be presented in a particular content item slot, the content distribution system can select between zero and five content items to be provided in response to the content item request. - In some implementations, the content items selected by the
content distribution system 110 are sized for presentation based on the total number of content items that are being provided in response to the request. For example, assume that the dimensions of the content item slot remain constant irrespective of the number of content items that are presented in the content item slot. In this example, the selected content items can be sized so that the total dimensions of the combined set of content items correspond to (e.g., equal or be some specified amount less than) the dimensions of the content items slot, and the size of each content item can correspond to, or determine, a size of a presentation position for the content item. Thus, when a single content item is presented, that content item can have dimensions equal to the dimensions of the content item slot. Similarly, when two content items are presented, each of the content items can be sized to occupy one-half of the content item slot, and the dimensions of the content items can continue to decrease as the number of content items presented in the content item slot increases. Note that for purposes of example, the content items are each assumed to occupy an equal portion (when two or more are presented) of the content item slot, but the techniques described in this document can also be used when the various content items are of various sizes (e.g., where a highest ranked content item occupies more space than a lower ranked content item). - The performance of content items can vary based on the size of the content items and/or a number of content items that are presented. For example, if only a single content item is presented in a content item slot, that content item will be presented more prominently than if another content item were presented in the content item slot with that content item. Similarly, when a single content item is selected, that content item will be the only content item in the slot with which a user can interact. As more content items are presented in the content item slot, the user has the option of selecting any of the content items presented in the content item slot. Therefore, the expected performance of a particular content item when presented with one or more other content items may be lower than the expected performance when the particular content item is the only content item presented in the content item slot.
- The performance of a content item can also vary based, in part, on a presentation position of the content item within the content item slot. For example, assume that two content items are presented in two presentation positions of a content item slot. In this example, users may more often interact with content items that are presented in a particular presentation position (e.g., a more prominent presentation position), such that the performance of (e.g., a number of clicks received by) content items presented in the particular presentation position may generally be higher than the performance of content items presented in the other presentation position.
- In a particular example, the
presentation position 119 a may have a higher historical performance (e.g., historical click through rate) than thepresentation position 119 b. Therefore, the expected performance of a particular content item when selected for presentation inpresentation position 119 a may be higher than the expected performance of that content item when selected for presentation inpresentation position 119 b. Differences in expected performance of a content item based on the presentation position in which the content item is presented and/or a number of other content items that are being presented with the content item can be quantified using position factors, which are discussed in more detail below. - The variation in content item performance described above may lead a publisher to attempt to increase revenue by specifying a maximum number of content items that is lower than the actual maximum number of content items that can be presented in a content item slot, which is referred to as “artificially limiting” (i.e., the publisher artificially limits the maximum number of content items when in fact more can be presented). When a publisher artificially limits the maximum number of content items, it reduces the number of content items that will be presented in the content item slot, which can negatively impact the value of the content items slots to content sponsors, and may also negatively impact the revenue realized by the publisher.
- The environment includes a
distribution management apparatus 120 that allocates impressions to content items (or content sponsors) in a manner that encourages publishers to specify the actual maximum number of content items that can be presented in a content item slot, and also encourages a content sponsor to submit a bid representing the full value of an impression (or click) to that content sponsor. As described in more detail below, thedistribution management apparatus 120 provides the above-referenced incentives by computing a sponsor value associated with content items that are eligible to be provided in response to a particular content item request, and using the sponsor values to select the number of content items that together provide a threshold sponsor value and/or a maximum sponsor value. In some implementations, the sponsor value for a particular content sponsor can generally be based, in part, on a bid that will be used for the current content item request relative to a range of previous bids that have been submitted by the content sponsor. - As described in detail with reference to
FIG. 4 , thedistribution management apparatus 120 can determine a price for distribution of each content item that reduces, or eliminates, benefits that content sponsors may otherwise achieve by lowering their bid. For example, the price charged for distribution of a particular content item can be based on various bids that could be associated with the content sponsor (or content item), the configuration (e.g., number and/or presentation positions) of content items that would be distributed for each of the various bids, and/or an expected performance of the particular content item when distributed based on the various bids. A price determined based, in part, on these factors can generally result in a value to a content sponsor remaining fairly constant irrespective of the bid submitted, which provides an incentive for the content sponsor to submit a bid corresponding to a full value of an impression or click (e.g., based on a value of a conversion and/or conversion rate) to the content sponsor. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow 200 that illustrates an example content item selection process. The data flow 200 can begin with thedistribution management apparatus 120 receiving acontent item request 202 from auser device 106. As noted above, thecontent item request 202 can include information that facilitates selection of content items to be provided in response to thecontent item request 202. For example, thecontent item request 202 can include data (e.g., keywords or phrases) specifying one or more characteristics that are related to a resource with which the requested content items will be presented. The content item request can also specify a maximum number of content items that are able to be presented in presentation positions of a content item slot. For example, for the purposes of the following discussion, we can assume that thecontent item request 202 specifies that the content item slot in which the content items will be presented can include a maximum of three presentation positions. In this example, a maximum of three content items can be selected for presentation in response to thecontent item request 202. - Based at least in part on the information included in the
content item request 202, thedistribution management apparatus 120 identifies content sponsors that are eligible to provide a content item in response to thecontent item request 202. For example, thecontent distribution apparatus 120 can use keywords or other information related to the content item request (e.g., geographic information or time of day information) to identify eligible content items (e.g., content items having distribution parameters that are matched by the information included in the content item request 202) and/or the content sponsors that are associated with (e.g., provided) the eligible content items. In the present example, assume thatContent Sponsor A 204,Content Sponsor B 206, andContent Sponsor C 208 are the three content sponsors that are associated with eligible content items for thecontent item request 202. - The
distribution management apparatus 120 obtains, from each of the identifiedcontent sponsors Bid_A 210 is obtained fromContent Sponsor A 204,Bid_B 212 is obtained fromContent Sponsor B 206, andBid_C 214 is obtained fromContent Sponsor C 208. Note that, for purposes of example,Bid_A 210,Bid_B 212, andBid_C 214 are described as being obtained from the respective content sponsors in response to receiving thecontent item request 202. In some implementations, the bids are received prior to receipt of thecontent item request 202, stored in a data store such as thebid data store 216, and obtained from thebid data store 216 in response to receiving thecontent item request 202. - The
distribution management apparatus 120 obtains, from thebid data store 216, historical bid data for each of the content sponsors 204, 206, and 208. For example, as illustrated byFIG. 2 , the historical bid data can include a set of (or distribution of)previous bids 218 that were submitted by each of the content sponsors 204, 206, and 208. The set ofprevious bids 218 that are obtained for each of the content sponsors can specify, for example, all previous bids that have been submitted by the content sponsor, all bids submitted by the content sponsor over a specified period (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year), recent bids (e.g., a most recent or sequence of recent bids), and/or bids that the content sponsor has submitted for content item requests associated with a particular resource or publisher. Other bid segments can be defined/retrieved as required or desired. - In some implementations, the set of
previous bids 218 that are obtained by thedistribution management apparatus 120 in response to thecontent item request 202 can specify all bids that the content sponsors 210, 212, and 214 have submitted for content item requests associated with the specific publisher of the resource identified by thecontent item request 202. For example, assume that thecontent item request 202 specifies that the resource with which the requested content items will be presented is example.com. In this example, thedistribution management apparatus 120 can request, from thebid data store 216, a set ofprevious bids 218 submitted by the content sponsors 204, 206, and 208 for previous content item requests for resources associated with the domain example.com and/or known related resources (e.g., resources in another domain that is registered to a same publisher). - Using the set of
previous bids 218, thedistribution management apparatus 120 determines a cumulative distribution function (“CDF”) 220 of the previous bids for each of the content sponsors 204, 206, and 208. In some implementations, theCDF 220 for a particular content sponsor describes a probability that a bid submitted by the particular content sponsor will be less than or equal to the various values included in theCDF 220. For example, for a particular bid X in theCDF 220, theCDF 220 provides a probability that a bid received from the content sponsor will be less than or equal to the particular bid X. - The
distribution management apparatus 120 uses theCDF 220 for each of the content sponsors 204, 206, and 208, to determine a probability density function (“PDF”) 222 for each of the content sponsors 204, 206, and 208. In some implementations, thedistribution management apparatus 120 determines thePDF 222 for a particular content sponsor based on a derivative of theCDF 220 for the particular content sponsor. For example,relationship 1 can be used to determine thePDF 222 based on aCDF 220. -
- where,
- PDFi(b) is the probability density function for content sponsor i as a function of bid value (b); and
- d/db(CDFi(b)) is the derivative of the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor i as a function of bid value (b).
- The
distribution management apparatus 120 proceeds to determine a sponsor value for each of the content sponsors (e.g., a sponsor value associated with the content item provided by the content sponsor). In some implementations, the sponsor value of each content sponsor can be based on a function of the current bid submitted by the content sponsor, the CDF for the content sponsor, and the PDF for the content sponsor. For example, relationship (2) can be used to determine the sponsor value of a content sponsor. -
- where,
- SVi is the sponsor value of content sponsor (i);
- bi is the bid value for content sponsor (i);
- CDFi(bi) is the value provided by the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor i at the bid value of bi; and
- PDFi(bi) is the value provided by the probability density function for content sponsor i at the bid value of bi.
- In some implementations, the bid value bi for content sponsor i is set equal to, or based on, the value of the current bid submitted by the content sponsor. For example, assume that
Content Sponsor A 204 submitted a bid of $2.00 for use with respect to thecontent item request 202. In this example, the bid bi can be set to $2.00. - In some implementations, the bid value bi for content sponsor i is determined based on the current bid submitted by the content sponsor and one or more other values. For example, assume that the bid value bi is determined, at least in part, on a product of a quality score for content sponsor i and the current bid submitted by content sponsor i. To illustrate, assume that
Content Sponsor A 204 submitted a bid of $2.00 for use with respect to thecontent item request 202, and that thecontent sponsor A 204 has a quality score of 0.8 (e.g., on a scale of 0.0-1.0). In this example, the bid value bi can be determined to be $1.60 (i.e., $2.00*0.8), which can be referred to as a quality-adjusted bid value. - For purposes of example, the discussion that follows simply refers to a bid value, which can either be the current bid submitted for use with respect to the
content item request 202 or a quality-adjusted bid that is based on the current bid and quality score. Note that quality scores can be obtained from a data store, such as thebid data store 216 or received from another data processing apparatus and represent a relative measure of quality of content items provided by a particular content sponsor. - In some implementations, the relationship used to determine the sponsor value of a content sponsor can be based on the characteristics of relationship (2). For example, if relationship (2) is an increasing function of bi, then the SVi obtained from relationship (2) can be used as the sponsor value for the content sponsor. If relationship (2) is not an increasing function of bi, other relationships can be used to determine the sponsor value of a content sponsor. For example, assume that relationship (2) is not an increasing function of bi and that there does not exist some value SVi>bi for which relationship (3) is not met.
-
- where,
- SVi is the value resulting from relationship (2) based on bi;
- CDFi(SVi) is the value provided by the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor (i) at the bid value of SVi; and
- PDFi(SVi) is the value provided by the probability density function for the content sponsor (i) at the bid value of SVi.
- In this example, relationship (4) can be used to determine the sponsor value for the content sponsor.
-
- where,
- ASVi is the alternative sponsor value for the content sponsor (i);
- SVi is the sponsor value provided by relationship (2) based on bi;
- CDFi(SVi) is the value provided by the cumulative distribution function for content sponsor (i) at the value SVi;
- PDFi(SVi) is the value provided by the probability density function for content sponsor (i) at the value SVi.
- Using the sponsor values, the
distribution management apparatus 120 can create a content sponsor ranking 224 based on their respective sponsor values. For example, assume that a sponsor value of L was computed based onBid_A 210, a sponsor value of M was computed based onBid_B 212, and a sponsor value of N was computed based onBid_C 214 and that L>M>N. In this example,Content Sponsor A 204 has a highest sponsor value and highest rank (e.g., rank of 1),Content Sponsor B 206 has a second highest sponsor value and second highest rank (e.g., rank of 2), andContent Sponsor C 208 has a third highest sponsor value and third highest rank (e.g., rank of 3), as illustrated by thecontent sponsor ranking 224. - The
distribution management apparatus 120 uses the content sponsor ranking 224 and sponsor values to select the number of content items that will be provided in response to the request. In some implementations, thedistribution management apparatus 120 selects between zero and the maximum number of content items specified by thecontent item request 202 to be provided in response to thecontent item request 202. The number of content items selected to be provided in response to thecontent item request 202 can be selected, for example, based on an efficiency measure for various configurations (e.g., different numbers) of content items. - As described in more detail below, the efficiency of a set of content items can generally represent a total value of the content items in the set, and the value of each content item can be based on the sponsor value associated with the content item (e.g., a sponsor value of a content sponsor that provides the content item) and a position factor for the position at which the content item will be presented in the configuration. As described in detail with reference to
FIG. 3 , because various factors, including the position factors of the various presentation positions, are used to determine the total value of a configuration, a configuration having a higher number of content items may actually have a lower efficiency than a configuration having a lower number of content items. Thus, a first configuration having fewer content items than a second configuration may have a higher efficiency than the second configuration. - The efficiency for a particular configuration of (e.g., number of) content items (or content sponsors) can be determined, for example, based on a function of (e.g., a sum of, weighted sum of, or another mathematical combination of) the sponsor values of content sponsors that are eligible to provide content items for presentation in the configuration. Generally, the content sponsors that are eligible to provide content items for presentation in the configuration will be those content sponsors associated with the highest sponsor values. For example, if a particular configuration includes two different content items, the efficiency of that configuration can be based on the two highest sponsor values for content sponsors that can provide a content item in response to the request. The computation of the efficiency measure is discussed in more detail with respect to
FIG. 3 . For purposes of the following example, assume that the efficiency of a configuration is determined based on the sum of the sponsor values of the content sponsors that can provide content items for presentation in the configuration. - To illustrate with respect to the example data flow 200, up to three content items can be presented in response to the content item request 200 since the
content item request 202 specifies a maximum of three content items. Therefore, thedistribution management apparatus 120 can determine that between zero and three content items can be provided in response to thecontent item request 202. In this example, as illustrated by table 226, a first efficiency measure (e.g., efficiency measure O) can be determined for a first configuration in which only one of the content items (e.g., a content item provided byContent Sponsor A 204, which is associated with a highest sponsor value) will be presented in response to thecontent item request 202, a second efficiency measure (e.g., efficiency measure P) can be determined for a second configuration in which two content items (e.g., content items provided byContent Sponsor A 204 andContent Sponsor B 206, which are associated with the two highest sponsor values) will be provided in response to thecontent item request 202, and a third efficiency measure (e.g., efficiency measure Q) can be determined for a third configuration in which three content items (e.g., content items provided byContent Sponsor A 204,Content Sponsor B 206, andContent Sponsor C 208, which are associated with the three highest sponsor values) will be provided in response to thecontent item request 202. - Assume for purposes of this example, that efficiency measure P is higher than both of the efficiency measure O and the efficiency measure Q. Since efficiency measure P corresponds to a configuration of two content items, the
distribution management apparatus 120 can determine that two content items will be provided in response to thecontent item request 202. Thedistribution management apparatus 120 can also determine that the content sponsors associated with the two highest sponsor values (e.g., content items provided byContent Sponsor A 204 and Content Sponsor B 206) will be selected to provide content items in response to thecontent item request 202. - In some implementations, the presentation positions that are allocated to the content sponsors/content items can be selected based on the sponsor values of the content sponsors. For example, as illustrated by table 228, the content item provided by Content Sponsor A 204 can be presented in a first presentation position (e.g., highest position or most visually prominent position) since
Content Sponsor A 204 is associated with a highest sponsor value, and the content item provided byContent Sponsor B 206 can be presented in the second presentation position (e.g., a second highest position or second most visually prominent position) sinceContent Sponsor B 206 is associated with a second highest sponsor value. Thedistribution management apparatus 120 can provide instructions that cause the selected content items to be provided for presentation at theuser device 106 according to the selected allocation. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart of anexample process 300 for distributing content items. Theprocess 300 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus, such as thedistribution management apparatus 120 or thecontent distribution system 110 ofFIG. 1 . Operations of theprocess 300 can be implemented by execution of instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium and that cause one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations of theprocess 300. - A content item request is received (302). In some implementations, the content item request is received from a user device that is rendering a resource. For example, as described above, code included in the resource being rendered by the user device can cause the user device to submit a content item request. The content item request can include information that can be used to select one or more content items that will be provided in response to the content item request. For example, the content item request can include data specifying one or more topics related to the resource and/or other contextual data that can be used by a content item selection process.
- The content item request can also specify a maximum number of content items that can be provided in response to the request. For example, if up to three content items can be presented in a content item slot corresponding to the request, then the content item request can specify a maximum of three content items.
- A current bid is identified for each of two or more content sponsors (304). In some implementations, the current bid is requested from and/or received from each of the content sponsors following receipt of the content item request. In some implementations, the bids are submitted by the content sponsors prior to receipt of the content item request, and the bids that will be used to select content items are identified upon receipt of the content item request. Each bid specifies a maximum amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for distribution of a content item. The bid can be expressed on a per one thousand impressions (“CPM”) basis or on a cost per click (“CPC”) basis. If the bid is expressed on a CPC basis, the bid can be converted to an estimated CPM (“eCPM”) bid, which specifies an estimated amount that will be paid for one thousand impressions of the content item, and the eCPM bid can be used for subsequent determinations that utilize a bid value.
- The eCPM of a CPC bid can be determined, for example, based on a number of clicks that the content item has received, the CPC bid, and a number of impressions that the content item has received. For example, the eCPM for a content item can be determined according to relationship (5).
-
- A sponsor value is determined for each of the two or more content sponsors (306). In some implementations, the sponsor value is determined based on the current bid (e.g., eCPM bid) received from the content sponsor and previous bids that were previously used during a content item selection process. For example, as described above with reference to
FIG. 2 , historical bid values can be obtained for each of the content sponsors and each of the historical bids can correspond to a bid that was submitted by the content sponsor for use with respect to previous content item requests. The historical bids can define or be stored in the form of a bid distribution for the content sponsor. For example, the distribution of previously bids that were previously received from a particular content sponsor can be obtained from a database of historical bids. - As described above with respect to
FIG. 2 , the historical bids can be used to determine a cumulative distribution function, which can be used to determine a probability density function of the bids. In turn, a function of the current bid, the cumulative distribution function, and/or the probability density function can be used to determine the sponsor value for each of the content sponsors. For example, one or more of relationships (2) or (4) discussed above can be used to determine the sponsor values for the content sponsors. - In some implementations, a separate cumulative distribution function and probability density function is determined for each content sponsor. For example, the cumulative distribution function and corresponding probability density function can be determined for a particular content sponsor based on the bids that were submitted by that content sponsor, independent of the bids that were submitted by other content sponsors.
- Additionally, or alternatively, a particular content sponsor can have a separate cumulative distribution function and corresponding probability density function for each different publisher. For example, a particular content sponsor can have a first CDF and corresponding PDF for resources provided by a first particular publisher, and have a second different CDF and PDF for resources provided by a second different publisher. The first CDF and corresponding PDF can be determined, for example, based on the bids that the particular content sponsor provided for content requests associated with the resources from the first particular publisher (e.g., independent of bids submitted by other content sponsors or other bids submitted by the particular content sponsor for content requests associated with resource from other publishers). In other words, when the CDF and PDF for a particular content sponsor are determined on a per-publisher basis, the CDF can be determined based on a proper subset (fewer than all) of the previous bids, and the proper subset can include only those bids that the content sponsor submitted with respect to content item requests requesting content items for presentation with resources provided by the particular publisher.
- In some implementations, multiple different content sponsors share a same CDF and PDF. For example, instead of (or in addition to) determining a different CDF for each different content sponsor-publisher pair, with respect to a single publisher, a same CDF can be used by all (or a portion of) the content sponsors. In some implementations, the single CDF that is used for of the multiple different content sponsors can be determined based on all of (or a portion of the bids) that were received from any of the multiple different content sponsors and used as part of a content item selection process for a content item request associated with resources provided by that single publisher. In some implementations, the CDF and PDF will not vary on a per-content sponsor basis, but will vary on a per-publisher basis.
- In some implementations, a single CDF is determined for each content sponsor, and this single CDF will not vary on a per-publisher basis. In some implementations, each content sponsor's CDF will be determined independent of the bids provided by other content sponsors and independent of the CDFs determined for other content sponsors. In some implementations, the single CDF determined for a particular content sponsor can be based on any or all bids received from that particular content sponsor, but generally may not consider bids submitted by other content sponsors. Thus, this CDF for the particular content sponsor can be publisher independent and consider bids that the particular content sponsor submitted for content item requests associated with resources provided by multiple different publishers.
- A number of content items that are able to be provided in response to the request is determined (308). As discussed above, the number of content items that are able to be provided in response to the request can be referred to as a maximum number of content items, and can be specified by the publisher of the resource with which the selected content items will be presented. The maximum number can be specified in the content item request or can be obtained from a data store storing the maximum number for various publishers.
- A number of content items that will be provided in response to the request is determined (310). In some implementations, the number of content items that will be provided is determined based on an aggregate (e.g., total) sponsor value of content sponsors that would be selected to provide content items for various content item configurations. The value of a particular configuration is referred to as an efficiency of that particular configuration. In some implementations, the configuration (e.g., the number of content items) that has a highest efficiency is used to determine the number of content items that will be provided in response to the content item request.
- For example, for each candidate configuration of content items, the efficiency of the candidate configuration can be a sum of the sponsor values of the content sponsors that would provide content items to be included the configuration. The candidate configurations can include configurations that include one to “N” content items, where “N” is an integer corresponding to a maximum number of content items that can be presented in the content item slot, and each different number of content items can constitute a different configuration.
- In some implementations, the threshold efficiency is specified to be a maximum efficiency that is provided by any candidate configurations. For example, assume that three different candidate configurations of content items are available (e.g., a one content item configuration, a two content item configuration, and a three content item configuration). In this example, the threshold efficiency can be provided by the configuration that provides the highest efficiency. Note that the threshold efficiency can also be specified as an absolute efficiency value or a relative efficiency value (e.g., relative to an efficiency provided by one or more other configurations).
- In some implementations, the configuration that provides the threshold efficiency is identified from all candidate configurations that can be created using up to the maximum number of content items that can be provided in response to the content item request. For example, the maximum number of content items that can be provided can be identified from the content item request, and the total number of content sponsors that are eligible to provide a content item in response to the content item request.
- The candidate configurations can be determined based, at least in part, on the maximum number of content items that can be provided in response to the content item request. For example, assume that up to three content items can be presented in a content item slot, and that only two content items are available to be provided in response to the content item request. Further assume that each configuration differs in the number of content items that are presented. In this example, two content items can be provided in response to the request, and there can be two different candidate configurations (e.g., a content item provided by a content sponsor having a highest ranking can be presented alone in one candidate configuration and both available content items can be presented in another candidate configuration).
- Once the candidate configurations have been identified, a position adjusted sponsor value can be determined for each of the content sponsors in the candidate configuration. The position adjusted sponsor value can be based, for example, on a product of (or another mathematical combination of) the sponsor value of the content sponsor and a position factor corresponding to the presentation position of the content item in the candidate configuration.
- A position factor can represent a position-specific performance associated with a presentation position. For example, the position factor for a particular presentation position in a content item slot can represent the performance of content items presented in that particular presentation position relative to a baseline performance of content items. The baseline performance can be, for example, an average performance of content items presented in a reference presentation position (e.g., a highest performing or lowest performing presentation position). For example, assume that two presentation positions are available in a particular content item slot, and that the average click through rate for content items presented in a first of the presentation positions is 0.20, and that the average click through rate for content items presented in the second presentation position is 0.10. In this example, the baseline performance can be set to 0.20, and the position factor for the second presentation position can be 0.5 (e.g., 0.10/0.20). In some implementations, the baseline performance can be based on an average performance of all content items presented in the content item slot (e.g., irrespective of presentation position).
- Using the baseline performance, the position factor for a particular presentation position can be determined according to relationship (6).
-
PF(i,j)=CI_Perf(i,j)/CI_Perf(bl) (6) - where,
- PF(i,j) is the performance factor for presentation position i when j content items are presented in the content item slot;
- CI_Perf(i,j) is the performance of content items presented in position i when j content items are presented in the content item slot; and
- CI_Perf(bl) is the baseline performance.
- A single presentation position may be associated with multiple different performance factors. For example, performance factors can be determined on a per-content sponsor basis, and used to adjust sponsor value associated with each respective content sponsor. Also, a particular presentation position may have a first performance factor when two content items are presented in the content item slot, and have a second different performance factor when three content items are presented in the content item slot.
- For example, assume that the performance of content items presented in a second presentation position (e.g., a second highest performing presentation position) of a content item slot has a value of 0.4 (e.g., a click through rate of 0.4) when only two content items are presented in the content item slot, and has a value of 0.1 (e.g., a click through rate of 0.1) when three content items are presented in the content item slot. In this example, the presenting three content items in the content item slot, instead of presenting two content items, reduces the performance of the second content item slot. Thus, the performance factor for the second presentation position in a two content item configuration will be higher than the performance factor for the second presentation position in a three content item configuration.
- In this example, when only a single content item is presented in the content item slot, the performance factor for the single presentation position may generally be higher than the performance factor for a highest presentation position when two or more content items are presented in the content item slot, since presentation of the additional content items will reduce the prominence of the highest presentation position.
- As discussed above, position factors can be used to determine position adjusted sponsor values. The position adjusted sponsor values can be used to determine an aggregate sponsor value for each of the candidate configurations, and the candidate configuration having the highest aggregate sponsor value can be used to determine a number of content items that will be provided in response to the content item request.
- For purposes of example, assume the content item request specifies that up to three content items can be presented in the content item slot for which content items are being requested. In this example, the candidate configurations can include a first configuration in which only a single content item is presented, a second configuration in which two content items are presented, and a third configuration in which three content items are presented in the content item slot. Further assume that Table 1 (below) lists the three content sponsors having the three highest sponsor values with respect to the current content item request.
-
TABLE 1 Content Sponsor Sponsor value 1 2.00 2 1.75 3 1.25 - In this example, the efficiency of each candidate configuration can be determined as provided in Table 2, where SVi*PFi is the position adjusted sponsor value for content sponsor (i).
-
TABLE 2 Number of Presentation Positions in Configuration (j) Content Sponsor (CS) Assigned to Each Presentation Position (i) Position Factors (PF) Configuration Efficiency 1 Pos. 1 = CS 1Pos. 1 = 1.5 2.0*1.5 = 3.0 2 Pos. 1 = CS 1Pos. 1 = 1.1 (2.0*1.1) + (1.75*0.7) = 3.425 Pos. 2 = CS 2Pos. 2 = 0.7 3 Pos. 1 = CS 1Pos. 1 = 0.6 (2.0*0.6) + (1.75*0.2) + Pos. 2 = CS 2Pos. 2 = 0.2 (1.25*0.2) = 1.8 Pos. 3 = CS 3Pos. 3 = 0.2 - As presented in Table 2, the configuration in which
content sponsor 1 is assigned the first presentation position (Pos. 1) andcontent sponsor 2 is assigned the second presentation position (Pos. 2) is associated with a highest efficiency. Therefore, in this example, two content items will be selected for presentation in response to the content item request. - One or more of the content sponsors are selected to provide a content item in response to the content item request (312). In some implementations, the content sponsors associated with the highest sponsor values are selected to provide a content item in response to the request. As illustrated above,
content sponsor 1 andcontent sponsor 2 are associated with the two highest sponsor values, and therefore, will be selected to provide the two content items in response to the content item request. In some implementations, the presentation positions that are assigned to each of the content sponsors can be based, at least in part, on the sponsor values of the content sponsors. For example, a content sponsor having a highest sponsor value can be assigned to a highest performing presentation position, and each next highest performing presentation position can be assigned to the content sponsor with the next highest sponsor value. - A price that will be charged for distribution of the one or more content items for the one or more content sponsors is determined (314). Generally, as described in more detail with reference to
FIG. 4 , the price paid by a particular content sponsor can be determined based on trigger prices at which the selected configuration of content items would change if the particular content sponsor lowered its bid to that price. For purposes of illustration, if there are m trigger prices that would cause a configuration change, (e.g., pi,1, . . . , pi,m, where pi,1>pi,2> . . . >pi,m), then these m trigger prices can be utilized to determine the price that the particular content sponsor will pay for distribution of their content items. For example, the price that the content sponsor will pay can be a performance weighted average of these m trigger prices. In a particular example, the price can be determined using relationship (7). -
- where,
- Pcpc is the price per click that the content sponsor (i) will be charged;
- si,1 is the position factor when the bid for content sponsor (i) is greater than pi,1;
- xi,j is the position factor when the bid for content sponsor (i) is between pi,j−1 and pi,j; xi,m+1=0 and
- qi is the quality score for content sponsor (i).
-
FIG. 4 is a flow chart of anexample process 400 for determining a price to be charged for distribution of a content item. Theprocess 400 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus, such as thedistribution management apparatus 120 and/or thecontent distribution system 110 ofFIG. 1 . Operations of theprocess 400 can be implemented by execution of instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium and that cause one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations of theprocess 400. - A bid that was used to select the content item for presentation at a first presentation position is identified (402). The first presentation position can be one of multiple different presentation positions that are available in a content item slot. In some implementations, the bid that was used to select the content item for presentation at the first presentation position is a first value, or a quality-adjusted value, corresponding to the bid submitted by the content sponsor associated with the content item. For example, the bid used to select the content item can be a maximum bid submitted (or selected) by the content sponsor, or a value resulting from a product of the maximum bid and a quality measure (e.g., quality score) corresponding to the content sponsor.
- For purposes of illustration, assume that Content Sponsor A submitted a bid having a value of $2.00, and Content Sponsor B submitted a bid of $1.50. Further assume, for purposes of this example, that there are two available presentation positions, and that these bids result in Content Sponsor A and Content Sponsor B being assigned to the two presentation positions (e.g., with Content Sponsor A being assigned a highest performing presentation position for having a higher sponsor value). Thus, in this example, the bid of $2.00 can be identified as the bid that was used to select a content item from Content Sponsor A for presentation in the highest performing presentation position, and the bid of $1.50 can be identified as the bid that was used to select a content item from Content Sponsor B in the second highest performing presentation position.
- First performance data for the content item at the first presentation position is obtained (404). In some implementations, the first performance data specifies a measure of user interactions that the content item is expected to receive (referred to as an “expected performance” or “estimated performance”) when presented at the first presentation position. For example, the first performance data can include a total number of clicks (or other user interactions) that the content item is expected to receive over a specified period of time (e.g., when presented at the first presentation position), a click-through rate (or interaction rate) that the content item is expected to experience when presented at the first presentation position, or another measure of performance. The first performance data can be obtained from a data store storing the performance data.
- In some implementations, the expected performance specified by the first performance data is determined based on historical performance of the content item, historical performance of any or all content items presented at the first presentation position, and/or a position factor for the first presentation position. For example, the expected performance can be based on a number of user interactions that the content item received when previously presented at the first presentation position (e.g., over a specified period or number of impressions), a click-through rate of the content item when presented at the first presentation position, and/or a click-through rate of all content items presented in the first presentation position. For purposes of example, assume that the first performance data for the content item provided by Content Sponsor A specifies that the content item is expected to receive 3 clicks over a set of 100 impressions.
- A lower value of the bid that will result in a sponsor value that causes the content item being presented at a different presentation position is identified (406). In some implementations, the lower value is a value at which the content item will be presented in a lower performing presentation position. The lower value can be determined, for example, by lowering the value of the bid associated with the content item until the sponsor value of the content item falls below the next highest sponsor value associated with another content item that is available for presentation. The sponsor values associated with the content item and the other content item can be determined based on bid values, cumulative distribution functions, and probability density functions, as described above.
- Continuing with the example above, the lower value for the bid associated with Content Sponsor A can be determined by iteratively lowering the value of the bid associated with Content Sponsor A until Content Sponsor A's sponsor value meets, or is lower than, the sponsor value of Content Sponsor B (e.g., the sponsor value that is computed for Content Sponsor B based on the bid value of $1.50). Assume for purposes of this example that the bid value at which the sponsor value of Content Sponsor A falls below the sponsor value of Content Sponsor B is at a value of $1.60. Thus, in this example, the identified lower value of the bid can be $1.60.
- Second performance data for the content item at the second presentation position is obtained (408). The second performance data for the content item at the second presentation position can specify an expected performance of the content item when presented at the second presentation position. The second performance data can be obtained and/or determined in a manner similar to that described above with respect to obtaining the first performance data (404). For example, the second performance data can be obtained from a data store storing the second performance data. The expected performance specified by the second performance data can be determined based, at least in part on the historical performance of the content item, the historical performance of the content item and/or other content items when presented at the second presentation position, and/or based on a position factor for the second presentation position.
- Continuing with the example above, assume that the second performance data for the content item provided by Content Sponsor A specifies that the content item is expected to receive 1 click over a set of 100 impressions when presented at the second presentation position.
- A determination is made whether there are additional lower presentation positions at which the content item could be presented (410). In some implementations, the determination of whether there are additional lower presentation positions can be made by comparing the current number of presentation positions to the maximum number of presentation positions for the content item slot (e.g., as indicated by a content item request). If the current number of presentation positions is less than the maximum number of presentation positions, then there may be additional lower presentation positions in which the content item can be presented.
- In some implementations, the determination of whether there are additional lower presentation positions can also be based on an evaluation of the number of content items that would be selected for presentation as the bid for the content item is lowered. For example, as discussed above, the number of content items selected for presentation is based on the efficiency associated with the various numbers of content items that can be selected. Thus, even if the maximum number of presentation positions is higher than the current number of presentation positions, an additional lower presentation position may not be available if the efficiency associated with presentation of a content item in that additional lower presentation position is less than the efficiency associated with a configuration that does not include presentation of a content item in the lower presentation position.
- If additional lower presentation positions are available, an additional lower value is identified (406), and performance data associated with the additional lower presentation position is obtained. The determination of whether there are additional lower presentation positions, and the obtaining of performance data can continue until there are no lower presentation positions to evaluate.
- If there are no additional lower presentation positions to evaluate, a final lower value that results in a sponsor value at which the content item will no longer be presented is identified (412). The final lower value can be identified in a manner similar to that described above with respect to operation (406). For example, the lower value at which the content item will no longer be associated with one of the top X sponsor values (where X is the number of presentation positions that are being used to present content items), and therefore not selected for presentation, can be identified. Since the final lower value can generally be the value at which the content item will no longer be selected for presentation, the performance data corresponding to the final lower value can specify an expected performance of zero.
- A price that will be charged is determined based on the lower values and the differences between the expected performance specified by the performance data (414). For example, the price that will be charged can be a performance weighted average of the lower prices (e.g., lower prices identified at
operation 406 and the final lower price identified at operation 412). The weight of each lower price can be a difference between the estimated performance of the content item at the lower presentation position corresponding to the lower price and the estimated performance of the content item at the next highest presentation position. - For example, assume that Table 3 (below) specifies various bid values at which the selection content item configuration will change, the presentation position that will be occupied by the content item at that bid value, and the estimated performance (e.g., number of clicks) for a content item at various presentation positions.
-
TABLE 3 Presentation Number Bid Value Position of Clicks 2.00 (current bid) 1 3 1.60 2 1 1.00 None 0 Price = ($1.60 * (3-1) + 1.00 * (1-0))/3 = $1.40 - In this example, the performance weighted average of the bid values that will cause a configuration change (e.g., $1.60 and $1.00) results in a price of $1.40 cost per click. Thus, the content sponsor in this example can be charged a price of $1.40 CPC for presentation in the first presentation position.
