Abstract
When an electronic message with a voicemail attachment is received, an audio player object and a reply by chat object are displayed simultaneously along with the electronic message. A reply to the electronic message, whether by chat or by email, is associated with the same thread as the electronic message. The electronic message with the voicemail attachment is associated with a conversation thread that may also include chat messages and email messages. In a conversation view of a respective conversation thread, representations of an electronic voicemail message (an electronic message having a voicemail attachment), one or more chat messages and one or more email messages may be displayed simultaneously.

Through the web-based interface, a user can interact with the electronic messaging system 104 and utilize its services, such as sending, receiving, and viewing electronic messages. Email systems that utilize a web-based interface are sometimes called webmail or web-based email. The web-based interface may be implemented using well-known technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and so forth.
[0018] The voice communications system 106 provides voice communications services. The voice communications system 106 may include one or more voice communications servers 600, further details of which are described below in FIG. 6. The voice communications system 106 receives voice data (or more generally, audio data) from other computers and converts the audio data into digital audio data. In some embodiments, the voice communications system 106 encodes and compresses the voice data into a digital audio file (sometimes called a digital audio data file or audio data file) using the MP3 encoding standard. In some other embodiments, other encoding and compression standards or audio file formats, whether lossy or lossless, may be used. Examples include waveform audio (.wav), Advanced Audio Coding (.aac), and Windows Media Audio (.wma) formats.
The voice communications system 106 may also send the digital audio to other computers or systems. In some embodiments, the voice communications system 106 sends the digital audio to other computers or systems, such as the electronic messaging system 104, as attachments to electronic messages.

Examples of client applications that can send audio data to the voice communications system 106 include voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications, voice chat applications, or instant messaging applications with voice communications modules.
[0020] In some embodiments, the voice communications system 106 may be a part of a communications system that includes presence information, i.e. information regarding whether a person is online, offline, busy, etc. If a person is online, a user may communicate with the person in real time or near-real time, akin to a phone call. If a person is offline, busy, or otherwise not responding, a user may leave a voicemail message, as a digital audio file, for the person.
[0021] It should be appreciated that while the embodiments disclosed in this specification are described in the context of voice communications, voicemails, and audio data files that represent voicemails, the embodiments may be adapted for use with audio data generally. That is, the embodiments may be adapted for use with audio data that does not include voice data, or audio data that includes both voice data and other sounds. The term "voicemail message" is used in this document to mean audio data, which may be stored, for example, in an audio data file, that contains a voicemail. The term "electronic voicemail message" is used in this document to mean an electronic message that contains or is associated with audio data that contains a voicemail message.
[0022] Attention is now directed to FIG. 2, which is a flow diagram illustrating a process for 200 for associating both an electronic message that has an associated digital audio file and a reply to the electronic message with the same thread in accordance with some embodiments. An electronic message is received, wherein the electronic message is associated with audio data (e.g., an audio data file), which may be a voicemail, and both the electronic message and the audio data are associated with the same conversation thread (202).
For example, the audio data file may be an attachment to the electronic message, and the conversation thread to which the electronic message is assigned is also the conversation thread associated with the attached audio data file. In some embodiments, each distinct conversation thread has a distinct conversation ID or identifier. All the messages assigned to or associated with a conversation thread are assigned or associated with the same conversation ID.
For example, the audio data file may be an attachment to the electronic message, and the conversation thread to which the electronic message is assigned is also the conversation thread associated with the attached audio data file. In some embodiments, each distinct conversation thread has a distinct conversation ID or identifier. All the messages assigned to or associated with a conversation thread are assigned or associated with the same conversation ID.
[0023] A request from a client to open the electronic message is received (204). The electronic message, an audio player object, and a chat reply object are transmitted to the client (206). A reply to the electronic message is received from the client (208). The received reply is associated with the same conversation thread as the electronic message and the audio data file (210).
[0024] Attention is now directed to FIG. 3, which is a flow diagram illustrating a process flow 300 for displaying an audio player and a chat reply object with an electronic message in accordance with some embodiments. An electronic message is received at a client, wherein the electronic message is associated with a digital audio file (302). The electronic message is displayed simultaneously with an audio player object for playing the digital audio file and a chat reply object (304).
[0025] While the items described above are displayed, a user of the client may select the chat reply object. After user selection of the chat reply object, a reply chat session is initiated (306). In some embodiments, the session is initiated by opening a new chat window.
The chat session is configured to be a reply to the electronic message and the audio file.
The chat session is configured to be a reply to the electronic message and the audio file.
[0026] Attention is now directed to FIGs. 4A-4G, which illustrate exemplary graphical user interfaces for displaying an audio player object and a chat reply object with an electronic message in accordance with some embodiments. FIGs. 4A-4G
illustrates graphical user interfaces of a webmail application rendered in a web browser. The webmail application interface 400 may include a search box 402 for searching emails (or, alternately, for searching all electronic messages in a user's account) and a listing of folders or other organizational units 403, such as an inbox, trash, spam, sent messages, and so forth. In some embodiments, the interface 400 also includes a list of chat contacts 405. The list of chat contacts 405 shows the presence information for the contacts in the list.

In some embodiments, the interface 400 also includes a list of chat contacts 405. The list of chat contacts 405 shows the presence information for the contacts in the list.
[0027] The interface 400 includes a list of conversation threads 404 (also variously called "threads" and "conversations"). The list of conversation threads 404 includes a list of conversations in the folder or other organizational unit that the user has selected. Each item in the list 404 is a compressed representation of a respective conversation thread. For example, if the user has selected the inbox from the folder list 403, the list of threads 4041ists the conversations in the inbox. Some of the conversation threads in the list of threads may include electronic messages that have voicemail attachments. In some cases, these threads 406 and 408 may include a subject name that indicates the conversation thread includes a voicemail, the sender of the voicemail, and a length of the voicemail.
Additionally, as shown in FIG. 4A, a phone icon 410 may be shown in the compressed representation of a respective thread 406 or 408 to indicate that the thread includes a voicemail attachment.
Additionally, as shown in FIG. 4A, a phone icon 410 may be shown in the compressed representation of a respective thread 406 or 408 to indicate that the thread includes a voicemail attachment.
[0028] When the user selects a thread, the interface 400 displays the thread view 412 (also sometimes called the conversation view) for the user selected thread, as shown in FIG.
4B. In some embodiments, when the thread includes a voicemail attachment, the thread view 412 includes an audio player object, which includes a playback/pause object, a playback progress object and a volume control object. In the embodiment shown in FIG.
4B, the thread view 412 includes a playback/pause button 415, a progress slider 416 and a volume slider 418. The thread view 412 may also include an image associated with the sender of the voicemail, if one is available. If an image associated with the sender is not available, a generic silhouette of a person may be displayed instead. In some embodiments, the thread view 412 includes a link 420 (or more generally an object) to open the audio player object in a new window and a link 422 (or more generally an object) to download the voicemail attachment may also be included.

4B, the thread view 412 includes a playback/pause button 415, a progress slider 416 and a volume slider 418. The thread view 412 may also include an image associated with the sender of the voicemail, if one is available. If an image associated with the sender is not available, a generic silhouette of a person may be displayed instead. In some embodiments, the thread view 412 includes a link 420 (or more generally an object) to open the audio player object in a new window and a link 422 (or more generally an object) to download the voicemail attachment may also be included.
[0029] The thread view 412 may also include one or more reply objects. In some embodiments, the reply objects may include any combination of the following: a link 424 to start a reply message, a link 426 to start a message forwarding message, a link 428 (a chat link or chat reply object) to open a window for a chat session with the sender, and a reply box 430 for composing or entering a reply message. If the user selects the chat link 428, a chat window 432 opens. See FIG. 4C. Via the chat window, the user and the sender can engage in a chat session, sometimes called an instant messaging session. In some embodiments, when that chat session is ended, a transcript of the chat session is saved (as one or more electronic messages) and associated with the same conversation thread as the voicemail. As shown in FIG. 4D, when the user views the thread later, the thread view 412 includes the transcript 434 of the chat session.
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 4B and FIG. 4E, if the user selects the reply link 424 (FIG. 4B), a reply interface 436 (FIG. 4E) may be shown on the client device.
In the reply interface 436, the user can edit the list of recipients for the reply message and enter (e.g., compose and/or edit) a reply message. When the user sends the reply message, the reply message is saved and associated with the same conversation thread as the electronic voicemail message and the initial message. As shown in FIG. 4F, when the same conversation thread is selected for viewing later, the thread view 412 displays the reply along with other messages in the thread, including the message with the voicemail attachment.
In the reply interface 436, the user can edit the list of recipients for the reply message and enter (e.g., compose and/or edit) a reply message. When the user sends the reply message, the reply message is saved and associated with the same conversation thread as the electronic voicemail message and the initial message. As shown in FIG. 4F, when the same conversation thread is selected for viewing later, the thread view 412 displays the reply along with other messages in the thread, including the message with the voicemail attachment.
[0031] In some embodiments, the thread view 412 may display the body of only the most recent message in the thread, as shown in FIG. 4G; while displaying a compressed representation of the other messages in the thread. The compressed representation of a message in the thread may include information such as subject and date/time, and may optionally also indicate the sender of the message. The compressed representation of a respective electronic voicemail message (see FIG. 4G) includes the voicemail icon 410 (FIG.
4B). User selection of the compressed presentation of a respective message in the conversation thread, for example by clicking on the compressed presentation, causes the user device to redisplay the conversation thread with the user selected message being displayed in an expanded (e.g., full text) representation. When the user selected message (i.e., a user selected compressed representation of a message) is an electronic voicemail message, the expanded representation of the electronic voicemail message includes the audio player object, as shown in FIGs. 4D, 4E and 4F. If the user selects the forward link 426 (FIG. 4B), a forwarding interface that resembles the reply interface 436 may be shown. In the forwarding interface, the user can edit the list of recipients for the forward message and edit the forward message.
4B). User selection of the compressed presentation of a respective message in the conversation thread, for example by clicking on the compressed presentation, causes the user device to redisplay the conversation thread with the user selected message being displayed in an expanded (e.g., full text) representation. When the user selected message (i.e., a user selected compressed representation of a message) is an electronic voicemail message, the expanded representation of the electronic voicemail message includes the audio player object, as shown in FIGs. 4D, 4E and 4F. If the user selects the forward link 426 (FIG. 4B), a forwarding interface that resembles the reply interface 436 may be shown. In the forwarding interface, the user can edit the list of recipients for the forward message and edit the forward message.
[0032] As described above, a voicemail may be delivered as an attachment to an electronic message such as an email. In some embodiments, the electronic message to which the voicemail is attached, as generated by a voice communications system 106, may include a special tag or identifier tagging the electronic message as one with a voicemail attachment.
Directing attention now to FIG. 5, the electronic voicemail message data structure 500 may include an voicemail tag or identifier 502 that identifies the message as having a voicemail attachment (i.e., an audio data attachment that contains a voicemail message).
The voicemail tag 502 is included in the electronic message data 504, which also includes the headers 506 and the body 508 of the electronic message. The data structure 500 also includes the attachment audio file 506. The voicemail tag 502 is one of several types of metadata that may be included in or otherwise associated with an electronic message. Labels, including labels automatically assigned by the electronic messaging system (e.g., "Inbox") and/or user assigned labels (e.g., "vacation", or "work"), are another type of metadata that may be included in or otherwise associated with an electronic message.

Labels, including labels automatically assigned by the electronic messaging system (e.g., "Inbox") and/or user assigned labels (e.g., "vacation", or "work"), are another type of metadata that may be included in or otherwise associated with an electronic message.
[0033] The tag 502 tags the particular electronic message to which the tag is added as one that includes a voicemail attachment. Such electronic messages are sometimes herein called electronic voicemail messages. When an electronic messaging system 104 receives an electronic message with the tag 502 (i.e., an electronic voicemail message), the electronic messaging system 104 may treat the message specially. In some embodiments, the special treatment includes indexing the message such that it is searchable as a voicemail or audio message. In some embodiments, another special operation performed for messages with a voicemail tag 502 is sending an audio player object along with the message when the message is delivered to a client for display or opening. In some embodiments, if the same electronic message and voicemail attachment is included later in a reply or forwarding message, the voicemail tag 502 is not included in the reply or forwarding message, because the original recipient of the electronic voicemail message is not the user to whom the reply or forwarding message is being sent. In these embodiments, the reply or forwarding message, even though it includes the original message with the voicemail, is treated as a normal electronic message that happens to have an audio file attachment.
[0034] FIG. 5B illustrates an exemplary user database 520, identifying the users of an electronic messaging system. The user database 520 may contain a User ID 522 that references a full text and attributes index 524 associated with a particular user. The index 524 maps terms and message attributes to messages in a message database 530. A
particular Message ID 526 may be associated with a particular Conversation ID 532 in a Message to Conversation Map 5304. Each entry in Message to Conversation Map 534 associates (i.e., maps) a Message ID 526 to a Conversation ID 532. In some embodiments, the Conversation ID 532 is an n-bit number. This number uniquely identifies the particular conversation to which the message identified by Message ID 526 belongs. In these embodiments, every conversation in a user's electronic messages account has a distinct Conversation ID.

In these embodiments, every conversation in a user's electronic messages account has a distinct Conversation ID.
[0035] To identify the other messages associated with a particular conversation, a User Conversation Database 538 may be used. Such a database might be used, for example, when identifying the remainder of the messages included in a conversation where one or more messages had matched a particular search query. The User Conversation Database 538 includes a number of Conversation Entries 540. Each Conversation Entry 540 stores a list of the messages (or other data structure representing the messages) associated with the conversation. All of the messages associated with a respective conversation have the same Conversation ID. The set of messages assigned or associated with a respective Conversation ID may include one or more email messages, one or more chat messages, and one or more electronic voicemail messages, all in the same conversation.
[0036] As shown in FIG. 513, a Conversation Entry 542 may include a linked list of message entries 546, each message entry corresponding to a particular message in the conversation. The linked list might be ordered by, for example, date/time values associated with the messages in the conversation. An exemplary message entry 546 includes the Message ID 526, Header 548, and Metadata 550 of a particular message. The Header 548 may contain all or a portion of a message's header information. The Metadata 550 may contain information identifying certain attributes associated with the message. For example, in some embodiments the Metadata 550 of a message identifies the labels (e.g., labels automatically assigned by the electronic message system and/or user defined labels) or message folders associated with the message. In some embodiments, the Metadata 550 also indicates whether a voicemail tag 502 has been associated with the message.
The Message ID(4) 526 of a particular entry 552 may be associated with a particular message in the Message Database 530. In some embodiments, the message entry 546 does not include the content of the body of the corresponding message 560.
The Message ID(4) 526 of a particular entry 552 may be associated with a particular message in the Message Database 530. In some embodiments, the message entry 546 does not include the content of the body of the corresponding message 560.
[0037] In some embodiments, the information in the index 524 and the information in a Conversation Entry 542 may be used to assist in associating a new message (e.g., an email message, an electronic voicemail message or a chat message) with a particular conversation, without accessing the Message database 530. Once a conversation has been associated with a new message, attributes identified in the metadata 550 of the message entries for the identified conversation can be applied to the new message, without having to retrieve any messages from the message database.
