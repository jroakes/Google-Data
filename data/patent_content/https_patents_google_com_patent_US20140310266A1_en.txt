- a multi-location search may enable a user to provide a first location, a second location and a search topic, and receive search results that are responsive to the search topic and that correspond to places located between the first and second locations, or at least approximately the same distance or travel time from each of these locations. Such a multi-location search may be useful for suggesting a place for people to meet.
- the multi-location search includes (1) receiving a multi-location search query, including the following: (a) a first geographic location, (b) a second geographic location, and (c) a search topic; (2) identifying one or more intermediate locations having an approximately equal travel time from the first and second geographic locations; (3) identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic, (4) ranking the search results based at least in part on proximity of the locations associated with the search results to the one or more intermediate locations to generate a ranked set of search results, and (5) providing the set of ranked search results (i.e., the suggested places to meet) for display to the user.

- FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 100 of employing a multi-location search to suggest a meeting place in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- Method 100 may include receiving a multi-location search query (block 102 ).
- the multi-location search query includes multiple geographic locations and a search topic. For example, a user may visit a multi-location webpage (e.g., similar to multi-location search webpage 200 depicted in FIG.
- a multi-location search query that specifies a first location of “111 8 th Avenue” (e.g., a current location of the person submitting the search), a second location of “Grand Central Station” (e.g., a current location of the person they are meeting), and a search topic of “Italian restaurant” (e.g., based on the two wanting to meet at an Italian restaurant).
- Method 100 may include identifying intermediate locations (block 104 ).
- identifying intermediate locations includes identifying one or more locations that are located approximately the same travel time and/or distance from the two locations. Travel times may be estimated based on various travel conditions, such as distance, speed limits, traffic, available modes of transportation, and so forth.
- identifying intermediate locations includes identifying a set of geographic points (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) that are approximately the same travel time and/or distance from the two locations. In some embodiments, the points may be identified with a given level of granularity, e.g., in 0.25 km increments.
- identifying intermediate locations includes identifying geographic cells (or tiles) that bound regions that are approximately the same travel time and/or distance from the two locations.
- the intermediate locations may include, for example, a cell that includes Times Square in New York City, a cell that includes the Garment District in New York City, the Flatiron District in New York City, and so forth—each having an approximate travel time of about five min from both “111 8 th Avenue” and “Grand Central Station.”
- the travel time and/or distance from the first or second locations to a cell may be determined based on travel to a centroid of the cell. For example, where a centroid of the cell including Times Square is located at Broadway and West 42 nd Street, the travel time and/or distance from “111 8 th Avenue” and “Grand Central Station”, may be calculated from Broadway and West 42 nd Street to the respective locations.
- Method 100 may include identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic (block 106 ).
- identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic may include identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic “Italian restaurant”.
- the set of search results is identified by querying a search index for places that are categorized as an Italian restaurant.
- the set of results may include, for example, Italian restaurants located in New York (e.g., “NYC Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “The Italian Restaurant”, “Times Square Pizza”, and so forth) as well as other locations (e.g., Italian restaurants in New Jersey, Brooklyn, and so forth).
- the set of search results may include a raw-unranked list of search results.
- identifying a set of search results may include identifying search results that are responsive to the search topic and to at least one of the identified intermediate locations (e.g., that are less than a predetermined distance from the intermediate location).
- Method 100 may include ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the intermediate locations (block 108 ).
- ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the intermediate locations includes scoring/ranking the search results based on proximity to the intermediate locations. For example, a search result for a place located in the same cell as an intermediate location (or within a short distance of the centroid of that cell) may receive a boost in score/rank (based on proximity to an intermediate location) than a search result for a place located outside of the identified cell or a greater distance away from a centroid of the identified cell.
- ranking the set of search results includes ranking the search results based on proximity of a place/location associated with the search result to the two locations.
- Proximity can be measured by net distance to the locations identified in the multi-location search, or net travel time to the locations identified in the multi-location search. For example, a search result for a place having a total travel time of nine minutes (e.g., a five minute travel time from the first location and a four minute travel time from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on net travel time proximity) than a search result for a place having total travel time of fifteen minutes.
- a search result for a place having a total travel distance of five miles may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on net travel distance proximity) than a search result for a place having total travel time of ten miles.
- ranking the set of search results includes ranking the search results based on a travel imbalance, where a travel imbalance represents a difference in travel times or distances between the search result location and each of the locations identified in the multi-location search. For example, a search result for a place having a travel imbalance of one minute (e.g., a five minute travel time from the first location and a four minute travel time from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on travel time imbalance) than a search result for a place having a travel imbalance of five minutes.
- a travel imbalance represents a difference in travel times or distances between the search result location and each of the locations identified in the multi-location search. For example, a search result for a place having a travel imbalance of one minute (e.g., a five minute travel time from the first location and a four minute travel time from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on travel time imbalance) than a search result for a place having a travel imbalance of five minutes.
- a search result for a place having a total travel distance imbalance of one mile may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on travel distance imbalance) than a search result for a place having a travel distance imbalance of five miles.
- ranking the set of search results includes ranking the search results based on relevancy. For example, a search result for a place that is an Italian restaurant may receive a greater boost in score/rank than a place that is a pizza parlor. As a further example, a search result for a place that has favorable user reviews may receive a greater boost in score/rank than a place that has unfavorable user reviews.
- ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the intermediate locations includes generating a composite score for the search results and ranking the results relative to one another based on their composite scores. For example, a composite score for each of “NYC Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “The Italian Restaurant”, “Times Square Pizza”, and so forth may be generated by determining and adding scores in one or more of the applicable scoring categories (e.g., categories of proximity to an intermediate location, net travel time/net travel distance proximity, travel time/travel distance imbalance, and relevance) and/or applying corresponding scoring multipliers for one or more of the applicable scoring categories to a baseline score for the search results.
- the applicable scoring categories e.g., categories of proximity to an intermediate location, net travel time/net travel distance proximity, travel time/travel distance imbalance, and relevance
- a composite score for a search result can be computed by multiplying a relevance score by a distance imbalance score, or by dividing the relevance score by the net travel time score, or by multiplying the relevance score by the distance imbalance score and dividing by the net travel time score.
- composite scores are determined for each of the search results, they can be ranked.
- the search results may be ranked in the order of “The Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “NYC Italian Restaurant”, and “Times Square Pizza” based on respective composite scores of eight, six, five, and two.
- Method 100 may include providing the ranked set of search results for display (block 110 ).
- the ranked set of search results may be referred to as “suggested meeting locations” based on the first and second location and the search topic.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a search results webpage 200 that includes suggested meeting locations 202 .
- the suggested meeting locations 202 correspond to the three highest ranked search results of the exemplary set of ranked search results discussed with regard to block 108 .
- Webpage 200 also includes a map 203 having markers corresponding to the first and second locations (e.g., markers “1” and “2”), as well as markers corresponding to the suggested meeting locations (e.g., markers “A”, “B” and “C”).
- the meeting locations 202 may be identified and displayed in response to the user providing the first location in field 204 , the second location in field 206 and the query topic in field 208 , and selecting the search button.
- method 100 may provide a set of suggested meeting locations (e.g., “The Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “NYC Italian Restaurant”) based at least in part on multiple locations and a search topic provided by a user.

Abstract
Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- Embodiments of this invention relate generally to search industries and, more particularly, to special purpose machines, systems, methods and computer instructions for suggesting places to meet.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- Persons often employ searches to locate nearby businesses or other locations of interest. For example a person may search for “restaurant” in hopes of finding a nearby restaurant. In some instances, a person may provide additional search information, such as a particular location, in an effort to narrow their search. For example, a person in New York City may search for “new york city restaurants” in hopes of finding restaurants that are located in New York City. Although this traditional searching technique may provide a suitable set of results relating to a location of interest, it may not provide a reliable option for users searching for a meeting place between multiple locations. For example, if two people located across town from one another want to meet for dinner, one of them may submit a search for “restaurant” using a traditional search environment, and then sift through the search results to find a location that seems to be a good meeting place. Although a meeting place can be located in this manner, it requires a substantial amount of effort and may not help the user to find a meeting place that is convenient to both persons. For example, where the person searching selects a location that appears to be at a mid-point between the two persons' locations, the travel times from each of the locations may be considerably different, requiring one of them to travel a great deal longer than the other.
- Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for suggesting a meeting place based on two or more locations. In some embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method that includes receiving, via a user device, a first geographic location, a second geographic location, and a search topic, identifying, by one or more processors, an intermediary intermediate location having an approximately equal travel time from between the first and second geographic locations, wherein at least one of the travel times or the travel distances from the intermediate location to each of the first and second locations are approximately equal, identifying, by the one or more processors, a set of search results responsive to the search topic, wherein each search result is associated with a location that is within a predetermined distance of the intermediate location, ranking, by the one or more processors, each of the search results based at least in part on proximity of the locations associated with the search results to the intermediary location to generate a ranked set of search results, and providing the set of ranked search results for display via the user device.
- In some embodiments, provided is a system including one or more memories storing instructions and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and configured to execute the instructions stored thereon to cause the following steps: receiving a first geographic location, a second geographic location, and a search topic, identifying an intermediate location between the first and second geographic locations, wherein at least one of the travel times or the travel distances from the intermediate location to each of the first and second locations are approximately equal, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic, wherein each search result is associated with a location that is within a predetermined distance of the intermediate location, ranking each of the search results based at least in part on the location associated with the search result, and providing the set of ranked search results for display.
- In some embodiments, provided is a non-transitory computer readable medium having program instructions stored thereon that are executable by a processor to cause the following steps: receiving a first geographic location, a second geographic location, and a search topic, identifying an intermediate location between the first and second geographic locations, wherein at least one of the travel times or the travel distances from the intermediate location to each of the first and second locations are approximately equal, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic, wherein each search result is associated with a location that is within a predetermined distance of the intermediate location, ranking each of the search results based at least in part on the location associated with the search result, and providing the set of ranked search results for display.

FIG. 3 is a block diagram that illustrates a search query environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. - As discussed in more detail below, provided are systems and methods for suggesting a meeting place based on two or more locations, referred to herein as a multi-location search. A multi-location search may enable a user to provide a first location, a second location and a search topic, and receive search results that are responsive to the search topic and that correspond to places located between the first and second locations, or at least approximately the same distance or travel time from each of these locations. Such a multi-location search may be useful for suggesting a place for people to meet. For example, if two people want to meet for dinner and they are located across town from one another, one of them could submit a multi-location search for “restaurant” along with each of their locations, and the multi-location search would return results for restaurants in locations having approximately the same travel times from each of their locations.
- In some embodiments, the multi-location search includes (1) receiving a multi-location search query, including the following: (a) a first geographic location, (b) a second geographic location, and (c) a search topic; (2) identifying one or more intermediate locations having an approximately equal travel time from the first and second geographic locations; (3) identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic, (4) ranking the search results based at least in part on proximity of the locations associated with the search results to the one or more intermediate locations to generate a ranked set of search results, and (5) providing the set of ranked search results (i.e., the suggested places to meet) for display to the user.
-
FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates amethod 100 of employing a multi-location search to suggest a meeting place in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.Method 100 may include receiving a multi-location search query (block 102). In some embodiments, the multi-location search query includes multiple geographic locations and a search topic. For example, a user may visit a multi-location webpage (e.g., similar tomulti-location search webpage 200 depicted inFIG. 2 ) and submit a multi-location search query that specifies a first location of “111 8th Avenue” (e.g., a current location of the person submitting the search), a second location of “Grand Central Station” (e.g., a current location of the person they are meeting), and a search topic of “Italian restaurant” (e.g., based on the two wanting to meet at an Italian restaurant). -
Method 100 may include identifying intermediate locations (block 104). In some embodiments, identifying intermediate locations includes identifying one or more locations that are located approximately the same travel time and/or distance from the two locations. Travel times may be estimated based on various travel conditions, such as distance, speed limits, traffic, available modes of transportation, and so forth. In some embodiments, identifying intermediate locations includes identifying a set of geographic points (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) that are approximately the same travel time and/or distance from the two locations. In some embodiments, the points may be identified with a given level of granularity, e.g., in 0.25 km increments. In some embodiments, identifying intermediate locations includes identifying geographic cells (or tiles) that bound regions that are approximately the same travel time and/or distance from the two locations. In accordance with the example provided above, the intermediate locations may include, for example, a cell that includes Times Square in New York City, a cell that includes the Garment District in New York City, the Flatiron District in New York City, and so forth—each having an approximate travel time of about five min from both “111 8th Avenue” and “Grand Central Station.” In some instances, the travel time and/or distance from the first or second locations to a cell may be determined based on travel to a centroid of the cell. For example, where a centroid of the cell including Times Square is located at Broadway and West 42nd Street, the travel time and/or distance from “111 8th Avenue” and “Grand Central Station”, may be calculated from Broadway and West 42nd Street to the respective locations. -
Method 100 may include identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic (block 106). In accordance with the example provided above, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic may include identifying a set of search results responsive to the search topic “Italian restaurant”. In some embodiments, the set of search results is identified by querying a search index for places that are categorized as an Italian restaurant. The set of results may include, for example, Italian restaurants located in New York (e.g., “NYC Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “The Italian Restaurant”, “Times Square Pizza”, and so forth) as well as other locations (e.g., Italian restaurants in New Jersey, Brooklyn, and so forth). At this point, the set of search results may include a raw-unranked list of search results. In some embodiments, identifying a set of search results may include identifying search results that are responsive to the search topic and to at least one of the identified intermediate locations (e.g., that are less than a predetermined distance from the intermediate location). -
Method 100 may include ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the intermediate locations (block 108). In some embodiments, ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the intermediate locations includes scoring/ranking the search results based on proximity to the intermediate locations. For example, a search result for a place located in the same cell as an intermediate location (or within a short distance of the centroid of that cell) may receive a boost in score/rank (based on proximity to an intermediate location) than a search result for a place located outside of the identified cell or a greater distance away from a centroid of the identified cell. - In some embodiments, ranking the set of search results includes ranking the search results based on proximity of a place/location associated with the search result to the two locations. Proximity can be measured by net distance to the locations identified in the multi-location search, or net travel time to the locations identified in the multi-location search. For example, a search result for a place having a total travel time of nine minutes (e.g., a five minute travel time from the first location and a four minute travel time from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on net travel time proximity) than a search result for a place having total travel time of fifteen minutes. As a further example, a search result for a place having a total travel distance of five miles (e.g., a two mile travel distance from the first location and a three mile travel distance from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on net travel distance proximity) than a search result for a place having total travel time of ten miles.
- In some embodiments, ranking the set of search results includes ranking the search results based on a travel imbalance, where a travel imbalance represents a difference in travel times or distances between the search result location and each of the locations identified in the multi-location search. For example, a search result for a place having a travel imbalance of one minute (e.g., a five minute travel time from the first location and a four minute travel time from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on travel time imbalance) than a search result for a place having a travel imbalance of five minutes. As a further example, a search result for a place having a total travel distance imbalance of one mile (e.g., a two mile travel distance from the first location and a three mile travel distance from the second location) may receive a greater boost in score/rank (based on travel distance imbalance) than a search result for a place having a travel distance imbalance of five miles.
- In some embodiments, ranking the set of search results includes ranking the search results based on relevancy. For example, a search result for a place that is an Italian restaurant may receive a greater boost in score/rank than a place that is a pizza parlor. As a further example, a search result for a place that has favorable user reviews may receive a greater boost in score/rank than a place that has unfavorable user reviews.
- In some embodiments, ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the intermediate locations includes generating a composite score for the search results and ranking the results relative to one another based on their composite scores. For example, a composite score for each of “NYC Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “The Italian Restaurant”, “Times Square Pizza”, and so forth may be generated by determining and adding scores in one or more of the applicable scoring categories (e.g., categories of proximity to an intermediate location, net travel time/net travel distance proximity, travel time/travel distance imbalance, and relevance) and/or applying corresponding scoring multipliers for one or more of the applicable scoring categories to a baseline score for the search results. For example, a composite score for a search result can be computed by multiplying a relevance score by a distance imbalance score, or by dividing the relevance score by the net travel time score, or by multiplying the relevance score by the distance imbalance score and dividing by the net travel time score. Other combinations are of course possible, and within the scope of the invention. Once composite scores are determined for each of the search results, they can be ranked. For example, the search results may be ranked in the order of “The Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “NYC Italian Restaurant”, and “Times Square Pizza” based on respective composite scores of eight, six, five, and two.
-
Method 100 may include providing the ranked set of search results for display (block 110). The ranked set of search results may be referred to as “suggested meeting locations” based on the first and second location and the search topic.FIG. 2 illustrates asearch results webpage 200 that includes suggestedmeeting locations 202. The suggestedmeeting locations 202 correspond to the three highest ranked search results of the exemplary set of ranked search results discussed with regard to block 108.Webpage 200 also includes amap 203 having markers corresponding to the first and second locations (e.g., markers “1” and “2”), as well as markers corresponding to the suggested meeting locations (e.g., markers “A”, “B” and “C”). Themeeting locations 202 may be identified and displayed in response to the user providing the first location infield 204, the second location infield 206 and the query topic infield 208, and selecting the search button. Thus,method 100 may provide a set of suggested meeting locations (e.g., “The Italian Restaurant”, “Little Italy Restaurant”, “NYC Italian Restaurant”) based at least in part on multiple locations and a search topic provided by a user. -
