Definitions
- [ 0002 ] There are a variety of services related to searching. For example, a user may enter a search term on a web page offered by a service, and the service returns a webpage containing matching results. A variety of techniques may be used to rank the results. For example, if the results are websites, the websites may be ranked based on their popularity. The results may also be selected and ranked based on the prior search history, e.g., a result is more likely to be ranked higher if many prior users selected the same result in response to a similar query.
- a user may also enter a street address or latitude/longitude position as a search request.
- the user will receive a webpage containing the results of the search.
- the results may include a map of the requested location and all of the businesses known by the system to be located at the address .
- a user may also enter other search terms. For example, a user may search for "pizza" while viewing a map.
- the service may provide listings that are proximate to the map and fall within the category of pizza restaurants or otherwise match the request such as having the term "pizza" in their company name. Other results may be provided as well, such as web pages and other information.
- the service may also display responsive advertisements to the user that are limited to particular geographic areas (e.g., particular cities or ranges of latitude/longitude coordinates).
- the service also stores an association between the search terms entered by a user and the portion of the map being viewed by a first user. Those terms may be used, either alone or in combination with other prior user searches and criteria, to query and display advertisements when subsequent users view a portion of the map that overlaps with the prior portion.
- Google Maps is also capable of displaying street level images of geographic locations. These images, identified in Google Maps as "Street Views", typically comprise photographs of buildings and other geographic features and allow a user to view a geographic location from a person's perspective as compared to a top-down map perspective.
- Street Views typically comprise photographs of buildings and other geographic features and allow a user to view a geographic location from a person's perspective as compared to a top-down map perspective.
- the street level image may also comprise a 360° panorama, such that the user may view the panorama — and the objects captured therein — from a variety of angles.
- the service also displays a street address to the user that is intended to approximate the closest street address to the location of the camera when the image was taken.
- a method of selecting information in response to user interaction with an image of a structure may include transmitting an image of a geographic location to a user at a remote computer as well as determining, using a processor, whether a user interacted with a structure represented in an image associated with the geographic location, where the structure is associated with a plurality of street addresses. It may also include selecting, with a processor, a search term associated with the structure, where the search term was associated with the structure by selecting a search term from a set of potential search terms derived from the listings associated with the plurality of street addresses. Such an aspect also includes retrieving, with a processor and based on the search term, information to be provided to the user and transmitting the information to the user.
- a system comprises a memory containing instructions executable by a processor and a processor capable of executing the instructions in the memory.
- the instructions include: providing image identification data, where the image identification data comprises data identifying a portion of an image that is being displayed to a user and where the image comprises an image of a geographic location; receiving and displaying an advertisement, where the advertisement was selected by: determining whether the portion of the image is displaying a structure associated with a plurality of street addresses; selecting a search term associated with the structure, where the search term was associated with the structure by selecting a search term from a set of potential search terms derived from businesses located at the plurality of street addresses and; retrieving, with a processor and based on the search term, the advertisement.
- Another aspect of a system includes first and second computers having first and second processor and memories at first and second nodes, respectively.
- the computers may communicate over a network
- the first memory may contain a program that displays images of buildings on a display in communication with the first computer and a program that transmits building identification that data identifies a building contained in the image.
- the second memory may contain data representing (a) whether a building occupies more than one street address, (b) the street address location of listings, (c) listing data, (d) search terms such that each building is associated with a building search term, where a building search term is selected based on the listing data of the listings associated with the street addresses occupied by the building, and (e) images of buildings.
- the second memory further may contain a program that identifies a search term associated with the building identified by the building identification, a program that selects information based on the search term, and a program that provides the information to the first computer via the network.
- Still a further aspect relates to a method that includes: determining, with a processor, a keyword for a single structure by iterating through a plurality of street addresses occupied by a single structure and a plurality of listings associated with the plurality of street addresses, where the keyword is selected from data associated with the listings; identifying, with a processor, the keyword associated with a structure in response to receiving data indicating that a user has interacted with the structure; selecting an advertisement by querying, with a processor and with the keyword identified for the structure, a plurality of advertisements where each advertisement in the set is associated with a keyword; and displaying the advertisement to the user.

- the component may also comprise software for determining the position of the device based on other signals received at the client device 170, such as signals received at a cell phone's antenna from one or more cell phone towers if the client device is a cell phone.
- It may also include an accelerometer 188 or gyroscope to determine the direction in which the device is oriented.
- the device may determine its pitch, yaw or roll (or changes thereto) relative to the direction of gravity or a plane perpendicular thereto.
- a client device's provision of location and orientation data as set forth herein may be provided automatically to the user, the server, or both .
- information may be sent via a medium such as a disk, tape or CD-ROM.
- information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system.
- functions are indicated as taking place on a server and others on a client, various aspects of the system and method may be implemented by a single computer having a single processor.
- Server 110 may store map-related information, at least a portion of which may be transmitted to a client device.
- the server may store map tiles 307, where each tile is a map image of a particular geographic area.
- each tile may cover an entire region such as a state in relatively little detail.
- Another tile may cover just a few streets in high detail.
- the map information is not limited to any particular format.
- the images may comprise street maps, satellite images, or a combination of these, and may be stored as vectors (particularly with respect to street maps) or bitmaps (particularly with respect to satellite images).
- the various map tiles are each associated with geographical locations, such that the server 110 is capable of selecting, retrieving and transmitting one or more tiles in response to receiving a geographical location.
- a location may be expressed and requested in various ways including but not limited to latitude/longitude positions, street addresses, street intersections, an x-y coordinate with respect to the edges of a map (such as a pixel position when a user clicks on a map), building names, and other information in other reference systems that is capable of identifying a geographic locations (e.g., lot and block numbers on survey maps) .
- a location may define a range of the foregoing.
- the system and method may translate locations from one reference system to another.
- the server 110 may access a geocoder to convert a location identified in accordance with one reference system (e.g., a street address such as "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA" ) into a location identified in accordance with another reference system (e.g., a latitude/longitude coordinate such as (37.423021°, -122.083939)).
- one reference system e.g., a street address such as "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA”
- another reference system e.g., a latitude/longitude coordinate such as (37.423021°, -122.083939)
- data 135 defines a set of locations 320 where each location is associated with a street address and a unique identifier ("FID") .
- Each location 320 may further be associated with a latitude/longitude coordinate, which may represent the actual latitude/longitude position of the street address or an approximation thereof.
- the server may also access listing information identifying local businesses or other objects or features associated with particular geographic locations.
- each listing 310 may be associated with a title (such as a company's name), a category (such as "pizza", "Italian restaurant” or “ballpark") and other information (such as store hours and food on a menu) .
- the information may be compiled by automatically gathering business information such as from websites or telephone directories.
- the information may also be stored by users; the users may enter or edit the listing information themselves via web pages served by the server 110. Accordingly, the listing information may be obtained from various sources and contain potentially overlapping information, such as one category that is managed by the operator of the server and another category that is obtained from third parties (e.g., yellow pages ) .
- the listing data may also be associated with a geographic location. For example, if the listing refers to a store, the location may identify the store's street address. The listing may refer to a particular location 320 via the location's unique FID identifier.
- Listings may refer to other geographically-located objects in addition to or instead of businesses. For example, listings may also identify individual's homes, landmarks, roads, bodies of land or water, items located in a store, items that can be moved to different locations etc. Therefore, while many of the examples below refer to business listings, most aspects of the system and method are not limited to any particular type of listing .
- the server may also store a set of advertisements 350.
- the system and method may select an advertisement based at least in part on whether it is returned in response to a query containing search terms. For example, a company may pay the operator of the server each time the content of the advertisement is displayed or selected by a user in response to the user searching for the keyword "pizza.”
- advertisements may be associated with keywords which may be used, along with other criteria, to determine whether the advertisement corresponds with one or more search terms. Search terms are typically text based, but may include other types of data including data representing images and sounds.
- the advertisements 350 may be directly or indirectly associated with geographic locations.
- an advertiser may have specifically directed that an advertisement be displayed only when a user is viewing a map or other information associated with a particular geographic area, such as a city or latitude/longitude range.
- the advertisement may be associated with a listing 310 that is, in turn, associated with a location 320.
- Other advertisements may not be limited or associated with any particular geographic location.
- the method associates search terms with street addresses based on the listings located at the street address.
- the system and method may create sets of search terms by iterating over and analyzing each listing at a street address, and using a variety of information as a source for search terms .
- the names and categories of businesses at the address may be used as address-based search terms. For example, as shown in FIGURE 4, there may be three different businesses located in a single building 410 at the fictional address "25 Second Street, Springfield". The first business may be a restaurant on the first floor named “Joe's Pizza” that falls within the category of "pizza.” The business may be represented by listing data 425 and assigned a unique ID (“CID") 2525. (For ease of reading, various figures use the listing's title in lieu of the numeric CID.) The system and method may thus create a table 490 of search terms based on listing 425, where the search terms are drawn from the words contained in the listing's title and category.
- CID unique ID
- the system and method may similarly iterate through the listings 450 and 460 at the address, and create tables 491 and 492 accordingly.
- the system and method may also select search terms from prior searches that were used to find the listing.
- the search term may come from prior user queries that resulted in the listing being displayed to, and subsequently selected by, the user. Further still, the search term may be selected from the query that resulted in the listing being selected more times than any other query .
- FIGURE 5 illustrates a search that may have been conducted by a user.
- the user entered the query "calzones Springfield” into browser 510 (such as a Google Chrome browser) via text box 520.
- the search button 525 the query was transmitted to the server 110 and passed to the search engine 305.
- the search engine interpreted the query as a request to search for listings associated with the term "calzones" in or near the city of Springfield.
- Server 110 then returned a webpage 530 of search results for display in the browser.
- the results included a map 540 of the queried geographic location (Springfield) as well as information 560 from listings that match the search. It will be understood that additional and different types of results may have been returned and displayed in the webpage as well, including by way of example only links to web pages, videos, pictures, sponsored links, advertising and other content.
- the results of the search may be user selectable.
- the displayed listing for Joe's Pizza may comprise a hyperlink to the website associated with the business, and the user may use his or her mouse to move cursor 570 to click on the listing.
- the browser 510 may navigate the user to the webpage 620 of the listing.
- the hyperlink may take the user to a webpage served by server by 110 that provides an introduction and summary of the listing. It will be understood that a user may select search result in any number of ways, including using a keyboard to check a checkbox displayed next to the listing.
- server 110 may store an entry in a log 710 each time Joe's Pizza was selected by any user in response to a search request.
- the log identifies the listing 712, the date and time 714 that the listing was selected, and the query 716 that the user entered when the listing was selected.
- the system and method may determine whether a geographic location received by a user was a result of a user interaction with an image of a location (e.g., a building, a park, etc.) .
- the user interaction with the image may be, for example, clicking on the image with a mouse, touching the image on a touch screen, or moving a mouse pointer over an image.
- the user interaction with the image may trigger an event handler in response to the event.
- the event handler may transmit a flag and a location associated with the image to the server 110. The flag may indicate occurrence of the event to the server 110.
- the geographical location associated with the image may be used as a search term.
- the geographical location may be expressed in different ways. For example, if a user clicks on an image of a building, the building's name may be used as a search term.
- the most-popular search term is only selected from queries that include a geographic location and another search term (e.g., the location "Springfield” in the query "calzones Springfield”).
- the most- popular search term is the most-popular search term regardless of surrounding terms in the query.
- log 710 is not limited to any particular data structure.
- log 710 illustrated in FIGURE 7 may comprise a small portion of a variety of data structures 345 (FIGURE 3) that store information associating user queries and the results selected by users in response to those queries.
- the system and method determines the most popular search term for the listing. For example, as the system iterates through listings, the system and method may query data 345 based on the identity of the listing and obtain a table such as that shown as log 710. The system and method then iterates through the words of the queries, and counts how many queries contain the word and resulted in the listing being selected. The words are then sorted by count as shown in table 720, where the column "clicks" represents how often the term was associated with the selection of the listing (it being understood that a search result may be selected by a user in ways other than clicking it with a mouse) . The term associated with the most "clicks" may then be considered the most popular search term for the listing.
- FIGURE 8 illustrates table 810, which represents all of the candidate search terms for the foregoing example of "Joe's Pizza".
- the system and method may select the most popular search term over other search terms if the most-popular search term is considered sufficiently relevant to the listing.
- the most-popular search may provide advantages over using a listing's categories. For example, a large department store may be associated with dozens of categories. If a user enters a street address matching the store, it may be difficult to assume that the user was looking for a particular category, e.g., "photos,” “furniture,” or “toys.” However, it may also be discovered that the department store was consistently selected when users queried "discount store.” Accordingly, it may be more reasonable to infer that another user is searching for discount stores when the user enters that address instead of "photos," "furniture” or similar categories .
- Just one method of determining the relevancy of the most popular search term is to determine whether the most successful query for the listing (e.g., "calzones" as shown at reference 811) is associated with a value (e.g., 210 clicks) that exceeds a threshold (e.g., a minimum of 100 clicks) .
- a threshold e.g., a minimum of 100 clicks
- the system and method may select one or more of the listing's categories 813.
- the listing's categories may also be tested for relevancy. For example, a large and prominent department store may be associated with dozens of different categories (e.g., photos, toys and groceries, etc.), none of which are representative of the store. Thus, if the number of categories exceed a threshold (e.g., ten categories), none of the categories may be selected as the listing's search term.
- a threshold e.g., ten categories
- only a single category is selected as the street address. For example, the operator of server 110 may maintain a set of categories and limit each listing to one such category.
- the system and method may select the operator-provided category. If the listing is not associated with an operator- provided category but is associated with categories managed by third parties, one of the third-party categories may be selected (e.g., the dominant or first-listed category if there are more than one categories associated with the listing) . In yet another aspect, all of the categories associated with a listing may be selected as the search term for the street address.
- search term 811- 12 from the title may be selected.
- the search term for listing 460 (FIGURE 4) may be selected from the listing's title, "Second Destinations" because the large number of categories associated with the listing indicates that the categories are too diverse, which makes it difficult to narrow a search to a particular category.
- a single search term is selected for an address even if there are multiple listings at the address.
- One manner in which the single term may be selected includes selecting the search term for the most popular listing. For example, if two listings each have a web site, and if the first web site is extremely popular with many back links and the second website is relatively rarely visited with relatively few back links, the second website may be considered more popular. In that regard, the listing associated with the second web site may be considered more popular and its search terms would be used for selecting advertisements based on the street address.
- the system and method may compare the search terms selected from each of the different listings (CID column 921) at the same address (FID column 920) . For example, if the most-popular search term for one listing resulted in more selections (e.g., resulted in more "clicks") than the most-popular search term for another listing, the first search term may be selected for the entire building. Therefore, as shown in table 910, the term “calzones” may be selected for the address because it resulted in "Joe's Pizza" being selected 210 times. This can be compared to the salon's most-popular search term ("haircut”) yielding only 100 selections.
- FIGURE 10 illustrates a table 1010 of different street geographic locations, each of which is associated with a single search term. As shown in FIGURE 3, these search terms 340 may be stored in data 135.
- FIGURE 11 illustrates a webpage 1120 served by server 110 to client device 150 and displayed on the electronic display using browser 1110.
- the search page includes a text box 1130 that allows the user of the client device to enter a search request.
- FIGURE 11 provides the example of a user entering the street address "25 Second Street, Springfield" and no other information.
- the search engine 305 may determine that the user is interested in viewing a map of the requested location. This may occur automatically as a result of the user entering an address, or manually as a result of the user's selection of link 1140 entitled "Maps" after entering the query. Regardless, the server 110 may construct a webpage containing a map of the selected address. [ 0081 ] The system and method may also select an advertisement based on the address. For example and as shown in FIGURE 3, server 110 may query locations 320 for a street address that exactly, or most closely, matches the user's query. When the street address is found, the server 110 uses the location's FID to query the address-based search terms 340 and retrieve a search term .
- the address-based search term is used to select an advertisement.
- a number of systems and methods of selecting advertisements based on search terms may be used. However, for purposes of illustration, one aspect may comprise searching advertisements 350 for all advertisements having keywords that correspond with the selected address-based search term. Matching advertisements are then ranked based on any number of criteria, such as ranking an advertisement depending on whether the keyword is an exact match for the address-based search term, the prominence of the business or website associated with the advertisement, and the price of the advertisement.
- FIGURE 12 illustrates how an advertisement may be selected based on the data used in the foregoing examples.
- the address entered by the user, "25 Second Street, Springfield” is parsed to find a matching location record 1220.
- the identification of the listing may be used to pull additional information about the listing such as its title and address.
- the server may also retrieve one or more listings 1211 associated with the originally-entered address (e.g., "Joe's Pizza").
- the advertisement selected with the address-based search term may then be displayed to the user that searched for the street address.
- FIGURE 13 illustrates a screen shot that may be displayed to the user that searched for "25 Second Street, Springfield".
- the server displays to the user, via browser 1110 on the client device's electronic display, an icon 1380 that identifies the requested address on a map 1310 as well as the text of a listing 1330 at the address (other listings at the address may be displayed as well) .
- the server also displays the advertisement 1340, including in one aspect the name of the advertiser and the content of the advertisement.
- the server may also display, in the same textbox as the listing at the requested street address, the listing information 1350 of the advertiser as a sponsored link. Icons 1360 and 1361 identifying the location of the listing at the requested address as well as the advertiser, respectively, may also be shown on the map 1310.
- the system and method may display an advertisement based solely on a street address provided by a user. That advertisement may or may not relate to a business at that address.
- the same advertisements 1340 and 1350 may also be shown in connection with a street level image 1410 of the requested location.
- the user may have entered an address and selected the option of displaying the location in street view.
- the user may not have entered a street address but rather navigated to a particular street level image by panning, zooming, etc.
- the user may have navigated to a street level image that displays building 1450 without entering a street address in textbox 1460. If so, the system and method may approximate the street address of the building being viewed based on the latitude/longitude of the street level image and the orientation of the view. The approximated street address may then be used to display advertisements 1340 and 1350.
- the system and method infers what the user was looking for based on where the user was looking, and selects an advertisement targeted at this inferred intent .
- the system and method may be used in any context where a user enters a street address. For example, in addition to searching for addresses as explained above, the system and method may also be used when a user is searching for directions and enters a destination address.
- the system and method may also be used to select advertisements for locations expressed in other reference systems.
- locations expressed in latitude/longitude may also be used to select listings and search terms for advertisements.
- Just one process for using latitude/longitude comprises storing latitude/longitude in association with a listing and obtaining keywords from listings within range of the requested latitude/longitude location.
- Yet another process comprises obtaining latitude/longitude from GPS receiver 189 of client device 170, geocoding the latitude/longitude to obtain a street address, and using the street address as described above to obtain an advertisement and display it on the client device.
- the system and method may also be used in connection with continuously-changing locations.
- the client device 170 is a cell phone
- the client device may consistently display new advertisements as the GPS reviver 189 obtains new location information.
- the most-popular search term may be determined based on other criteria than the criteria set forth above. For example, the most-popular search term may also be determined based on frequency rather simply the total amount of times the listing was ever selected in response. In that regard, the various queries may be evaluated based on how often they resulted in the listing's selection within the past day, week, month, etc.
- the threshold used to determine sufficient relevancy between the query and the listing may comprise more than a fixed numeric value. For example, fifty clicks over the course of a year may indicate sufficient relevancy between a query and a small business such as a local pizzeria. However, fifty clicks may not be sufficient to determine the relevancy between a search term and a listing that is associated with a website that is viewed by hundreds of people a day.
- the threshold may be a function of the listing's prominence.
- the threshold may also be calculated based on other parameters. Some of these parameters may be specifically tied to the listing under consideration (such as prominence) and others may be independent (such as minimum value of 50 clicks for all listings) .
- each address may be associated with multiple search terms that are used to query advertisements. For example, if there are multiple listings at an address, a search term from each listing (such as both "calzones" and "beauty salon") may be used to select advertisements. Moreover, rather than selecting only a single search term from each listing, multiple search terms may be selected. For example, all of the search terms shown in table 810 of FIGURE 8 or table 910 of FIGURE 9 may be used when selecting advertisements for the listing.
- weights may be applied to the terms. For example, the listing's most popular search term may be considered twice as likely as the listing's title to pull an advertisement that will interest a user. Therefore, when the advertisement is queried with both terms, the query may indicate that the most- popular search term should be given twice as much weight when selecting and ranking advertisements for display.
- the system and method may also select multiple advertisements based on a single street address. For example, there may be multiple advertisements responsive to the same keyword.
- different advertisements are selected and displayed based on different search terms from one or many listings. By way of example, a different advertisement may be selected and shown for each search term shown in FIGURES 8 and 9.
- the system and method may further assign weights to the location-based search terms and select the number of the advertisements to display based on the weights.
- the weight may be based on the relative popularity of the most-popular search terms at the requested location. In view of the data shown in FIGURE 9, two advertisements may be selected based on "calzones" and one advertisement may be selected based on "haircut” because the listings at the street address received 100 clicks for "haircut” and 210 clicks for "calzones". Alternatively, the weight may be based on other factors, including information that is neither specific to the requested location nor the location's associated listings.
- a statistical analysis of all- available evidence may indicate that user's are generally twice as likely to choose advertisements that are selected with the term "haircut” than "calzones.”
- the system and method may display twice as many advertisements based on "calzones” than "haircut” in spite of the popularity of the search terms relative to the listings of 25 Second Street. Weights based on combinations of the above are also possible.
- listings are not limited to businesses.
- the system and method may also be used in connection with points of interest (POI) .
- POI points of interest
- the street address of the Empire State Building in New York City is "350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10018".
- the system and method may use the name of building as the source of the advertisement search term.
- one aspect of the system and method may determine whether the street address is associated with a landmark or similar POI listing, and accord more weight to the POI listing than business listings when selecting advertisement search terms.
- the system and method may determine whether a geographic location received by a user was a result of a user interacting with an image of a structure at a location, such as but not limited to a building.
- the user interaction with the image may comprise, for example, clicking on an image of a building that is shown in a street level image, touching the name of a building shown in a two-dimensional map that is displayed on a touch screen, or panning a map or street level image such that a particular structure is centered in the display.
- a user may click on the image of building 1450 in street level image 1410.
- the system and method may retrieve search terms by retrieving the address of the structure and implementing the methods described above.
- a single structure may contain multiple addresses and points of interest.
- the system and method may be configured to select the best candidate search term for the entire structure based on all of the listings at all of the addresses contained in or otherwise associated with the structure. For example, if building 1450 of FIGURE 14 included three street addresses, e.g., 25 Second Street, 26 Second Street and 27 Second Street, then the best candidate search term may be selected from the union of search terms from all of the listings at all three addresses.
- table 910 in FIGURE 9 may include search terms from all of the listings at the various addresses contained in the building 1450.
- Blocks 1901-06 of FIGURE 19 illustrates various of the foregoing operations and other features of such an aspect.
- the system and method may use a search term that was retrieved from another address in the same structure.
- the term “calzones” may be used to request an advertisement when the user enters the street address "26 Second Street” in spite of the fact that the search term "calzones" is associated with a restaurant at 25 Second Street and is not otherwise associated with any listing at 26 Second Street.
- the search term that is used to retrieve an ad may be selected from one of a plurality of structures at a single address.
- a street level image or map may display a compound of buildings wherein the entire compound is associated with a single street address.
- the search terms may be selected from a subset of the listings associated with the address.
- the system and method may determine which of the three buildings is of greatest interest to the user (such as determining, based on the map data, which building is below the mouse pointer when the user clicks on a map that includes the office park) .
- table 910 of candidate search terms in FIGURE 9 may include only the search terms selected from the business in the individual building selected by the user in spite of the fact that there are other listings at the same street address.
- FIGURE 20 illustrates various of the foregoing operations and other features of such an aspect.
- functions described above as being performed by the server may be performed by the client device, and vice versa.
- the server may send listing information at the requested address to the client device, and the client device may use the listing information to determine a search term and request more information.
- the client device and server perform and share different functions .
- the system and method may also be used to select descriptions of products, services and other information. For example, if some of the search terms were music related, the system and method may provide a description of local bands, local music venues or location-neutral music information such as song titles .
- references herein to "search term” may include search terms that include more than one word, i.e., a search term may comprise multiple words. It will be similarly understood that when a search query "contains” a search term (e.g. "pizza”), the query may only that one term or multiple terms (e.g., "pizza in Springfield”).
- the present invention enjoys wide industrial applicability including, but not limited to, computer data processing systems such as, by way of example only, advertisement selection and geographic and structural based search systems.
