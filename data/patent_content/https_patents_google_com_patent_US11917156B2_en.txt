Definitions
- Digital video streams may represent video using a sequence of frames or still images.
- Digital video can be used for various applications including, for example, video conferencing, high definition video entertainment, video advertisements, or sharing of user-generated videos.
- a digital video stream can contain a large amount of data and consume a significant amount of computing or communication resources of a computing device for processing, transmission or storage of the video data.
- Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the amount of data in video streams, including compression and other encoding techniques.
- Encoding based on spatial similarities may be performed by breaking a frame or image into blocks that are predicted based on other blocks within the same frame or image. Differences (i.e., residual errors) between blocks and prediction blocks are compressed and encoded in a bitstream. A decoder uses the differences and reference frames to reconstruct the frames or images.
- This application relates to encoding and decoding a current block of video data.
- Disclosed herein are aspects of systems, methods, and apparatuses for encoding and decoding the current block using adaptation of scan order for entropy coding.
- a first aspect is a method for decoding a current block.
- the method includes decoding a subset of quantized transform coefficients of a quantized transform block using a first scan order; determining, based on the subset of the quantized transform coefficients, a second scan order; decoding, based on the second scan order, remaining quantized transform coefficients of the quantized transform block; determining, based on at least the subset of the quantized transform coefficients, a context model for decoding an intra-prediction mode; decoding the intra-prediction mode based on the context model; and obtaining the current block based on the quantized transform coefficients and the intra-prediction mode.
- a second aspect is an apparatus for coding a current block.
- the apparatus includes a processor that is configured to execute instructions to code a subset of quantized transform coefficients of a quantized transform block obtained from the current block using a first scan order; determine, based on the subset of the quantized transform coefficients, a second scan order; code, based on the second scan order, remaining quantized transform coefficients of the quantized transform block; determine, based on at least the subset of the quantized transform coefficients, a context model for coding an intra-prediction mode for predicting the current block; and code the intra-prediction mode based on the context model.

- Compression schemes related to coding video streams may include breaking images into blocks and generating a digital video output bitstream (i.e., an encoded bitstream) using one or more techniques to reduce the data rate of the output bitstream.
- a received bitstream can be decoded to re-construct the blocks and the source images from the compressed information.
- Techniques used to encode and decode video streams can include entropy coding of components of a video signal (e.g., a prediction residual for a block from a frame of video).
- a hybrid video coding framework may make use of prediction, transform, quantization, and/or entropy coding to compress a block of video data.
- compression performance of entropy coding may be improved by adaptively selecting a scan order instead of using a fixed scan order. For example, if a significant number of zero valued coefficients occur at the end of the scan order for the block, then the ending run of zeros can be very efficiently coded (e.g., using an entropy encoder or an entropy decoder) explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by an end of block indication).
- a block may be partitioned for entropy coding into a plurality of groups of elements (e.g., quantized transform coefficients of a residual block), and information in the first group of elements that are coded using a default scan order, which is available at both the encoder and compatible decoder, may be used to determine a scan order for a next group. For example, based on a distribution of non-zero valued elements in prior coded groups of elements, a scan order for the last group(s) of elements of the block may be selected to increase the probability of zero valued elements occurring at the end of the resulting scan order for the block.
- scan order adaptation is based only on information available in the current block of elements (e.g., quantized transform coefficients of a residual block). Such a scheme may offer the advantage of avoiding dependency of the entropy coding of the block on other parameters, such as an intra-prediction mode for the block or coefficient statistics for other blocks of the video that may be used by a constrained adaptive scan order scheme.
- the advantages may include (1) increasing the coding efficiency of the an entropy encoder/decoder by using a scan order that is adapted to the distribution of non-zero coefficients in the current block; (2) allowing the processing of blocks of a frame in different orders by avoiding a parsing dependency on information outside of the current block; and/or (3) enabling the improvement of intra-prediction mode coding efficiency by enabling intra-prediction modes to be decoded after the elements of a residual block and leveraging correlation between the elements of the block and the intra-prediction mode used to generate the block.
- the scan order for a block based on a residual block resulting from inter-prediction may be adapted based on information in a partitioned group of elements of the block that start the scan order.
- inter-prediction may use a motion vector that represents the spatial displacement of a previously coded block relative to the current block.
- the motion vector can be identified using a method of motion estimation, such as a motion search.
- a portion of a reference frame can be translated to a succession of locations to form a prediction block that can be subtracted from a portion of a current frame to form a series of residuals.
- the horizontal and/or vertical translations corresponding to the location having, e.g., the smallest, residual can be selected as the motion vector.
- the motion vector can be encoded in the encoded bitstream along with an indication of the reference frame.
- a resulting inter-prediction residual may exhibit spatial patterns that can be recognized and exploited to improve entropy coding efficiency for the residual by adapting the scan order for a block based on the residual.
- Encoding a video stream, or a portion thereof, such as a frame or a block can include using spatial similarities in the video stream to improve coding efficiency.
- a current block of a video stream may be encoded based on identifying a difference (residual) between the previously coded pixel values, or between a combination of previously coded pixel values, and those in the current block.
- Intra prediction attempts to predict the pixel values of a current block of a frame of a video stream using pixels peripheral to the current block; that is, using pixels that are in the same frame as the current block but that are outside of the current block.
- Intra prediction can be performed along a direction of prediction, referred to herein as prediction angle, where directions can correspond to respective intra-prediction modes.
- An intra-prediction mode uses pixels peripheral to the current block being predicted. Pixels peripheral to the current block are pixels outside the current block.
- intra-prediction modes may be referred to as directional intra-prediction modes, which may have corresponding prediction angles.
- Directional intra-prediction modes can include, for example, horizontal intra-prediction modes, vertical intra-prediction modes, and diagonal intra-prediction modes.
- a horizontal intra-prediction mode corresponds to an intra-prediction having a prediction angle that is generally horizontal.
- a vertical intra-prediction mode corresponds to an intra-prediction having a prediction angle that is generally vertical.
- a diagonal intra-prediction mode corresponds to a directional intra-prediction having a prediction angle that is neither generally horizontal nor generally vertical.
- the prediction angle of a directional intra-prediction mode can be a prediction angle between 0 and 360 degrees.
- the prediction angle can be a prediction angle between 0 and 270 degrees. Available prediction angles can also be a subset of all possible prediction angles.
- a codec can have available prediction modes corresponding to 50-60 discrete prediction angles of the 0 to 360 prediction angles.
- Non directional intra-prediction modes can also be supported, including, for example, a planar intra-prediction mode and a DC intra-prediction mode.
- Directional intra-prediction modes can be used to propagate pixel values from previously coded blocks along an angular line to predict a block.
- pixel values being propagated can include peripheral pixels above and/or to the left of the block in the same frame (e.g., when raster scan order is used in encoding).
- FIGS. 14 A and 14 B illustrate two example of intra prediction.
- FIG. 14 A is a diagram of an intra-prediction mode 1401 having a 90 degree prediction angle according to implementations of this disclosure.
- FIG. 14 A illustrates generating a prediction block for a 4 ⁇ 4 block to be predicted (also called a current block) using a vertical intra-prediction mode.
- the intra-prediction mode of FIG. 14 A propagates peripheral pixels A through D down the columns of the prediction block such that each pixel in a column has its value set equal to that of the adjacent peripheral pixel A through D in the direction of the arrows.
- FIG. 14 B is a diagram of an intra-prediction mode 1402 having a 135 degree prediction angle according to implementations of this disclosure.
- FIG. 14 B illustrates generating a prediction block for a 4 ⁇ 4 current block using a diagonal intra-prediction mode.
- the intra-prediction mode of FIG. 14 B propagates peripheral pixel values along a 135 degree line (i.e., lines 1406 ) to the right and down to form the prediction block.
- the peripheral pixel values can include, for example, some of peripheral pixels 1408 (i.e., pixels A through R) from blocks adjacent to the 4 ⁇ 4 current block of a frame 1410 , to form the prediction block 1403 for the current block.
- a linear combination e.g., weighted average
- some (e.g., two, three, or more) of the peripheral pixels can be used to predict pixel values of the prediction block along lines extending through the block.
- the pixel value 1404 to be propagated along line 1406 can be formed from a weighted average of pixel values K, L, and M.
- a residual block of residual errors can result from the intra prediction of a block of a video stream.
- the residual block can be in the pixel domain.
- the residual block can be transformed into the frequency domain resulting in a transform block of transform coefficients.
- the transform coefficients can be quantized resulting into a quantized transform block of quantized transform coefficients (also referred to herein as quantized coefficients).
- a quantized transform block of quantized transform coefficients is also referred to herein as a block of quantized transform coefficients.
- the quantized coefficients can be entropy encoded and added to an encoded bitstream.
- the intra-prediction mode can also be entropy encoded and added to the encoded bitstream.
- a decoder can receive the encoded bitstream, entropy decode the quantized transform coefficients and/or the intra-prediction mode to reconstruct the original video frame.
- the number of bits used to encode the intra-prediction mode can depend on the number of available intra-prediction modes. In a video coding system where N intra-prediction modes are available, log 2 N bits may be required to indicate the prediction mode. For example, in a system where nine (9) or ten (10) intra-prediction modes are available for a 4 ⁇ 4 luminance block, four (4) bits may be required to indicate an intra-prediction mode. In a system where 35 intra-prediction modes are available for a 4 ⁇ 4 luminance block, six (6) bits may be required to indicate an intra-prediction mode. Coding systems that use more intra-prediction modes require more bits to encode an intra-prediction mode.
- the number of bits required to encode an intra-prediction mode can be greater than the number of bits required to encode the pixel values of the current block being encoded. For example, to encode a 4 ⁇ 4 block (which contains 16 pixels) in a coding system that uses more than 16 intra-prediction modes, the number of distinct prediction modes is higher than the number of pixels to be predicted. This results in a problem of over saturation.
- Implementations of this disclosure can improve video compression using improved coding of intra-prediction modes.
- Implementations according to this disclosure can use information in residual blocks to improve the compression performance of intra-prediction modes.
- information in the quantized transform block can be used by an entropy encoder to encode the intra-prediction mode thereby improving compression performance.
- the bit rates resulting from encoding an intra-prediction mode can be reduced.
- Encoders and decoders according to implementations of this disclosure can improve the entropy coding without increasing the complexity of the encoding and decoding.

For example, let r[i] denote the sum of the absolute values of the quantized transform coefficients in the i-th row of the quantized transform block and let c[i] denote the sum of the absolute values of the quantized transform coefficients of the transform block in the j-th column.
- the value of category t can be determined using algorithm (8):
- the category t is set to 1 indicating, for example, a generally horizontal intra-prediction mode. If the total sum of the absolute values of the quantized transform coefficients in the first row is greater than twice the total sum of the absolute values of the quantized transform coefficients in the first column, then the category t is set to 2 indicating, for example, a generally vertical intra-prediction mode.

If, for example, the decoded non-zero quantized transform coefficients are skewed toward the first several columns of the quantized transform block, then a generally horizontal intra-prediction mode can be selected. If the decoded non-zero quantized transform coefficients are skewed toward the first several rows of the quantized transform block, then a generally vertical intra-prediction mode can be selected.
