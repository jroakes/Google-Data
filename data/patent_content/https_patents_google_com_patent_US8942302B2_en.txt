- FIG. 3 is an example block diagram of an antenna array 300 that can be used by the transceiver 240 at the base station 200 , such as the eNB 120 , according to a possible embodiment.
- the antenna array 300 can be a transmit antenna grid of (ML) ⁇ N antennas 310 .
- the example antenna array 300 can be seen as comprising single (e.g., co-polarized) polarized antenna elements which can be considered as a uniform linear array in the horizontal and vertical dimensions.
- the antenna array can comprise dual-polarized or cross-polarized antenna elements.
- subarrays within the antenna array are formed such that within a sub-array, correlation is fairly large (e.g., antenna elements with the same polarization) with the correlation structure slowly varying in time. In contrast, the fading of the channels between the subarrays has low correlation with the relative phase between the subarrays' channels varying rapidly.
- the antenna array with dual-polarized or cross-polarized antenna elements can be considered in each dimension (horizontal or vertical) to include two (or more) co-polarized subarrays with each subarray as a uniform linear array.
- the eNB 120 can estimate an Angle of Departure (AoD) of a transmit signal and/or a terminal 110 coarse location with respect to the antenna array 300 based on a uplink Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) transmission or more generally, any uplink transmissions from the terminal 110 by leveraging uplink channel response reciprocity in TDD (Time Division Duplex) systems or multipath direction of arrival reciprocity in FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) systems.
- SRS Sounding Reference Signal
- the antenna array 300 can be calibrated with respect to AoD, which can enable beamsteering in the direction of the terminal 110 .
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary block diagram 400 of beamforming performed by the eNB 120 .
- the eNB 120 can communicate with the terminal 110 by transmitting and receiving signals using the antenna array 300 for beamforming in a manner to achieve channel requirements.
- the data stream 460 is spatial layer which includes a sequence of modulation symbols.
- the data stream 460 including the sequence of modulation symbols may be first multiplied in multipliers 440 by the complex-valued weighting factors 450 .
- the resulting signals, one for each antenna 430 can be fed to transceivers 410 where the baseband signal may be converted to a carrier frequency.
- the transceivers 410 may also apply filtering and additional processing to the signal.
- the transceiver output can then be passed to the power amplifiers (PA) 420 where the signals' power is increased.
- PA power amplifiers
- the output of the PAs 420 can then be fed to the antennas 430 .
- the phase and amplitude of the signals in each antenna 430 of the array of antennas can be therefore be controlled so as to obtain a constructive pattern at the terminal 110 .
- the beams or transmit radiation patterns can be adjusted in the horizontal and the vertical direction by changing the weighting factors 450 . Transmission-power adjustment or deployment of beams for transmitting and receiving signals can be used to meet channel requirements. Beamforming can help to cope with multipath situations and can overcome extra attenuation by providing extra power concentration.
- Beamforming can also be used to reduce interference to adjacent cells or co-scheduled UEs within a cell or coordinating cluster of cells in case of MU-MIMO.
- the method of beamforming illustrated in FIG. 4 is only an exemplary example to implement beamforming of a data stream 460 .
- the weighting factors may be applied after the signal has been translated to the carrier frequency either immediately after the transceiver or after the PA or may be divided in to multiple weighting factors applied at different locations in the transmit chain, e.g., a weighting factor applied in baseband and a weighting factor applied after the transceiver.
- LN static vertical beams or virtual antennas can be formed with partial overlap.
- each CSI-RS antenna port can be configured; each CSI-RS antenna port assigned to each vertical beam or virtual antenna of each column.
- each CSI-RS port can correspond to a single virtual antenna formed from a vertical subset array or vertical subarray of M elements within a column. Assuming each antenna element has a uniform response in azimuth, the LN beams can propagate uniformly in azimuth, but with different elevation angles.
- channels from vertical beams or virtual antennas corresponding to different columns may fade independently, such that multipath fading may cause one or more virtual antennas corresponding to a first column of the N columns to experience a fade while virtual antennas corresponding to a second column may experience a peak.
- Another approach for forming vertical and/or horizontal beams at the eNB 120 can be based on dynamic beamforming
- MU-MIMO Multiple User Multiple Input Multiple Output
- DL Downlink
- MU-MIMO Multiple User Multiple Input Multiple Output
- DL Downlink
- the eNB 120 can use UE location information, DL CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) feedback, DL CSI determined based on Uplink (UL) sounding or uplink channel response reciprocity, such as with Time Division Duplexing (TDD) or multipath direction of arrival reciprocity in FDD and/or Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) feedback from the UE 110 to form the beams.
- DL CQI Channel Quality Indicator
- DL CSI determined based on Uplink (UL) sounding or uplink channel response reciprocity, such as with Time Division Duplexing (TDD) or multipath direction of arrival reciprocity in FDD and/or Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) feedback from the UE 110 to form the beams.
- TDD Time Division Duplexing
- PMI Precoding Matrix Indicator
- the beams can be designed so that they cover equal area on a two-dimensional plane within a sector of the eNB 120 .
- Beamforming within the M vertical antenna elements can be denoted as vertical beamforming, elevation beamforming, or Level-1 beamforming, and beamforming across the NL beams or virtual antennas can be denoted as horizontal beamforming, azimuth beamforming, or Level-2 beamforming.
- This partitioning can be applicable to the UE 110 for PMI feedback. However, this may not be how the eNB 120 may actually form the beams at the transmitter.
- Level-1 beamforming may be UE-transparent for a first case (Case 1) or it may be based on UE feedback for a second case (Case 2).
- Level-1 beamforming and Level-2 beamforming can constitute a logical partitioning of vertical/horizontal beamforming across a large number of antenna elements and the associated CSI feedback can be used to assist precoding for transmission from the eNB.
- the eNB 120 may implement a general precoding algorithm in a UE-transparent manner to schedule users based on Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) (i.e., dedicated pilot or reference for a UE) using a 64-element antenna array.
- DMRS Demodulation Reference Signal
- Level-2 beamforming can be based on eNB-configured antenna ports. This can be based on determinations at the eNB 120 .
- One use case can be when there is identical vertical sectorization across the N columns of the antenna array.
- the eNB 120 can use fixed or same weights at the M antenna elements of each vertical subset array across the columns, such as in Active Antenna Systems (AAS).
- AAS Active Antenna Systems
- Each beam or virtual antenna of the NL virtual antennas can be mapped to a CSI-RS antenna port.
- RSRP CSI-RS Reference Signal Received Power
- the UE 110 may average the power contribution across the N CSI-RS ports corresponding to the N virtual antennas with the same vertical sectorization (or same weights for the vertical subset array across the N columns or in other words the same elevation direction) for CSI-RS or vertical sector RSRP determination (The beam index in the report in this case would be vertical sector index indicating the strongest vertical sector out of the L vertical different vertical sectors or different elevation angles).
- the number of beams or CSI-RS antenna ports for RI/PMI reporting to assist Level-2 beamforming can be configured by the eNB.
- Level-2 beamforming can be based on UE-selected antenna ports. This use case can occur when there is non-identical vertical sectorization across columns. UE reporting of CSI-RS RSRP may be insufficient to configure appropriate virtualization. Thus, the UE 110 can provide assistance in the form for PMI feedback for beamforming.
- the corresponding codebook can include all or a subset of possibilities of Kronecker products between (rank 1) vertical precoding vectors and horizontal precoding matrices.
- the rank of the precoding matrix corresponding to a codebook entry can correspond to the number of streams that can be supported by the channel between the UE 110 and the eNB 120 . If the horizontal codebook includes rank 1 precoding vectors, which have unit magnitudes and linearly progressing phases, then this technique can be pictured as each codebook entry corresponding to a pair of launch angles of a transmitted stream, one in azimuth, determined by a horizontal precoder, and one in elevation, determined by the vertical precoder.
- One solution for Case 2 can extend a RI/PMI feedback approach.
- One codebook, C H can quantize the short-term variations of the channel matrix for an equivalent horizontal array formed by a particular virtualization of M elements within each column.
- Another codebook, C V can be used for spatial quantization of an equivalent vertical array to help the eNB virtualize the M elements within each column.
- C H can be a Release 10 codebook with possible enhancements for 4 transmit antennas (Tx) in the equivalent horizontal array, such as a codebook using a W 1 W 2 weighting structure (precoder corresponding to a codebook entry is a matrix multiplication of two matrices, W 1 and W 2 ), where a precoding vector or matrix applies weights to signals transmitted from each antenna in an antenna array.
- C H can be an enhanced Release 10 codebook, which can allow for a dual codebook structure for 4 Tx and finer quantization for 4 Tx and 8 Tx cases. Since PMI reporting based on C H and C V can serve different purposes, C V can be designed separately from C H , while taking into account different antenna geometries, separations, and other factors. For UE-assisted virtualization of M antenna elements, C V can be a subset of rank-1 codebook with rank 1 precoding vectors from one of Release-10 2 Tx, 4 Tx and 8 Tx codebooks depending on the value of M.
- VQ Vector Quantization
- a vector, ⁇ circumflex over (p) ⁇ n from C V can be chosen by maximizing some metric that involves ergodic or equivalently, long-term time averaging. For example, metric such as based on
- ⁇ F denotes the Frobenius norm which is the sum of the magnitude square of the matrix's elements.
- the ergodic averaging can be done over a longer duration, such as 200-400 ms, than that used for reporting RI/PMI (or codebook indices of PMI in case of dual codebook W 1 W 2 weighting structure) for C H that quantizes the fading applicable to the channel matrix of the equivalent horizontal array.
- the eNB 120 can transmit CSI-RS from the M vertical antenna elements of the n-th vertical subset array on different CSI-RS antenna ports. With the Frobenius norm criterion above, the UE 110 can select a precoding vector such that
- p ⁇ n arg ⁇ ⁇ max p ⁇ C V ⁇ p * ⁇ E H V ⁇ [ H V ( n ) * ⁇ ⁇ H V ( n ) ] ⁇ p .
- the operator ( ⁇ )* denotes the conjugate transpose of a vector or matrix.
- the unconstrained maximizer of the argument can be the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the transmit covariance matrix E H V [H V (n) *H V (n) ].
- E H V [H V (n) *H V (n) ] can be approximately independent of n, i.e., the beam index. Therefore, it can be sufficient for the eNB 120 to request the UE 110 to report only one maximizer ⁇ circumflex over (p) ⁇ across all n if the vertical transmit covariance matrix or vertical correlation properties of the channel is expected to remain approximately independent of n.
- the eNB 120 can configure a first CSI-RS resource with M CSI-RS antenna ports and transmit CSI-RS on antenna ports corresponding to only one set of M antenna elements to enable feedback to assist Level-1 beamforming.
- the eNB can transmit the same CSI-RS signal from an antenna element (out of the M antenna elements) of each of the more than one (or all) NL vertical subset arrays thereby corresponding to a logical CSI-RS antenna port formed from NL antenna elements from the different vertical subset arrays.
- the eNB 120 can configure a second CSI-RS resource which can include Level-1 beamforming or precoding on the CSI-RS transmission on CSI-RS antenna ports corresponding to the second CSI-RS resource.
- This second CSI-RS resource can be used for determining RI/PMI and/or associated CQI to assist the eNB 120 in Level-2 beamforming. More details for this Case 2 are provided below.
- the eNB 120 can configure NML CSI-RS antenna ports within multiple CSI-RS resources, such as NL sets of CSI-RS resources, where each CSI-RS resources can include M CSI-RS antenna ports. This can be done with larger DL overhead.
- the UE can find the precoding matrix as
- i N S can be indexes corresponding to the N S strongest beams.
- the hierarchical PMI selection can be viewed as a suboptimal solution to the double maximization as follows:
- N S take its maximum value
- N S NL
- N take the place of NL.
- P ⁇ arg ⁇ ⁇ max P H ⁇ C H ⁇ max P 1 , ... ⁇ , P N ⁇ C V ⁇ [ ⁇ [ H V ( 1 ) , ... ⁇ , H V ( N ) ] ⁇ [ ( P 1 ⁇ P N ) ] ⁇ P V ⁇ P H ⁇ F 2 ] .
- P V is a MN ⁇ N matrix composed of matrices P 1 through P N stacked one on top of the other with P 1 on the top.
- P 1 through P N are M ⁇ N matrices.
- the vertical angle subtended at the eNB array can change much slower than the horizontal angle.
- the virtualization applied within the M vertical elements in each column may not need to be changed as often as the precoding across columns or precoding corresponding to the horizontal beamforming.
- the UE 110 can send PMI for C V , with no channel quality indicator (CQI) and rank indicator, much less often than the PMI for C H , such as 160 ms or 320 ms for PMI from C V , as opposed to 5, 10, 20 ms for PMI from C H .
- CQI channel quality indicator
- New multiplexing schemes for slow and fast rate reporting for periodic reporting can be used.
- the UE 110 can receive a set of CSI-RS.
- the UE 110 can determine, based on the received set of CSI-RS, a precoding matrix that is a product of first precoding matrix P V and a second precoding matrix P H .
- P V can have at least a representation in terms of N matrices, P V,k [1 ⁇ k ⁇ N].
- Each matrix P V,k can be based on at least one column vector (p k ) selected from a first codebook.
- P H can be based on a second codebook. For example, this can be based on the Eq. 2 above, where
- the UE 110 can then transmit a representation of at least one of the first precoding matrix and the second precoding matrix.
- the product of P V and P H can be a matrix product P V P H , and
- P V [ P V , 1 ⁇ P V , N ]
- P V,k can be a matrix such that only the k th column of P V,k , equal to p k , can be non-zero. For example, this can be based on the Eq. 1 above, where
- P V ⁇ ( : , p ) [ 1 e j ⁇ p ⁇ e j ⁇ ( M - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ p ] , ( Eq . ⁇ 7 )
- P H (:,p) is the p th column of the horizontal precoding matrix taken from the second codebook, and denotes the Kronecker matrix product.
- a solution for Case 2 can perform Level-1 beamforming identical across different sets of M elements as mentioned earlier. For this case, it can be assumed that E H V [H V (n) *H V (n) ] is approximately independent of n, i.e., the beam index. Therefore, only one CSI-RS resource with M CSI-RS antenna ports corresponding to one set of M elements may be configured to assist Level-1 beamforming.
- the eNB 120 can configure a second CSI-RS resource including NL antenna ports where CSI-RS from each antenna port can be obtained or can be precoded by Level-1 beamforming or precoding within M antenna elements. This second CSI-RS resource can be used for determining RI/PMI and/or associated CQI to assist the eNB 120 in Level-2 beamforming.
- a UE can be configured with multiple CSI processes to support Coordinated Multipoint (COMP) scheduling and transmission from multiple Transmission Points (TPs).
- a CSI process is associated with the generation of one set of CSI which can consist of PMI for vertical or Level-1 beamforming, PMI for horizontal or Level-2 beamforming, RI, and/or CQI, based on an associated one or more CSI-RS resource(s) (for which the UE assumes non-zero transmission power for the CSI-RS) and one or more interference measurement resource.
- a first CSI-RS resource associated with a CSI process can be configured to target PMI feedback to assist Level-1 beamforming.
- a second CSI-RS resource associated with the CSI process can be configured to target RI/PMI and/or associated CQI feedback towards Level-2 beamforming.
- the CSI-RS antenna ports in the first CSI-RS resource and second CSI-RS resource associated with the CSI process can be configured independently.
- the second CSI-RS resource may comprise a plurality of sub-CSI-RS resources, each sub-CSI-RS resource associated with one of the L vertical subarrays and comprising N CSI-RS antenna ports; the sub-CSI-RS resources can be configured independently or in a configuration list or a bitmap with each bit set to one indicating a predetermined CSI-RS resource for a sub-CSI-RS resource preferably in order for the L vertical subarrays.
- Codebook subset restriction can be independently applied for CSI associated with the first CSI-RS resource (Level-1 beamforming) and CSI associated with the second CSI-RS resource (Level-2 beamforming) of the CSI process.
- a codebook subset restriction can be applied to use PMI reporting corresponding to the first CSI-RS resource constrained to rank 1 feedback with possibly a subset of the rank 1 precoders.
- the precoder codebook associated with the Level-1 and Level-2 beamforming can be different.
- special codebook(s) can be designed for PMI feedback to assist Level-1 beamforming.
- the UE 110 can be configured with a first codebook associated with the first CSI-RS resource and a second codebook associated with the second CSI-RS resource.
- the optimum vertical precoder can be found for each horizontal precoder. Then, given this optimum vertical precoder, the best horizontal precoder can be found. In other words, a preferred or recommended (vertical precoder, horizontal precoder) pair can be determined.
- rank 1 precoding is first discussed followed by the higher rank case.
- h e (k,p) ⁇ tilde over (H) ⁇ V (k) p (Eq. 9)
- p ⁇ k arg ⁇ ⁇ max p ⁇ ⁇ E H ⁇ V n ⁇ ⁇ h e ( k , p ) ⁇ 2 ( Eq . ⁇ 10 ) where ⁇ circumflex over (p) ⁇ k is the optimum vertical precoder corresponding to horizontal precoder k.
- the optimum horizontal precoder can then be obtained by maximizing over k:
- the expectation can be an average over the subframes/subbands of interest and can be on a different time/frequency scale than the optimization in Equation (Eq. 11).
- An alternative to using LMN CSI-RS antenna ports and calculating ⁇ tilde over (H) ⁇ V (k) for each hypothesized value of q k is for the eNB 120 to apply a precoder k of the horizontal codebook across the rows of the array, and transmit precoded CSI-RS on ML CSI-RS antenna ports where each CSI-RS antenna port corresponds to a precoded row, resulting in direct measurement of ⁇ tilde over (H) ⁇ V (k) at the UE 110 . This can be useful if the size of the codebook, K, is less than the number of columns N.
- ⁇ tilde over (H) ⁇ V (k,i) be the N r ⁇ LM channel when horizontal precoding with the i th column of the k th precoder, Q k (:,i), is applied across each of the LM rows of the array:
- ⁇ tilde over (H) ⁇ V (k,i) [H 1 Q k (:, i ) H 2 Q k (:, i ) . . . H M Q k (:, i )] (Eq. 12)
- the optimal precoder is well defined as the precoder which maximizes the energy of the received signal, or equivalently, the Frobenius norm of the received signal vector.
- the optimal (multi-layer) precoder can again be defined as the precoder which maximizes the energy of the received signal, or equivalently, maximizes the Frobenius norm of the received signal matrix. Optimizing over the set of r vertical precoders then gives
- p ⁇ ( k , 1 ) , ... ⁇ , p ⁇ ( k , r ) arg ⁇ ⁇ max p ( k , 1 ) , ... ⁇ , p ( k , r ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ H e ( k , p ( k , 1 ) , ... ⁇ , p ( k , r ) ) ⁇ 2 ( Eq . ⁇ 14 )
- the maximization can be over the vertical precoding codebook.
- the optimum horizontal precoder can be selected:
- CSI-RS reference signals can be constructed in two dimensions where reference signals from one dimension are transmitted on antenna ports corresponding to the antenna elements of one column.
- the reference signals from one dimension can be transmitted on vertical antenna elements.
- the CSI reference signals can therefore be transmitted on a two dimensional array of antenna ports of sizes M ⁇ 2, M ⁇ 4, M ⁇ 8, etc. where M is the number of antenna ports in the vertical direction.
- the precoding matrices for Case 2 and Case 3 with identical precoding in each column can have a specific structure.
- the precoding matrix can be written as a Kronecker product of horizontal and vertical precoding matrices.
- the precoding matrix can be equal to a block Kronecker matrix product of vertical and horizontal precoding matrices. This is explained in more detail below. First, however, is a short summary of 3GPP Release 10 precoding.
- x is the vector of modulated symbols
- y is the vector of signal transmitted from each PA.
- the matrix W 1 has the structure
- W 2 [ 1 ⁇ ] ; ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 1 , - 1 , j , - j ⁇ ( Eq . ⁇ 18 ) for rank 1 and
- W 2 [ 1 0 0 1 ⁇ 0 0 - ⁇ ] ; ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 1 , j ⁇ ( Eq . ⁇ 19 ) for rank 2.
- W 0 [1 e j ⁇ . . . e j(N v ⁇ 1) ⁇ ] T .
- the CSI feedback for the matrix W 0 can be of a low rate since the vertical elevation angle ⁇ is expected to change slowly, on the order of seconds, and likely to be much slower than changes in W 1 (W 1 typically changes slowly compared to W 2 ).
- the elevation beamforming matrix may be of size N V ⁇ 2 and be of the form
- the block Kronecker product (also called the Khatri-Rao matrix product) of two matrices A*B, both of size M ⁇ N (the M and N here are not related to the M and N defined above in relation to FIG. 3 , but rather are used only to define the block Kronecker product), where the matrices are partitioned
- a * B [ A 11 ⁇ B 11 A 12 ⁇ B 12 ... A 1 ⁇ N ⁇ B 1 ⁇ N A 21 ⁇ B 21 A 22 ⁇ B 22 ... A 2 ⁇ N ⁇ B 2 ⁇ N ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ A M ⁇ ⁇ 1 ⁇ B M ⁇ ⁇ 1 A M ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ B M ⁇ ⁇ 2 ... A MN ⁇ B MN ] . ( Eq . ⁇ 25 )
- Combined azimuth and elevation spatial multiplexing beamforming may be cast in a grid of beams structure. Before illustrating this, one particular type of grid of beams structure is described. This structure is then shown to encompass 8 port Release 10 spatial multiplexing. The same structure is then shown to apply to single polarization combined azimuth and elevation beamforming. Finally, the structure is applied in a recursive or nested way to dual-polarization combined azimuth and elevation beamforming
- the matrix X has p columns and is a component precoding matrix that is applied across each of the subarrays while B contains relative weighting factors to be applied between subarrays and is of the form
- the columns are therefore beamforming vectors that are chosen to point to or in the direction of the dominant scatterers in the environment.
- the matrix B is equal to the block diagonal 2p ⁇ p matrix A, which is composed of two diagonal blocks, the first of which is the identity matrix
- Each non-zero element of A is from the set ⁇ 1, ⁇ 1, j, ⁇ j ⁇ .
- the matrix A contains weighting factors that weight different polarizations. Namely, the first half of the rows of W are applied to antenna elements of one polarization while the remaining rows are applied to elements of the other polarization.
- the precoding matrix W can be written as the product of matrices W 1 and A:
- the grid of beams formulation can be applied to combined azimuth and elevation beamforming with single polarization over an antenna array of size N V ⁇ N H .
- This can be done by replacing the phase weighting factors in A that weight the different polarizations with the product of an elevation precoding matrix U that contain phase factors that weight the N V rows of the array, (i.e. each row of the array is a subarray) and a new N V p ⁇ p phase weighting matrix A sp , where the subscript sp denotes single polarization.
- the N V p ⁇ N V p matrix U therefore has the form
- the component matrices of A sp , A sp,2 , . . . , A sp,N v are diagonal matrices of the form
- the precoding matrix therefore factors into the product of N H N V ⁇ pN V azimuth precoding matrix W sp,1 , pN V ⁇ pN V elevation precoding matrix U, and the N V p ⁇ p phase weighting matrix A sp . Expanding this product results then gives
- W sp [ v 1 v 2 ... v p a sp , 2 , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a sp , 2 , 2 ⁇ e j ⁇ 2 ⁇ v 2 ... a sp , 2 , p ⁇ e j ⁇ p ⁇ v p ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a sp , N V , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a sp , N V , 2 ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ v 2 ... a sp , N V , p ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ p ⁇ v p ] . ( Eq . ⁇ 36 )
- the vector y received at the receiver can be:
- the results of the previous section can be extended to the dual polarization case with combined azimuth and elevation beamforming.
- the matrix ⁇ dp may be composed of two diagonal matrices, ⁇ dp,1 and ⁇ dp,2 stacked one on top of the other.
- the precoder is given by,
- a dp is composed of two diagonal matrices stacked one on top of the other. The sizes of the matrices are as follows: W dp :2N H N V ⁇ p (Eq. 39) W dp,1 :2N H N V ⁇ 2pN V (Eq. 40) W sp,2 :2pN V ⁇ 2p (Eq. 41) A dp :2p ⁇ p (Eq. 42)
- the matrices A sp ⁇ dp,1 and A sp ⁇ dp,2 perform the same weighting across polarizations as the two blocks of A.
- the precoding structure is seen to have a nested structure that results from repeating a precoding matrix and weighting the repeated versions first for the purpose of elevation beamforming, and then repeating and weighting the result a second time for the purpose of beamforming across polarizations.
- the combined precoding matrix W dp together with the channel matrix H form an effective channel and the matrix A dp acts as a rank p precoding matrix for the effective channel.
- the system 100 uses dual-polarized vertical subarrays.
- the precoder may be implemented as either of the following two canonical decompositions.
- ⁇ 2p ⁇ r is a 2p ⁇ r matrix, such as a 0-1 matrix comprising r columns of I 2p selected in some order.
- a possible constraint may be r ⁇ p for Decomposition Type 1 and r ⁇ 2p for Decomposition Type 2.
- the codebook index from the UE CSI feedback i 1 determines [v 1 v 2 . . .
- v p at least partially by selecting the main beam direction v (2i 1 ) or by selecting a beam cluster from a set of partially overlapping beam clusters in a co-polarized subarray.
- the codebook index i 2 from the UE CSI feedback determines
- Type 1 1 2 Type 1 or Type 2 2 (Type 1) or 1 (Type 2) 3 Type 1 or Type 2 3 (Type 1) or 2 (Type 2) 4 Type 2 2 5 Type 2 3 6 Type 2 3 7 Type 2 4 8 Type 2 4
- the precoder takes the structure:
- W sp [ ⁇ v 1 v 2 ... v p a 2 , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a 2 , 2 ⁇ e j ⁇ 2 ⁇ v 2 ... a 2 , p ⁇ e j ⁇ p ⁇ v p ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a N V , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a N V , 2 ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ v 2 ... a N V , p ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ p ⁇ v p ] ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ p ⁇ r
- the precoder takes the structure:
- W dp ⁇ [ v 1 v 2 ... v p a 2 , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a 2 , 2 ⁇ e j ⁇ 2 ⁇ v 2 ... a 2 , p ⁇ e j ⁇ p ⁇ v p ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a N V , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a N V , 2 ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ v 2 ... a N V , p ⁇ e j ⁇ ( N V - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ p ⁇ v p a N V + 1 , 1 ⁇ v 1 a N V + 1 , 2 ... a N V + 1 , p a N V + 2 , 1 ⁇ e j ⁇ 1 ⁇ v 1 a N V
- the precoder for the second type can be written as:
- the role of W 2 and W 3 can be to co-phase the vertical elements and different polarizations by applying a block diagonal phase rotation.
- the structure above can allow for arbitrary co-phasing between the subarrays comprising different vertical elements and polarizations.
- the subarrays can include co-polarized subarrays with antenna elements of the same polarization.
- such a general structure may make both the codebook design and precoder selection at the UE difficult.
- the design can be simplified by applying some restrictions to the co-phasing matrix W 2 as follows:
- the submatrices A 2 , . . . , A N V determine the co-phasing as applied to the vertical elements with +45 degree polarization.
- the submatrices A N V +1 , . . . , A 2N V determine the co-phasing as applied to the vertical elements with ⁇ 45 degree polarization.
- a k [ ⁇ 1 ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ p ] ; ⁇ ⁇ N V + 1 ⁇ k ⁇ 2 ⁇ N V . ( Eq . ⁇ 51 )

- the matrix W 1 is determined, at least partially, by the codebook index i 1 and can correspond to the grid of beams component of the precoder based on an oversampled DFT matrix.
- the role of W 2 can be to co-phase the cross pole antennas whereas W 3 takes care of vertical beamforming within the set of vertical elements with the same polarization.
- the Release 10 codebook can be extended in such a way that W 2 is determined by an codebook index i 2 .
- the role of W 3 can be to apply phase rotation to the vertical elements so as to point a layer in a desired direction or vertical/elevation angle.
- a new codebook to span the relevant set of vertical angles can be determined by a new codebook index i 3 .
- the relevant set of vertical angles can be predetermined and known apriori to the eNB and UE or can be signaled by the eNB 110 .
- a UE capable of supporting vertical/elevation beamforming may be configured by higher layer signaling to use a codebook supporting vertical/elevation beamforming.
- the eNB 120 may signal to the UE 110 an indication of a list of possible vertical angles.

- the vertical beamforming component of the codebook may be designed over a set of vertical angles which are a priori known to the UE 110 and eNB 120 .
- the UE 110 may be configured with a codebook subset restriction to restrict the possible precoders for CSI feedback to include a subset of the vertical angles.
- W 1 matches the precoding vector space [v 1 v 2 . . . v p ] to the wideband spatial transmit covariance structure of the channel matrix
- W 3 matches the transmit phases to the vertical angle of departure of the rays associated with transmit array, i.e., vertical beamforming.
- W 3 may also be associated with change in UE location and may cause a change in W 3 . Since the vertical angle changes at the same or a much slower rate than the spatial covariance structure, the rate of feedback for i 3 may not be any faster than that for i 1 .
