Definitions
- This specification relates to information retrieval.
- the Internet enables access to a wide variety of resources, such as images, video or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, book articles, or news articles.
- a search system can identify resources in response to a search query that includes one or more search terms or phrases.
- the search system ranks the identified resources based, at least in part, on their relevance to the search query.
- the search results are typically ordered according to the rank.
- a search result can, for example, include a link to an identified resource, a title of the identified resource, e.g., web page title, a snippet of text from the identified resource, a representation of the identified resource, e.g., a thumbnail of an image, the uniform resource locator (URL) of the identified resource, or any combination thereof.
- a link to an identified resource e.g., a title of the identified resource, e.g., web page title, a snippet of text from the identified resource, a representation of the identified resource, e.g., a thumbnail of an image, the uniform resource locator (URL) of the identified resource, or any combination thereof.
- search result including a reference to an image
- web pages e.g., landing pages
- the search system may identify a particular painting as being responsive to a search query and generate a search result for the painting.
- images of the painting may be accessible from numerous web pages.
- each of the web pages may link to an image of the painting hosted on another web page.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include accessing domain data specifying first domains that are used to host web pages and second domains that are used to host images linked to by the web pages; for each of the first domains: determining a total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain, where each image link is a link to an image hosted on a second domain; identifying second domains hosting images to which image links on web pages hosted on the first domain link; for each of the second domains: determining a number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain; determining, by one or more data processors, a codomain relationship measure for the first domain and the second domain specifying a measure of relatedness between the first domain and the second domain based at least in part on the number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain and the total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to
- a web page linking to an image to be referenced by a search result can be selected from among multiple web pages linking to the image based on relatedness between the domains hosting the web pages and the domains hosting the image, “codomain relationship measures.” Selecting web pages based on respective codomain relationship measures can, for example, reduce the likelihood of selecting a web page of low authority or quality to reference in the search result.
- Low authority or low quality web pages likely have low codomain relationship measures because such web pages often “hotlink” to many popular images hosted on many different domains to increase user traffic without shouldering the burden of actually hosting the images.
- highly authoritative web pages tend to serve images off their own domains rather than hot-linking to images hosted on others' domains, provide original content, or both.

- This specification generally relates to determining codomain relationship measures between domain pairs of first and second domains, where the first domain is used for hosting web pages, and the second domain is used for hosting images that are linked to by web pages hosted on the first domain.
- the designation of first domain and second domain can be reversed for any two domains, e.g., both domains host pages that link to images hosted by the other domain.
- first domain and second domain do not mean that a particular domain does not host images or web pages.
- the codomain relationship measures can be used, for example, to select a particular web page, e.g., landing page, for an image to be referenced in a search result.
- a search query is submitted to a search system.
- the search system identifies an image as responsive to the search query.
- the image is available through multiple web pages which link to the image, e.g., the web pages include scripts or links that retrieve the image from other web pages and cause the image to be displayed when the web page is rendered on a user device.
- the codomain relationship measures associated with the multiple web pages can be used to select one of the web pages to reference in the search result.
- a codomain relationship measure is a measure of the relatedness between the first domain of the web page and the second domain of the referenced image.
- the codomain relationship measure can be based on, for example, a ratio of the number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain and linking to images hosted on the second domain to the total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain.
- web pages on a first domain R may link to a total of twenty-five images; five images hosted on second domain A, twelve images hosted on second domain B and eight images hosted on second domain C.
- web pages hosted on a first domain S may link to a total of eighty images, all hosted on second domain D.
- the codomain relationship measure for the first domain S and second domain D is 1.0.
- a low codomain relationship measure may indicate a web domain hosts web pages of low authority.
- an image is identified for reference in a search result, e.g., the image or the subject matter of the image is determined to be relevant to a search query.
- the image is hosted on the second domain A and linked to by a web page hosted on the first domain R, and the image is also hosted on the second domain D and linked to by a web page hosted on the first domain S.
- the search system will cause the search result to reference the web page hosted by the first domain S as the landing page for the image.
- a selection of the search result will cause, for example, a user device to render web page hosted on the first domain S, which, in turn, will cause the request and display by a user device of the image hosted on the second domain D.
- the codomain relationship measure is, for example, an indicator of the quality or authority of a landing page.
- the codomain relationship measure is used to determine which landing page is selected, in some implementations, the codomain relationship measure is used in combination with other indicators of landing page quality to select a landing page, as described below.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a search system 110 can be implemented and provide search services.
- a network 102 such as a local area network, “LAN,” wide area network, “WAN,” the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects servers 103 , publisher web sites 104 , user devices 106 , and the search system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include multiple servers 103 , publisher web sites 104 and user devices 106 .
- a publisher web site 104 is a one or more resources 105 , e.g., web pages, associated with a domain.
- a domain is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control in the Internet. The domain can be used to identify one or more internet protocol (IP) addresses.
- IP internet protocol
- An IP address is a numerical label assigned to devices, e.g., user devices 106 and servers 103 , on the network 102 .
- a domain for example, is exampledomain.com, which corresponds to IP address X.X.X.X or exampledomain.biz, which corresponds to IP address Y.Y.Y.Y.
- domain data specifying domains and the publisher web sites 104 and resources 105 associated with those domains are stored in a domain data store 114 .
- a domain has a suffix that indicates to which top level domain (TLD) it belongs, e.g., “.edu,” “.com,” “.org” and “.net.”
- a domain can also have subdomains.
- a subdomain is a part of a larger respective domain.
- exampledomain.com can have subdomains en.exampledomain.com and mail.exampledomain.com.
- a subdomain, itself can have subdomains.
- a domain can represent a hierarchical structure with the domain at the top level and subdomains at lower levels.
- a publisher web site 104 can be hosted by one or more servers 103 or other computing devices connected to the network 102 .
- An example publisher web site 104 includes a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language, “HTML,” that contains text, graphic images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- a publisher web site 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web site.
- a resource 105 is any data that is provided by a publisher web site 104 over the network 102 and associated with a resource address.
- resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format, “PDF,” documents, images, videos, and feed sources.
- a resource 105 has an addressable storage location that can be uniquely identified by the resource address, such as a universal resource locator (URL).
- URL universal resource locator
- the URL for a blog, e.g., resource 105 on the domain exampledomain.com is www.exampledomain.com/blog.html.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as, text, images, and so on, and may include embedded information, such as meta information, e.g., metadata, and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions such as scripts.
- a resource 105 can reference another resource 105 by use of a resource link (“link”).
- An example link is a HTML hyperlink that references another resource 105 by the URL of the resource 105 , or an Xlink in an extensible markup language (XML) document.
- web page A hosted on domain A may link to an image on web page B hosted on domain B such that when a user device 106 renders web page A the HTML of web page A, e.g., a script in the HTML, causes the user device 106 to request the image from web page B and display the image with web page A.
- link data identifying the links between resources 105 are stored in a link data store 116 .
- a resource 105 e.g., a web page or an image
- a resource 105 is described as being hosted on a particular domain it means the resource 105 is hosted on the server or servers 103 that have an IP address or addresses identified by or identified as being part of the particular domain.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user device 106 to display text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
- the search system 110 can identify the resources 105 by crawling the publisher web sites 104 and indexing the resources 105 provided by or available from the publisher web sites 104 .
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache data store 112 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries to the search system 110 .
- the search queries can be submitted to the search system 110 in the form of a search request that includes the search query.
- the search system 110 can use data in the indexed cache data store 112 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query.
- the search system 110 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in a search results page.
- a search result can be data generated by the search system 110 that identifies a resource 105 that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource 105 .
- An example search result can include any, or a combination, of a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from a web page, an image or thumbnail of an image, and a URL of a web page that includes the snippet of text and/or the image.
- the search results can be ranked, for example, based on scores related to the resources 105 identified by the search results, such as information retrieval, “IR,” scores.
- IR information retrieval
- scores related to the resources 105 identified by the search results such as information retrieval, “IR,” scores.
- an IR score can be based on a quality of the resource 105 and a relevancy of the resource 105 .
- the ranking of the search results is based, at least in part, on the IR scores.
- the user devices 106 receive the search results on search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource 105 identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result.
- the server 103 hosting a publisher web site 104 associated with the resource 105 receives the request for the resource 105 from the user device 106 and provides the resource 105 to the requesting user device 106 .
- a search result can be an image search result that includes a reference to an image that is accessible from multiple web pages.
- the link determination apparatus 122 and the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 facilitate the determination of which of the multiple web pages will be the displayed landing page for the image in response to a user selection of the search result, as described below with reference to FIGS. 2A-B .
- FIG. 2A is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for determining codomain relationship measures.
- the process 200 can be implemented in one or more data processing apparatuses in which the search system 110 is implemented.
- the process 200 is periodically performed in an offline, e.g., preprocessing, stage such that the codomain relationship measures are pre-computed and are not determined in a query-time process in response to the search system 110 receiving a search query. Rather the codomain relationship measures are “looked-up,” in a data store where the previously computed codomain relationship measures are stored, in a real-time or near real-time process in response to the search system 110 receiving a search query.
- codomain relationship measures can additionally, or alternatively, be computed in a query-time process with respect to receiving search queries or determining responsive search results.
- the process 200 accesses domain data specifying first domains that are used to host web pages and second domains that are used to host images linked to by the web pages ( 202 ).
- the link determination apparatus 122 receives or accesses data specifying a set of first domains hosting web pages, e.g., as identified by an administrator or based on web page popularity, etc.
- the link determination apparatus 122 accesses the domain data store 114 to identify the first domains.
- the process 200 determines a total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain ( 204 ).
- the link determination apparatus 122 for each of the first domains in the set of first domains, accesses link data from the link data store 116 and determines a total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain where each image link is a link to an image hosted on a second domain.
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines the total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain by aggregating the numbers of image links from each web page hosted by the first domain. Further in some implementations, the link determination apparatus 122 determines the total number of image links regardless of, e.g., independent of, which and how many second domains host the images to which the image links link.
- two web pages hosted by the first domain may link to the same image accessible from the same web page hosted on the second domain.
- the link determination apparatus 122 can count each image link as a separate image link in its determination of the total number of image links.
- the link determination apparatus 122 can treat the two image links as the same image link in its determination of the total number of image links.
- the determination of the total number of image links is described with reference to FIG. 2B , which is a block diagram 250 of example image links between first and second domains.
- the first domain 254 hosts web pages that have image links to 179 different second domains, second domains 254 - 1 through 254 - 179 . More particularly, the first domain 254 hosts web pages that have 537 image links to images hosted by the second domains 254 - 1 through 254 - 179 . Of these 179 second domains, the second domain 254 - 179 has the most image links from the first domain 254 , e.g., four image links, and is the only second domain with four image links from the first domain 254 . Thus, for the first domain 254 , the link determination apparatus 122 determines that the total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain 254 is 537. More generally, a first domain can host any number of web pages with any number of image links to any number of images hosted by any number of second domains.
- the process 200 for each of the first domains, identifies second domains hosting images to which image links on web pages hosted on the first domain link ( 206 ).
- the link determination apparatus 122 for each of the first domains in the set of first domains, identifies second domains hosting images to which image links on web pages hosted on the first domain link.
- the link determination apparatus 122 identifies the second domains hosting images to which image links on web pages hosted on the first domain link by accessing the domain and link data stores 114 , 116 , and processing, e.g., parsing, the accessed data based on associations between the second domains and the first domain.
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines that the first domain 252 hosts web pages that include image links to the second domain 252 - 1 and the second domain 252 - 2 . Similarly, with reference to the first domain 254 , the link determination apparatus 122 determines that the first domain 254 hosts web pages that include image links to the second domains 254 - 1 through 254 - 179 .
- the process 200 determines a number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain ( 208 ).
- the link determination apparatus 122 for each of the second domains identified in process 206 , determines a number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain.
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines the number of image links by accessing the domain and link data stores 114 , 116 , identifying the image links between web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain, and aggregating the identified image links.
- the first domain 252 can host eight web pages, three of which have image links linking to images hosted on the second domain 252 - 2 .
- the three web pages, web pages A, B and C can, for example, have 30, 18 and 15 image links, respectively.
- the link determination apparatus 122 aggregates the numbers of image links from web page A, B and C to determine the number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain 252 linking to images hosted on the second domain 252 - 2 is 63 image links.
- a web page may include image links to multiple domains, e.g., web page A may include image links to images on the second domain 252 - 1 .
- the respective image links are counted for the respective codomain relationships, e.g., a web page with image links to multiple domains may be considered for multiple codomain relationships.
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines the total number of image links linking to images hosted on the second domain by accessing the domain and link data stores 114 , 116 , identifying the relevant image links, and aggregating the identified image links.
- the process 200 determines a codomain relationship measure for the first domain and the second domain ( 210 ).
- the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 determines the codomain relationship measure for a first domain and a second domain based at least in part on the number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain, e.g., from the process 208 , and the total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain, e.g., from the process 204 .
- the codomain relationship measure for the first domain and the second domain specifies a measure of relatedness between the first domain and the second domain.
- #IL(D1, D2) is the number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain linking to images hosted on the second domain
- #IL(D1) is the total number of image links on web pages hosted on the first domain.
- first domain 252 and second domain 252 - 1 pair have a higher codomain relationship measure than the first domain 252 and second domain 252 - 2 pair as the first domain 252 and second domain 252 - 1 pair have more image links than the first domain 252 and second domain 252 - 2 pair.
- #ILT(D2) is the total number of image links linking to images hosted on the second domain.
- the first domain 252 and second domain 252 - 1 pair have a higher codomain relationship measure than the first domain 252 and second domain 252 - 2 pair.
- the codomain relationship measure can be based on Equation 1, Equation 2 or a combination thereof.
- the counts e.g., #IL(D1,D2), #IL(D1), #ILT(D2), used in the examples above may be replaced by weighted aggregates of the counts where the weights are based on a quality or utility of the links, the images, the web pages, the domains, or a combination thereof.
- the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 only determines a codomain relationship for a codomain pair, e.g., a unique pairing of a first and a second domain, if the total number of image links from web pages hosted on the first domain satisfies, e.g., exceeds, an image link number threshold. For example, the link determination apparatus 122 determines that the first domain 254 has 537 image links.
- the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 will not determine a codomain relationship measure or measures for the codomain pair or pairs having the first domain 254 as the total number of image links for the first domain 254 does not exceed the image link number threshold. Conversely, if the image link number threshold is 500 image links then the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 will determine a codomain relationship measure or measures for the codomain pair or pairs having the first domain 254 as the total number of image links for the first domain 254 exceeds the image link number threshold.
- codomain relationship measures can be used, for example, to select a web page, e.g., a landing page, to be referenced by a search result to provide access to an image responsive to a search query.
- a selection process is described below with reference to FIG. 3 , which is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for selecting a web page to be referenced by a search result.
- the process 200 can be performed iteratively, during one or more preprocessing stages, whereas the process 300 can be performed in a real-time or near real-time process in response to receiving a search query, as described below.
- the process 300 receives data specifying a search query ( 302 ).
- the search system 110 receives a search query from a user device 106 .
- the search queries can be submitted to the search system 110 in the form of a search request that includes the search query.
- the process 300 determines a search result responsive to the search query ( 304 ). For example, in response to the receiving the search query, the search system 110 can use data in the indexed cache data store 112 to determine one or more search results, e.g., references to resources 105 that are relevant to the search query.
- a search result can identify an image as relevant to the search query and include a reference to the image.
- the search result can include a thumbnail of an image that is or pertains to subject matter responsive to the search query.
- the image e.g., represented by the thumbnail, is referenced by or otherwise accessible from numerous web pages, e.g., resources 105 .
- the search query “Van Gogh's Starry Night painting” is submitted to the search system 110 .
- the search system 110 identifies six different web pages from which an image of Starry Night is accessible, e.g., each of the six web pages includes an image link to an image of Starry Night that will be retrieved or otherwise accessed from a second domain hosting the image and displayed on the web page when the web page is rendered on a user device 106 .
- the six web pages can be hosted on the same first domain, different first domains or some combination thereof.
- the process 300 determines respective first domains, each respective first domain hosting one of a plurality of web pages ( 306 ).
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines the first domains of the numerous web pages, e.g., the plurality of web pages, identified by the search system 110 from which a relevant image is accessible.
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines the first domains hosting the web pages having image links to the image referenced in the search result, e.g., as determined in process 304 .
- the web pages may be hosted on the same first domain, different first domains or some combination thereof.
- one web page having an image link to a relevant image e.g., a photograph of the Starry Night painting
- another web page having an image link to a relevant image e.g., a sketch drawing representation of the Starry Night painting
- the link determination apparatus identifies the first domains 252 and 254 as respective first domains.
- the process 300 determines second domains hosting the image based on the domain data ( 308 ).
- the link determination apparatus 122 accesses the domain data store 114 and determines the second domain hosting each of the images linked to by the image links from the web pages hosted on first domains, e.g., as determined in process 306 .
- the second domains can be the same or different second domains.
- a web page hosted on the first domain 252 has an image link linking to an image of Starry Night hosted on the second domain 252 - 1 and a web page hosted on the first domain 254 has an image link linking to an image of Starry Night hosted on the second domain 254 - 179 .
- the Starry Night images hosted on the second domains 252 - 1 and 254 - 179 can be the same image of a Starry Night or they can be different images of a Starry Night, e.g., the two images can be copies of the same data file or can both be pictures of the original painting but taken from different perspectives.
- the link determination apparatus 122 determines that the second domains 252 - 1 and 254 - 179 are second domains hosting the image.
- the process 300 compares the codomain relationship measures for codomains pairs ( 310 ).
- a codomain pair is a unique pairing of one of the determined second domains with one of the respective first domains.
- a first codomain pair is the first domain 252 and the second domain 252 - 1
- a second codomain pair is the first domain 254 and the second domain 254 - 179 .
- the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 compares the codomain relationship measure of each codomain pair to that of each other codomain pair.
- the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 compares the codomain relationship measures determined in process 210 , e.g., based on Equation 1 or Equation 2. For example, the codomain measure determination apparatus 124 compares the codomain relationship measure for the first codomain pair of the first domain 252 and the second domain 252 - 1 of 0.987 with the codomain relationship measure of the second codomain pair of the first domain 254 and the second domain 254 - 179 of 0.007.
- the process 300 selects one of the plurality of web pages to be referenced by the search result based on the comparison ( 312 ). For example, the search system 110 selects one of the multiple web pages hosted on the first domains to be referenced by the search result. In some implementations, the search system 110 selects the web page hosted by the first domain from the codomain pair that has the highest codomain relationship measure. The highest codomain relationship measure indicates the codomain pair with the highest degree of relatedness. For example, the search system 110 selects the first codomain pair of the first domain 252 and the second domain 252 - 1 as its codomain relationship measure is higher than that of the second codomain pair of the first domain 254 and the second domain 254 - 179 .
- User selection of the search result causes, for example, the image to be retrieved from the second domain of the codomain pair having the first domain that hosts the selected web page and displayed on the selected web page.
- the search system 110 determines that the first codomain pair of the first domain 252 and the second domain 252 - 1 has the highest codomain relationship measure, e.g., based on the comparison by process 310 , and, in turn, selects the web page hosted by the first domain 252 to reference in the search result.
- User selection of the search result causes the user device 106 to render the selected web page, which causes the user device 106 to retrieve the image hosted by second domain 252 - 1 for display on the selected web page.
- two or more web pages hosted by the same first domain and each having an image link to an image hosted by the same second domain may be included in the multiple web pages identified by the search system 110 as being web pages from which an image responsive to the search query is accessible.
- the search system 110 can select one of the two or more web pages based on other factors such as, for example, the relevancy of the web page to the search query or the quality of the web page.
- the search system can access relevancy and quality metrics from a relevancy and quality data store and base the selection on this accessed relevancy and quality data.
- the search system 110 uses the relevancy metrics, quality metrics or both of the multiple web pages, in combination with the codomain relationship measures to select the web page to be referenced in the search result. For example, the search system 110 weights the relevancy score for each of the multiple web pages, the quality score for each of the multiple web pages and the codomain relationship measure associated with each of the multiple web pages. The search system 110 then aggregates the weighted scores for the web pages and selects the web page with the highest aggregated score.
- the weights for the relevancy score, the quality score and the codomain relationship score can be set by a system administrator, e.g., 0.2 weight for the relevancy score, 0.2 weight for the quality score and 0.6 weight for the codomain relationship measure.
- the search system 110 can, for example, multiply the weights with the respective scores/measure and sum the result to determine the aggregated and weighted score for each web page.
- the above description describes determining codomain relationship scores on a domain level basis and selecting web pages to be referenced in a search result based on this domain level, codomain relationship measure.
- the techniques and processes described herein can also be applied on a subdomain level.
- the process 204 can determine the total number of image links on web pages hosted on subdomain levels of the first domains and the process 206 can identify the second domains, on subdomain levels, hosting images to which image links on web pages hosted on particular subdomains of the first domains link.
- the process 210 can determine codomain relationship measures for codomain pairs having one of the subdomains from the first domains and one of the subdomains from the second domains.
