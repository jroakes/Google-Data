Definitions
- a user may wish to act upon images and/or other content displayed by the computing devices. For example, a user may wish to learn more about one or entities (e.g., people, places, things) that are depicted, described, or otherwise represented visually on a display. As another example, a user may wish to save images or other displayed content for later use and/or share the images or other displayed content with others.
- Screenshots provide one simple mechanism for users to save or share the content of their screens with others. However, screenshots typically include the entirety of the content depicted on the user's display. Accordingly, a screenshot may include, in addition to the content of interest to the user, other content of less interest.
- screenshots are static, and thus are not readily usable (e.g., interactive) to initiate searches about entities that may be depicted in the screenshots.
- Implementations of this specification are directed allowing users to provide input via one or more input devices (particularly biosensors) of a computing device, such as a touchscreen, soft key, fingerprint sensor, bezel-based sensors (e.g., capacitive), camera, accelerometer, etc., to activate (e.g., bring forth, surface) so-called “interactive content items” associated with various aspects of content currently displayed to the users.
- a computing device such as a touchscreen, soft key, fingerprint sensor, bezel-based sensors (e.g., capacitive), camera, accelerometer, etc.
- activate e.g., bring forth, surface
- interactive content items associated with various aspects of content currently displayed to the users.
- the users may then interact with these interactive content items to take further actions tailored to the various aspects of the displayed content.
- content being displayed to a user may be segmented into so-called “semantic regions” based on, for instance, content of the one or more semantic regions.
- a semantic region may include, for instance, a discrete image, a discrete portion of text (e.g., a list, a displayed text message, an isolated passage of text, a price, an entity name/description, etc.), and so forth.
- Content being displayed to a user may be segmented into semantic regions in various ways.
- markup language such as HTML or XML underlying the webpage may be leveraged to segment the webpage into semantic regions, e.g., using various markup language tags or other related signals.
- an ⁇ img> tag may be used to segment a region of the displayed content that contains an image
- a ⁇ p> tag may be used to segment a region of the displayed content that contains a passage of text
- a ⁇ div> tag may be used to segment a region of the displayed content that contains a combination of an image and accompanying text, etc.
- pixels of the displayed content may be analyzed (locally at the computing device or remotely at one or more servers forming a so-called “cloud”) to segment the displayed content into semantic regions.
- Content being displayed to a user may be segmented at various times and/or in response to various events.
- the segmenting may occur in the background in a continuous or periodic fashion. For example, in some implementations, segmenting may occur automatically whenever content being displayed to a user changes, e.g., in any way, by some threshold amount, completely, etc. Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, segmenting may occur periodically, e.g., every few seconds (or more or less frequently). In yet other implementations, segmenting may occur in response to a user command.
- a user provides a command, such as actuation of a fingerprint sensor, a long tap on a touchscreen, squeeze of bezel-based sensors, etc., that indicates a desire by the user to act upon something currently being displayed.
- a command such as actuation of a fingerprint sensor, a long tap on a touchscreen, squeeze of bezel-based sensors, etc.
- user input may include a command to capture a screenshot image, although this is not required.
- Such user input may initiate segmenting of content being displayed when the user provides the input.
- one or more interactive content items corresponding to the one or more semantic regions may be generated.
- These interactive content items may include graphical elements that may, for instance, be generated using content of corresponding semantic regions. For example, if a semantic region contains an image of a stadium, a corresponding interactive content item may depict the stadium or some portion thereof.
- user interaction with a given interactive content item of the one or more interactive content items may cause the computing device to perform one or more actions that are tailored to the semantic region that corresponds to the given interactive content item.
- the interactive content item may be selectable to search for more information about the stadium (e.g., directions), to purchase tickets to an event at the stadium, submit the stadium image to an image search engine, etc.
- the interactive content may, for instance, depict all or a portion of the text (e.g., a title or heading included in the text), and may be actuable to save the text, copy the text to a pasteboard, share the text with others, search the text using a search engine, use the text to generate a list (e.g., a shopping list, a to do list), etc.
- the interactive content items may be visually emphasized, e.g., by being visually raised above other content displayed to the user.
- interactive content items may be at least temporarily included in a set of interactive content items (e.g., previously interacted with by the user). For example, suppose a user selects an interactive content item associated with a grocery list received in a text message and saves the list in a list application. The corresponding interactive content item may be displayed to the user, along with other interactive content items that the user has interacted with recently, in a particular graphical user interface. In some implementations, these interactive content items may appear as floating (e.g., untethered to the displayed background) icons, e.g., on a user's home and/or lock screen, or in a particular region of a virtual reality environment. In some implementations, a user may be able to “delete” one or more of these displayed interactive content items by, for instance, dragging the interactive content item off the screen, to a trash can icon, etc.
- a method is provided that is performed by one or more processors and that includes: segmenting content displayed to a user by a display of a computing device of the user into one or more semantic regions, the segmenting being based on content of the one or more semantic regions; receiving, via a biometric sensor of the computing device, user input indicating a desire of the user to act upon one or more of the semantic regions; in response to the receiving, generating one or more interactive content items corresponding to the one or more semantic regions; and providing the one or more interactive content items for presentation to the user via one or more output devices of the computing device of the user, wherein user interaction with a given interactive content item of the one or more interactive content items causes the computing device to perform one or more actions that are tailored to the semantic region that corresponds to the given interactive content item.
- the biometric sensor may take the form of a fingerprint sensor, a light sensor, a pulse reader, an accelerometer, a camera, one or more bezel-based (e.g., side) sensors of a smart phone, and so forth. In some implementations, the biometric sensor may be on an opposite side of the computing device from the display.
- the one or more interactive content items may include visually-emphasized versions of the one or more semantic regions. In various implementations, the one or more interactive content items may include visually-raised versions of the one or more semantic regions.
- the user interaction with the given interactive content item causes the given interactive content item to be at least temporarily included in a set of interactive content items previously interacted with by the user.
- the method may further include providing the set of interactive content items previously interacted with by the user via one or more output devices of the computing device of the user.
- providing the set of interactive content items previously interacted with by the user may include providing the set of interactive content items previously interacted with by the user on a home screen or lock screen of the computing device.
- the segmenting may be based on a plurality of pixels of the content displayed to the user. In various implementations, the segmenting may be based on markup language underlying the content displayed to the user. In various implementations, the one or more interactive content items may be generated as part of a screenshot image that captures the content displayed to the user. In various implementations, the content displayed to the user may include a screenshot image captured by the user. In various implementations, the display may be part of a virtual reality or augmented reality computing device. In various implementations, the content displayed to the user may include content captured by a viewfinder of the computing device and displayed to the user.
- some implementations include one or more processors of one or more computing devices, where the one or more processors are operable to execute instructions stored in associated memory, and where the instructions are configured to cause performance of any of the aforementioned methods.

- the content router engine 128 may utilize additional and/or alternative criteria in selecting a content recognition engine. For example, a size of a semantic region, a resolution of the semantic region, and/or other characteristic of the semantic region may influence which content recognition engine is provided with content (e.g., pixels, text, images, etc.) contained within the region. Also, for example, availability of the content recognition engines may be considered. Although content router engine 128 and content recognition engines 129 A-C are illustrated in FIG. 1 as separate from the computing device 120 , in some implementations one or more of those components may be implemented on the computing device 120 .

For instance, entity determination engine 132 may determine one or more entities that are strongly associated with text or other information in one or more entity databases, such as a knowledge graph. For example, the text may be most strongly associated with an alias of a particular entity.
- the action determination engine 134 determines one or more computer-based actions that are tailored to the entity (or entities) determined by entity determination engine 132 . In some of those implementations, the action determination engine 134 determines the computer-based actions based on the computer-based actions being mapped to the entity in one or more databases such as entities and actions database 136 .
- the entities and actions database 136 includes a mapping of each of a plurality of entities to one or more computer-based actions associated with the entity. An action may be directly mapped with an entity and/or may be indirectly mapped to the entity via a mapping with a class of the entity.
- the action of dialing a phone number may be mapped to each of a plurality of particular phone numbers and/or may be associated with the class of phone numbers in general.
- the action of playing a movie may be mapped to each of a plurality of movies, movies in general, and/or only movies that are available for on-demand viewing via one of the applications 127 installed on the computing device 120 .
- the action determination engine 134 may optionally rank and/or filter the identified actions based on one or more factors such as, for example: strengths of association of the actions to the entity and/or a class of the entity; historical popularity of the actions in general; historical popularity of the actions for the application from which the content originated; whether the actions are performable via one or more applications 127 installed on the computing device 120 ; historical popularity of performance of the actions via one or more applications 127 installed on the computing device 120 ; etc.

- the graphical element may be associated with a link that causes performance of the one or more actions.
- Actions may include, for example, accessing a particular webpage, issuing a particular search, accessing a particular state of an application, rendering additional media, etc.
- Multiple items of interactive content may optionally be generated and interactive content may optionally be provided in combination with non-interactive content, such as content that includes an alias or other properties of one or more entities.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a non-limiting example of segmenting content displayed on the computing device 120 into semantic regions and generating, based on one of the semantic regions, interactive content item(s) 207 to provide for presentation to the user via the computing device 120 .

- the content router engine 128 selects content recognition engine 129 A from a plurality of content recognition engines and provides pixels from the region 204 to the engine 129 A. In some implementations, the content router engine 128 selects the content recognition engine 129 A based on the semantic type of the semantic region as described herein. In some implementations, the content router engine 128 selects the engine 129 A based on additional and/or alternative criteria, such as characteristic(s) of the region. In some implementations, the router 128 may pre-process the pixels provided to the engine 129 A based on properties of the engine 129 A. For example, the router 128 may alter the size and/or resolution of an image formed by the provided pixels to achieve an image that is capable of being processed by engine 129 A or that is more appropriately formatted for processing by engine 129 A.

- the engine 134 provides the interactive content item(s) 207 to render engine 125 for presentation of the interactive content item(s) 207 by the render engine 125 .
- the render engine 125 displays the interactive content item(s) 207 by either supplanting the displayed content captured by the screenshot image 201 or by providing the interactive content item(s) “over” portions of the displayed content captured by the screenshot image 201 .
- the computing device 420 is displaying the illustrated content on a display screen 440 of the computing device 420 .
- the content displayed on the display screen 440 may be displayed by a messaging application executing on the computing device 420 , such as a messaging application that does not incorporate functionality for extraction of images, text, and/or other content from the messaging application.

- the interface engine 124 provides content contained with the region 463 without providing content contained in any other of the semantic regions.
- not providing content from any other of the semantic regions may result in less consumption of computational resources by one or more downstream components (e.g., since they don't have to also analyze those pixels) and/or reduced network traffic (e.g., when downstream component(s) are remote from the computing device 420 ).
- the content router engine 128 may provide the semantic region content to one of the content recognition engines 129 A-C, optionally based on that engine being configured to process content associated with the semantic type.

- not providing content contained in any other of the regions may result in less consumption of computational resources by one or more downstream components (e.g., since they don't have to also analyze those pixels) and/or reduced network traffic (e.g., when downstream component(s) are remote from the computing device 420 ).
- the content router engine 128 may provide the content contained in each of the semantic regions to one or more of the content recognition engines 129 A-C, optionally based on the semantic type of the semantic region. For example, the router 128 may provide content contained in region 463 to content recognition engine 129 A, content contained in region 461 A to content recognition engine 129 B, and content contained in region 461 B to content recognition engine 129 B.

For example, engine 129 A may provide an indication that region 463 includes a daisy flower and engine 129 B may provide an indication that region 461 A includes a list of items and may provide the text of those items.
- the interactive content generation system 130 may utilize the indication of content to generate interactive content items such as graphical elements 474 A, 474 B, 474 C, and 477 .
- Graphical elements 474 A-C are the same as those illustrated in FIG. 4C .
- the interactive content generation system 130 may also generate the graphical element 477 so that selection of graphical element 477 causes the computing device 420 to add the listed items (derived from an indication of content in region 461 A) to a shopping list, such as shopping list maintained by one or more of the applications 127 of the computing device 420 .

- Generation and/or formatting of the cards 470 and 475 may be performed by the interactive content generation system 130 and/or the render engine 125 .
- FIG. 3 another example is illustrated of segmenting content displayed on a computing device into semantic regions and generating, based on one of the regions, interactive content item(s) to provide for presentation to the user via the computing device.
- displayed content segmentation system 121 captures at least a portion of content displayed to a user via a display screen of a computing device, such as a plurality of pixels of a screenshot image 301 provided by screenshot capture engine 122 , or a markup language document being viewed by the user.
- the displayed content segmentation system 121 provides captured portion of the displayed content to the segmentation engine 123 .
- Segmentation engine 123 analyzes content being displayed on a display of a computing device, such as a plurality of pixels of a screenshot image 301 provided by screenshot capture engine 122 , or a markup language document being viewed by the user, to determine one or more semantic regions of the displayed content and to assign a corresponding semantic type to each of the semantic regions. Segmentation engine 123 may utilize various techniques to determine semantic regions and/or semantic types of the semantic regions.
- the segmentation engine 123 provides one of the semantic regions and a semantic type of the semantic region 302 to interface engine 124 .

- the interface engine 124 provides multiple semantic region and indications of the semantic types of the semantic regions 302 in response to a more general user interface input, provided by user interface input module 126 , such as user actuation of a biosensor.
- the action determination engine 134 determines one or more computer-based actions that can be performed based on the provided semantic type(s) of the region(s). For example, for a region having a semantic type of “image”, the action determination engine 134 may provide interactive content that enables a computing device of a user to save (locally or remotely) content contained in the determined region, share (e.g., via email, text, chat) the semantic region content, and/or designate the semantic region content to be sent for a remote server for recognition and/or for generation of further interactive content item(s) based on that semantic region. This enables a computing device of a user to perform one or more actions focused on a particular semantic region of a display of a user.

- the action determination engine 134 may determine computer actions that can be performed on semantic regions having the semantic types and/or determine instructions for extracting content contained in the respective semantic regions 461 A, 461 B, and 463 .
- the action determination engine 134 may further generate visually interactive content items, such as the graphical elements 476 , 478 , and 480 . In some implementations, and as is depicted in FIG. 4E , these graphical elements may be visually emphasized using techniques such as rendering them to appear “raised” from the display screen 440 .
- shadows may be employed to make the graphical elements appear raised.
- a position of a user's eyes may be detected (e.g., using a front-facing camera) relative to the display, and the rendered shadows may be modified based on the detected position of the user's eyes.
- the graphical elements may appear three-dimensional as the shadows may be adjusted as the user rotates or tilts the display one way or another.
- the given interactive content item may be stored at least temporarily in a set of interactive content items previously interacted with by the user.
- the set of interactive content items previously interacted with by the user may be made available as part of various user interfaces, such as on a home screen or lock screen of the computing device. An example of this is depicted in FIG. 5 .
- the set of interactive content items may be viewable (e.g., as floating objects) in a particular three-dimensional region or space of a rendered three-dimensional virtual reality environment, or in a particular direction (e.g., up, down) in an augmented reality setting.
- FIG. 5 a computing device 520 similar to computing device 420 of FIGS. 4A-E is depicted with a display screen 540 .
- Other components of computing device 520 are not labeled for the sakes of brevity and clarity.
- computing device 520 is in a state in which a home screen or lock screen is active on display screen 540 .
- a set of interactive content items taking the form of graphical elements 582 , 584 , 586 , and 588 are rendered on display screen 540 .
- Each of these interactive content items may represent semantic regions that were previously segmented from content previously displayed on display screen 540 (or on a display screen of another computing device, such as another computing device of a coordinated “ecosystem” of computing devices controlled or otherwise operated by a user). In some implementations, only those interactive content items previously interacted with by a user may be included as part of the set. In other implementations, any interactive contents that are generated from semantic regions, regardless of whether the user interacted with them, may be included in the set.
- the number of interactive content items that is included in the set of saved interactive content items may be determined in a variety of ways.
- the set may include a maximum number, and whenever a new interactive content item is added to a set, another interactive content item (e.g., the oldest, the least-often used, etc.) is removed from the set.
- the number of interactive content items that may be included in a set may be determined based on one or more characteristics of the interactive content items themselves, such as their size, resolution, frequency of use, etc.
- interactive content items that are deemed to be semantically related e.g., their underlying semantic regions contain similar content
- only a subset of the set of temporarily saved interactive content items may be presented.
- interactive content items that were created using a particular application may only be displayed when that particular application is active (e.g., in the background), or at least is installed (e.g., remains installed).
- the particular application if the particular application is uninstalled, then interactive content items created from semantic regions displayed from that application may also be removed from the set.
- the set of interactive content items may be ranked based on various criteria, and only those n highest ranking interactive content items may be displayed. For example, interactive content items may be ranked based on their associated semantic types (e.g., corresponding to the original semantic region that caused generation of the interactive content item).
- Semantic types associated with topics/entities in which a user has shown greater interest may be ranked higher, and thus, interactive content items associated with those semantic types may be more likely to be displayed, e.g., on a home or lock screen.
- a user's context may be taken into account when selecting a subset of interactive content items to display, e.g., on a home or lock screen. For example, if a user has travelled to a particular city, interactive content items have semantic types or other characteristics that are at least tangentially related to that city may be surfaced (e.g., presented on the home screen). Other less relatable interactive content items may not be displayed while the user is in the city. As another example, suppose a user and one or more other individuals have engaged in a message exchange thread (e.g., a chat or email exchange) discussing dinner plans. In some implementations, interactive content items relating in some way to dining (e.g., restaurants, recipes, etc.) may be favored over other interactive content items, at least for some time following the message exchange.
- a message exchange thread e.g., a chat or email exchange
- a first graphical element 582 (more generally, an interactive content item) corresponds to the shopping list associated with first textual content 444 of FIG. 4A discussed previously.
- a second graphical element 584 depicts a product in the form of a backpack. Second graphical element 584 may have been generated, for instance, when the user previously shopped for backpacks using a website or other similar interface, or captured a backpack-of-interest in a camera viewfinder.
- the user may have seen the backpack, provided general user input (e.g., actuated a biosensor) to segment the displayed content (which included the backpack) into semantic regions, and may have interacted with the interactive content item that was generated from the semantic region that contained the backpack, e.g., to save it for later, obtain more information, perform a web search, share, see user reviews, etc.
- a third graphical element 586 corresponds to the first image 446 of FIG. 4A discussed previously.
- a fourth graphical element 588 depicts a city.
- Fourth graphical element 588 may have been generated, for instance, when the user previously operated a map application that depicted the city, when the user browsed a website that included a picture of the city, or when the user captured the city's skyline in a camera viewfinder (in which case the skyline may be image processed to recognize the city based on the skyline shape).
- the user may have seen the city, (e.g., an image of the city, a geographic region on a map corresponding to the city, etc.) and may have provided general user input (e.g., actuated a biosensor, shaken the computing device, provided a spoken command, etc.) to segment the displayed content (which included the city) into semantic regions, and may have interacted with the interactive content item that was generated from the semantic region that contained the city, e.g., to book a reservation/flight, obtain more information, perform a web search, share, etc.
- general user input e.g., actuated a biosensor, shaken the computing device, provided a spoken command, etc.
- different interactive content items may be rendered with different sizes. These sizes may be selected, for instance, based on how recently the interactive content item was generated (e.g., older interactive content items may be presented as smaller or bigger than new interactive content items), frequency of use (e.g., more frequently used interactive contents may be relatively large), etc.
- interactive content items particular when they take the form of graphical elements, may overlap, and may be moved, resized, and/or moved forward or backward relative to other interactive content items automatically or manually.
- a user may interact with any of the displayed interactive content items (e.g., 582 - 588 ) to cause one or more actions to be taken.
- interaction with a given interactive content item may transition computing device 520 into a state of an application that was active when the semantic region underlying the given interactive content was segmented.
- the interactive content item may act as a “bookmark” to a previous application state.
- interactive with a given interactive content item may cause a list of selectable elements to appear, such as “perform web search,” “share,” “delete,” “go back to app,” etc.
- the user may provide general user input, such as tapping or pressing a fingerprint sensor that may or may not be on an opposite side of the smart phone as the touch screen display. This may cause the displayed content (i.e. the webpage) to be segmented into one or more semantic regions (e.g., using displayed pixels and/or by analyzing underlying markup language).
- the portion of the webpage that contains the ingredients may be contained in a first semantic region
- the portion of the webpage that contains the instructions for preparing the meal using the ingredients may be contained in the first semantic region or in a distinct second semantic region.
- a picture of the prepared recipe shown on the webpage may be contained in a third semantic region. And so on. These semantic regions may be used to generate interactive content items that are visually emphasized, e.g., by being visually-raised (e.g., using various 3 D rendering techniques, by using shadowing, etc.).
- the user could activate and point a computing device's camera at a printed recipe.
- the contents of the viewfinder (which may be displayed on the display screen of the computing device) may be segmented into semantic regions and used to generate corresponding interactive content items, as described above.
- the displayed content may be segmented into semantic regions whenever the content of the viewfinder changes. If the user moves the phone (and hence, the camera), newly-captured pixels may be segmented and appropriate interactive content items may be generated (e.g., on the fly or in response to user input).
- a user at a store could pan a smartphone camera across products on a shelf.
- Each time a new product enters the view finder, its corresponding pixels may be detected and used to generate a semantic region.
- An interactive content item may then be generated based on the semantic region and displayed to the user.
- the user may then interact with the interactive content item to, for instance, search for coupons online, find better deals, see nutritional information, be informed of product recalls, see product reviews, etc.
- such interactive content items may include annotations about the product, such as nutritional information, coupon availability (e.g., “click here to download a coupon”), and so forth.
- the interactive content items may be matched to items on a shopping list associated with the user. If there is a match, an interactive content item that matches a product on the user's shopping list may be further visually emphasized, e.g., by bouncing, highlighting, etc., so that the user knows to purchase the product.
- the user may interact with an interactive content item that includes the ingredients of the recipe.
- Various actions may be taken by the smart phone (with or without assistance from one or more remote computing devices of a “cloud”).
- a shopping list application installed on the smart phone may be automatically populated with the ingredients.
- the user may be provided with options such as “share,” “save for later,” etc. Suppose the user selects the “save for later” option. When the user later shops for groceries, the user may pull out the smart phone and unlock it.
- interactive content items may be rendered, including the interactive content item associated with the ingredients.
- the user may provide a similar general user input, such as actuation of the same biosensor, to cause the interactive content items to appear.
- the user's context e.g., at the grocery
- the user may tap or otherwise interact with the ingredients interactive content item to access the list of ingredients, to aid the user while shopping.
- the semantic region that contained in the ingredients in the originating webpage may be displayed by itself.
- the user's web browser may be launched or made active and may navigate back to the original webpage (or to a cached copy).
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example method 600 of segmenting content displayed on a computing device into semantic regions and generating interactive content items (and associated actions) based on characteristics of the regions.
- This system may include various components of various computer systems, such as one or more components of displayed content segmentation system 121 , content router engine 128 , content recognition engines 129 A-C, and/or interactive content generation system 130 .
- operations of method 600 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added.
- the system captures at least a portion of content displayed to a user on a display screen of a computing device.
- this may include capturing one or more screenshots of the pixels forming the displayed content (e.g., contained in a camera viewfinder), and/or it may include capturing one or more displayed documents that are formed using markup languages such as HTML and XML.
- a user operates a “virtual reality” or “augmented reality” computing device
- two-dimensional or three-dimensional pixels that are currently visible to a user may be captured.
- any two-dimensional or three-dimensional pixels that are viewable to the virtual reality user may be captured.
- augmented reality computing devices e.g., smart glasses
- a field of view of a camera that approximately coincides with a user's field of vision may capture an image that, in addition to or instead of displayed content, may be segmented and used to generate interactive content items as described below.
- the system receives (e.g., general) user input via a biosensor such as a fingerprint sensor, a camera (e.g., for visually recognizing facial expressions, eye movements, hand gestures etc.), a motion sensor such as an accelerometer (e.g., to detect user gestures), and so forth.
- a biosensor such as a fingerprint sensor, a camera (e.g., for visually recognizing facial expressions, eye movements, hand gestures etc.), a motion sensor such as an accelerometer (e.g., to detect user gestures), and so forth.
- this (general) user input may be indicative of a desire of the user to act upon one or more semantic regions currently being displayed to the user.
- a user may actuator a fingerprint sensor while viewing a page describing one or more products for sale, e.g., to indicate that the user wishes to perform some action (e.g., save, share, navigate deeplink, submit search, etc.) relating to content of a semantic region currently being displayed.
- some action e.g., save, share, navigate deeplink, submit search, etc.
- the system may segment the content displayed (or pixels of a captured camera image) to the user into one or more semantic regions.
- the segmenting may be based at least in part on content of the one or more semantic regions. For example, suppose analysis of pixels in a particular region of the displayed content suggest that an image is present, and text in the region (e.g., detected as is or using OCR on pixels) provides information about a product, then the region may be segmented as a semantic region with one or more semantic types of, for instance, “image,” “product,” etc.
- a camera may capture an image, and the image itself (e.g., its pixels) may be segmented into semantic regions.
- object recognition may be performed on pixels of the image to identify one or more objects captured in the image. For example, if the user takes a picture of a product (or captures the product at least temporarily in a camera viewfinder), the product (and a product display, if applicable) may be identified via object recognition and/or optical character recognition.
- a person e.g., a celebrity, a person the user knows
- that person may be recognized, and a region of the captured image containing that person may be segmented into its own semantic region (e.g., similar to “tagging” a person).
- the segmenting of block 606 may be performed in response to the user input received at block 604 .
- the segmenting may be perform in response to other stimuli (e.g., user changing applications, launching a new application, etc.), periodically, continuously, etc. In the latter case, it may be the operations of block 608 that are performed in response to the user input, rather than the operations of block 606 .
- the system may generate one or more interactive content items that correspond to the semantic regions segmented at block 606 .
- These interactive content items may include, for instance, graphical elements (e.g., icons, etc.).
- the interactive content items may include at least some of the visual content contained in the corresponding semantic region of the displayed content.
- the interactive content item may include an image of the product (e.g., obtained from pixels of the semantic region or elsewhere), an animation of the image of the product (e.g., if the original semantic region included an animated GIF that showed the product rotating about itself to reveal all sides, the corresponding interactive content item may or may not also include the rotating image), a logo, and so forth.
- each interactive content item may be associated with one or more tailored actions, such as searching, sharing, saving for later, etc.
- an action associated with an interactive content item generated for that semantic region may be, for instance, to share something with the person (such as the image itself).
- the system may provide the interactive content items for presentation to the user, e.g., on the display screen of the computing device.
- the interactive content items may be visually emphasized in various ways in order to notify users of the ability to interactive with the interactive content items.
- the interactive content items may be visually raised, e.g., using shadowing, three-dimensional techniques, etc.
- the interactive content items may appear as two- or three-dimensional objects that appear to float in two- or three-dimensional space.
- the system may detect user interaction with an interactive content item. For example, a user may tap, long tap, describe with spoken input, or otherwise cause to be selected (e.g., by shaking the computing device or toggling a biosensor until a desired interactive content item is selected), a content item displayed to the user, e.g., on a display screen or as part of an augmented/virtual reality interface.
- the system may store the interactive content item that the user interacted with, or in some cases all generated interactive content items generated for content displayed to a user at a given moment, in a set of interactive content items associated, e.g., with the user.
- the user may later access these items from various interfaces, such as a home screen, a lock screen, particular portions of a virtual reality environment (e.g., looking at a virtual “bulletin board”), etc.
- stored interactive content items generated at one device operated by a user may be made available at all devices of an ecosystem of coordinate devices owned/operated/associated with the user, although this is not required.
- interactive content items associated with one user may be shared among a plurality of users. For example, classmates performing a project may share pertinent information by generating (from segmented semantic regions) and storing, e.g., in cloud storage, interactive content items.
- a team of people participating in a scavenger hunt may split up and share interactive content items associated with objects they find individually as part of the hunt. In some cases this may enable teammates to avoid duplicative efforts in locating particular objects, as they may be able to see, via shared interactive content items, which objects their teammates have already found.
